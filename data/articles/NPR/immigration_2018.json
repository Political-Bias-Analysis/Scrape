Updated at 6:43 p.m. ET President Trump delivered a White House broadside against illegal immigration Thursday, underscoring what has become his central focus in the final days of the midterm election campaign. The televised speech, delivered from the Roosevelt Room, offered little in the way of specific policy prescriptions. But it served to elevate an issue that Trump has been hawking at campaign rallies and on Twitter. Aides promoted the president's remarks as an update on the \"illegal immigration crisis,\" although unauthorized border crossings remain far below their historic highs. Trump promised to crack down on what he called the abuse of the asylum process and delivered a stern warning to a group of Central American migrants slowly making their way through Mexico, who have set their sights on the United States. \"Let me begin by stating that these illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States,\" Trump told reporters. \"They should turn back now, because they're wasting their time.\" He argued that migrants have been gaming the system by falsely claiming fear of persecution at home. \"Asylum is not a program for those living in poverty,\" Trump said. The president said he is finalizing a plan that would require asylum-seekers to present themselves at U.S. ports of entry \u2014 a move that immigration advocates called illegal. \"This president, who likes to proclaim himself a law-and-order president, is proposing things that clearly contradict our domestic law,\" said Karen Musalo, director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law. Trump has offered no evidence for his repeated claims that the migrants include dangerous criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" \"The president has willfully and cynically vilified an asylum-seeker population composed of vulnerable children, women, and men,\" said Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International. \"Most of what he said was very misleading and very clearly intended to stir up fear and emotions,\" added Denise Gilman, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas Law School. \"That does not match at all with the reality of what we're seeing in terms of Central American asylum-seekers.\" But the president has scarcely strayed from the immigration playbook, convinced it will energize GOP voters in red states where control of the Senate is likely to be decided \u2014 even if it alienates voters in more diverse, suburban districts that could tip the balance of power in the House to the Democrats. Earlier this week, Trump challenged the idea that any child born on U.S. soil is entitled to American citizenship \u2014 a principle of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution that dates back more than a century. Most legal scholars say his plan to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The Trump campaign also unveiled an incendiary video this week, spotlighting a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally and was later convicted of killing two California sheriffs' deputies. The ad has drawn comparisons to the racially charged Willie Horton ad used against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign. This is hardly new territory for Trump, who kicked off his presidential campaign in 2015 by denouncing Mexican migrants as \"rapists\" and drug dealers. And his tough talk appeared to have an immediate effect. During the first six months Trump was in office \u2014 February through July 2017 \u2014 illegal border crossings plunged 56 percent from the same period a year earlier. President Trump talks about immigration and gives an update on border security from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump talks about immigration and gives an update on border security from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Thursday. But unauthorized crossings along the U.S. border with Mexico have since rebounded, with more than 521,000 people apprehended in the 12 months ending in September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That's still far below the levels of illegal immigration in the peak years of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But officials say the profile of the people crossing the border has changed, complicating matters for U.S. enforcement agencies. A generation ago, most unauthorized border crossers were single adults from Mexico looking for work. If apprehended, they could quickly be deported. Today, more than 40 percent are families or children traveling on their own. In many cases, the migrants come from Central America seeking asylum, saying they fear persecution if sent home. Processing those asylum claims can take months or years. Under law and court decree, children cannot be detained for more than 20 days. As a result, families are often released in the U.S. with instructions to return for a later court date \u2014 a procedure the Trump administration disparages as \"catch and release.\" The administration tried to get around that this spring by separating families \u2014 detaining parents while turning children over to the Department of Health and Human Services. But after a public outcry, that family separation policy was abandoned. The administration is now considering detaining families together \u2014 in tent cities or other facilities \u2014 as long as it takes to process their claims. It has filed notice of a proposed regulation aimed at sidestepping the 20-day detention limit for young people. But that regulation has not yet been finalized and is sure to invite legal challenges once it is. The president has also mobilized the military, ordering more than 5,000 troops to the border to help \"harden\" ports of entry, transport Border Patrol agents, and otherwise provide support for border enforcement. U.S. Northern Command's initial estimate is that more than 7,000 troops will be pressed into service in Texas, Arizona and California. Trump hinted on Wednesday that he might order a broader mobilization of up to 15,000 troops. The military says while some troops will be armed, their role will strictly be supportive, and they will not be tasked with border enforcement duties themselves. The U.S. military is prohibited from performing law enforcement activities. The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee questioned the wisdom of the troop deployment in a letter to the president. \"This is not a military problem; it does not warrant a military solution,\" Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., wrote. \"To date, the U.S. Department of Defense has provided no indication to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the migrant caravan \u2014 still about 1,000 miles and weeks away from reaching the U.S. southern border \u2014 poses a direct national security threat to the United States.\"",

He is doing a slew of events leading up to Election Day. Updated at 8:28 p.m. ET President Trump is back in campaign mode and immigration is a key talking point for him, even as his recent comments have exposed divisions within the Republican Party. After a brief pause to pay respects to victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Trump hosted a political rally in Fort Myers, Fla., on Wednesday. It's one of 11 campaign rallies the president will hold in the next six days, in a furious final sprint to next week's midterm elections. With GOP congressional majorities on the line, Trump is investing considerable time and attention to campaigning this fall, with 30 political rallies on his calendar between Labor Day and Election Day. \"This isn't bragging. There has never been anything like what's happening,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham this week, alleging to have tens of thousands attending his rallies. (One of his bigger rallies, in Texas on Oct. 22, was held in an arena for 18,000.) People familiar with Trump's thinking say he has given similar weight to helping Republican House candidates as he has to Senate candidates. But his rhetoric and rallies this final week appear tailored primarily to red states where control of the Senate will be decided, even at the cost of the most competitive House districts. As he left the White House Wednesday afternoon, Trump sounded upbeat about Republicans' prospects. \"I think we're going to do well in the House,\" Trump told reporters. \"I think we're doing really extraordinarily well in the Senate.\" In Florida, Trump renewed his attack on what he called the \"left-wing media,\" suggesting the news business bears responsibility for the deeply divided political climate. \"They're pushing people apart,\" Trump told supporters. \"When we talk about division, this is a big part of the division, right there.\" The president accused news outlets of exaggerating the protests that greeted his visit to Pittsburgh, where Trump responded to the anti-Semitic synagogue killings. \"We have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice in all of its ugly forms,\" Trump said. \"But the media doesn't want you to hear.\" President Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates on Wednesday in Estero, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates on Wednesday in Estero, Fla. The president has been highlighting illegal immigration and other hot-button social issues, focusing attention on Central American migrants slowly approaching the U.S. border through Mexico. This week, the Defense Department mobilized 5,200 troops to \"harden\" ports of entry and support Border Patrol agents. \"Many more troops coming,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday. \"We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S.\" Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND! Trump denied that he is deliberately sowing fear for political purposes and suggested he might send thousands of additional troops. \"I'm not fearmongering at all. This is a very important subject,\" Trump said. \"We'll go up to anywhere between [10,000] and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border. Nobody is coming in,\" he said. The military personnel will serve support roles, as the U.S. military is prohibited from performing law enforcement activities. Trump also reiterated his support for ending \"birthright citizenship,\" which grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil \u2014 including those born to immigrant parents living in the country illegally. \"So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other,\" Trump tweeted, amplifying comments he had made to the website Axios. For more than a century, birthright citizenship has been guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. While Trump and some of his allies argue the amendment has been misinterpreted, most legal scholars disagree. The issue is catnip for anti-immigrant activists in the GOP base. But it's a potential turnoff for many suburban voters, who may decide control of the House. Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., who represents a suburban district northwest of Philadelphia, called the president's focus on birthright citizenship \"political malpractice.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also disputed Trump's claim that the amendment could be altered through an executive order. \"As a conservative, I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution,\" Ryan told WVLK radio in Lexington, Ky., on Tuesday. \"I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear.\" Wednesday, Trump shot back. \"Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\" the president tweeted. \"Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border! \" Trump later told reporters he doesn't try to tailor his message to different parts of the country. \"I don't view suburban districts or any other districts. I view the country,\" Trump said. \"Our country has to be safe.\" Both Ryan and Costello are leaving Congress at the end of this term. Immigration is a more nuanced issue in red-state Senate contests, where Democrats as well as Republicans tout their law-and-order credentials. In Missouri, where Trump will campaign on Thursday and again next Monday, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is running ads highlighting her endorsement by the National Border Patrol Council. She and her GOP opponent, Josh Hawley, agreed that Trump can't alter birthright citizenship through an executive order. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who is in a tough re-election contest against Republican Mike Braun, stressed his repeated votes in favor of a border wall. Donnelly also said he would be open to considering legislative changes to birthright citizenship. Republicans in Florida worry that Trump's focus on immigration could alienate Latinos, who represent 16 percent of that swing state's registered voters. GOP Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Mario Diaz-Balart, who represent the Miami area, both defended birthright citizenship on Tuesday. Trump's rally on Wednesday is not near their South Florida districts. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., told the Miami Herald he hasn't seen the president's proposal and would need to fully review it.",

            "article_content": "Congressional Republicans have delayed a vote on their immigration bill again. Also, ProPublica's Ginger Thompson discusses audio from a migrant detention facility and we preview Turkey's election.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Republican lawmakers in the House have punted on immigration yet again. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah. A so-called consensus bill was supposed to be held for a vote today. It was called a consensus even though it was a compromise among Republican factions not with Democrats, we should note. This bill sought to carve out a path to citizenship for the so-called DREAMers brought here as children. It would also have provided billions of dollars for a border wall and would have helped to keep migrant families together in detention. But last night, House leaders realized that this was not going to get enough support to pass, so they pushed the vote to next week. GREENE: All right, let's talk about that with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: OK. So this bill on hold couldn't get enough Republican support let alone any Democratic support. So what is the plan that the White House and Republicans have to try and, I guess, bring this up again next week? HORSLEY: Well, David, if there's a plan, it's not evident to me. (LAUGHTER) HORSLEY: House Republicans are just still tied up in knots when it comes to immigration. This vote was originally supposed to happen yesterday. It was pushed back to today. And then when it was clear that they still didn't have enough votes to pass it, it was punted until next week. The president has been on Twitter blaming Democrats for their lack of support. But, you know, House Democrats are not inclined to come to the rescue for a problem they see as wholly manufactured by the president. GREENE: Well, of course this larger debate on immigration comes amid the backdrop of the president's new executive order ending the separation of families crossing illegally. And so much concern we've heard, Scott, about when/if these kids who are already separated are ever going to be reunited with their families. Some aid workers, lawyers saying that they're only able to track down relatives for a very small fraction of the kids. Is that situation improving at all? HORSLEY: Well, there's lots of confusion on the ground, including for the families who are continuing to arrive at the border. Remember, the administration adopted this family separation policy because the president wanted to prosecute all immigrants who crossed the border illegally. And there is a legal settlement that says young people can only be detained for 20 days. Now, the president's executive order reversing family separation this week didn't change either of those other things. So something's going to have to give. Yesterday, the Justice Department formally asked the courts to change that settlement so perhaps young people could be held more than 20 days. But there's no guarantee that's going to happen. The other remedy would be for Congress to act. And as we've seen, that may not happen... GREENE: It's not happening so far. We also learned yesterday that the Department of Health and Human Services is asking the Pentagon to look at whether it would be able to house up to 20,000 children. And Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says it's possible. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMES MATTIS: We have housed refugees. We have housed people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and hurricanes. We do whatever is in the best interest of the country. GREENE: Now, the idea of optics came up through this whole conversation in recent days. Scott, what would be the optics of housing children on military bases? HORSLEY: Well, this request was to house unaccompanied minors. Of course, the challenge now is going to be finding a place to house families who come together and will be kept together. The Pentagon has housed unaccompanied minors in the past. This will be a new challenge for them. GREENE: Scott, can I just ask you about first lady Melania Trump, who's been talked about a lot because of something she was wearing when she was visiting detained immigrant kids in Texas? HORSLEY: That's right. She toured a border shelter yesterday in a camera-ready show of compassion. But she was wearing a jacket that said - I really don't care. Do you? - so something of a mixed message from the first lady here. The president says she was trolling the news media. Melania Trump was certainly trolling someone. GREENE: NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, we appreciate it. Thanks a lot. HORSLEY: You're welcome. GREENE: All right, we're going to stay on the topic of immigration now. This saga of children separated from their parents on the southern border has really been dominating headlines all week, as we know. MARTIN: Right. And what really drove this home in a different way was this audio recording from the investigative newsroom ProPublica. It made people feel this crisis in a totally different way. We heard these kids crying, repeatedly calling out for their mothers and fathers who were shipped to different detention centers. One of the voices on that recording is that of this 6-year-old girl named Allison Jimena Valencia Madrid. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Sobbing, speaking Spanish). ALLISON JIMENA VALENCIA MADRID: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CONSULAR WORKER: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Sobbing, speaking Spanish). JIMENA: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: So that last voice is Jimena's. And in that clip, she's asking a consular worker to call her aunt so she can get picked up from the detention center. She says, I have her number memorized. And then she's reciting it there. GREENE: And that phone number has really been her lifeline to her family in the United States. Jimena's aunt lives in Houston. And ProPublica senior reporter Ginger Thompson dialed that number. And we're going to learn what happened next. Ginger's with us. Hi there, Ginger. GINGER THOMPSON: How are you? GREENE: I'm good. Thank you. So you called Jimena's aunt. And what did she tell you? THOMPSON: Well, you know, immediately I said, you know, I've heard your daughter - or niece is in detention. And she said yes, that's right. My niece is in detention. And I said I've heard that she may have called you. And she said she did. And it was devastating to hear her crying and screaming and saying please, Tia - aunt - please come get me because I'm here, and I'm alone. GREENE: All right. I want to play a little bit from a video that you took of your meeting with the aunt because you did actually meet her as well. Let's listen here. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). GREENE: So what exactly is she describing here? THOMPSON: So I did. I visited the aunt yesterday. And she told me that, you know, the consular official, when she called, remarked at how smart and how lucky Jimena was that she remembered this phone number because essentially what happens with these children under zero-tolerance is when they're physically separated from their parents, they're also bureaucratically separated from them. And so when child advocates and consular officials and shelter workers encounter these children for the first time, they rely on the children to tell them whether they've come with a parent. They rely on the children to tell them where their parents are. And so... GREENE: These kids are so young. I mean, they're... THOMPSON: Yeah. GREENE: ...Relying on these kids to know this information. THOMPSON: Exactly. GREENE: It's just extraordinary to think about. THOMPSON: Exactly. When a child is unable to count to 10, how is that child going to remember a number? GREENE: You were able to speak with her mother as well. Is that right? Where is she? Is she facing deportation? Any idea when she might see her daughter again? THOMPSON: There's no idea when she'll see her daughter again. She was told that she would be reunited with her daughter, but there's been no plan for exactly how these reunifications are going to happen. And this bureaucratic sort of mix-up that has been revealed by this recording make their reunification even more uncertain. GREENE: Ginger Thompson is a senior reporter for ProPublica. Thanks a lot. We appreciate it, Ginger. THOMPSON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. So the winner of this weekend's presidential election in Turkey will have more powers than most previous Turkish presidents. MARTIN: Right. That's because last year voters narrowly changed the constitution there to give the next president powers now granted to the prime minister. The Parliament's traditional role as a check on the presidency is also going to be limited. And that will suit the current president just fine. He is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he is up for re-election. He has been jailing his enemies and muffling the media. GREENE: And let's turn now to NPR's Peter Kenyon at his post in Istanbul. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So President Erdogan has won - what? - every election for the past 16 years. Is anything going to change this Sunday? KENYON: Well, there's no question Erdogan is still Turkey's dominant politician. Now, the polls here are not always the most reliable, but he does appear to be leading again. If he wins, as you mentioned, he'll be even stronger. He's going to have these new executive powers, including the ability to rule by decree in some cases. Erdogan says it's a new era for Turkey. His opponents are saying it's another step toward one-man rule. GREENE: Well, I mean, if it is going towards one-man rule - he is so powerful; he's such a dominant force; he controls so much - does this election mean anything? Does it offer real options for voters? KENYON: There are real options. But critics say, is it a really level playing field? They're not so sure. Much of Turkish media is pro-government. The opposition says it's getting a lot less coverage, especially TV airtime, than Erdogan and his ruling party. But there are two strong challengers. The secular party has fielded a younger man Muharrem Ince. He's a lawmaker, former physics teacher. He seems to be connecting with voters. And there's a woman in the race Meral Aksener, a nationalist who split with her party when it lined up with Erdogan. She's running a strong third if the polls are right. These elections were, however, moved up by more than a year. So the opposition hasn't had so much time to organize. We'll see what happens. UNIDENTIFIED MUEZZIN: (Singing unintelligibly). GREENE: We're hearing the famous call to prayer in Istanbul behind you? Is that... KENYON: (Laughter) We are. Midday... GREENE: That's lovely. KENYON: ...Prayer is here. GREENE: Yeah. Well, are voters worried about Erdogan becoming more and more autocratic, Peter? KENYON: They are. Of course, he has his supporters who say, look - don't worry about that. We've got a lot of enemies. We need a tough person at the helm. Others are raising questions such as - well, if Erdogan wins another term, he'll be in power for 20 years, is that compatible with democracy? I mean, they argue the judiciary is going to be weaker, the Parliament. There's not going to be the checks and balances. There is the possibility, though, that he could face a Parliament now led by the opposition, which would be a first. GREENE: All right, NPR's Peter Kenyon describing to us the upcoming election. President Erdogan expected to win, a dominant force in that country. Peter, thanks a lot. KENYON: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF LIPHE'S \"ORBIT\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As President Trump continues to threaten to potentially shut down the government over his border wall, Americans would prefer to see him compromise to prevent gridlock, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. By a 21-point margin \u2014 57 percent to 36 percent \u2014 Americans think the president should compromise on the wall to avoid a government shutdown, rather than stand firm. About two-thirds of Republicans say the opposite, and the president has been focused on maintaining his base. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Congress moved last week to fund the government temporarily until Dec. 21. A major sticking point in funding negotiations is the president's insistence on an additional $5 billion to help fund the building of a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. \"The wall is polarized in terms of partisanship,\" said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll at the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. \"It's an important issue for the president's base. It is something that is not a particular interest or priority for Democrats and independents in the country, but what they all agree on is they don't want to see gridlock, and they don't want to see a government shutdown.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged the president to hold his ground during a Sunday show appearance. \"If I were the president, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding,\" Graham said Sunday on Fox News. \"I want the whole $5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.\" But not only do most Americans oppose risking a government shutdown over a wall, but more than two-thirds (69 percent) do not believe building a wall should even be an immediate priority for Congress. That includes half who do not believe it should be a priority at all. More than a quarter (28 percent) believe it should be an immediate priority, including 63 percent of Republicans. Immigration is a cultural touchstone issue that Trump used to fuel his campaign. It's an issue that has energized his supporters, highlighted a seemingly unbridgeable schism between the parties and helped move independents largely toward Democrats' positions on the subject. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here To that point, the poll found that while 53 percent of Americans support President Trump broadly on his handling of protection of U.S. borders, they disagree with him when diving further into the details of immigration policy. \" 'If you don't have borders, you don't have a nation' \u2014 that has more resonance as an abstract goal,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist institute. \"For the president, it seems to break down with the devil in the details.\" Just 44 percent approve of Trump's immigration policy overall, which mirrors his most recent Marist Poll overall job approval rating of 42 percent; 39 percent approve of his handling of the \"migrant caravan,\" a group of Central Americans making their way toward the U.S.; and just 36 percent approve of his handling of immigrants already in the United States illegally and the reunification of immigrant children separated from their parents at the border. On Trump's overall immigration policy, the caravan, immigrants in the U.S. illegally and separated families, about half or more of independents disapproved of the job Trump was doing. The numbers show that how the parties talk about immigration is key to winning over a critical mass, but they also show the risk in the stridency of Trump's message heading into the 2020 presidential election. \"There's a risk immigration could be something that becomes one of several very intense issues, which is very double-edged for the president,\" Miringoff said. \"I don't think we have third rails in politics anymore, but we certainly have hot-button issues, and this is one that's fraught with danger for him.\" The poll was conducted from Nov. 28-Dec. 4, surveyed 1,075 adults and has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points.",

The latest reporting indicates that segments of the so- called migrant caravan from Central America are already arriving to the U.S./Mexico border. During the run up to the most recent midterm elections, immigration became a key topic for many of those running for office. President Trump made reference to the caravan often in his own campaign speeches and and he has also made repeated references to \"The Wall,\" a promise he made during his own campaign two years ago to build a wall along the border of Mexico to control immigration which was, and continues to be, highly controversial.What is not at issue, though, is the fact that there is already a wall along parts of the border and last spring, the section of wall near that separates Tijuana and San Diego was the location of Fandango Fronterizo Festival, an annual gathering of musicians who make music from both sides of the wall.This year, they were joined by pianist and bandleader Arturo O'Farrill, who took his celebrated big band, the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, to the wall for performances and collaborations. The result of that performance is a new album called Fandango at the Wall: A Soundtrack For Mexico, The United States and Beyond, a cross-cultural expression of social and political observations told through music.The album is an engaging mix of jazz, Afro-Caribbean and folkloric music from Mexico, performed with lots of passion by the orchestra and a host of guest musicians \u2014 jazz musicians like Regina Carter and Antonio Sanchez, Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux and a host of son jarocho musicians from both side of the border.

Claire McCaskill wait for her to arrive at a campaign stop in St. Louis on Monday. There's a lot that can happen Tuesday, the culmination of a long midterm election campaign that will provide the first nationwide measure of the U.S. electorate since Donald Trump was elected president. One narrative has become dominant: that Democrats are likely to gain control of the House and Republicans hold the Senate, if not expand their majority there. That narrative is based largely on national polls, and caution should be urged. Pollsters have made a lot of adjustments to hopefully correct what they got wrong in 2016, but they can't tell you precisely who is going to show up to vote. What's more, there have been far fewer statewide and district-specific surveys than in past midterm elections. And, as it is, there are data both parties can take solace in that buoy their respective cases. So everyone should be prepared for surprises \u2014 because there always are some. That's the beauty of campaigns and voting. Here are four scenarios for how election night might play out and what each could mean. This is the most likely outcome, based not just on the polls but also on conversations with strategists in both parties. But they urge caution, because the races in the many districts across the country that are up for grabs are still very close. How it would happen: Forget the polls; Democrats are favored to take back the House for more reasons than that. There have been a record number of retirements, reducing the built-in advantage incumbents tend to have; record numbers of candidates, especially Democratic women, have run for public office; Democrats won the off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey; they won or fared better than expected in special elections across the country; there was high primary turnout for Democrats in many states; and there is very high early voting turnout. And just look at how wide the playing field is \u2014 Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to take back the House, and they are targeting some 80 Republican-held seats. Republicans are competing in just eight held by Democrats. That right there is and has been a huge flashing red light for the GOP. So many of those races are running through the suburbs, where independents and wealthy, college-educated women live, both of which have consistently in polling said they disapproved of the job the president is doing and prefer to vote for a Democrat in their district. One other overlooked number from the last NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: Just 54 percent of Republican women who are registered voters said they were very enthusiastic about voting in this election. Compare that with 78 percent of Republican men who are registered voters. And where do a lot of those women live? The suburbs. If GOP women, an important group that Republicans need to bolster them, stay home, that's one way Democrats clean up in the House. In the Senate, on the other hand, Republicans have a very favorable landscape and are competing in conservative states held by Democrats. The fundamentals favor the GOP in these states, and if Republicans win where they should win, they will hold the Senate. What it would mean: This would be a huge win for Democrats, as they'd be able to gum up Trump's agenda and begin to investigate his administration, something the GOP has not done very much of. In the Senate, Republicans could still approve federal judges and Trump Supreme Court nominees, but if they want to get any big legislation done they're going to have to negotiate with Democrats in the House, and possibly a Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Democrats feel they need to limit the losses in the Senate. If they can hold Republicans to net even, keeping the Senate at 51-49, or maybe lose a net of one seat, then they will be very happy. They have a much more favorable Senate landscape in 2020 and believe they will be able to take back the Senate then. This would be a huge win for the GOP. How it would happen: A record turnout is expected Tuesday \u2014 perhaps higher than any time in the past 50 years for a midterm \u2014 but, as in 2016, Trump voters would have to dominate. Rural voters would have to turn out at higher-than-expected rates, causing the polls to be wrong (again). Meanwhile, young voters and Latinos would have to stay home. (It is supposed to rain on the East Coast Tuesday, which could depress low-propensity-voter turnout.) All of those close House races would have to tip Republicans' way, something that's very possible given the conservative lean of those districts and the distrust of the media, purposefully stoked by the president. And who pays for polls for the most part? Big media organizations. President Trump acknowledges supporters during a campaign rally for Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and other Tennessee Republican candidates on Monday in Chattanooga, Tenn.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump acknowledges supporters during a campaign rally for Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and other Tennessee Republican candidates on Monday in Chattanooga, Tenn. What it would mean: President Trump and Republicans would step on the gas, validated by an election cycle dominated by negative news coverage and polling that said the GOP had its back against the wall. The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) would very likely be repealed once and for all. And Trump could set his sights on ousting Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other key figures at the Justice Department, possibly ending the department's investigation of Russia's attack on the 2016 election. What's more, Trump's strategy of demonizing immigrants would have worked \u2014 again. That was rewarded, and what message would that send? He is only going to do more of it between Wednesday and November 2020 when he stands for re-election. It would also be yet another reckoning for pollsters and media organizations that pay for the surveys. The polls currently show Democrats with a razor-thin, but consistent advantage heading into Election Day. But if the polls are wrong, it should induce more than a shoulder shrug from outlets that conduct them and the news media organizations that report on them. This is not seen as the likeliest of scenarios, but it's not out of the realm of possibility either. It would very likely mean a massive wave and a massive shift against Trump and Republicans tied to him nationally. A lot would have to happen, especially in the Senate, for this to happen. How it would happen: The path for Democrats in the House is through the suburbs, as in Scenario 1. That doesn't change. But for Democrats to pull this off in the Senate, not only would voters have to side with Democratic incumbents in conservative states, but Democratic challengers would have to win in places like Nevada and Arizona, and possibly Tennessee and Texas. What it would mean: It would be a repudiation of Trump and the Republicans tied to him nationwide. It would have to trigger a degree of soul-searching \u2014 in at least some Republican corners. Trump would be faced with the choice of moderating and working with Democrats or being a lame-duck president starting in January 2019 when a new Democratic Congress is sworn in \u2014 as talk ramps up about Democratic 2020 challengers. It's very possible control of both the House and Senate will not be clear on election night. A number of races are so close that it may not be possible to declare a winner on election night, leaving control of the House and Senate up in the air.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Sohm/Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A number of races are so close that it may not be possible to declare a winner on election night, leaving control of the House and Senate up in the air. How it would happen: There are a half-dozen congressional races in California, for example, that are very close heading into Election Day. It's possible those races are so close they will not be called on election night. They might not be called for days and possibly weeks later, especially because the vote there is counted slowly. Additionally, early and absentee ballots can get counted slowly and there is growing concern that many voters' absentee and mailed ballots could be rejected. In 2016, to the surprise of many, 319,000 absentee ballots were rejected for one reason or another. In the Senate, depending on how results from other races shake out, there is the possibility that control is not known on election night or for weeks after. Specifically, it could all come down to Mississippi. There, no candidate is polling above 50 percent heading into Election Day, and if no one gets at least 50 percent, the race heads to a runoff three weeks later. What it would mean: Imagine a scenario in which Democrats lead 50-49 on Election Day in the Senate, and the eyes of the country \u2014 and the deep pockets of out-of-state money \u2014 descend on Mississippi. The consequences would be enormous, the rancor pitched and the tension thick.",

Updated at 9:05 p.m. ET President Trump told House Republicans that he will support them \"1,000 percent\" in their efforts to pass immigration legislation later this week. Republicans left the wide-ranging talk in the Capitol in good spirits but still unsure if they have the votes to pass a bill. Members emerged from the evening meeting with a range of opinions about what Trump would support. Some said they were confident Trump specifically endorsed a compromise between moderates and conservatives to address both legal and illegal immigration. Others thought Trump signaled he would vote for anything Congress can pass. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said Trump supported them more broadly. \"The president laid out his vision for immigration reform, the importance of taking action \u2014 the kids and separation at the border that's ongoing,\" McMorris Rodgers said. \"He's behind us.\" McMorris Rodgers said Republicans are focused on passing a bill this week. The goal has taken on greater urgency amid national outrage and concern over a White House policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border amid widespread condemnation of the practice. House Republican leaders are working to add new language to their legislation to require that minor children be allowed to stay with their parents throughout immigration proceedings at the border. That bill has not been finalized but leaders hope to vote on it later this week, along with another more conservative option. House GOP leaders planned to canvas members to see where support is for the version they crafted in hopes of holding votes on Thursday. Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, the leader tasked with rounding up votes, told reporters: \"I want to see us pass this bill and let the Senate have the opportunity to take it up as well and solve the problem. We want to secure the border. We want to reunite kids. Our bill does just that.\" Most Republicans said they were pleased with Trump's message, including some of the moderates who launched the House immigration talks last month in order to give legal protections to immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought to the country as children, known as DREAMers. Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, one of the leaders of the group, said Trump's speech was positive but wasn't sure if it was enough to close the deal with his colleagues. \"I think he was explicit in that he was going to support House Republicans who take a risk and vote for meaningful immigration reform,\" Curbelo said. \"So, we'll see.\" White House spokesman Raj Shah, in a statement after the session, attempted to clear up any confusion, and stressed that Trump endorsed both proposals. \"The President spoke to the House Republican conference on a range of issues,\" Shah said. \"In his remarks, he endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb chain migration, and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\" Members said the range of issues Trump covered included trade, taxes and other victories for the administration. Several people who were in the room said Trump told them that his daughter Ivanka spoke to him about needing to address the family separation issue. \"He mentioned that his daughter Ivanka had encouraged him to end this and he said he does recognize that it needs to end, that the images are painful,\" Curbelo said. \"He discussed the optics and the policy itself and I think he's not comfortable with either.\" The meeting was seen by many members as a critical opportunity for Trump to convince conservatives in particular to back the compromise bill. Many still support a hard-line conservative proposal written by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., that is expected to fail. Despite the meeting with the president, some members remained wary of supporting any immigration bill following a chaotic week during which Trump appeared to switch his position on immigration several times. Some members fear that Trump has a mercurial history of supporting legislation, like the omnibus spending bill earlier this year and health care bills in 2017. In both cases, the president declared he backed certain policies, only to turn around later and blast the same idea \u2014 and those who voted for them \u2014 on Twitter. That lack of confidence and fear of retribution could make it significantly harder for Republicans to pass any politically risky immigration proposals ahead of the midterm elections in November. The meeting capped a day of disarray and confusion among congressional Republicans over how to handle the growing outcry over the White House \"zero tolerance\" family separation policy. In addition to the House GOP immigration bills, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters that he wants to pass narrow legislation to address just family separation \u2014 and not a broad immigration plan as is being discussed in the House. \"In order to fix this problem you can't fix all the problems,\" he told reporters. \"We've wrestled with this issue for a decade.\" McConnell didn't provide any specifics of any potential bill. Senate leaders are working through various proposals to find consensus as more and more Republicans are speaking out in sharp opposition to Trump. It is one of the rare instances where Republican leaders in Congress have been willing to publicly rebuke the president on policy and actively consider legislation to oppose him. Earlier in the day, Trump further complicated the process when he seemed to say he would still make changes to the House legislation during a speech at the National Federation for Independent Businesses. \"We have one chance to get it right; we might as well get it right or let's just keep it going, but let's do it right,\" Trump said. \"We have a chance.\" Trump said Tuesday that current law gives his administration only two options for handling people who cross the border illegally: \"Totally open borders or criminal prosecution.\" \"What I'm asking Congress to do is to give us a third option which we have been requesting last year,\" Trump said. \"The legal authority to detain and properly remove families together as a unit.\" NEWS: Senator Hatch plans to send a letter to the Justice Department later today calling for a pause on family separations until Congress has time to pass a legislative solution to this issue. Many in Congress, including many Trump supporters, say he is wrong. A growing number of Republicans have pushed back, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions urging him to suspend the policy immediately to give Congress time to address the issue. \"Although enforcing our immigration laws is an essential responsibility of the federal government, it must be done in a way that is consistent with our values and ordinary human decency,\" the letter stated. Twelve other Senate Republicans signed on to Hatch's letter, including Cory Gardner of Colorado, Dean Heller of Nevada and John McCain of Arizona. The letter takes direct aim at Trump's argument that Congress is to blame for the separations. \"The immediate cause of the crisis is your Department's recent institution of a 'zero tolerance' policy under which all adults who enter the United States illegally are referred for prosecution,\" it read. The clash between Trump and congressional Republicans makes it increasingly likely that Republicans will need to work with Democrats if they want to pass a bill that could overcome a presidential veto. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that Trump should resolve the policy on his own. \"Mr. President, you started it, you can stop it, plain and simple,\" Schumer told reporters.",

Will Hurd, R-Texas, during a May 9 news conference on a discharge petition to force votes on immigration legislation. Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill this week to confront an unplanned and unpredictable immigration debate. Republicans and Democrats alike believe the outcome could be a decisive factor for voters in elections this November that will determine control of Congress. A divided House GOP Conference will hold a closed-door session on Thursday to build a strategy around immigration legislation scheduled for the floor the third week of June \u2014 a deal promised to the rank-and-file by reluctant GOP leaders before the Memorial Day break. At a Nashville campaign rally last week in Tennessee, President Trump spoke bluntly about immigration as a midterm election issue that he believes will preserve the GOP's House and Senate majorities. \"The Democrats want to use it as a campaign issue, and I keep saying, 'I hope they do.' The fact is the Democrats are lousy politicians. They are lousy on policy,\" he said. The president argued that his administration's hard-line immigration policies and recent crackdown on people and families trying to enter the U.S. along the Mexico border is \"a good issue for us, not to them.\" Conservatives on Capitol Hill agree with the president and are deeply skeptical \u2014 if not outright hostile \u2014 to any legislation that draws significant Democratic support and creates any new paths to citizenship. They are increasingly at odds with the GOP's more moderate wing that includes lawmakers running for re-election in some of the most competitive congressional districts. In a series of escalating events prior to the Memorial Day break, conservatives took down a popular farm bill on the House floor to take a stand on immigration. At the same time, moderates continue to agitate for signatures on a discharge petition that would force the hand of party leaders to hold votes on immigration legislation if they reach 218 signatures. As of Monday, there are 213 signatures on the petition, mostly Democrats. Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., is one of the leading proponents on the legislative gambit, which is sharply opposed by GOP leaders. Unlike most of his GOP colleagues, Denham has argued the only way forward on immigration legislation this month is a pared-down bipartisan bill that would create a path to citizenship for people who were brought to the U.S. as children but now reside in legal limbo, in exchange for an influx of cash to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. Denham told CNN that moderates are trying to reach a legislative solution that GOP leaders can support, but are keeping the discharge petition alive as a sort of legislative insurance policy. \"We are still working with the speaker, House leadership to come up with that bill, hopefully, a compromised bill, and if not move forward on a full debate in front of the American public,\" he said. \"We've got enough signatures,\" Denham added. \"We'll have more members signing on as soon as we get back.\" The House has not attempted to take up any immigration legislation under Trump because GOP leaders have been unable to draft a bill that can pass on GOP votes alone, and unwilling to advance bipartisan legislation if there is no guarantees Trump would sign it into law. The president's rhetoric and an emotional and fractious debate about how people and families are being treated along the U.S. Mexico border right now have also mobilized Democrats to fight \u2014 not compromise \u2014 with Trump on immigration. Protesters gathered in more than two dozen cities across the country last week to protest the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant parents and children at the Southern border. At least 600 children were taken from their parents in May as part of the latest crackdown on illegal immigration. \"It is entirely the Donald Trump administration's fault,\" Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., a leader in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told MSNBC last week. \"This is all because of Donald Trump, and this is all because they're trying to appease their base. That's all this is.\" Over the Memorial Day recess, a growing number of congressional Democrats announced plans to introduce legislation to counter Trump's immigration policies. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., announced plans to introduce legislation to enhance congressional oversight over Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol by requiring formal record-keeping and reports to Congress on all stops and searches at the border. \"In order to better protect our country, as well as the rights of every person, we need data on every encounter and stricter oversight of these agencies who've become the key enforcers of President Trump's anti-immigrant agenda,\" Crowley said in a statement. Senate Democrats like California's Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, are working on legislation that would block the separation of families at the border. \"Congress has a moral obligation to take a stand here,\" she said in a statement. The volatile mix of intra-GOP fighting and rising Democratic opposition is fueling more skepticism than confidence that the House will ultimately pass any immigration legislation this month, let alone bills that could clear the Senate's 60-vote hurdle and President Trump's veto pen. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., winked at that reality last week in an interview with Fox Business News when asked what his priorities would be come 2019, if Republicans hold the majority and he is elected speaker. He said he'd focus on economic growth, and that \"means solving immigration.\"",

Curbelo is seeking to circumvent Republican leaders to bring an immigration bill to the House floor.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call Inc.\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., holds a news conference on immigration reform Wednesday at the Capitol. Curbelo is seeking to circumvent Republican leaders to bring an immigration bill to the House floor. A small group of House Republicans began gathering support Wednesday for a plan to force votes on immigration legislation as early as this summer, despite protests from party leaders. The long-shot legislative maneuver, known as a discharge petition, requires that they persuade at least 218 House members to sign a petition to overrule House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders and compel votes on at least four immigration bills. The effort is a rare act of defiance of party leaders by legislators who are eager to avoid an ugly showdown over immigration ahead of the election in November. Supporters of the petition say they are tired of waiting for leaders to act on immigration and are willing to resort to unusual steps to get their way. Florida Republican Carlos Curbelo told reporters Wednesday that he has been clear with leaders that he wants to empower lawmakers. \"We believe this institution needs to act. Immigration has paralyzed the institution for too long,\" Curbelo said. \"We don't view this as [in] any way undermining House leaders.\" Members on both sides say they are frustrated by negotiations with the White House over border security and protection for immigrants who are in the country after being brought as children to the country illegally. The Senate attempted to take up immigration in February but failed to advance any bills after a week of debate. President Trump announced last year that he planned to revoke protections for roughly 700,000 of those immigrants who filed under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Courts have so far blocked him from following through but lawmakers say they want to step in and give immigrants certainty as soon as possible. Curbelo said the plan is to allow votes on up to four bills. The first would be a moderate proposal that would include DACA protections and some bipartisan border security measures. The second bill would be a conservative measure drafted by Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte to crack down on illegal immigration and place new limits on legal immigration. The other two options are still poorly defined, but at least one would be a bill crafted by GOP leaders and sponsored by Ryan. It is rare for leaders to back a process that evades their control of the House floor. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters Wednesday that he \"doesn't like discharge petitions\" but declined to answer when asked if he was formally working to persuade members not to sign the immigration petition. Ryan hasn't formally weighed in, but he has for months called on House members to work on crafting immigration legislation through normal committee channels \u2014 a position reiterated Wednesday by Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. \"We continue to work with our members to find a solution that can both pass the House and get the president's signature,\" Strong said in a statement The measure is gaining steam despite leadership objections. The discharge petition was filed Wednesday morning with seven signatures. The number more than doubled to 17 by midafternoon. Sponsors said they expect all 193 Democrats will eventually join them \u2014 meaning the effort could be fewer than 10 votes short of success. \"Every member should be for this discharge petition and this process,\" Curbelo said. It isn't rare for members to file discharge petitions; what's rare is for the petitions to succeed. Members have successfully forced votes on major legislation only twice in the past 20 years: the McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill in 2001 and a 2015 measure to reinstate the Export-Import Bank. The unconventional plan has been in the works for several months, but it rapidly gained support in April after Ryan announced that he plans to retire at the end of 2018. Ryan had been pushing members to focus on crafting an immigration bill that Trump could support. Forcing votes on immigration could be politically risky for Republicans who have struggled to find a unified message on the subject.  A vote this summer could re-expose fissures within the party over protecting DACA recipients and deep disagreements with Trump over his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico. Trump has said he won't sign new immigration protections without funding for the wall and greater border security. So far Congress has failed to come up with any legislation that would satisfy those demands while still getting the necessary votes from moderates in the House and Democrats in the Senate, where bipartisan support is needed to avoid a filibuster. But supporting immigration is also good politics for some Republicans. Utah Republican Mia Love, one of dozens of House Republicans facing a serious challenge in November, said she backs the petition precisely because it would give every member of Congress the opportunity to go on record on immigration. \"We want the White House to come up with their plans and the Senate to come up with their plans,\" Love said. \"Our job is to make sure all of the bills that all of us have worked really hard on have a voice on the floor.\"",

            "article_content": "The Office of Government Ethics on Monday said that as an agency head, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt bears \"a heightened responsibility\" when it comes avoiding conflicts of interest.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Office of Government Ethics on Monday said that as an agency head, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt bears \"a heightened responsibility\" when it comes avoiding conflicts of interest. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota went on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday and defended embattled EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. \"We'll nitpick little things,\" Rounds said. \"He has too many people on his security detail. It may add up to more than what the previous guy did. ... We said we had to have regulatory reform. We've got it. Scott Pruitt is a big part of that. He's executing what the president wants him to execute.\" On a host of issues, Republicans seem to be struggling with how to respond in the age of Trump \u2014 whether it's about Pruitt and ethics or the president and questions about his personal behavior. (Think about evangelicals' response to allegations of President Trump's marital infidelity \u2014 or previous allegations of sexual assault and misconduct). But ethics officials in government are starting to speak out and raise red flags. The Office of Government Ethics on Monday issued a strongly worded letter (full letter at the bottom of this post) that lays out its case for why ethics matter. \"Public trust demands that all employees act in the public's interest, and free from any actual or perceived conflicts when fulfilling governmental responsibilities entrusted to them,\" writes David Apol, acting director and general counsel of the office. What's more, Apol points out, Pruitt is not just any \"employee\" who has to be held to this standard. \"Agency heads in particular bear a heightened responsibility,\" he notes. That's because, according to the Code of Federal Regulations, agency heads are literally \"required to 'exercise personal leadership in ... establishing and maintaining an effective agency ethics program and fostering an ethical culture in the agency.' \" Not only that, but the statute lays out the expectation that agency heads also \"enforce\" ethics rules in their agencies and consider them in \"evaluating the performance of senior executives.\" President Trump shakes hands with EPA chief Scott Pruitt after announcing his decision for the United States to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump shakes hands with EPA chief Scott Pruitt after announcing his decision for the United States to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Reports about Pruitt's potential ethical issues are wide-ranging. They include requesting a large security detail (even when on personal travel to Disneyland); flying first class on the taxpayers' dime (while flying coach when he was flying on his own); entering a $50-a-night deal to rent a room in a condo owned by the wife of a lobbyist; providing pay raises to aides close to him after the White House apparently rejected the hikes; using an EPA staffer to help him search for housing on weekends; and removing the head of his security detail who objected to using sirens to get Pruitt through traffic in a nonemergency situation. The actions \"do raise concerns about whether the Administrator is using public office for personal gain in violation of ethics rules\" and \"raise concerns about whether the Administrator misused his position,\" Apol writes. If it's true that Pruitt retaliated against staff for doing their jobs, then, Apol says, \"it is hard to imagine any action that could more effectively undermine an agency's integrity than punishing or marginalizing employees who strive to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that safeguard that integrity.\" And yet, Republicans like Rounds dismiss the ethics complaints as \"nitpicking.\" And even as the White House says it is reviewing the allegations, Trump has already sought to minimize them. In a weekend tweet, Trump echoed Pruitt's claims that the extra security spending was the result of \"death threats because of his bold actions at EPA,\" declared the travel expenses \"OK,\" called the questionable rental arrangement \"about market rate,\" and said, \"Scott is doing a great job!\" While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job! The defense of Pruitt comes even though the president and Republican leaders could surely find another conservative who could be as effective at rolling back the regulations at the department. One of the rules of politics is that people rarely act when their jobs aren't at stake. But Republicans have been punished for ethical lapses in the past. After the 2006 election, for example, the last time the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress, Republicans lost the House and Senate. The spiraling Iraq civil war was the principal reason, but ethics scandals played a not-insignificant role, too. As The Washington Post noted the day after Election Day 2006: \"Exit polling indicated that this theme resonated strongly with voters, who told a consortium of news media interviewers that they disapproved of the way Congress is handling its job (61 percent) and described 'corruption and scandals in government' as either very or extremely important factors in their vote (74 percent). \"Only the state of the national economy was mentioned more frequently (82 percent) as a very or extremely important issue in exit polling, based on 13,208 interviews. The issues that Republican Party leaders highlighted in their pre-election campaigning \u2014 terrorism, immigration, abortion and same-sex marriage \u2014 were mentioned less often in the surveys.\" When John Boehner became speaker in 2010, after Republicans wrested control of the House once again, he did not have a short memory. He was known for his swift action against members of his own party for a variety of ethics scandals. He set the tone. In contrast, Trump gave his backing to Pruitt \u2014 and congressional Republicans don't appear to be withdrawing their support for the EPA chief. As Apol argues, \"The success of our government depends on maintaining the trust of the people we serve.\" Democrats and Republicans have struggled with ethics. As NPR's Ron Elving notes, policy victories \u2014 as can often be the case in Washington \u2014 are trumping ethics. But how party leadership responds can often set an example or inflame outrage. Voters will get the opportunity to decide for themselves this year whether ethical lapses matter \u2014 or if it's all just nitpicking.",

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his populist Fidesz party easily swept to victory on Sunday in a parliamentary election that saw the highest turnout of voters in more than a decade. It will be the third successive term for Orb\u00e1n, who is the longest-serving prime minister in post-communist Hungary; it's the 54-year-old's fourth term overall. His party is projected to regain its two-thirds majority in the 199-seat parliament. \"We scored a decisive victory,\" Orb\u00e1n told his supporters. \"We have received an opportunity, created an opportunity to be able to defend Hungary.\" Budapest voter Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy said she cast her ballot for Fidesz because she believed the right-wing party and its leader offer Hungary the best protection against Muslim migrants and pressure from Brussels \u2014 the main issues Orb\u00e1n campaigned on. \"I voted for stability and the process that is already underway, and I would like for this process to continue positively with the team that has managed to do positive things,\" she said. Fidesz' formerly far-right rival, Jobbik, came in a distant second. Its chairman, G\u00e1bor Vona, told reporters at a late night news conference that he was resigning. \"We would have liked for this high turnout to yield a different result, but the people decided this way,\" he said. Some Hungarian analysts had predicted the high turnout of voters would benefit the opposition. Those candidates did appear do better in bigger cities like Budapest, but Fidesz appeared to dominate races in the rest of the country. Many polling stations around Hungary remained open for several hours after the 7 p.m. CEST closing time to accommodate voters standing in long lines. The prime minister and his party also likely benefited from the mail-in ballots of 378,000 of new voters who are ethnically Hungarian, but live abroad.  Critics say the current government actively recruited and provided them with citizenship and also allowed them to mail in their votes, which citizens who move abroad from Hungary are not allowed to do. International observers from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) have scheduled a press conference on Monday to talk about some of their findings on the Hungarian elections. Some right-wing conservatives in Hungary who used to support Fidesz have soured on Orb\u00e1n. One such supporter-turned-critic is P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, an independent mayor who two months ago beat the Fidesz candidate in the party's southern stronghold of  H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely. Orb\u00e1n \"created a system where he practically cannot be removed from power,\" M\u00e1rki-Zay said. \"As in every authoritarian leader, you know, after time, he just surrounded himself with people who supported him and didn't dare to criticize him. So he lost touch with reality.\" That's not how the prime minister sees it. \"Our homeland, Hungary is not yet where we would like it to be,\" he told supporters on Sunday night. \"But it has set out on the way it has chosen for itself. We'll go all the way on this road together.\" The sweeping election results will likely embolden the prime minister in his battles with the EU leadership over its attempts to better integrate the 28-country bloc, as well as any plans it has regarding refugees. Hungarian government spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs told NPR the new government also plans to exert more control over civil society.  Earlier this year, the cabinet submitted draft measures to the Hungarian parliament aimed at banning NGOs deemed a security risk or that support immigration, while also imposing a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to those groups who help migrants. \"Because of the election campaign ... there was no time actually to go through the proposal,\" Kov\u00e1cs said.  \"But that's going to be the first issue, the first topic on which the new parliament\" votes.",

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to show support for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on Feb. 2 in West Palm Beach, Fla. Last week was supposed to be a pivotal moment for an immigration deal. But despite days of debate and numerous proposals, senators were not able to pass a concrete immigration solution. Four separate immigration measures failed in the Senate. Part of the conundrum is that President Trump seems unwilling to sign any bill that does not include a commitment to narrowing legal immigration, after originally saying he would pass any bill that lawmakers could agree on. If Congress does not come up with a solution soon, and the courts don't offer some clarity, some 700,000 people protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) could lose their status. Assumption versus reality Immigration appears thoroughly ingrained in the Democratic brand. When the center-left think tank Third Way conducted surveys after the 2016 election with voters, nearly all of them pointed to the same thing. \"When we asked people what Democrats stood for, immigration was one of the biggest words that came up in the word cloud that people used to discuss Democrats,\" said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, vice president for social policy and politics at Third Way. \"[Immigration] was a mainstay of how people saw the Democratic Party.\" And so the logical conclusion ahead of the 2016 presidential election was that Trump's unfriendly immigration rhetoric would help Democrats. \"One of the things that many analysts had pointed to is Donald Trump's comments about immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants, might motivate Latino voters to turn out in record numbers,\" explained Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center. That did not exactly happen. For one thing, the top issue for Latino voters \u2014 like all voters \u2014 was the economy. And the Latino turnout rate actually declined compared from 48 percent in 2012 to 47.6 percent in 2016. Despite the assumption that immigration is a pillar of the Democratic Party, in the last presidential election, it galvanized Republicans far more than Democrats. Data were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool \u2014 a consortium of ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, NBC and The Associated Press.\n                \n\n                    National Exit Polls \n                    \n\nhide caption Trump voters President Trump made immigration the backbone of his campaign. \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump said at his 2015 campaign announcement. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" Trump successfully moved immigration into the core of the Republican Party's identity. In the early 1990s, Republican and Democrats were almost entirely in sync with how they felt about immigrants' contributions to the country, but as Democrats have become more progressive, Republicans have become more conservative. Loading... Among 2016 voters who said \"the most important issue facing the country\" was immigration, they heavily favored Trump \u2014 64 percent to 32 percent \u2014 according to the exit polls. Republican pollster Whit Ayres believes that immigration is politically potent not so much on its own, but as symbolic of broader emotional issues that affect the GOP base. \"For opponents of immigration, the issue taps into economic pressures that could damage the blue-collar middle class, as well as fears that we're losing our culture \u2014 a country that's spoken English since its founding is becoming bilingual,\" he explained. \"Don't underestimate ... the frustration of many Trump voters that we are losing our country. And that we are fundamentally changing it in ways that are unlike anything we've had in the past.\" Data were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool \u2014 a consortium of ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, NBC and The Associated Press.\n                \n\n                    National Exit Polls\n                    \n\nhide caption John Sides, a political science professor at George Washington University, conducted a survey after the 2016 election where he interviewed the same voters he had spoken with in 2012 \u2014 so he knew how they felt about immigration and he also knew how they had voted. \"One of the reasons why Trump was able to win ... was by using the issue of immigration to pull some white Obama voters over to his side,\" explained Sides. His research found that about a quarter to a third of white Obama voters in 2012 had fairly conservative positions on immigration. \"We were able to show among white voters there were only a handful of things that were more strongly related to their choice between Trump and Clinton than their choice between Obama and Romney, and those things had to do with their views of race, and their views of immigration, and their views of Muslims,\" Sides said. What history tells us So maybe heated rhetoric alone does not turn out voters, but Lopez says policy changes might, such as when the DACA program was first introduced the summer before President Obama's re-election. \"Obama in 2012 was under this cloud of being a 'deporter-in-chief,' \u2014 at least many Latino leaders had described him as such,\" said Lopez. \"So when he does DACA many analysts say that was just enough the motivator to get many Hispanics who were perhaps on the fence about voting out to vote.\" But even if there was a post-DACA bump, it was a minor bump. Chris Zepeda-Mill\u00e1n, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, says history proves that Latinos are more likely to mobilize against a legislative threat than for legislative action. He points to the mass Latino mobilization in 2006 because of the Sensenbrenner bill, which threatened to make it a federal crime to aid someone who entered the country illegally. \"Latinos tend to come and out vote, and immigrants, when there's anti-immigrant legislation on the ballot,\" said Zepeda-Mill\u00e1n. \"We saw this in California. We've seen it in other states as well. When there's anti-immigrant legislation looming, Latinos tend to come out at higher rates.\" A similar thing happened in California in the 1990s when Republicans backed  Proposition 187, a ballot measure to deny public services to people in the country illegally. Midterm consequences The key difference between Donald Trump's election and the upcoming midterms is that it's a fundamentally different political landscape. This November, elections will be held in discrete districts. The Republican pollster Whit Ayres points out that much of how immigration is discussed in a local contest comes down to the demographic context of the local area. And in many key suburban swing districts, immigration may not be as much of a lighting rod in either direction. Many of these analysts on the topic of immigration say that Republicans could benefit in those areas by merely getting the issue off the table. Any immigration solution, even if it's merely a short-term DACA fix, could suffice. \"Most voters don't list immigration as their number one voting issue,\" said Erickson-Hatalsky. \"So, I think if Trump signs a deal that probably diffuses the issue politically, in general.\" If, however, those 700,000 immigrants who came here as children lose their DACA protection from deportation, then Democrats might have a policy change that motivates turnout on their side.",

            "article_content": "Faces Of NPR is a weekly feature that showcases the people behind NPR, from the voices you hear every day on the radio to the ones who work outside of the recording studio. You'll find out about what they do and what inspires them. This week's post features Ben de la Cruz, a visuals editor for NPR's Science Desk. The Basics: Name: Ben de la Cruz Job Title: Visuals Editor Where You're From: Born in Manila, Raised in Baltimore Twitter Handle: @bendelacruz You're the visuals editor for NPR's Global Health and Development blog, Goats and Soda. What is your day-to-day like? As a visuals editor, I get the chance on a daily basis to collaborate with amazingly talented filmmakers, animators, photographers, illustrators, reporters, and editors. Many of my collaborators are right here in the building, but I also work with freelancers from around the world. Our shared goal is to produce visually-rich, compelling content that can surprise, explain, and humanize the many serious \u2014 as well as hopeful \u2014 stories in global health and development. How did you get started at NPR? Do you have any advice for someone who wants a job like yours? I came to NPR more than six years ago after working for 12 years as a video journalist at The Washington Post, including serving as the head of video and multimedia. During my time there I helped cover three presidential elections, immigration and race issues, and Hurricane Katrina. Working with the investigative team, I contributed to series about illegal guns, congressional earmarks, public housing, and the mistreatment of soldiers suffering from PTSD at Walter Reed military hospital. Congratulations on receiving awards of excellence in the Eyes of History multimedia contest sponsored by the White House News Photographers' Association for your work on the Hot Pot: A Dish, A Memory video series. What inspired you to start this project? I was binge watching Netflix's Chef's Table and Instagram food videos last year. I loved the backstories of the chefs and the mesmerizing quality of the short Instagram videos. It got me thinking about how to create an NPR version that would meld these two qualities. After months of brainstorming with my editor Alison Richards, as well as colleagues Malaka Gharib, Rhitu Chatterjee, John Poole, and others on Goats & Soda and The Salt, we decided to focus each video on an ordinary person cooking a dish, while sharing a food memory. While we didn't conceive of the project with awards in mind, it was so gratifying that the work received recognition. NPR is known for its audio storytelling and reporting. What's it like working in a visual capacity at NPR? It's a challenge, but it's also fun and exciting. People know what NPR sounds like, but most probably don't know what NPR looks like. I think there are already a lot of great examples of what NPR looks like, of course. I loved the video team's coverage of the solar eclipse, as well as the Inauguration and Women's March. And I'm a big fan of Skunk Bear's science videos. But we're always evolving, adapting, and honing our visual storytelling style for new audiences and platforms. Ben receives a rose from Skunk Bear host Adam Cole.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Lee/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ben receives a rose from Skunk Bear host Adam Cole. Is there a particular image you've worked on that you're particularly proud of? There's no particular image, but I'm proud of our team's coverage of the ebola outbreak in West Africa. It was a difficult and dangerous story to cover, but despite the challenges, our team\u2014including our visual journalists John Poole, David Gilkey, and freelancer photographer Tommy Trenchard\u2014brought to our audiences so many powerful stories in video, stills, audio, and text. What are some other cool things you're working on now? Do you have favorite past projects? First, some past favorites are: Currently, I'm part of a team developing a new way of thinking about how we can collaborate and engage with our audience as well as photographers, filmmakers, illustrators, animators, and graphic designers to build new visual storytelling avenues on NPR's website, social media platforms, and through live events. We're really excited about these new ideas. Details to come soon. What's on your desk? Artwork created by my 6-year-old son, Javier.

Favorite Tiny Desk? Pixies, because Joey Santiago is one of my favorite guitar players. I listened to Surfer Rosa on repeat for a month straight when it first came out. I bonded with Joey after the show because we were both born in the Philippines. Favorite places in D.C.? National Arboretum's Fern Valley and the Hirshhorn Museum. What is your favorite food?

I have so many favorites. Sinigang with butter fish (mom's recipe); Ginataan crab (my wife Genevieve's recipe); Bo Saam (a la David Chang); Cacio e pepe (from a family trip to Rome last November); BBQ pork marinated in garlic, soy, and 7-up (my dad's recipe); and Kare Kare (Tom Cunanan's recipe). What are you binging on right now? Netflix's The Crown. Do you have any guilty pleasures? The Baltimore Orioles. Since I was a kid in B'more, I've always loved following the team. We lived a few miles from the stadium and when the game wasn't on TV, I listened to the game on the radio from our back porch. When the O's hit a home run, I could hear the sounds of the distant cheers in the summer night. Go O's! What is your favorite thing about working at NPR? I get to work with lots of talented people. And the Tiny Desk Concerts!",

Zeman has opposed immigration and supports closer ties with Russia. Milos Zeman, an outspoken immigration critic and admirer of Russia's Vladimir Putin, has won a second five-year term as president of the Czech Republic. Zeman defeated political newcomer Jiri Drahos in the central European country's presidential runoff election that ended Saturday. Zeman took 51.4 percent of the vote against Drahos' 48.6 percent, according to the Czech Statistical Office, with turnout at 66.6 percent. It's a victory for advocates of closer ties between the Czech Republic and Russia and China. Drahos, 68, a chemist and academic, had advocated improving ties with the European Union and NATO. Zeman was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. The 73-year-old Zeman is \"probably openly the most anti-immigration and anti-Muslim top politician in Europe,\" Jiri Pehe of New York University in Prague told CNN. Zeman has called for an end to EU sanctions against Russia and has proposed a referendum on the Czech Republic leaving the EU. Zeman's supporters tended to be more rural while Drahos tended to have more support in cities. \"Zeman very clearly established his anti-immigration position and that decided the election,\" Jakub Charvat of the Metropolitan University in Prague told Bloomberg. \"He appealed to voters with lower income and lower education levels who felt they finally had someone in the highest echelons of politics who defends them.\" The presidency is a mostly ceremonial post, but it includes the power to appoint the Czech prime minister. Zeman plans to reappoint Prime Minister Andrej Babis, according to the BBC.",

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., looks on. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., says a primary challenge in 2020 to President Trump isn't off the table. \"That's not in my plans, but I don't rule anything out,\" the frequent Trump critic told NPR's Robert Siegel in an interview airing Thursday on All Things Considered. \"I do think he will have a challenge. Most certainly there will be an independent challenge,\" Flake predicted. \"If you have Donald Trump, if he still can manage to carry his base, as he calls it, that could be and should be enough to get him renominated, but it certainly won't be enough to get him re-elected.\" Asked whether Trump could face some kind of mass uprising within the party ranks during the 2020 nominating process, Flake said he wasn't convinced the president is necessarily going to run again. Trump's approval ratings have hit record lows in his first year, and multiple reports have described how frustrated and unhappy the president is by the confines of his office. \"Well, we're assuming he is running for re-election,\" the Arizona senator said. \"I don't think that's a safe assumption. He may not. I'm not among those who think that he's going to be impeached or removed from office, but I am among those who question whether or not he'll give it a go the next time around.\" \"But if he does, I do think he'll have a challenge within the Republican Party,\" Flake continued. \"I'm not sure that challenge will succeed, but it may be time for an independent \u2014 particularly if the Democratic Party continues to go further to the left. There is a huge swath of voters I think in the middle that are going to be looking for something else.\" Flake announced last year that he wasn't running for re-election after facing a tough primary challenge from a candidate who has criticized him for not being behind Trump enough. Trump has also lashed out at Flake, calling him \"toxic\" and \"weak\" on border security. Flake has indeed not been shy in sharing his deep concerns about the president. He wrote a book, Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle, in which he decried his fellow Republicans for making a \"Faustian bargain\" in nominating Trump while abandoning many core conservative principles like free trade and glossing over his controversial stands like birtherism. When Flake announced his retirement, he gave an impassioned speech on the Senate floor, lamenting that, \"We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country \u2014 the personal attacks; the threats against principles, freedoms and institutions; the flagrant disregard for truth or decency; the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal.\" Flake also said at that time that he would be making a series of speeches about the critical importance of facts and truth to American democracy \u2014 something Flake and many others say Trump and his White House often flout. The Arizona Republican's Senate term runs through the end of this year.",

            "article_content": "On the NPR Ed Team, I am what you might call the grizzled veteran. I've seen education trends come and go and come again. And go again. You get the idea. In years past, around December, my teammates would often pause by my desk and ask: \"What do you think we'll be covering next year?\" I've always found this a fun thought exercise, and, at some point, my editor suggested I jot down my answers and share them beyond our cubicles. And so, here are a few predictions for 2018. A quick reminder, though: I don't have a real crystal ball or a time machine. Just gut instinct, which occasionally fails me. 1. DACA will end Since 2012, the federal policy known as DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 has protected roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation. Under DACA, immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children are able to stay, work and get an education. A few months ago, the Trump administration announced it was ending the Obama-era program but left open the possibility that Congress could re-instate it by March 2018. I predict that conservative lawmakers, fearful of looking weak on immigration in an election year, will let DACA die. The reaction of DACA students, especially the 241,000 enrolled in college, will be swift and furious. And though it is unlikely they would be deported immediately or en masse, most will eventually be forced to quit school and surrender their driver's licenses and work permits. 2. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will step down This is a leap, I know, but, since her turbulent confirmation, DeVos has had a rough time building trust with educators who question her support of public schools. In 2018, her relationship with state education officials will deteriorate and tip the scales against her. Politically, DeVos will grow increasingly irrelevant and isolated, and, by the end of 2018, she will decide to pursue her agenda as a private citizen. President Trump will be too preoccupied with mid-term elections to persuade her to stay. 3. Higher education will dominate headlines The nation is in a student financial aid crisis, which will only get worse in 2018, especially if Republicans' tax overhaul hits college students as hard as some predict. And, though there are no prominent court cases pending, many colleges and universities will revisit the hotly contested issue of race's role in admissions policies. Also, intense news coverage of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace will spread to campuses, where both have been a problem. The focus will be on the predatory behavior of male faculty and administrators. 4. After years of modest progress, closing the achievement gap between rich and poor, black and white, will hit a wall With the federal government now scaling back its oversight of public education, vocal critics of the Education Department under President Obama will have a chance to prove that, when it comes to education, locals know best. But, under the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), efforts to close the achievement gap will suffer. Not only that, one trend will dominate in 2018: the continued segregation of students by race and income and its impact on learning.",

            "article_content": "As a caravan of migrants continues north through Mexico, Texas border towns are preparing. Many are also skeptical about the deployment of U.S. troops to the border, and some say this is all politics.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: With midterm elections days away and Central American migrants plodding northward, President Trump is deploying more than 7,000 active-duty troops to support border agents. He's also vowed to further limit asylum and put up massive tents to detain asylum-seekers who get caught crossing illegally. NPR's John Burnett sent us this report from South Texas. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: The president's dire warnings of an imminent invasion of dangerous Central American immigrants has gotten people's attention here in the gritty border town of Progreso, Texas. This week, big steel gates were installed on the international bridge leading to Nuevo Progreso, Mexico. They can swing shut in case immigrants try to storm the U.S. port of entry, something that's never happened before. RUBEN TREVINO: I've been coming here for 20 years, and they have never, ever been any gates like that. When we walked by today and we saw the gates, we were in shock. BURNETT: That's Ruben Trevino walking home from Nuevo Progreso after he and his wife visited a dentist in Mexico. Most of a dozen bridge crossers interviewed say they're glad the authorities put in gates to keep out unwanted immigrants. Bob and Sharon Caylor moved to South Texas from Michigan. They were also seeing a Mexican dentist and buying meds. SHARON CAYLOR: Yeah, it's a good idea. But I don't think the caravan's going to make it. BURNETT: Why not? S. CAYLOR: Well, they got 900 more miles to go. They're going to wear their shoes out. They're getting sick. BOB CAYLOR: I think that they ought to put crocodiles in the river. S. CAYLOR: Not crocodiles, alligators. B. CAYLOR: Alligators. BURNETT: Earlier this week, the Pentagon released details of its deployment. More than 7,000 troops are coming from across the country - helicopter companies to move Homeland Security personnel, engineer battalions to build vehicle barriers and fencing, medical teams to treat casualties. Trump already sent more than 2,000 National Guard to the border earlier this year to back up federal agents. At the Brownsville VFW Hall, a 20-year Navy veteran named Juan Palomo wonders why active duty and why now. JUAN PALOMO: You have reservists, and you have National Guard. They use them every time that there is hurricanes, flooding. What's the difference now? Why don't they use them instead of taking people who are active duty who have an - a job to do already to come down here and police the borders? BURNETT: The main caravan is estimated to have dropped from 7,000 to fewer than 4,000 currently, and it's still in southern Mexico. But border agents say they've been swamped with migrant families for months. Chris Cabrera is a local spokesman for the agents' union. CHRIS CABRERA: Everybody's making this huge deal about a caravan coming in. The caravan's coming. It's coming. We're getting 5,000 a week in the Rio Grande Valley - a week. That's a caravan in and of itself. It's already here. The problem's here. BURNETT: Cabrera is on the fence about whether the troops will help. He says the real problem is the asylum process that lets applicants linger inside the U.S. for years while their cases work through the overloaded court system. Yesterday, Trump said he plans to issue an executive order that would deny asylum to anyone who crosses unlawfully. That would mean all immigrants seeking asylum must cross at a legal port of entry. But there's already a bottleneck at border crossings from San Diego to Brownsville. A new crush of applicants could make things worse, says Michael Seifert, who works with the ACLU in South Texas. He says they watch the Brownsville-Matamoros International Bridge every day. MICHAEL SEIFERT: Even if you wanted to come in the right way, you're going to be prepared to wait eight to 10 days out in the open in a place where there's no restroom facilities on the side of the bridge that right now is not safe because of the drug wars. BURNETT: This unusually blustery political season has put U.S. border towns front and center. Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez hears about the caravan supposedly coming to rush his bridges, of politicians saying they need to militarize his community to protect it and of Democrats accused of being for open borders. Martinez himself is a Democrat running for re-election next year, and he says he's just had it. TONY MARTINEZ: It's not about open borders. It's about secure borders, and we have secure borders. We've had border walls for 20 years, you know? This rhetoric is just beyond the pale. It is so absurd. And I know that some people will believe it because they don't live here. They don't know it. BURNETT: The mayor says, come and visit after the election. The border's not such a scary place. John Burnett, NPR News, Brownsville. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In a newly published interview, Trump said he's preparing to sign an order ending the right to citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Days before an election in which he wants immigration to be a major issue, President Trump has a new way to talk about immigration. He gave an interview to Axios in which he said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship. That's the legal concept that someone born in the United States or to a U.S. citizen is also entitled to be a citizen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. JONATHAN SWAN: Right, 14th Amendment. TRUMP: Guess what? You don't. SWAN: You don't. TRUMP: No. 1, you don't need that. No. 2, you can definitely do... SWAN: I mean, that's in dispute. That's very much in dispute. TRUMP: Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order. Now, how ridiculous - we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And it has to end. INSKEEP: There is a lot in that bit of video, including a number of statements that are false. Notably, the president is wrong to say that the United States alone grants birthright citizenship. Many countries around the world do, including Canada.  Now let's talk about this with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Why is the president focused on this? HORSLEY: Well, it seems to be conveniently timed for the midterm elections, which are just a week away today. This is an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and some other candidates during the 2016 campaign. INSKEEP: Right. HORSLEY: And here we are in late 2018, and we have seen zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this until - now we are a week out from the midterm elections. The White House counsel, who would presumably play a role in drafting an order like this, has just left his post. The new White House counsel hasn't taken over. There's an acting person in that slot. So it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to surface. It may be a little bit of vaporware, like the president's 10 percent middle class tax cut... INSKEEP: Oh. HORSLEY: ...That conveniently arises before the midterm and then is never seen or heard from again. INSKEEP: I guess we should fact-check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there. And it is something he said during the campaign, complaining that someone who is known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on U.S. soil and therefore get 85 years of benefits. The reality is in many cases, of course, that person grows up and goes to work and works a job and creates value for the economy, correct? HORSLEY: Well, that's right. And we're talking, really, about sort of two phenomenon. One is babies born to people who are living in the U.S. illegally, and then secondly, there's a nascent phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to the U.S. specifically for the purpose of having children. We should say the 14th Amendment is very explicit. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens. Whether you can challenge that through an executive order is a pretty constitutionally dubious proposition. INSKEEP: Well, that's what I want to ask about, Scott Horsley. The president says there - on the video, he says, OK, so it's in the Constitution. But some people think you can do it with Congress, so I'm going to try an executive order. That seems, to me, like he was saying, you need a plane to cross the Pacific Ocean. But some people think you can do it in a rowboat, so I'm going to try a scooter. HORSLEY: (Laughter) He may try it. And this would certainly face a quick constitutional challenge. INSKEEP: Although, as you point out, he hasn't done it yet. It's a thing he is raising, he is discussing days before an election. HORSLEY: And this is catnip to the anti-immigrant faction within the GOP. INSKEEP: All right, Scott. Thanks so much, really appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome, Steve.

            "article_content": "As Sweden prepares for its Sept. 9 general election, the rise of a populist right-wing party has changed the political landscape.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Sweden took in record numbers of asylum-seekers at the height of Europe's refugee crisis. And now it's preparing for its tightest election in years. Polls suggest the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats could become the country's second-largest party when the nation votes a week from now, scrambling politics as usual there. Maddy Savage reports from central Sweden. MADDY SAVAGE, BYLINE: It's a gray, rainy day in Orebro, a rural, politically split city about 120 miles west of the capital, Stockholm. But the weather hasn't stopped campaigners. Their stalls are packed together in the square outside the 19th century city wall. PER SODERLUND: (Speaking in Swedish). SAVAGE: Sweden has eight parties in its Parliament and usually ends up with a center-left or center-right coalition government. But the political landscape is set for a major upset thanks to the rise of the nationalist Sweden Democrats. Per Soderlund is the party's chairman here. SODERLUND: Sweden has accepted a lot of asylum-seekers into our country the last three, four years and even before that, actually, compared to other countries in Europe. And this has costed a lot of money. SAVAGE: But you think now there should be a complete stop. SODERLUND: Yeah, for now. We say, like, in Sweden, Swedish culture should be the main culture. SAVAGE: The Sweden Democrats only entered Parliament for the first time in 2010 after working to distance themselves from earlier links to neo-Nazi groups. These days, they're attracting an increasingly diverse support base. Here in Oreboro, Ingelin Andersson is among those considering voting for them. INGELIN ANDERSSON: I think they have many good policies. We have had too many people who has come to Sweden. They don't respect the Swedish culture - not all, but some. SAVAGE: What do they do that you feel isn't very Swedish? ANDERSSON: Well, if you stay in a queue, they are walking to be first. They can say bad things to Swedish girls. They think that the Swedish girls are whores. SAVAGE: Until recently, Ingelin's comments would have been very taboo in Sweden, a country with a reputation for tolerance. But things shifted after the center-left government took in record numbers of asylum-seekers in 2015 and then admitted that public services couldn't cope. It toughened its approach to migration. And Sweden's biggest center-right opposition party did, too. But they both ended up losing support. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN-CATRIN KRISTIANSSEN: (Speaking in Swedish). SAVAGE: Dr. Ann-Catrin Kristianssen is a political scientist and commentator for Swedish radio. KRISTIANSSEN: (Through interpreter) There's a bright picture of Sweden, and there's a dark picture of Sweden. The darker picture sort of has been the winning image of Sweden for quite a while, so this is a failure for the established parties because Sweden is a rich country and has a lot to offer for its citizens. SAVAGE: She says it is unlikely the Sweden Democrats will end up in a government coalition because the mainstream political parties still consider them too far removed from their ideologies. But a new kind of coalition across party lines might end up being formed to keep the nationalists out of power. The last few weeks of campaigning have thrown up a few curve balls. Climate change has shot up the agenda after Sweden had its warmest summer on record. Security's been in focus, with government agencies clubbing together to try and combat fake news and foreign interference. Meanwhile, many voters, like this 27-year-old nurse, Kajsa Nasstrom, say they're still mulling their options. KAJSA NASSTROM: The Sweden Democrats - they scare me a bit. So I'm looking around - see what the other parties are doing. It's the future I think about and my child - how it's going to be around him when he grows up. SAVAGE: As the election gets closer, it's this kind of undecided voter that all parties will aim to reel in. Sweden's usually a calm and pretty chilly place, but it's shaping up to have its hottest political contest in decades. For NPR News, I'm Maddy Savage in Orebro. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "After Congress failed to pass any immigration legislation this week, we look at how immigration policy could motivate voters this November.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Congress has less than three weeks to come up with an immigration solution before the Trump administration says it is going to revoke DACA, the the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. NPR's Asma Khalid reports on how an immigration bill, or a lack of one, might be motivating voters in an election year. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Immigration is part of the Democratic Party's brand, and so as Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center points out, there was this assumption in the 2016 election that Donald Trump's unfriendly immigration rhetoric would motivate Democrats. MARK HUGO LOPEZ: One of the things that many analysts had pointed to is that Donald Trump's comments about immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants, might motivate Latino voters to turn out in record numbers. KHALID: That did not exactly happen. For one thing, the top issue for Latino voters was the economy, and turnout among Latinos in 2016 actually declined compared to 2012. OK. So maybe insults alone do not turn out voters, but, Lopez told me, policy changes might. He points to when the DACA program was first introduced, the summer before President Obama's re-election. LOPEZ: Obama, in 2012, was under this cloud of being a deporter-in-chief. At least, many Latino leaders had described him as such. So when he does DACA, many analysts say that that was just enough the motivator to get many Hispanics who were perhaps on the fence about voting to vote. KHALID: But even if there was a bump, it was a minor bump. One analyst told me historically we've seen Latinos mobilize against something more than for something. So for example, we saw mass mobilization in 2006 when some anti-immigration legislation was introduced. The thing is, immigration in the abstract actually seems to matter more to Republicans. The exit polls from 2016 show that among voters who said the most important issue facing the country was immigration, they heavily tilted toward Trump, by pretty much 2 to 1. And that's not surprising to Whit Ayres. He's a GOP pollster who's written about immigration and his party. WHIT AYRES: For opponents of immigration, the issue taps into fears of economic pressures that have so damaged the blue collar, middle class, as well as fears that we're losing our culture, that a country that's spoken English since its founding is becoming bilingual. KHALID: That cultural anxiety should not be underestimated. John Sides, a professor at George Washington University, did a survey after the 2016 election where he interviewed the same voters he had spoken to in 2012. JOHN SIDES: So we knew what they said about immigration then and we knew how they voted in 2012. KHALID: And he found that among white voters, there was a correlation over time between their vote and how they felt about a couple of key things. SIDES: And those things had to do with their views of race, and their views of immigration and their views of Muslims. KHALID: Immigration is potent, politically. Not so much standing alone, but symbolic of bigger emotional issues that motivate the GOP's base. Of course, the big difference between Donald Trump's election and the midterms is that it's a very different political landscape. This November, elections will be held in discrete districts and states. In key suburban swing districts, immigration may not be as much of a lightning rod. And so analysts say Republicans could benefit in those areas by just getting any immigration solution, even a short-term DACA fix. Here's Lanae Erickson Hatalsky with the think tank Third Way. LANAE ERICKSON HATALSKY: Most voters don't list immigration as their No. 1 voting issue. So I think if Trump ends up signing a deal, that probably defuses the issue politically, in general. KHALID: But if there is no deal and those 700,000 people with DACA lose their protection from deportation, well, then that might actually motivate Democrats. Asma Khalid, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "House Republican leaders have avoided the immigration debate because it exposes splits inside the party. Now, just five months ahead of the midterms, they agreed to vote on two proposals, with conservatives and centrists still struggling to get on same page.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's been a long time coming. Next week, House Republicans will take up two immigration bills to address the legal status of people brought to the U.S. as children. It's the first time the House will attempt to tackle the contentious immigration legislation since President Trump took office. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis reports on the latest chapter in the long-running struggle inside the GOP to find unity on this issue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: House Republicans know what they're about to do could come at a price this November. TOM COLE: No. I think there is a political risk, but I think the greater risk would've been to do nothing. DAVIS: That's Oklahoma Congressman Tom Cole. And on that point, most Republicans agree. After the Senate failed to act on immigration back in February, House leaders were happy to ignore the immigration debate ahead of this year's elections. But in recent weeks, pushback from conservatives and moderates who want to go on record on this forced House Speaker Paul Ryan's hand with some conditions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: Last thing I want to do is bring a bill out of here that I know the president won't support. Well, we've been working hand in glove with the administration on this to make sure that we're bringing a bill that represents the president's four pillars so that we can come together, have the votes that everybody's looking for... DAVIS: The votes Republicans are now looking at are on two competing proposals. One is expected to be more conservative. The other - more moderate. Both are aimed at providing legal certainty to people brought to the U.S. as children, often called DREAMers. From there, the two bills are expected to include competing provisions on border security and changes to legal immigration, and it's unclear if either can pass. White House adviser Stephen Miller says the president supports House Republicans on both efforts. STEPHEN MILLER: The president has been extremely supportive of what Raul Labrador and Bob Goodlatte and Steve Scalise are doing to unify the Republican Congress. I think both of the bills are being finalized right now, but we strongly support what they're doing. DAVIS: For conservatives, there has long been a political risk to supporting anything that provides a pathway to citizenship for people residing in the U.S. illegally. California Republican Jeff Denham downplayed those fears on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS LIVE\") JEFF DENHAM: I don't think that Republicans should be afraid to face this in the elections. We ought to be championing - not only fighting for certainty for DREAMers, but we ought to be championing the fact that we're going to secure our border. DAVIS: For moderates, especially those in the battleground districts that will determine the majority this November, they risk appearing too cozy with Trump's hard-line immigration policies and rhetoric. Centrists tried to force votes on bipartisan bills that had a lot of Democrats on board. They were overruled. Here's Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart. MARIO DIAZ-BALART: You've heard me say this. Obviously my preference is always to do a bipartisan bill from the get go, right? That doesn't seem to be something that's possible right now. DAVIS: Democrats are expected to overwhelmingly oppose both bills, so Republicans are on their own. California Democrat Linda Sanchez is a member of her party's leadership. She says Democrats aren't going to offer any support for what they see as a purely political exercise intended to help vulnerable Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA SANCHEZ: Fundamentally, at the base of it all - no matter how much lip service they give to wanting to provide a permanent solution for DREAMers and DACA recipients, the fundamental truth is, no, they really don't. DAVIS: President Trump likes to blame Democrats for congressional inaction on immigration. But next week, the Republican majority will be tested on whether they can pass Republican ideas on Republican votes. And if they fail, they'll have no one to blame but each other.

            "article_content": "President Trump is keeping up his hardline rhetoric on immigration. He threatened to deport those crossing the border illegally without due process \u2014 sending mixed signals to Congress on the issue.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: On the one hand, President Trump said today that the executive order he signed last week reversing his administration's policy of separating families at the border was something he wanted to do to show humanity, he said. At the same time, the president stepped up his hard-line rhetoric on immigration, calling for those who are detained to be removed from the country in a matter of hours without the benefit of court proceedings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We want strong borders, and we want no crime. Strong borders. We want no crime. The Democrats want open borders, and they don't care about crime. CORNISH: Democrats dispute that claim. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So what is the president doing here in terms of his message? LIASSON: Well, the president is doing two things. He made a tactical retreat on one aspect of his immigration policy, saying he would no longer separate kids and families at the border. But he's still very committed to using immigration as a key issue to rally his base for the November elections. And in recent days, he's called immigrants invaders. He said they were infesting the country. In a rally in Nevada over the weekend, he said if immigrants see, quote, \"weakness,\" they will come here by the millions. He also said, I got elected because we were strong on borders. And, of course, today in that photo op with the king of Jordan - you just played some of that tape - he again said, we have to change our laws. CORNISH: Meanwhile, it seems like Congress is confused about what the president wants as well. I mean, where do things stand on that front? LIASSON: Right. Well, Congress has been trying to pass a law. House Republicans would like to know where the president stands on the immigration bill that they're supposed to vote on this week. He has said he's a thousand percent behind them and the legislation, but he's also tweeted that it's a waste of time for House Republicans to vote on immigration since the bill presumably wouldn't pass the Senate without Democratic votes. Republicans are still as divided as they've been all year on this issue. Conservatives don't want a path to citizenship for DREAMers. Don't forget, doing something about the DREAMers - those young people who were brought here, often illegally, as children - is what these bills originally were about. That was the other immigration crisis Trump initiated way back in the winter when he took away deportation protection from these young people. But moderates in the House want to be able to vote on something that protects the DREAMers, to register their support for keeping kids and parents together. And that's what Congress is working on. Presumably, if that bill fails, which many people in the House and the White House think it will, then maybe the House would work on a narrower standalone bill that would just address the issue of family separation at the border. CORNISH: Now in the wake of all this, we've seen several incidents of protests against members of the Trump administration in restaurants in the region. So this weekend, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in... LIASSON: Right. CORNISH: ...Virginia because she works for the president. President Trump tweeted about this. And actually, we should note that Sarah Huckabee Sanders brought up the issue at the White House press briefing today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: This weekend, a member of Congress called for people to push back and make clear to those serving their country in this administration that they are not welcome anywhere, anytime, for anything. CORNISH: And I assume there she's referencing Maxine Waters... LIASSON: Right. CORNISH: ...A Democrat who spoke over the weekend. LIASSON: That's right. CORNISH: Mara, what's going on? LIASSON: Maxine Waters, over the weekend, said to Democrats and activists, if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and create a crowd. Push back on them. Tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere. Trump tweeted about this. He sees this as a good issue. He wants to say, look, the Democrats and the left-wing mob are victimizing my supporters and my administration officials. The big debate inside the Democratic Party has been, what is the right way to push back against Trump - at the ballot box, or out in the streets? And many Democrats are worried that the party will turn into a left-wing mirror image of instability started by Donald Trump. So they say, Donald Trump, during the campaign, would say, I want to punch that protester in the face or knock the crap out of him. And the question is, what is the right response? Nancy Pelosi tweeted. She said, Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable and unacceptable. In other words, she sympathizes with Maxine Waters, but she thinks it's a dumb tactic that will backfire, and it's the wrong way to go. So that's the debate inside the Democratic Party. Left-wing activists want to push back, but Democratic leaders don't. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A dispute over the tightening immigration policies in Germany is threatening to bring down Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Germany is facing a major political crisis over immigration. It threatens to topple the government and potentially end the political career of Chancellor Angela Merkel. A regional party in her ruling coalition is demanding tighter rules for migrants entering the country, and that party vows to act unilaterally if the chancellor refuses. Merkel has two weeks to reach a deal. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin that may just delay the inevitable. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: This scene three years ago of asylum-seekers thronging Munich's main train station is what the conservative Bavarian party allied with Chancellor Angela Merkel says must never be repeated. More than a million migrants crossed the Austrian border into Germany through Bavaria since 2015. Although that flow has slowed to a trickle, the migrants' impact on German society is a matter of constant debate, including by President Donald Trump, who tweeted inaccurately about it earlier today. The Bavarian party wants to tighten rules governing the entry into Germany of migrants who are first registered in another EU country and those rejected for asylum. Germany's interior minister and a senior leader of the Bavarian CSU party is Horst Seehofer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HORST SEEHOFER: This is scandalous. (Speaking German). NELSON: He told reporters the situation is scandalous. Seehofer asked, what's the point of an order barring someone's entry into Germany if that person learns there are no consequences? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SEEHOFER: (Speaking German). NELSON: The interior minister and his party, which is facing a major challenge from far-right populists in upcoming regional elections, say they will unilaterally prevent migrants from crossing Bavaria's international borders if Berlin doesn't act. A last-minute reprieve gives Merkel until July 1 to convince fellow European leaders to come up with a comprehensive policy to seal Europe's borders to unbridled migration. If she fails, the CSU vows to break its decades-old alliance with the chancellor's Christian Democrats, which would likely lead to new elections. That would benefit Germany's far right, just like the immigration issue has in at least a dozen other European countries. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: At her own news conference, Merkel said she agrees the asylum process needs to be streamlined. But she was also adamant the only way to do so was through a joint EU policy and individual deals with countries where migrants first go. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: She said it's vital to know what will happen to any migrants barred from entering Germany so they don't end up back here. Merkel has two weeks to negotiate a new arrangement. Otherwise, many political analysts here predict either the chancellor or her interior minister will have to resign. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Dueling, massive crowds showed up in Washington in January 2017: on one day, supporters of the newly inaugurated president; and, the next, an enormous gathering of opponents for the Women's March, with largely women leading the resistance. A year-and-a-half later, that dynamic has played out in the early contests of this year's crucial midterm primaries. President Trump and the allegiance he's inspired among his base, as well as the outrage he has stirred on the left \u2014 particularly among Democratic women \u2014 have been two of the dominant storylines of 2018. And now we enter the busiest stretch of the primary season, beginning with eight states holding primaries Tuesday. Just how busy will June be? Almost two thirds of the country, 31 states, will have voted by July overall, 71 percent of House races will be set and just over half of Senate ones. Here are the four big messages voters have been sending with their votes so far in the 2018 midterm primaries: President Trump is fully in control of the GOP. He's the most influential person in the party, and candidates are fashioning themselves after him.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump is fully in control of the GOP. He's the most influential person in the party, and candidates are fashioning themselves after him. 1. The Republican Party is Trump's party now President Trump continues to dominate news coverage and wields more influence in his party than anyone else \u2014 and Republicans running for office know it. Anyone who thought Republicans, fearing Trump's historically low approval ratings, would run away from this president were wrong \u2014 in primaries, anyway. That may change in the fall when some of these candidates need to tack to the middle, but, right now, they're with their president. Why? Because GOP voters approve of Trump at record levels. Several GOP candidates have hitched their wagons to Trump, sensing that's what their voters want, from candidates in Indiana who tried to out-Trump each other, to one in West Virginia who said he was \"Trumpier than Trump\" after the president told GOP voters to vote for anyone other than him. And speaking out against the president can present dangers. Look at Rep. Martha Roby in Alabama, who drew a crowded primary field because she criticized the president after the Access Hollywood tape came out before the 2016 election. That has meant a Republican Party that is increasingly fashioning itself a party of one. \"There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump Party,\" former House Speaker John Boehner said last week. \"The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\" One of the men vying to become the next House speaker, California GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy, told CNN that the party's evolution is a good thing. \"Well, I would think it's changed for the better,\" he said in response to Boehner's comment. McCarthy cited the country's relative peace and prosperity under Trump. And Trump has certainly benefited from that, as well. His approval rating, for example, has gone from 37 percent in December to almost 45 percent now, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. The question is whether that improvement will be enough for the Republican Party and its candidates, who are facing historical midterm challenges because so much of the enthusiasm is with the party out of power. 2. Democratic women are running and winning Speaking of that enthusiasm, in primary after primary so far, it's been Democratic women making a statement. So far, more than 40 percent of House Democratic nominees have been women, according to NBC News. A record number of women are running for the House and Senate in 2018. Overall, 417 women have filed to run. But nearly three times as many women have filed to run as Democrats than Republicans (310 to 107), according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. So far, 159 total women have appeared on primary ballots in these early contests. Of those, 80 percent (126) have been Democrats. Overall, 74 women have won primaries, and the lion's share (85 percent) have been Democratic women. Cut another way, half of the Democratic women running in primaries so far have won (63 out of 126), while a third of Republican women have won (11 of 33). So when people talk about the year of the woman, so far, it's been the year of the Democratic woman. 3. It hasn't been a good year to be a congressional Republican Only one incumbent has lost a primary so far. That was Republican Robert Pittenger, from North Carolina, who was upset by an underfunded Baptist minister. Democrats think that could open up the seat as a target in the general election. Other Republican congressional candidates have been denied job promotions. From West Virginia to Indiana to Idaho, that's been the case. Instead, what voters seem to value in Republican candidates is being an outsider businessman. Mike Braun captured that in Indiana, winning the GOP nomination for the Senate by running ads showing him walking around the state with cardboard cutouts of his similar-looking opponents, both of whom were congressmen. There have been a record number of retirements among House Republicans, and it's looking increasingly likely that the GOP House conference is moving even more toward the right-wing Freedom Caucus, as the Washington Post's Dave Weigel reports. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez hasn't quite figured out how to calm the restive Democratic base, but the left hasn't bitten the Democratic Party just yet.\n                \n                    \n                    George Frey/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez hasn't quite figured out how to calm the restive Democratic base, but the left hasn't bitten the Democratic Party just yet. 4. Democrats' intraparty fight hasn't amounted to much \u2014 yet As much as the Trump wing has flexed its muscle on the GOP side, the same can't be said for the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, at least not yet anyway. Progressives got a win in Nebraska, defeating a former congressman with a more liberal candidate, but that is looking more and more like an aberration rather than a trend. The left has had opportunities in Texas and Pennsylvania, for example, but those challenges fizzled. Progressives, however, believe they have pushed Democrats on the issues. For example, many Democratic candidates are now talking about Medicare-for-all and a $15 minimum wage. Are Democrats showing their pragmatic side, or have progressives just not hit their groove yet? After all, there's still plenty of irritation among them with the establishment wing of the party. Check out what happened when Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez endorsed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon of Sex and the City fame. Not everyone on the DNC leadership team was on board with the decision. \"The Democratic Party should not intervene in the primary process,\" DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison said in a statement after learning of Perez's endorsement. \"It is our role to be fair to all contestants and let the voters decide.\" The bottom line is: Democrats are unified, for the most part, against Trump. That may be enough to make gains in 2018, but a fight is coming on the direction of the party \u2014 whether it's in this year's midterms or in two years, in what's already shaping up to be a very crowded 2020 presidential field.",

            "article_content": "Ahead of his summit next week with North Korea's leader, President Trump meets with Japanese Prime Minister Abe. Meanwhile, Republican leaders in Congress grapple with a challenge on immigration.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: If all goes according to plan, history will happen in five days. That's when President Trump is expected to sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a face-to-face meeting. There is a lot at stake, including security for countries in the region, which is why Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is here in Washington today. He's meeting with President Trump at the White House, where he will make his case to protect Japan's interests in these negotiations. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: We should just remember here that when North Korea has launched test missiles in the past, sometimes those go over Japan. So this country has a particular interest in what's happening. LIASSON: They certainly do. They want to see a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, also. And Japan has been a big supporter of this campaign of maximum pressure - putting tough sanctions on North Korea. And they are concerned that Donald Trump is now backing off of that campaign without getting any concessions from North Korea. On Friday, President Trump said he doesn't even want to talk about maximum pressure. So Japan is concerned that the U.S. could make a deal that addresses U.S. security concerns but undercuts Japanese ones - for instance, getting rid of North Korea's long-range intercontinental missiles that they say could hit the U.S., but a deal that would allow them to keep the shorter-range missiles that could still be a threat to Japan. MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: And Japan also wants Donald Trump to bring up the issue of Japanese abductees when he talks to the North Korean leader. So overall, they're looking for a clarification. What is the Trump administration's strategy with North Korea? MARTIN: I mean, it's all fine and good for them to have a conversation. But does Abe actually have any real leverage over President Trump? I mean, is he likely to get what he wants? LIASSON: Well, that's a good question because he has spent a lot of time investing in a personal relationship with Donald Trump. He's met with him many times. Just in April, he met with him at Mar-a-Lago. They've golfed together. But you can't say he's gotten a whole lot from it yet. Even before Emmanuel Macron of France was trying to be buddies with Donald Trump, Abe was trying this strategy, but he couldn't even get an exemption for Japan on those steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump has put on U.S. allies. MARTIN: All right. Another political story to talk about with you this morning, Mara - immigration. We haven't talked about it in a long time, but it is moving. At least, there is some high-profile meetings happening today among House Republicans. What's going on? LIASSON: Yes. There's going to be a big meeting with all the House Republicans and the leadership. What they're trying to do is hammer out some kind of compromise on immigration. And the leadership's hand is being forced by a group of moderate Republicans aided by Democrats. They have signed something called a discharge petition. This is a mechanism that would allow them to bring an immigration measure to the floor over the objections of Republican leaders - kind of a bipartisan rank-and-file revolt. This is something that Paul Ryan does not want to happen. He talked about this yesterday, and here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: I feel good about the kind of conversations we're having. Our members are earnest and sincere in trying to understand each other's perspectives. We have a big swath of views within our conference on this issue, and I really do believe that there's a sweet spot here. LIASSON: It's hard to imagine what the sweet spot would be if there was a sweet spot on immigration. MARTIN: Right. Wouldn't you have found it? LIASSON: They would've found one by now. So what they're looking for is some kind of a solution to the DREAMers - to the DACA recipients - that would satisfy both moderate Republicans and conservative Freedom Caucus members. That seems hard to imagine. But even if they did find that, Mitch McConnell in the Senate said he doesn't want to bring anything to the floor that the president won't sign. And the last time the president weighed in on this, he issued demands for a bill that included steep cuts in the number of legal immigrants, and Democrats certainly won't vote for that. MARTIN: Do we know where the president is right now on the issue of immigration? I mean, is he motivated by it right now? LIASSON: Well, what's so interesting about this is you've got the president out on the campaign trail using immigration as a political weapon. He thinks it's a great issue for him in the elections, saying Democrats love illegal immigrants more than they like U.S. citizens. So he is using immigration as a real hard line. The politics of this cut in many different ways inside the Republican coalition. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson for us this morning. Thanks so much, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "The New York Times report says that at least two supervisors at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey were aware that two female employees were not in the country legally.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The New York Times report says that at least two supervisors at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey were aware that two female employees were not in the country legally. The Trump Organization employed immigrants in the country illegally at one of its New Jersey golf clubs, according to a lawyer representing one former and one current employee. Anibal Romero told NPR that his two clients worked using falsified papers at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey and that he knows of other employees continuing to work at the club without legal documentation. A report published Thursday in The New York Times first detailed the employment history of Romero's clients, two women who worked in close proximity to Trump both before and after he was elected president. The president has visited the Bedminster club more than 70 times since taking office. One of the women continues to live in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant. The other, who is from Costa Rica, has become a legal permanent resident since quitting her job at Bedminster. She worked at the property from 2010 to 2013 and told the Times she washed and ironed Trump's underwear, shirts and other personal effects. The report underscores a discrepancy between the president's harsh rhetoric against immigrants \u2014 both here illegally and legally \u2014 and the apparent hiring practices of his own company. Trump sent thousands of troops to America's border with Mexico ahead of the midterm elections, and there has recently been a spike in arrests there. It's estimated that nearly 8 million undocumented immigrants currently work in the United States. Although Trump's 2016 campaign refrain, \"America First,\" was intended in part to signal a commitment to American workers, the Trump Organization has hired both documented and undocumented foreign workers in the past. Undocumented Polish immigrants worked at the construction site of Donald Trump's iconic Trump Tower in New York City between 1979 and 1980. And the president's company has used H-2B visas to bring in employees for his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The New York Times report says that at least two supervisors at the Bedminster club were aware of the women's immigration status. A statement provided to NPR by the Trump Organization said: \"We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately.\" Romero told NPR that the woman still in the country illegally had positive impressions of Trump from his visits to the club before his election. In an interview with the Times, she recalled a $50 tip he gave her after he praised Guatemalans' work ethic, \"I told myself, 'God bless him.' I thought, he's a good person.\" But Romero told NPR that his client's supervisor became hostile after Trump took office. The lawyer also sent NPR a statement describing the allegations: [M]y clients and others were repeatedly subjected to abuse, called racial epithets and threatened with deportation. Ironically, the threats often came from the same supervisor who had employed them despite knowing their undocumented status and even provided them with forged documents. Undocumented immigrants regularly find themselves trapped in unfair or dangerous workplaces where complaining about their conditions or treatment would mean calling attention to their lack of legal status. Romero said that his undocumented client approached him earlier this year \u2014 after hearing he was representing the other employee \u2014 and explained she wanted to find a way to end her alleged physical and verbal abuse at the golf club. \"Enough is enough,\" Romero said she expressed to him back then. \"[I]t's time to come out of the shadows and let people understand that we work hard in America and we are not criminals, we are good people who work hard.\" As of Friday afternoon, he says she is still on the payroll of the Trump Organization but does not plan to return to work.",

            "article_content": "Ain't no party like a Ready 2 Vote party How do you engage high schoolers in the voting process? Start by having a dance battle to 'Kiki Do You Love Me' by Drake. Add carnival games, a photo booth and a mobile video game theater. Bring in artists with stencils, silkscreens and a sketched community mural ready to be painted by the students. Oh, and of course, voting booths. Three groups teamed up to throw the 'Ready 2 Vote' party on October 24 \u2014 the Los Angeles County Registrar, Los Angeles Unified School District (the second largest school district in the country,) and Power California. A total of 12 high schools from the East region of LAUSD were bussed out to Norwalk to get registered, fill out their first mock election ballot and vote early. A drumline was standing by, waiting for first time voters to slip their ballot into the box. Celebratory cheers would erupt from across the park, and the chants would change from, \"Go Vote!\" to \"You Voted!\" But not all of students at the Ready 2 Vote party will be voting come Tuesday. Many of the high schoolers there were undocumented or DACAmented students, who are not eligible. And while the students participating in the mock elections weren't met with the same excitement as those who were casting real ballots, their participation still served as an important symbol of political engagement. \"For young people, elections provide an entry way into having a voice on decisions that impact their daily lives,\" says Luis S\u00e1nchez. He is the co-executive director of Power California \u2014 a group that tries to get young people of color involved in voting. S\u00e1nchez says that in many ways, undocumented youth are leading political battles: \"Even if you are a young person that is 16-years-old or undocumented, you have the ability to organize 10 other young people to vote and shape the future.\" Citali Ruiz is one of those young people. She says that while parties and candidates may not view undocumented and DACAmented youth as a \"win now\" group, they are still a crucial part of the democratic process. Young people can register voters, attend city council meetings, call their representatives, and organize political rallies and protests \u2014 regardless of their citizenship status. Ruiz serves as a youth organizer with Power California in Orange County. She believes that undocumented and DACAmented youth are the ones that hold society accountable. \"The power that we have is that we are making ourselves be present and heard,\" she says. \"The people that say they are for us, like allies \u2014 we need to make sure that we are also pushing them to vote. That is our power \u2014 accountability of others.\" Engagement begins in the classroom For LAUSD, teaching students about civic engagement started long before the Ready 2 Vote party. In 2014, Governor Jerry Brown signed SB-113, a bill allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote. That bill prompted a surge of high school initiatives across California. On the local level, it inspired Brenda Barragan, a high school teacher in LA's East district, to start a complicated discussion. She asked her students, \"What makes someone a good or bad citizen?\" Barragan knows that there are students in her classroom who are undocumented, DACAmented or part of mixed-status families. Many of them think of citizenship as being related to birthplace, or obeying the law. And she says that this understanding has posed some difficulty when teaching about civic engagement. \"I think the biggest hurdle was trying to get them to see the gray instead of the black and white,\" Barragan says. So she has students discuss figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Chiune and Yukiko Sugihara \u2014 people who broke laws and disrupted the status quo while trying to improve their respective communities. Barragan says people like these challenge our definition of \"good\" and \"bad citizen.\" \"To me, being a citizen means being a global citizen,\" she says. \"We can't just think about our country; we have to think about the planet.\" Barragan now serves as the Magnet School Coordinator in charge of student engagement. Before that, she taught government and economics classes while supporting Student Learning Projects (SLP), an LAUSD graduation requirement. In both roles, she crafted a curriculum that would give students hands-on experience in exploring what it means to be a global citizen. Thanks in part to her work, all South East High School government teachers incorporate voter registration workshops, discussion of local and national elections, and mock elections in the classroom. And this year, LAUSD passed a resolution to broaden civic engagement outside of the classroom. At South East, students now have the option of completing 10 of their 40 required community service hours by registering eligible voters. Barragan says that on November 6, only the votes of U.S. citizens will be counted. But some of those voters will have been influenced by a canvasser, phone banker, friend or relative who is unable to cast their own ballot. \"Just because you can't vote, because of the laws that are made in this country thus far, doesn't mean that you can't make a difference,\" she says. Not a single story Being civically engaged as an undocumented or DACAmented youth doesn't always feel exciting or inspirational. Jazzany Discua, a senior at South East High School, says for her, it \"really sucks.\" Discua took part in the mock elections at the Ready 2 Vote party, and said she was excited as speakers galvanized the crowd of students to vote. Then, she remembered she couldn't. \"I was looking at all the propositions, and when the [Ready 2 Vote Party] host was talking I would say 'Oh yeah!' And then I realized, 'Oh wait, I can't vote.'\" Seo Yun Son empathizes with Discua. Son is an organizer at Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA) and a member of UPLIFT \u2014 an advocacy group run by undocumented Asian and Pacific Islander youth. She says there are challenges to being part of a political process that excludes undocumented people. Nationally, debates about immigration continue to flare up. President Trump's recent announcement that he is considering ending birthright citizenship has further intensified discussions about the status of undocumented and DACAmented youth in the country. \"It's incredibly difficult to speak out at this time,\" Son says. \"And I think it's also very taboo. I see that in the Asian Pacific Islander community, as well. [Being undocumented is] still not largely talked about, and within the mainstream media, the dominant narrative is about Latinx undocumented people. So I see a lot of that in my own community. And I think I was also detached from [the] civic engagement processes [from] just not knowing where to begin and also, out of my own frustration. I would just kind of tune it out. I just felt like I didn't have any power. But when I started working for [KIWA], I realized there [are] still many ways to get involved.\" And getting involved can mean different things to different people. For Discua, voter engagement did not go beyond the Ready 2 Vote party \u2014 but that doesn't mean she's staying quiet about other issues. At school, she chose to focus her Student Learning Project on climate change, because she is passionate about the environment, her community and animal rights. \"I really don't like when people can't be themselves because they feel ... threatened,\" Discua says. She says for her, that means supporting all movements that allow people to live freely.",

The caravan of migrants making its way across Mexico may be thousands of miles from Tennessee. But it's not far from voters' minds. \"That's one of my deepest concerns,\" said James Harrell of Shelbyville. \"We have no idea who these people are, what countries they're coming from.\" Early voting has already started in Tennessee, and turnout is high. There's a steady stream of voters at the county courthouse in Shelbyville, a small town about an hour south of Nashville that's seen a big influx of immigrants. And many voters here say illegal immigration is one of their biggest concerns. \"There have been people who have been hurt and killed because of illegal immigrants that have come into this country,\" said voter Dottie Mershon. Other voters told me they're worried that immigrants are taking benefits and jobs away from U.S. citizens. \"Our people are wanting jobs. Our citizens want jobs. And they're going to others,\" said Beth Campbell, the National Committeewoman for the Tennessee Republican Party. Tennessee has one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in the country and immigration has become wedge issue in the closely watched race for an open senate seat here. Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn is airing TV ads attacking her Democratic opponent Phil Bredesen, the former governor of Tennessee: \"Bredesen lured illegal immigrants hundreds of miles,\" the narrator says, \"by offering them driver's certificates.\" In fact, the state issued driver's certificates to undocumented immigrants years ago. Bredesen ended the practice after he took office. In recent years, Tennessee has passed some of the toughest anti-immigrant laws in the country. At a debate in Knoxville earlier this month, Bredesen insisted he's a border hawk \u2014 even if he doesn't agree with President Trump. \"I believe very strongly in controlling our borders,\" Bredesen said. \"But I think there are much better ways of doing it than building a wall. I think the wall is just sort of political theater.\" But Marsha Blackburn clearly sides with Trump. \"Let me tell you something: Tennesseans want to see that wall built. Because open border policies have made every town a border state. And every state a border state,\" she said. These are not new positions for Blackburn. She's been a longtime immigration hawk representing Tennessee in the house. Her critics say Blackburn and Trump are trying to exploit fears about immigrants, who are no more more likely to commit crimes than anyone else. \"Certainly, we think candidates like Trump saw what worked here in Tennessee, that you can make people think immigration is something to be feared, and you can win,\" said Stephanie Teatro, co-director of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, or TIRRC. Teatro thinks voters need to know that immigrants have helped to fuel Tennessee's economic growth. So her organization created a spin-off group called \"TIRRC Votes\" to train volunteers from across the state on how to get out of the vote. Many of those volunteers are recent immigrants, and can't vote. But Teatro says they're trying to mobilize allies who think President Trump's immigration crackdown is too harsh. She says they've turned out by the thousands to protest in the last two years. \"We're reminding them, if you were angry about family separations, if you came out and marched with us when Trump signed the Muslim ban, we need you to stand with us again,\" Teatro said. Several hundred volunteers gathered last weekend outside of Nashville. After the training session, volunteers fanned out across the city and its suburbs. Kayo Beshir found himself knocking on doors in Antioch, Tenn., a diverse, working-class neighborhood in southeastern Nashville. Beshir was born in Ethiopia, and joined his father in Tennessee when he was 13. They're both citizens now. But Beshir says he still has to explain the importance of voting to his father. \"Many of us come from countries where human rights are not respected,\" Beshir said. \"So votes don't matter. And very rigged elections. So too many of our parents don't understand the purpose of it.\" But Beshir thinks his own generation doesn't need any encouragement to the polls. They get it. \"That's why I feel hopeful is that our generation, our younger generation are gonna understand that,\" he said. \"And be the voice for our parents. And be the voice for the community that is being attacked.\" Beshir hopes the immigrant community can make the difference in a tight election. If not this year, maybe next time.",

Georgia has blocked approximately 53,000 voter registrations.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voters cast ballots during early voting last week in Atlanta. Georgia has blocked approximately 53,000 voter registrations. Since the 2010 elections, 24 states have implemented new restrictions on voting. Alabama now requires a photo ID to cast a ballot. Other states such as Ohio and Georgia have enacted \"use it or lose it\" laws, which strike voters from registration rolls if they have not participated in an election within a prescribed period of time. Mother Jones journalist Ari Berman, author of Give Us the Ballot, says that many of the restrictions are part of a broader Republican strategy to tighten access to the ballot \u2014 an effort that was bolstered in 2013 by the Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder ruling. \"[That] decision,\" Berman explains, \"said that those states with the longest histories of discrimination no longer had to approve their voting changes with the federal government.\" You're seeing a national effort by the Republican Party to try to restrict voting rights, and it's playing out in states all across the country. Ari Berman, author of 'Give Us the Ballot' As a result, Berman says, \"You're seeing a national effort by the Republican Party to try to restrict voting rights, and it's playing out in states all across the country.\" Many of the new voting restrictions are occurring in states like Georgia, North Dakota and Kansas, which have critical races in the 2018 midterms. Berman says that it's still unclear what the impact of the restrictions will be on the upcoming elections, but he remains hopeful that the tide might be shifting on voter restrictions. Berman points out that an amendment to Florida's 2018 ballot would restore voting rights to more than 1 million former felons who are currently disenfranchised in the state. \"The 2018 election could go in two different ways,\" he says. \"It could be tainted by voter suppression, or it could be remembered as an election in which voting rights were expanded for millions of people.\" On why he calls Georgia the \"epicenter of the voter suppression battle\" Georgia has closed 214 polling places in recent years. They have cut back on early voting. They have aggressively purged the voter rolls. Georgia has purged almost 10 percent of people from its voting rolls. One and a half million people have been purged from 2012 to 2016. ... There's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot. ... It was reported by the Associated Press that [gubernatorial candidate] Brian Kemp's office (the secretary of state's office) in Georgia was blocking 53,000 voter registrations in that state \u2014 70 percent from African-Americans, 80 percent from people of color. What was happening, as people were submitting voter registration applications, if their names on the voter registration forms didn't exactly match other state databases, these voters were sent a letter telling them that their applications were pending and they needed to provide more information to election officials. This was very confusing to people, because even though these pending voters could show up and vote at the polls with the correct ID \u2014 they couldn't vote by mail but they could vote at the polls \u2014 if you got a letter in the mail that said there was a problem with your registration, you probably would think that you weren't eligible to vote. So this set off widespread confusion. The fact that Brian Kemp, secretary of state, was running for office at the same time his office was doing this and that he was running against Stacey Abrams, who could be the first black woman governor in U.S. history, that really made this a huge national story. On the \"exact match\" system, whereby a name on voter rolls must be identical to the name in the state system This kind of exact-match system is known as \"disenfranchisement by typo\" because when you submit a voter registration form, if you have a hyphen missing on your name, if you have an apostrophe missing, if you use \"Tom\" on one form and \"Thomas\" on another, your form is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia. And what's interesting to me is that Georgia first tried to put this policy in place in 2009 when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the Voting Rights Act, and the federal government actually blocked this exact-match system from going into effect because they said it was discriminatory against minority voters, who are more likely to be flagged by this system. Then when Brian Kemp was elected, in 2010, he started doing this administratively. He was sued in 2016 by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a voting rights group, because 35,000 registrations were flagged as \"pending\" under the exact-match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flagged, and Kemp's office actually said he was going to stop doing this system. But what happened is the Georgia legislature basically reauthorized the law, gave voters more time to do this, and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was back into effect. On why people of color are disproportionately impacted by Georgia's \"exact match\" law [Voting rights lawyers] told me ... that basically the names of people who are African-American or Latino or Asian-American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers. So they might have names that don't match on the databases from one form to another, or election officials might actually enter the correct name incorrectly because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize the name. And so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections, and I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people of color are ending up on these pending registration lists. On how Kris Kobach, Kansas secretary of state, is an advocate for a question citizenship on the census \u2014 and how that affects voting rights It's a huge issue, because census data is used to draw voting districts. ... The way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population. So everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawing a district and deciding what level of representation an area should have. What Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts to only counting people who are citizens. If you did that, areas with lots of noncitizens \u2014 places such as Texas and New York and California \u2014 would have much less representation than places where there's a lot more citizens. And even though districts have always been drawn based on total population and not just citizenship, if Kobach has his way, districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship. What that will mean is that there will be a major power shift to Republicans, because, generally speaking, areas with lots of immigrants tend to vote Democratic. ... This question about U.S. citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since 1950. There's a tremendous fear that if it is asked, Latinos, Asian-Americans, other minorities \u2014 whether documented or undocumented \u2014 are going to be afraid to respond to the census, [and] that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seats, less money, less political representation than they otherwise would in a fair and accurate census. On why the census matters The census is basically the DNA for our democracy. It is the baseline for which so many things are done. The census determines how $675 billion is distributed to states and localities. The census determines how legislative districts are drawn. The census determines the composition of the Electoral College. So if this question about citizenship is added to the census, places like California and New York and Texas \u2014 which actually, funnily enough, is a red state \u2014 they could receive fewer members of Congress, they could have less influence in the Electoral College, they could have less money going to their states. And then places like Kansas, where there are fewer immigrants, where it's a lot whiter and more Republican, they're going to have more political power if this question about citizenship is added to the census like Kris Kobach wants. On voter suppression in North Dakota on Native American reservations The big voting issue in North Dakota is that that state has recently passed a new voter ID law that was upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this month, and what's alarming about that law is that the Republicans in North Dakota wrote it in such a way that for your ID to count, you have to have a current residential street address on your ID. The problem in North Dakota is that a lot of Native Americans live on rural tribal reservations, and they get their mail at the Post Office using P.O. boxes because their areas are too remote for the Post Office to deliver mail, [and] under this law, tribal IDs that list P.O. boxes won't be able to be used as a valid voter IDs. So now we're in a situation where 5,000 Native American voters might not be able to vote in the 2018 elections with their tribal ID cards. This is sending off a tremendous amount of alarm in the state, because normally we wouldn't be talking about North Dakota. But there is a competitive Senate race between the Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp, and the Republican, Kevin Cramer. Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the U.S. Senate in 2012 by 2,900 votes, and she got 80 percent of the vote on the two counties in the state with the largest Native American reservations. So there is a tremendous amount of fear in North Dakota that many Native Americans are not going to be able to vote in this state, and that's going to particularly hurt Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic incumbent. On a ballot initiative in Florida to restore voting rights to former felons Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex-felons from voting, meaning even after you've served your time, you've paid your debt to society, you have to wait five to seven years in Florida to appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board. One in 10 people in Florida \u2014 including one in five African-Americans in the state \u2014 can't vote because they have a felony conviction. So 10 percent of people in the most important swing state in the country ... aren't able to participate and aren't able to vote in 2018. Ari Berman This current governor, Rick Scott, in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody. You have a situation in Florida where 1.6 million ex-felons can't vote. That's a staggering number. What that means is that one in 10 people in Florida \u2014 including one in five African-Americans in the state \u2014 can't vote because they have a felony conviction. So 10 percent of people in the most important swing state in the country, that is routinely decided presidential elections, aren't able to participate and aren't able to vote in 2018. This ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to 1.4 million people in Florida. That would be the largest enfranchisement of new voters since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia, North Dakota, and Kansas and other states, Florida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the 1960s, and that's the good news that I hope doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news.

            "article_content": "Voting rights have become a central political issue in Georgia's gubernatorial election next month. The Democratic and Republican candidates have long sparred over how easy it should be to register and vote in the Peach State.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Voting rights are on the ballot this year, and nowhere is that more clear than in Georgia. Republican Brian Kemp hopes to be the state's next governor. Right now, though, he's in charge of running its elections. As reporter Emma Hurt of member station WABE reports, Kemp and his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, have a history of disagreement over voting rights. EMMA HURT, BYLINE: About 150 people gathered at the Georgia state Capitol last week to demand the resignation of Brian Kemp, Georgia's secretary of state. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Brian Kemp. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Must go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Brian Kemp. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Must go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Brian Kemp. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Must go. HURT: What has rallied people together - news that 53,000 Georgians who have applied to register to vote are on the, quote, \"pending list.\" Their applications did not exactly match information on file with other government databases down to punctuation errors. The Associated Press reports that nearly 70 percent of those on the list are African-American. These pending voters can still vote in this election with a state ID at the polls, and a similar policy has been upheld in federal court in Florida. But that doesn't make up for the conflict of interest according to Lydia Meredith, an Atlantan who was at the rally. LYDIA MEREDITH: It's a travesty that the secretary of state has not already resigned because he's a candidate in the election that he has the office of overseeing. HURT: Kemp's campaign spokesman, Ryan Mahoney, says the registration issue has been blown out of proportion. RYAN MAHONEY: This is a manufactured crisis by Stacey Abrams for Stacey Abrams. So calls for resignation or calls for anything from the left should be completely ignored because they're completely dishonest. And they're just trying to feign outrage to try to turn out their base to support. HURT: Exact match has been a policy of Kemp's office since 2010. Several civil rights groups challenged it in court in 2016, and parts of the policy were suspended. But in 2017, the Republican-controlled state Legislature made it a law. So some of the same groups sued Kemp again last week, arguing the law violates the Voting Rights Act. Danielle Lang with the Campaign Legal Center is one of their lawyers. DANIELLE LANG: This policy doesn't flag the right people and leads to an extraordinarily high error rate where tens of thousands of eligible voters are flagged for potential removal based on, you know, a hyphen here and a space there or a transposed digit. HURT: Brian Kemp's campaign blames, quote, \"sloppy work\" by a voter registration group called the New Georgia Project that Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams founded. That group is focused on minority and young voters. Kemp's office actually investigated the New Georgia Project for fraud back in 2014. The investigation was later dropped. Abrams told WABE earlier this month that as a state legislator, she has been fighting Kemp's office for removing inactive voters from the rolls and allowing counties to close polling places. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) STACEY ABRAMS: For me, the question of voting is about expanding the right. Unfortunately my opponent has made his mission as secretary of state restricting that right and eliminating access in ways that have really harmed the body politic. HURT: Kemp maintains his policies are protecting the integrity of Georgia's elections. He points to recent comments from Abrams, who said, quote, \"documented and undocumented people\" will be part of Georgia's, quote, \"blue wave.\" Kemp appeared on Fox News this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: I think hardworking Georgians should decide who their governor is, not people here illegally like my opponent wants. HURT: Abrams says Kemp is taking her issues out of context. But this issue is sure to fire up voters from both parties. A recent NPR-Marist poll found that 56 percent of Republicans consider voter fraud the biggest threat to this fall's elections. That's compared to 12 percent of Democrats.

            "article_content": "One candidate has embraced President Trump's get-tough approach. The other has rejected the administration's tactics and rhetoric.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Two hotly contested races in deep-red Kansas illustrate a broader Republican divide over immigration policy. One candidate has embraced President Trump's get-tough approach. The other has rejected the administration's harsher tactics and rhetoric. As Brian Grimmett with Kansas News Service reports, both approaches could have consequences at the polls. BRIAN GRIMMETT, BYLINE: At a recent campaign rally in Kansas, talking tough on immigration was clearly a crowd pleaser. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KRIS KOBACH: We've worked on a number of things, but the most important is stopping illegal immigration. (CHEERING) GRIMMETT: That's Kris Kobach, the Republican candidate for governor, standing next to President Trump. Kobach has made a career of stoking anti-immigrant sentiment. As secretary of state, he's pushed for new rules requiring that people show proof of citizenship before registering to vote. As a private attorney, he worked with cities across the country to help pass ordinances that make hiring or renting to undocumented immigrants unlawful. At the rally, Kobach warned that immigrants here illegally are a drain on the state's finances. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KOBACH: It's time to put Kansans first, not illegal aliens. (CHEERING) GRIMMETT: That sentiment plays well with Republicans in a state that Trump won by a wide margin. It also plays well in rural Kansas, where there's anxiety about immigrants taking jobs and bringing crime. But that rhetoric could hurt Kobach with voters in the growing suburbs of Kansas City. That's where Representative Kevin Yoder, another Republican, is taking a more moderate tone when it comes to immigration. He has been endorsed by Trump but didn't appear at the rally. In an interview with KCUR in Kansas City, Yoder says he supports Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and the border wall. But he's also willing to work across the aisle. KEVIN YODER: I also supported a Democratic plan that would make sure that DACA kids can't be deported. I also supported a Democratic plan that would ensure that we can't separate parents from their children. GRIMMETT: That approach may have won over some moderates, but it alienated those further to the right. Take conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham. She blasted Yoder for supporting a Democratic plan that would make it easier for migrants fleeing domestic abuse to get asylum in the United States. Yoder said he sympathized with the victims because his mother was a social worker. Here's her response on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW\") LAURA INGRAHAM: Your family history shouldn't be allowed to thwart the president's immigration agenda and, frankly, imperil the party's prospects in the midterms. GRIMMETT: Yoder eventually backed away from the Democratic plan. YODER: There have been clear concerns that this would allow millions of people, potentially, to make fraudulent claims. GRIMMETT: Yoder's district is increasingly home to wealthy, college-educated people, and it's skewing more democratic. Hillary Clinton narrowly won the district two years ago. University of Kansas political science professor Patrick Miller says Yoder is projecting a more centrist image to appeal to those changing demographics. PATRICK MILLER: You know, he really hasn't walked away from Trump's policies, yet he's attempted to say things or express concern over things, like children being detained, that might seem more sympathetic to what's really a swing district that he represents. GRIMMETT: In several recent polls, Yoder is trailing his challenger, Democrat Sharice Davids, and Kobach is in a dead heat with his Democratic rival, Laura Kelly. In Kansas, as in other parts of the country, it's unclear which strategy will work in the midterms, whether that's reaching out to moderates or ignoring them and relying on Trump's base.

Racist robocalls targeting Andrew Gillum, a black Democrat gubernatorial nominee in Florida, went to residents throughout the state recently in an apparent attempt to influence voting. The 39-year-old Tallahassee mayor and upset candidate is the first black nominee from a major party for Florida governor. The robocall message, obtained by NPR, is narrated by someone pretending to be Gillum. The narrator uses an exaggerated minstrel dialect \u2014 featuring phrases like \"We Negros\" \u2014 with jungle noises in the background. The calls end with a disclaimer that they were paid for by The Road to Power, a neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic podcast operated by Scott Rhodes of Idaho. In Florida, robocalls supporting or opposing non-federal candidates or ballot proposals need a financial disclaimer \u2014 as well as a registered agent in the state, which the Idaho-based calls may not be able to prove. The FCC also says that robocalls must \"state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call\" at the beginning of each message \u2014 rather than impersonate someone. The same group is linked to robocalls sent out last week that used the death of Mollie Tibbetts to promote white supremacist messages, according to the Iowa Starting Line. Tibbetts, a University of Iowa student, disappeared on a run in July. Her body was discovered more than a month later. The suspect in her killing is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. The Starting Line reports the call said, \"If after her life has now been brutally stolen from her, she could be brought back to life for just one moment and asked, 'What do you think now?' Mollie Tibbetts would say, 'Kill them all.' \" Tibbetts' father Rob Tibbetts wrote an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Saturday, decrying the right-wing punditry around his daughter's death. \"Do not appropriate Mollie's soul in advancing views she believed were profoundly racist,\" he wrote. The same podcast has also been linked to robocall campaigns in Charlottesville, Va., Oregon and California, according to Right Wing Watch. The Tallahassee Democrat reports that calls have previously used \"the local area code and prefix followed by a four-digit number associated with neo-Nazi rhetoric.\" Over a billion robocalls head to landlines and cellphones every month, reports Planet Money. Many of them appear to be from a line that has the recipient's same area code \u2014 but are really scammers or spammers \"spoofing\" their real number using the Internet. Experts tell NPR that it costs around 1 to 5 cents per call. Last week, GOP Florida gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis was criticized for comments some said amounted to racist dog whistling. \"Let's build off the success of Gov. Scott. The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda,\" DeSantis said. A spokesperson for the candidate later said the comments were not racially charged. Gillum told CNN he \"will continue to focus solely on the issues that Floridians care about and uniting our state.\" A spokesperson for DeSantis said the calls were \"absolutely appalling and disgusting.\" \"What I don't want the race to turn into is a race of name calling,\" Gillum  continued. \"I want to make sure that we don't racialize and, frankly, weaponize race as a part of the process, which is why I have called on my opponent to really work to rise above some of these things.\"",

The Trump era has already produced many moments of unprecedented strangeness, but perhaps none to match his triumphal visit to West Virginia just hours after two of his key associates were found guilty or pleaded guilty on a total 16 federal counts in two separate proceedings in two courts. As President Trump enthralled a rally crowd for more than an hour on Fox News Tuesday night, a click to another channel revealed endless tape loops of Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen leaving courthouses. As the world now knows, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight counts of tax and bank fraud by a federal jury in Virginia. Yet, hard as it is to believe, that was not the worst story for the president in the news on Tuesday. In the same hour, in a federal courtroom in New York City, Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal attorney and fixer, pleaded guilty to eight counts that included campaign finance violations among other crimes. Cohen also told the court some of his actions were taken at the direction of then-candidate Trump in 2016. And, as if to round out the day, a federal grand jury in San Diego indicted a veteran congressman and his wife for misuse of $250,000 in campaign funds. That congressman, Duncan Hunter Jr., had been the second House Republican to back Trump for president. The first, Chris Collins, was indicted in New York earlier this month for insider trading. As the most important midterm elections in recent memory take shape over the next 11 weeks, Democrats will run this fall against the corruption allegedly rampant in the ruling party \u2014 what their House leader Nancy Pelosi has called \"brazen corruption, cronyism and incompetence.\" That worked well for them the last time they displaced Republican majorities in Congress, in 2006, when the GOP was burdened with lobbying scandals and a whiff of sexual misconduct involving a House member and underage congressional pages. But if the Democrats plan to run against Manafort, Cohen, Collins and Hunter, the Republicans are just as determined to run against Cristhian Behana Rivera. That is the name of the undocumented immigrant arrested in the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, a student at the University of Iowa. Rivera's immigration is in dispute \u2014 with law enforcement authorities and the Trump administration contending he is undocumented and his lawyer saying in court documents that he is working in the state legally, according to the Des Moines Register. How important is the Tibbetts story to the Republican playbook? For starters, it was the lead story on Fox News on Tuesday evening \u2014 reported ahead of the Manafort and Cohen developments. Trump highlighted the Tibbetts story when he talked about illegal immigration in West Virginia Tuesday night. He used it to characterize the platform of the Democrats. The crowd chanted \"Build that wall!\" And when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders came to the lectern on Wednesday she wasted little time getting to the Tibbetts case, tossing in a biblical reference to add gravity. And the Trump Train twitter account sent out a picture of Tibbetts labeled: \"Thanks to the Democrats.\" So as the summer winds down and the fall campaigns gear up, it appears both parties plan a strategy of criminalizing the opposition and calling on the faithful to cleanse the nation's capital. One reason both parties reach so readily for accusations of criminality may be that neither party is confident enough in the rest of its arsenal. Republicans had thought they could win this year on the tax cuts they passed last winter. Those deep cuts were supposed to fuel the economy and make \"the forgotten man and the forgotten woman\" see real gains in disposable income. But polling data suggest the cuts, while are a gold mine for many high-income categories, have not made as much difference for average workers. Or, at least, they have not yet convinced many of those workers that they're doing that much better. The president and his party had also thought \u2014 and continue to maintain \u2014 that the overall robustness of the economy should rub off on Republican candidates. Indeed, the current numbers \u2014 historically high growth and low unemployment \u2014 are classic political assets. But the problem seems to be that, again, the uneven distribution of the benefits remains a political hurdle. Those benefiting most from the record highs in financial markets are those who were not hurting in the first place. Where jobs have been returning and/or wages rising, Republicans have a case to make. But in those places where jobs are still scarce and real income remains far below the levels of a generation ago, the political payoff may be limited. A third disappointment in this regard is the emergent effect of tariffs on sectors of the economy. Some farmers are losing global sales, while users of steel and aluminum are feeling the pinch of higher costs due to higher duties imposed on their raw materials. The pain may prove worthwhile in the long run, but the midterms are in roughly 11 weeks. Meanwhile, the combination of lower tax revenues (primarily from corporate taxes) and higher federal spending has driven the annual budget deficit back to the trillion-dollar-a-year level briefly touched in the depths of the recent \"Great Recession.\" So, perhaps we should not be entirely surprised that the strong economy has fallen short of being a magic wand in political terms. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks with reporters during her weekly press conference at the Capitol on July 12, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Edelman/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks with reporters during her weekly press conference at the Capitol on July 12, 2018, in Washington, D.C. Democrats for their part had expected the usual effects of midterm swing to carry them back to power this November. After all, since World War II, every U.S. president but one has seen his party lose House seats in his first midterm election (the exception was George W. Bush in 2002, right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks). Barack Obama lost more than 60 in his first midterm. The average House seat loss for all presidents in midterms since polling began is 36 when presidential approval is below 50 percent. The Gallup Poll done last week had Trump at 42 percent. And Republicans have seen more than 40 of their incumbents retire or run for other offices this year, including Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairs of eight committees. But as it turns out, those historic guidelines \u2014 like so many other norms these days \u2014 may be less applicable in the Trump era. For one thing, the usual arc of the partisan pendulum could be altered by the party-friendly district maps drawn by Republican legislatures and governors earlier in the decade. Both parties have always use gerrymandered districts to protect incumbents and press their Election Day advantage. But computers and sophisticated software have made that process far more efficient and effective. Moreover, the voters who turn out in midterms (as well as in presidential years) tend to be older, male, more affluent and less diverse. That fits the profile of voters who tend to favor Republican candidates (and who approve of the president). Whatever these voters may think of Trump personally, they will vote to protect him and his program because they believe they are protecting themselves. That means whatever momentum Democrats think they have, they will be met by voters who may be equally determined. The minority party will need to build not just a fire but a major conflagration under its own voters to generate the results they want. It must also be said that while Congress is not popular (approval rating at 12 percent in a recent tracking poll by YouGov and The Economist magazine) its problems are not seen as exclusively Republican. And the majority party is just as willing as the minority to take the fight to the opposition on immigration and abortion and other issues with high emotional impact. So while Democrats thought the GOP would be hunkered down for a pounding this year, the Republican sense of reality is quite different. Perhaps this too should not be surprising. The divisions in America, promoted by partisan cable news and social media, have rarely seemed so visible and visceral. And they are all the more difficult to address when embodied by a single political personality who seems to thrive on them.",

            "article_content": "Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke is firing up Democrats as he challenges GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's re-election bid. O'Rourke is staking out progressive positions instead of tacking to the middle in the deep red state.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now let's take a look at a U.S. Senate race, this one in Texas. El Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, is running against the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. O'Rourke has fired up liberals by running on a platform of clear, progressive positions. The question is whether that can get him elected in a state as Republican as Texas. From San Antonio, NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: If you arrived at Beto O'Rourke's town hall meeting 40 minutes ahead of time, you were out of luck - all 650 seats already taken. (APPLAUSE) GOODWYN: So when O'Rourke takes the stage, first thing he does is express his sympathy for those who can hear him but can't see him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BETO O'ROURKE: So let's make a lot of noise so the folks in the overflow room know that we're here, that we care about them. We're going to say San Antonio on three - one, two, three. San Antonio. Yeah, I think I heard them. GOODWYN: Texas Democrats who've been wandering in the electoral wilderness for decades have been showing up in droves. Beto O'Rourke is an unapologetic, unabashed liberal. So how can it be that two recent polls have him just two and six points behind Republican Senator Ted Cruz? This is Texas, after all, where the last great Democratic hope, state Senator Wendy Davis, got walloped by 20 points by Republican Governor Greg Abbott. Former Texas agricultural commissioner and Democratic populist Jim Hightower explains why O'Rourke's campaign seems to be different. JIM HIGHTOWER: You've got a Democratic constituency that are fed up not just with Trump but with the centrist, mealy-mouthed, knew-nothing Democratic establishment. And they're looking for some real change. And Beto is representing that. GOODWYN: Universal health care, assault weapons ban, abortion rights, raise the minimum wage - O'Rourke even raised the specter of impeachment after President Trump's Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin, although O'Rourke has since walked back that position. His opponent Ted Cruz is taking O'Rourke's candidacy very seriously. TED CRUZ: I think the decision he's made is run hard left and find every liberal in the state of Texas and energize them enough that they show up and vote. And I think he's gambling on there are enough people on the left for whom defeating and destroying Donald Trump is their No. 1 issue that he's hoping that's his path to victory. I don't see that in the state of Texas. There are a whole lot more conservatives than liberals. GOODWYN: When it comes to the critical issue of immigration, the two Texas candidates for Senate couldn't be further apart. Last week in Temple, Texas, Cruz indicated he supports ending birthright citizenship, telling the crowd, quote, \"it doesn't make a lot of sense.\" O'Rourke, on the other hand, is against building a wall along the border and favors a gradual path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. At a cafe in San Antonio where he's come for an interview, O'Rourke can't make it to the table because he's mobbed by customers who recognize him and want a picture together. Much to the reporter's annoyance, O'Rourke chats every one of them up, which takes quite a while. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: There we go (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Thank you so much. So nice meeting you. O'ROURKE: Thank you for saying hello, and best of luck. GOODWYN: Once he finally gets to the table, O'Rourke gets down to business. O'ROURKE: I think that this state, the most diverse state in the country, should lead on immigration. Free DREAMers from the fear of deportation, but make them citizens today so that they can contribute to their full potential. That is not a partisan value. That's our Texan identity. And we should lead with it. GOODWYN: O'Rourke seems to have no fear of sounding too progressive for Texas. He borrows an old line from Jim Hightower as way of explanation. O'ROURKE: The only thing that you're going to find in the middle of the road are yellow lines and dead armadillos. You have to tell the people that you want to serve what it is you believe and what you are going to do on their behalf. GOODWYN: Congressman Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz have agreed to hold five televised debates. Despite their political differences, both are whip smart, extremely articulate and completely unafraid. It promises to be quite a show. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, San Antonio.

            "article_content": "Immigrant rights advocates pitched their tents for an encampment outside the ICE offices in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday. The new liberal rallying cry raises more questions than it answered.\n                \n                    \n                    Frederic. J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Immigrant rights advocates pitched their tents for an encampment outside the ICE offices in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday. The new liberal rallying cry raises more questions than it answered. A new liberal rallying cry \u2014 \"Abolish ICE!\" \u2014 calls for an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that enforces President Trump's immigration policies. Many protesters held signs with the slogan at marches across the country over the weekend, and several leading Democrats echoed the grass-roots catchphrase. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the insurgent Democratic Socialist who won a stunning primary upset in New York last week, ran on this issue. And Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand \u2014 both considered possible 2020 presidential contenders \u2014 also took up the call. The new slogan, though, raises more political questions than it answers. What does \"Abolish ICE\" as a motto mean, anyway? \"Abolish ICE\" sounds simple and straightforward. It's short enough to fit on a bumper sticker \u2014 as does \"Build the Wall,\" or \"Abolish the IRS.\" It symbolizes Democrats' opposition to Trump's immigration policies, particularly the separation of children and parents at the border. It's a shorthand way to remind lawmakers and the public that Democrats don't like how the president has demonized immigrants \u2014 whether they entered the U.S. legally or not. It also expresses the fear and outrage among immigrant communities who feel that ICE is terrorizing their neighborhoods. If it's a useful slogan for Democrats, why are Republicans thrilled? Democrats who use the phrase say it doesn't mean they want no enforcement at the border at all. But Republicans are making a big push to convince voters that's exactly what Democrats do mean when they call for abolishing ICE. When we have an \u201cinfestation\u201d of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov. Over the weekend and into this week, Trump tweeted about it repeatedly, saying Democrats want to get rid of ICE so they can have open borders and more crime. He tweeted Tuesday, \"When we have an \"infestation\" of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.\" This is the president's No. 1 message for the midterms: Republicans are tough on the border and strong on crime, and Democrats are weak and will let hordes of immigrants come in illegally and \"infest\" our country. In an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, Trump said he was thrilled that some Democrats were adopting this new rallying cry and signaled he would use it against them as often as possible. \"I think they'll never win another election so I'm actually quite happy with it,\" he said. Why are Democrats divided about abolishing ICE? Until this past weekend, immigration was largely a political problem for Republicans. The GOP was badly divided over Trump's policy to end deportation protection for DREAMers \u2014 immigrants in the country illegally who were brought to the U.S. when they were children \u2014 and his now-reversed practice of separating children from their parents at the border. The majority of the country sides with Democrats on immigration in general. A Pew Research Center poll from June showed that Democrats had a 14-point advantage in handling immigration \u2014 and that was before the family separation issue exploded. A recent Gallup poll showed that 75 percent of Americans thought immigration was a good thing for the country. A majority of voters have consistently supported giving DREAMers a path to citizenship. Many Democrats think that turning the debate away from Trump's immigration policies and back to a fight over which party is stronger on border security is a loser for Democrats. It's why so many Democratic lawmakers refuse to jump on the \"Abolish ICE\" bandwagon. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dodged the question, saying only that he wanted to \"create policies that deal with immigration in a rational way.\" Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said abolishing ICE wouldn't accomplish anything, since even without the agency, Trump would still be setting immigration policy. Although Warren and Gillibrand sided with the \"Abolish ICE\" push, California Sen. Kamala Harris, another possible 2020 contender, did not. Harris said she wanted to \"critically re-examine ICE and its role.\" Many Democratic strategists were asking why \u2014 just when the Democrats were winning the immigration debate \u2014 they should adopt a slogan that could backfire on them going into the midterm elections. Is the debate over ICE's existence worth having? Yes. ICE is a massive law enforcement agency, created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It employs more than 20,000 people. It's responsible for homeland security investigations and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Last week The Texas Observer reported that 19 special agents in charge at ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen calling for the agency to be reorganized. The agents reportedly said that ICE is supposed to track down drug cartel leaders, child pornographers and human traffickers, but instead, the letter said, agents are spending time and resources going after undocumented immigrants, and the agency is becoming a \"political pawn.\" The letter calls for splitting the agency in two \u2014 one part for homeland security, the other for deportations. It's hard to imagine such a proposal would go anywhere, however, in a political atmosphere in which immigration issues get oversimplified and weaponized.",

On Monday the right-wing party passed legislation banning aid organizations and individuals from helping asylum-seekers. Hungary's parliament passed a series of laws on Wednesday criminalizing the act of aiding undocumented immigrants seeking asylum in the country, despite strong objections from leading European rights bodies. The suite of bills, called \"Stop Soros,\" allow the government to imprison individuals and nongovernmental organizations for up to a year if they're deemed to be facilitating what it says is illegal immigration by people not entitled to protections, the BBC reported. A separate amendment to the constitution declared that an \"alien population\" can not be settled in Hungary. The latter is in direct defiance of the EU's migrant relocation plan that would spread more than 150,000 Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean asylum seekers among member countries \u2014 a quota policy Hungary has been fighting since it was first rolled out. \"The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it,\" Interior Minister Sandor Pinter wrote according to The Guardian. Pinter added: \"The Stop Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organization of illegal immigration a criminal offence. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants.\" Human rights organizations condemned the legislative package as xenophobic and an attempt to silence dissent and to control Hungarian civil society. \"Criminalizing essential and legitimate human rights work is a brazen attack on people seeking safe haven from persecution and those who carry out admirable work to help them. It is a new low point in an intensifying crackdown on civil society and it is something we will resist every step of the way,\" Amnesty International's Europe Director, Gauri van Gulik, said in a statement. He noted it as a \"bitter irony\" that the vote, which passed 160 to 18, was cast on World Refugee Day. On Monday the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe urged the Hungarian government to hold off on the vote until Friday, when it was expected to publish its opinion on the bills. Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n won re-election in a landslide in April, campaigning on a fiercely nationalist and anti-immigrant platform. Much of his rhetoric specifically involved attacks on Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, for whom the nativist legislation was named. The right-wing leader and his Fidesz party have demonized Soros for allegedly instigating mass immigration to the country, specifically Muslim immigration. In a speech delivered last November, Orb\u00e1n claimed Soros' goal is to \"sweep away governments which represent national interests.\" As a result of mounting pressure from Orb\u00e1n's government, Soros' pro-democracy Open Society Foundations moved from Hungary to Germany last month, citing \"an increasingly repressive political and legal environment.\" As NPR reported, rights advocates expect \"those who will pay the price are many of the 55,000 NGOs registered in Hungary.\"",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., departs after taking questions from reporters about a closed-door GOP meeting on immigration Thursday. Updated at 12:23 p.m. ET House Republicans huddled for hours Thursday morning in another attempt to find party unity on an issue that divides the GOP like no other: immigration. The meeting concluded with little tangible progress toward a final bill, but Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters there was agreement within the House GOP that they would continue to work on a bill that addressed \"four pillars\" of immigration policy outlined earlier this year by the White House. Ryan said that is \"the most optimistic, plausible chance of getting [a bill] into law.\" The four pillars include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, commonly known as DREAMers; border security; ending the diversity visa program; and putting new restrictions on laws regarding family-based legal immigration. \"What we've all agreed is the four pillars is a really good point to rally around,\" Ryan said. Legislation to that end failed to pass the Senate earlier this year, so it's unclear how the House strategy would result in a bill that could become a law. \"We don't spend our time thinking about votes in the Senate,\" Ryan said, when asked about such a bill's long-term prospects in Congress. In recent weeks, uprisings from the party's conservative and moderate wings forced Republican leaders led by Ryan to agree to turn the floor over to an immigration debate the third week of June, but what the House will vote on remains a mystery. The party is divided over two very different approaches to immigration. Conservatives have been agitating for months for a vote on hard-line immigration legislation authored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. GOP leaders never brought the bill up for a vote because they say it doesn't have the support to pass the House. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said his group of conservatives wants to ensure the House votes on something similar to the Goodlatte bill that adheres to the White House framework. \"What I envision the leadership doing is taking all of the feedback and crafting something,\" Meadows told reporters after the meeting. \"What it comes down to is the citizenship question and how you deal with that.\" At the same time, frustrated moderate Republicans \u2014 many of whom represent the battleground districts that will determine control of the House this November \u2014 began working with Democrats last month on a discharge petition to force a vote on the floor. A discharge petition is a legislative act of rebellion that can overrule party leaders by forcing House votes on a bill if 218 lawmakers sign the petition. The measure is rarely successful because it requires at least some members of the majority party to rebel against their own leaders. GOP leaders strongly oppose the discharge petition, but signatures keep getting added to it. As of Thursday morning, supporters were just three votes shy of the 218 they need. Ryan said he was confident Thursday's meeting put the brakes on the petition effort as Republicans work toward legislative compromise. He said Republicans are working to \"exhaust possibilities\" to avoid a discharge petition, but he did not rule out that it could still happen. \"Obviously, time is of the essence,\" he said. Retiring Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, has not signed the petition, but he warned that the effort to gather signatures is on a fast track, a process that will only speed up if leadership fails to produce a bill. \"If we don't agree pretty quickly you'll get two or three more signatures on the discharge petition and one of those four bills will go to the Senate and it will probably be one of the more liberal bills,\" Barton told reporters. \"I would vote for that because I think some solution is better than no solution. But I'm one of 20 or 30 Republicans who would.\" A moderate solution could pass only if a majority of Democrats signed on to the bill. That could potentially pass the Senate, but only if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., agrees to allow it to come up for a vote. And that will  happen only if Trump gives a clear signal that he will sign whatever the Senate passes. It is a complex bind that makes it highly unlikely that any immigration bill will become law as the result of these negotiations. But many supporters of the moderate bill say the emphasis on a hard-line partisan immigration solution is shortsighted. \"Things that become law and stay law are bipartisan,\" Barton said. \"It's one thing to get a partisan bill through the House and maybe even get it through the Senate and maybe even get the president to sign it. But if it isn't bipartisan then you have another Obamacare debacle.\" Last month, conservatives voted down a farm bill they support on the floor as a leverage play on immigration to counter the moderates' discharge petition strategy. The farm bill now can't pass until the immigration debate is resolved. Adding to the internal drama is the pressure on party leaders to negotiate a way out of this dispute that doesn't prompt a further rebellion in the ranks. Ryan, who is not running for re-election, has been dogged by speculation since his announcement that he might need to resign early. He wants to remain speaker through the remainder of this Congress. His top two deputies, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., are angling for leadership promotions in the next Congress. How the trio navigates this immigration debate is being closely watched for what it could mean for their own political futures. When asked if his lame-duck status has made it harder to negotiate with his rank and file, Ryan said no. \"I don't think that's it at all,\" he said, adding that immigration is a \"difficult issue\" for his party and they are working to find the \"sweet spot.\"",

            "article_content": "A dozen states have moved or are moving to automatic voting registration.\n                \n                    \n                    Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A dozen states have moved or are moving to automatic voting registration. Political brawls over voting laws have consumed states across the country for the past decade. But below the surface, a movement to automatically register eligible voters to vote is rapidly gaining traction. By next year, more than a quarter of all Americans will live in states where they no longer have to fill out registration forms in order to cast a ballot. The latest state to implement automatic voter registration is California, which had been scheduled to start on Monday although it's been delayed while officials conduct more testing. Everyone who meets the legal requirements to vote in California will be automatically registered when they update their driver's license or state ID at the Department of Motor Vehicles, a move that election officials expect will help move some of the more than 6 million eligible, but unregistered, residents onto the state's voter rolls. While California is the largest and most populous state in the country to adopt automatic voter registration (known as AVR), a dozen states and the District of Columbia have also taken it up since 2015, according to a review by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. Just this month, lawmakers in Maryland and New Jersey approved AVR and Massachusetts could soon join the list with more than a dozen additional states considering the shift. In Nevada, the issue is on the ballot in this November's election. Loading... \"I think that it's a simple, common sense approach,\" said Natalie Tennant, who is a former West Virginia secretary of state and now affiliated with the Brennan Center. While she was in office, West Virginia became the third state in the country to pass automatic voter registration. While many voting rights laws have sparked controversy over the last decade, this voting policy is seen by many as bipartisan \u2014 a mechanism that modernizes the voting system and saves taxpayer dollars. In Georgia, for example, the switch was approved administratively by the Department of Driver Services in 2016 during Secretary of State Brian Kemp's time in office. Kemp, a Republican, is now running for governor. In California, eligible applicants who complete a driver's license, ID card or change of address transaction with the DMV will be automatically registered to vote unless they choose to opt out. The current voter registration system requires residents to fill out a separate form. In some states that register voters automatically, state agencies, such as the health insurance exchange or social service agencies, will also add previously unregistered voters to the rolls. One argument proponents make is that automated registration streamlines voter registration, reducing the number of paper forms required and the amount of government staff time needed. \"We want efficiency in our government and this is certainly a way to get it,\" said Tennant. To assuage Republican fears about voter fraud, supporters of AVR also argue the system makes voter rolls more accurate and up-to-date, reducing the chance that ineligible voters can cast a ballot. Still, opponents have raised concerns people who are legally ineligible to vote could be registered under AVR. Election officials say there are steps in place to protect against that. California, for example, allows undocumented residents to get driver's licenses \u2014 state officials announced earlier this month that more than a million such cards have been issued since the law went into effect in 2015. But undocumented residents will be ineligible to register to vote and state law prohibits California's DMV from submitting their information to the secretary of state's office. The new application includes a series of eligibility questions that ask whether an applicant is a U.S. citizen, a resident of California, at least 18 years old, not currently in state or federal prison or on parole for a felony conviction, and whether he or she has been found mentally incompetent to vote by a court. Voter registration data received from the DMV is also checked against existing records in California's statewide voter registration database, according to Sam Mahood, press secretary for California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla. The shift to automatic voter registration could bring millions of new voters into the political process. In California, as many as 2 million additional voters could be registered ahead of the 2020 election, according to estimates by Paul Mitchell, the vice president of the bipartisan data vendor Political Data. The latest registration report in California shows there are 18,980,481 registered voters in the state as of early January. \"Overall this should have a rather significant increase in voter registrations. Whether that correlates to turnout is a different question,\" Mitchell said. Mitchell points out registering to vote doesn't guarantee people will take time to vote, but says it does remove an administrative hurdle. In Oregon, the first state to pass automated voter registration back in 2015, there have been some early signs that the change may be increasing turnout. About 100,000 voters who were registered through the new system showed up to vote in 2016. The state saw a 4 percent increase in voter turnout from 2012 to 2016.",

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is expected to announce his challenge to Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on Monday. Updated 11:19 a.m. ET Florida Gov. Rick Scott is jumping into the Senate race in Florida, challenging an incumbent Democrat and setting up what could be the most expensive Senate race in the country. Scott touted his jobs record as governor and vowed to bring that model to Washington. He also vowed to fight for term limits, saying that the culture in Washington can't be changed unless the people are. \"Some say as governor, I have never fit in or played by the political rules in Tallahassee,\" Scott says in an announcement video. \"Well, that's true. I never planned to fit in. And I won't fit in in Washington either. It's time to shake that place up. We don't need another politician in Washington. It's full of politicians, and that's why it's broken.\" Scott's entry into the Senate race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson gives the GOP a top-flight recruit with deep pockets in an expensive state, shifting the battlefield map for 2018. Scott is banking on a jobs and outsider message to help propel him to the Senate and help Republicans hold onto control of it. Even if Democrat Bill Nelson is able to win reelection, however, it will divert lots of Democratic resources to the state to hold onto it. The pro-Democratic opposition research group, American Bridge, didn't hold back in its criticism of Scott. ICYMI, this guy is announcing for U.S. Senate today: Rick Scott. For 7+ years as governor he's pillaged Florida on behalf of his wealthy friends.Meanwhile, his own net worth went up $46 million as governor. Any theories? -JHK #flsen Republicans are daring Democrats to try and pour resources in to help Nelson \u2014 something that would take funds away from the other nine incumbents running in states President Trump won. In fact, the ads started in this race in December -- before Scott even got in. Throughout his two terms in office, Scott has been a divisive figure \u2014 but one that even some Democrats admit they may have underestimated at times. Still, they argue the wealthy former health care executive has benefited from conservative headwinds in his past elections that may not be there in 2018 with a possible blue wave forming. At dawn of the Tea Party, Scott emerges onto the political stage Few people in Florida had heard of Scott in 2010 when he announced he was beginning his political career with a run for the state's top office. He ended up spending more than $70 million of his own money on a campaign that came at precisely the right time. Florida and the nation were recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression and looking for change. It was also the dawn of the insurgent Tea Party movement, which embraced Scott as one of its own. After taking office, Scott announced plans to cut $5 billion out of the state budget. However, the event wasn't held in the state capital of Tallahassee but in front of a crowd of Tea Party supporters in Eustis instead. To cheers and applause, Scott proclaimed, \"It's a budget that's designed to reduce state spending, lower taxes and hold your government accountable. This is the budget you asked for.\" In his first year, Scott oversaw big cuts in spending on education, healthcare and the environment. He took aim at government regulations, eliminating an agency that oversaw development statewide \u2014 something that was all done with one purpose in mind. \"His thing was jobs, which he's been so consistent about almost to be one dimensional in the last eight years. Tax cuts for business to create jobs,\" said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida Republican political strategist. And no matter what the question was, Stipanovich said Scott always had the same answer: \"What time is it? Time to create jobs.\" Florida's economy, like that of the nation, rebounded during Scott's time in office. However, Democrats point out that real median incomes have declined during that period while the cost of living has risen. Scott's political evolution: hardline conservative to a sometimes compromiser Scott took office as a conservative, with tough positions on many issues, urging for example a crackdown on immigration. In a state where a fifth of the population is foreign-born, he quickly retreated from that. In 2014, he signed a bill allowing undocumented immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition at Florida colleges. After slashing education spending, he later worked to raise teacher salaries. Scott opposed expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but then reversed himself \u2014 not once but twice. Now once again, he opposes it. Although Scott still questions whether there's a connection between people and climate change, he's moderated on some other environmental issues. After first supporting it, he now opposes any drilling for oil or gas off the Florida coasts. Brian Ballard, a lobbyist and fundraiser with close ties to Scott, says as he's gained experience in office, the governor's positions on many issues have evolved. Ballard says Scott is \"a combination of an insurgent mentality but someone who understands now how government operates, what it means to compromise, to make important principles become governing policy.\" Response to hurricanes, other disasters scrutinized Over the last year, Florida has been hit by a series of events that have tested Scott and his administration's ability to respond to crises. They included Hurricane Maria, which brought more than 200,000 Puerto Ricans to Florida, and Hurricane Irma, which endangered almost the entire state. In Irma, the state's response was marred by 14 deaths at a nursing home in Hollywood Hills where the air conditioning failed. Scott blamed the nursing home for the deaths, which he says should have evacuated residents when conditions worsened. But before the storm, Scott had given his personal cell phone to nursing home operators, telling them to call him with any problems. But the facility made three calls to the governor, all of which were unanswered, before finally evacuating residents. A similar pattern emerged after the collapse of a pedestrian bridge at Miami's Florida International University in March in which six people died. In a news conference, Scott said, \"It's not an FDOT [Florida Department of Transportation] project. It's an FIU project.\" Afterwards, documents emerged showing the state helped choose the firm that oversaw construction and that FDOT had a responsibility to make sure the bridge was built safely. But one crisis were Scott did receive plaudits was his response after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland this past February. At a news conference near the school, Scott pledged action \u2014 and he delivered. Working with Republican leaders in the legislature, a few weeks later Scott was able to sign a bill that imposed a three-day waiting period and raised the age to 21 for all gun sales in Florida. It was the first gun control legislation passed in the state in more than two decades, and the National Rifle Association immediately filed a lawsuit to block the new law. For Scott, it was a major achievement that put him at odds with many in his party. But some Democrats said said it didn't erase his past policy positions. \"I think you've got to look at eight years though,\" argued Dan Gelber, a former Democratic leader in the legislature who's now mayor of Miami Beach. \"All of these Republican officials, including the Governor, have been very beholden to the NRA. They've given them an outsized influence over our state. They've allowed them to create a gun culture and culture of violence.\" Scott's advantages and disadvantages against Nelson Some of the attacks Democrats are readying against the Florida governor could be familiar ones. In the 1980s, Scott helped build Columbia/HCA into the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain but later left the company amidst a federal investigation. Columbia/HCA eventually pleaded guilty to overcharging the government and paid what was, at the time, the largest fraud settlement in U.S. history. Scott's opponents brought that up when he first ran for governor in 2010 and again four years later when he ran for re-election, but the charges never took hold. Democrats will double down on that message though, highlighting his business past and shortcomings as governor with a website they've already launched, SelfServingScott.com, along with running Google ads. But even some Florida Democrats admit opponents have consistently underrated Scott's political skills in the past. \"This is a guy who spends a lot of money on polling. He has a sense of where the voters are. He is a magician at manipulating the media. As he will say himself, he only says what he wants to be reported,\" said Democratic strategist Steve Schale. But Schale and others also argue Scott has benefited from quite a bit of political luck that may not be on his side this time. \"Scott's two razor-thin wins for governor were driven by a base-first campaign strategy dependent on weak Democratic turnout and tremendous Republican enthusiasm, a constellation of events that has completely reversed itself in 2018,\" the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge argued in a memo last week. \"This time, Scott's putative Senate bid will run into a Democratic headwind the likes of which he has never encountered and for which his political brand is totally unprepared.\" Get ready for an expensive \u2014 and nasty \u2014 race The Trump factor could also drag Scott down. The Florida governor was an early Trump supporter and the president has urged him to run for the Senate. If this election, as many analysts believe, becomes largely a referendum on the president, Scott's close relationship with Trump could become a major liability. Even though Trump carried the state in 2016, a Quinnipiac University Poll in late February found the president's numbers are now underwater, with 54 percent of voters disapproving of the job Trump's done so far and just 42 percent approving. That same poll gave Nelson a narrow lead over Scott, 46 percent to 42 percent. Nelson's approval ratings remained strong and he's winning independents handily. But perhaps most notably Scott's numbers \u2014 which the pollster noted have been in negative territory for the past seven years \u2014 have rebounded and he's in positive territory with nearly half of all voters approving of the governor. Those new, higher marks give Republicans hope that Scott can overcome any anti-GOP headwinds and are evidence that he's benefiting from positive headlines in the wake of his responses to hurricanes last fall and the Parkland tragedy. And, Scott has something nearly infinite at his disposal \u2014 money. Florida is one of the most expensive states in the country to run in, with multiple pricey media markets and a cost of about $3 million per week to run statewide television ads. Nelson had just $8 million in his campaign account at the end of 2017 \u2014 an amount which Scott can easily dwarf with simply writing a check. Democrats counter that Nelson is a beloved figure in the state who's served in Congress for four decades and has endured despite political changes in the state (he's the only remaining statewide Democratic elected official) who's crafted a centrist profile. But Republicans argue Nelson hasn't faced a real challenge since he was first elected to the Senate in 2000 and he's unprepared for such a tough test. Last week, Nelson promised to run a strong contest. \"When I have an opponent, I assume that they're the toughest opponent,\" Nelson said at an Orlando event, per the Orlando Sentinel. With a well-funded Scott, \"that means I'll run double time like there's no tomorrow,\" the Democratic senator said. Polls show it will be a tight contest, with Nelson starting with a slight edge. But it also could be the most expensive race in state history. The 2016 race with GOP Sen. Marco Rubio running for re-election topped out at $110.5 million \u2014 and that didn't feature a self-funding millionaire. The biggest downside for Democrats, thanks to Scott's deep pockets, is that the state is so expensive \u2014 and if Nelson and outside groups are unable to keep pace with the Republican's expected heavy spending \u2014 it could complicate their 2018 Senate map. They're defending vulnerable incumbents in much cheaper states, such as North Dakota or Indiana, and may question whether the resources to save one candidate could be better spent to help several others win. Democrats, even in what's shaping up to be a good political year for them, have a very tough Senate map, and are nonetheless eyeing a very narrow and somewhat improbable path to a Senate majority. The cash needed for a Florida Senate race could be a big complication in that equation.",

            "article_content": "Sara Saedi was two when her parents fled Iran to California. Her new memoir describes her 18-year-long path to citizenship, and the lingering anxiety of being undocumented. Rebel Without a Green Card by Sara Saedi Hardcover, 280 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest says her life began during a hostage crisis, a revolution and a war. When Sara Saedi was born in Iran in 1980, Americans were being held hostage by revolutionary Iranian students who had stormed the American embassy. The Ayatollah Khomeini had just come to power, turning the country into a fundamentalist state, and Iran was at war with Iraq. When Saedi was 2, she fled the country with her family and moved to California where they had relatives. When their visitors visas expired, they stayed in California, hoping their applications for green cards would eventually be approved. Saedi remembers her teenage years as marked by aloof boys, prepping for the SATs and a looming fear of deportation. She became a citizen at the age of 26. She's now a TV writer. She's currently with the CW series \"iZombie,\" and she writes books for young adults. Her new book is a memoir for young adults called \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" Sara Saedi, welcome to FRESH AIR. So were you the only person your age when you were growing up who you knew who was also undocumented? SARA SAEDI: Yes. Aside from my sister, who was 3 years older than me, I didn't know anybody else in my friend group or in my high school that was undocumented. GROSS: So you were 13 when you found out your family's immigration status. SAEDI: Yes. GROSS: Tell us the story of how you found out. SAEDI: Well, you know, I had no idea that we were undocumented. I didn't - I'd never even heard the term. At that time, they said illegal alien. And I had never heard that term before. It was just one afternoon after school spending time with my sister, and she was filling out job applications. And I remember her being really frustrated because every application asked for a Social Security number. And I didn't even know at the time what a Social Security number was. And she revealed to me that we didn't have Social Security numbers because we had entered the country illegally and that we could essentially get deported at any point if the government found out that we were living in the United States. GROSS: So how did that knowledge affect you? SAEDI: It was shocking. I mean, at that point, we had been living in the U.S., in the Bay Area specifically, for 10 years. And it gave me a lot of anxiety as a teenager, just the idea that we could get deported, that we could get sent back to Iran, which was a country that I was familiar with because we were Iranian but never - I didn't remember living there. I was 2 years old when I came to the states. So I would say that it gave me a baseline of anxiety through my teen years all the way until I was 20, which is when I finally did get a green card. GROSS: How worried were you about getting deported when you were a teenager? SAEDI: It was something that was always in the back of my mind. My parents were very reassuring, and they tried to tell us that something like that would never happen. But we were very aware of the fact that it was a possibility. Our application to get a green card was actually pending at that point. So I found out later as I was researching the book that we would have only gotten deported if our application was denied. But during the process of waiting, we were sort of in a safe period. GROSS: So you're very funny about this in the book, although it's really not funny. At the same time that you were dealing with fear of deportation, you were also dealing with bad acne. So did the fears of getting deported make the acne seem any less significant? SAEDI: Probably not. According to my high school journals and diaries, it was - the acne probably came up more consistently than being an undocumented immigrant did. So, yeah, there was still a lot of that typical teen angst that I was dealing with growing up. I think that being undocumented was just another part of it that most teenagers weren't dealing with, and it was actually something that I unfortunately couldn't vent about to most of my friends because it was something that we wanted to keep secret. GROSS: Right. So the deportation fear was something you had to keep secret whereas the acne you could not keep secret at all. SAEDI: Yes, exactly. It was right on my face. GROSS: It was very, very visible. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So it's just such an interesting dichotomy. You know, on the one hand, you're living this kind of, like, suburban life in the Bay Area. You're going to a good school in part because you lied about your address (laughter). You gave a relative's address so that you could get into a better school. When I say you, I mean your parents. SAEDI: Yes. We were very resourceful in that way. GROSS: Yes. And so at the same time, like, you're living this, like, nice suburban existence, going to this great school, you're also in some ways having to stay in the shadows and be a little secretive. SAEDI: Yeah. I think the big difference - you know, as I was researching the book and writing about my family's story, the big difference between being undocumented when I was in the '90s versus now is that, you know, first of all, there was no social media then. There was hardly any Internet. So there wasn't the sense of community that I think that many undocumented immigrants luckily have today, whether it's, you know, kids that are in the DACA program that are activists or tweeting about the fact that they're undocumented and the struggles that come along with it. I didn't have that growing up, so it felt very isolating in a lot of ways. There was a couple of close friends that knew that my family was undocumented. I actually had a really close friend that lived in Seattle. And one summer when I went to visit her, her parents wanted to take us to Vancouver, and they had to ask my mom to make sure that I packed my passport. And my mom had to explain to them at that point that they couldn't take me to Vancouver because I didn't have a green card, and I couldn't leave the country. So there was some people that were very close to us that knew the fact that we were undocumented, but it certainly wasn't something that I talked about day to day with my friends. GROSS: Your father had gone to college at Louisiana State University, so he lived in the states for a few years and then he married your mother while he was still a student, so she lived here with him for a couple of years. Then they returned to Iran. Why did they decide to flee the country, and when was it? SAEDI: They decided to leave Iran in 1982. So it was a couple years after the revolution, and they just saw the country go through a very extreme shift in a very short amount of time. During the protests against the Shah, my parents were very much supportive of the Shah being removed from the country at that point. They just didn't realize that - from their perspective, the country was going to change for the worse and - once the Ayatollah Khomeini came into power. And my family was mostly secular, so they just struggled a lot with many of the changes, including, like, when my mother, for instance, grew up in Iran, she didn't have to wear a chador. She didn't have to cover her hair, so it was... GROSS: No, you say she wore miniskirts. SAEDI: She did, yeah, she did. I've seen the photos. So Iran during the '70s, I mean, not many people know this, but it was, you know, it was a vacation destination for many Westerners. It was a thriving city, Tehran, where I was born, and, yeah, it had a lot of European sensibilities. And so to watch the country change in the way that it did, it was very shocking for many of my family members, and it was very unexpected at that point. So in 1982, I was 2 years old at the time. My sister was 5 years old, and the country was also at war with Iraq. And that was an interesting time because the United States actually supported Iraq in that war. The borders were closed in Iran, and my dad was able to bribe somebody in the government to get us papers for my mom, my sister and I to leave the country. So they decided to move to the United States because my uncle was already living in the Bay Area at the time and also because they had lived there for a period of time when my father was in college. But I don't think that they thought this was a permanent move. I think they believed that we're going to wait it out, we'll go to the U.S. for a few years, and eventually, we'll probably end up back in Iran. But, you know, a few years went by, and it became very clear that the country wasn't ever going to be the way that it was when they lived there. GROSS: When your family left Iran, they had to do it in stages. Your mother went with you and your older sister, and your father had to stay behind. Why did he have to stay behind? SAEDI: One of the reasons that he stayed behind is because they didn't think that the government would allow us to leave the country if my dad was coming with us. What they - what my mom had told the government was that my uncle was ill in California and that she wanted to be able to see him. It wasn't true. My uncle was actually very healthy at the time. And my dad ended up staying behind because it would seem obvious if we were all leaving together that we were actually going to leave the country permanently. But if it was just my mom and my sister and I and my dad stayed, then they would think that she was planning on returning. GROSS: So, you know, you write when your father joined your family after three months, you didn't recognize him, and you were afraid of him for a while. And that must've just broken his heart. SAEDI: Yeah. He says, looking back on that time, that that was the most difficult part of our separation because I was only 2 years old, so I didn't have much memory of him. And it was hard for me to adjust being around this person that I had been away from for a few months who was essentially a stranger to me at that point. GROSS: So I don't want to get too deep into the bureaucracy of the Immigration and Naturalization (laughter) Service. But can you just give us an overview of what your status was and how it changed over time? SAEDI: Of course. Yeah. One of my goals in writing this book is that I wanted people to understand how complicated and lengthy the process of becoming naturalized can be. So we entered the country in 1982 on a U.S. visitor's visa, and we overstayed our visa once it expired. We then applied for political asylum, which basically would mean that we wouldn't be able to return to Iran. Because when you're applying for political asylum, you're essentially saying that your life is in danger if you return to your home country. And after a couple of years, we checked on the status of our application and were told that there was no record of it. So to this day we don't know what happened. It somehow got lost in the shuffle. At that point, our only option was to apply to get a green card through my uncle, my mom's brother, who was an American citizen. And so he sponsored us. And we didn't end up getting our green card through that application until the year 2000. So it was 18 years since we moved to the country. I think it was 14 years since we applied to get a green card through him. So it was a very long wait period. Along the way, there was other things that my parents attempted to do once they saw that that application was taking such a long time. My grandmother on my mom's side was a green card holder, so we decided to apply to get a green card through her to see if that would be any faster. One of the things that my parents were told by a lawyer, though, is that you can't apply to get a green card through your parent if you're married. So my parents ended up getting a divorce so that my mom would be able to apply to get a green card through her mother and hopefully get green cards for my sister and I. When my grandmother passed away, that application became null and void. And so my parents essentially remarried. (Laughter) And we ended up getting the green card through my uncle. It just took an extremely long time. GROSS: Must've been pretty crazy in your family when your parents divorced in order to get the green card. SAEDI: Yeah. It was really tough because, you know, I write a lot in the book about my parents' relationship, and I was very lucky that I was raised by two people that were happily married. So the fact that they had to get a divorce to speed up our process of getting green cards was a hard pill for me to swallow because I felt like they had worked really hard on their marriage and they were very happy together. And even though it was just a divorce on paper, it still didn't feel right to me that people would have to go to such great lengths to be able to live in the country. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Sara Saedi. And she's the author of the new memoir \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RHYTHM FUTURE QUARTET'S \"IBERIAN SUNRISE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is TV writer Sara Saedi. She writes for The CW show \"iZombie.\" She's also the author of books for young adults, and her new book is a memoir for young adults. It's called \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" And it's about how her family, when she was 2, moved from Iran to the U.S. They came here on a visitor's visa and then stayed to escape the Iran-Iraq war and the Iranian revolution. And then it took years for them to become citizens. It took years just to get green cards, and they lived in fear of being deported. And her memoir is about being a teenager while dealing with all the teenager stuff and also dealing with all the immigration stuff and the fear of being deported. So tell us about the day that you became an American citizen. What was the ceremony like for you? SAEDI: So I became a citizen in 2006. Once you get a green card, you have to wait. I believe it's a five or six-year period of time that you have to wait in order to become a citizen. The ceremony - I'll admit, it was a bit anticlimactic. I had a lot of people around me who were very excited for me. I had co-workers and family friends and my boyfriend's family, who were very congratulatory. And I had really mixed feelings about it. I mean, I was very happy that our immigration struggle was finally coming to an end. I was excited to finally get to vote in an election. But it felt bittersweet because in some ways it did feel like a betrayal to the Iranian side of me. I didn't know how happy I should be about it. And the ceremony itself, I kind of treated it like (laughter) going to the DMV to get a driver's license. And looking back on it, I'm really regretful of that. I wish that I had more gratitude for the - for finally becoming a citizen. I wish that I soaked in that moment a little bit more. But I was a busy TV executive at the time, and I remember bringing scripts with me to the ceremony and thumbing through it as (laughter) they were swearing us in. So maybe that was the most American thing I could be doing, was to be working while becoming an American citizen. But it was - looking back on it, there was a sense of community. There was such a sense of excitement amongst all the people there that were also becoming citizens. I had just gone to the ceremony by myself. I didn't realize that there was people that had family members there that were cheering them on from the sidelines. So I think if I could go back and do it all over again, I would have made a bigger deal out of the process than I did. GROSS: It just impresses me, since you worked so hard to become a citizen and endured so much anxiety about not being one, to take it so lightly during the ceremony itself, (laughter) to be distracted by a script you were reading for \"General Hospital\" (laughter). SAEDI: Yes. I know. I'm still - I'm still really regretful of that fact because I remember seeing other people around me being so excited and wondering now if they looked at me and thought, oh, she must have had a really easy time becoming a citizen because she clearly seemed - doesn't seem like she's that excited about what's happening right now. And that couldn't be further from the truth. I think that maybe at that point I was a little bit cynical about the process. I think I was a little bit bitter about what we had been put through in order to become citizens. So maybe that prevented me from embracing it fully. I think politically, too, I was struggling a lot with some of the things that were going on in the country. And so quite honestly it was hard to sit through a video of George W. Bush welcoming me to the United States because I had mixed feelings about that administration. So there was a lot of other things that came into play that made me struggle with the process. But I think looking back on it, it was such a relief, and it had been such a long and arduous process that it was nice to put that in the past. And I was also really excited to get to vote in an election because I hadn't been able to vote in 2000 and I hadn't been able to vote in 2004. So to be able to finally vote in the next election was a really, really big deal for me. And I will say to this day I vote in every election, and I never, ever take it for granted. GROSS: So you voted in three presidential elections. Obama won the first two. Trump won the third. Considering Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies and his anti-immigration positions as a candidate, how did his election affect you, and how has his presidency affected you? Has it had an effect on your day-to-day life? SAEDI: It's had a huge impact. One of the things that motivated me to write the book was the rhetoric that seemed so hostile towards immigrants during the 2016 election. And so as I was writing the book, at that point, I'll be honest, like many people, I assumed that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. So it definitely shifted the tone of the book once Donald Trump was elected. And I think day to day, any time you turn on the news, you hear about the border wall. You hear - you hear a lot of negative descriptions of immigrants and undocumented immigrants, which were so opposite my experience. So that was actually a great motivator in writing the book and hoping that people would read it and realize that many of the things that were being told about undocumented immigrants are actually really inaccurate. And in some ways, I think it would have been much more challenging - well, in many ways, it would have been much more challenging to go through the process of being undocumented while having a president in office who is not very sympathetic towards immigrants at all. So I'm grateful for my status today, but I will say that once you become a citizen after going through the process of being undocumented, that anxiety never really leaves you. There is part of you that still always feels like they might find a way to kick me out of this country. And with the current administration that we have, I'll admit that there - that I do have that anxiety, especially in writing the book and being so candid about the fact that I was undocumented for so long. There's still that part of you that feels like maybe there's a loophole. Maybe there's a way that they're still going to kick me out of this country. And I don't know. Nothing would surprise me these days. GROSS: My guest is Sara Saedi. Her new memoir for young adults is called \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" We'll talk more after a break. And jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review the album \"Miles Davis & John Coltrane: The Final Tour,\" recordings of the last dates Coltrane played as a sideman with Miles. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RENAUD GARCIA-FONS' \"BERIMBASS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Sara Saedi. Her new memoir for young adults is called \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" It's about her teenage years when, in addition to all the typical things teenage girls worry about, she was worried about getting deported. She was born in Iran in 1980 when the country had just become an Islamic fundamentalist state. Her family fled when she was 2 and came to California where they had relatives. When their visitors visas expired, they stayed, hoping their green cards would eventually be approved. During the long wait, they lived here illegally. Saedi is now a U.S. citizen. She writes for The CW series \"iZombie.\" So while you're going through all this teenage angst about, you know, boys and how you look and your acne, you also learned that your grandmother in Iran, when she was married, she had an affair with her husband's nephew. And then her husband left her. Because of that affair, she ended up marrying the nephew, and your mother is the daughter of that marriage. How did you find out about that, and how - what did that mean to you since today Iran is so, like, socially conservative, especially for women? I mean, women are so constrained in that society now. SAEDI: I mean, they were certainly socially conservative on that front when my grandmother was dealing with all that marital strife. And I - again, it was something that I didn't know about all along. I think when I was - at some point, when I was a teenager, I discovered that my aunt and uncle, my mom's two oldest siblings, were actually half-siblings, which meant that my cousins were half-cousins. But it was never anything that came up in our family because we were all so close. And that's when I was told the story. So essentially, my grandmother had an arranged marriage to her first cousin. And in Iran, we have something called a sofreh aghd, which is - basically translates to the wedding altar. And one of the elements of the wedding altar is a mirror where the couple sits in front of and looks at their reflection. And the way that my mom always told me the story was that the first time my grandmother saw what her husband looked like was seeing his reflection in that mirror. So even though they were cousins, they didn't know each other. They had never met. And from all the stories that I've been told, he was a really lovely man, but they just weren't in love with each other. They had three children together. And one summer, his nephew came to live with them, and he was about eight years younger than my grandmother. And they just had this love affair. They fell in love and... GROSS: He was, like, 21, and she was 29. SAEDI: Yeah. She was 29 I believe, yeah. And they had this love affair that - the way that I was told it was something that they didn't act on. It was just all emotions until she decided to leave her husband. I quite honestly don't know if that's true or not. But she fell in love with him, and she made the very difficult decision to leave her husband for him, which was scandalous on many fronts because women just didn't get divorced at that time. And not only was she choosing to get divorced, but she was marrying somebody who was much younger and somebody that was related to her husband. And so it created - it created a ripple effect amongst two families. And she was essentially disowned by her family. And she married the nephew eventually, and they had five children together. And my mom is the youngest of those kids. GROSS: What impact did that have on your mother growing up in this family that was considered scandalized? SAEDI: You know, I think for her it had actually less of an impact than it did for her oldest siblings who then grew up without their mother. My aunt and my uncle lived most of the time with their dad. And I think for them, it was much harder to not have this family unit that my mom and her siblings got to have growing up. And I will say, too, before writing the book, I always looked at this story through a very romantic lens of, wow, my grandmother followed her heart. And she, you know - if it wasn't for her doing that, I wouldn't exist. And then in going back and hearing the stories from my parents, I realized what a lasting effect it had on my aunt and uncle who didn't get to grow up with both their mom and dad in the same house. So I think as an adult, I've realized more how complex her decision was and how it had a lasting negative impact on some of our family members, although I think looking back, you know, they're all glad that it happened the way that it did. But, yeah, I mean, it was - it was definitely a decision that would be scandalous today in Iran. Frankly, it would be pretty scandalous in the United States... GROSS: I was thinking the same thing, yeah. SAEDI: ...To leave your husband for his nephew (laughter). GROSS: That'd probably not play well here. SAEDI: Yeah, exactly. But, yes, in the 1940s in Iran, it was just unheard of that somebody would do something like this, and she did pay a high price. I mean, she did lose two of her kids. And then I write about - I write in the book her youngest daughter at the time... GROSS: She lost those children in the divorce. SAEDI: Yes, she lost them in the divorce. They continued to live with their dad. And then her youngest daughter, who was 6 years old, came to live with her and then tragically drowned when she was 6. So there was a lot of loss associated with the decision to leave her husband. GROSS: So here's another story from your family in Iran. Your maternal great-grandfather was a polygamist, and he was a doctor. And you write that sometimes he'd see patients for free in exchange for being able to marry their young 13 or 14-year-old daughters. SAEDI: Yes. He wasn't a great guy. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So, like, how - how do you process that? SAEDI: It's so foreign from what I am used to and what I've been raised with that it almost feels like it's not real. It almost feels like it's some fantasy life that I'm writing about because it's somebody that I never knew and something that my parents didn't talk about much growing up and something that was unfortunately considered the norm back then. And I didn't know the details of it until writing the book. I didn't know that he basically bartered medical care in order to marry these young women. And it was definitely something that had an impact on my grandmother's life because she lost her mother quite young and his other wives helped raise her. GROSS: So through the memoir, you reprint some of the excerpts of your high school diary. So I'm going to ask you to read your entry from February 8, 1995. Why don't you start by telling us how old you were when you wrote this? SAEDI: I was 14 years old when I wrote this. GROSS: OK. Would you read it? SAEDI: Of course. (Reading) I feel so ugly. There must be something really wrong with me. All the guys like all the made-up, permed hair, easy, trendy girls, and I really refuse to change my whole personality to be liked by guys. I know I'm not disgusting. I guess I'm pretty average. I just feel so inexperienced, and I'm sure it shows. Sometimes I just wish I could get in people's heads and see what they think about me. I've never felt like such a loser before. GROSS: What had happened that made you feel like such a loser? SAEDI: It was in response to a guy that I had a crush on my freshman year of high school who sat next to me in English class. And one day, we - I thought we were flirting and just, like, making fun of each other. And he pointed out the fact that I had a unibrow. And I don't know why I didn't realize the fact that I had a very noticeable unibrow and was surprised when he pointed it out to me. And it was just one of those moments where you kind of realize how a person you have feelings for sees you. And it's not the way that you want to be seen at all. GROSS: So after that boy told you that you had a unibrow and you found it very upsetting, did you tweeze your eyebrows? SAEDI: It actually took me a while to tweeze my eyebrows because, strangely enough, even though many Iranians are OK with their teenagers getting plastic surgery, plucking our eyebrows was sort of a rite of passage that my mom didn't want us to do until we were 15 years old. That was the rule in the house. And I think I finally wore her down after this happened. And I begged, and I begged, and I begged. And she finally relented. But I was also very conscious of the fact that if I went to school the very next day having plucked my eyebrows, he would know that the comment really got under my skin, and I had too much pride to let that happen, too. So I wanted to wait at least a couple of months so that me plucking my eyebrows and him making fun of my unibrow wouldn't feel like they were two related events. GROSS: Why was tweezing your eyebrows considered, you know, crossing a line? SAEDI: I'm not exactly sure. I think from my mom's perspective and my aunt's perspectives, it felt like something you do once you're a woman, as far as any form of hair removal, whether it was shaving our legs or waxing our upper lip hair, the many things that you have to deal with when you're an Iranian woman who has unwanted hair (laughter). But it was something that - for my mom, it was just always a cultural thing, that it was something that you didn't do when you were too young. But I do think that it was a real struggle for her in a lot of ways because she wanted to make life easier for us as, you know, insecure teenagers but that there was also part of her that didn't want her sisters or the rest of the family to look at her and think that she was becoming too lenient as a mom. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sara Saedi. Her new memoir, \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card,\" is about being a teenager and about being here without documentation and all the work her family went through to become citizens. We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sara Saedi. And she's a TV writer. She writes for the TV series \"iZombie,\" which is on The CW. She's also the author of books for young adults, and her new book is a memoir for young adults called \"Americanized: Rebel Without A Green Card.\" Her family is from Iran. That's where she was born when she was 2. Her family moved to the U.S. They had to, like, sneak out of Iran because the borders were closed. This was after the revolution, during the Iran-Iraq War. And when they came to the United States, they were here on a visitor's visa, but they outstayed the length of the visa and then went through a long process of trying to become citizens and trying to get green cards and living in fear of being deported. You were a creative executive at ABC, and I know you were working on \"General Hospital\" there. I bet you heard a lot of really crazy plots (laughter). SAEDI: Yes, definitely. And a lot of my notes, if I could go back and look at them, are ridiculous because the things that we were discussing were the, you know, tried-and-true soap opera cliches like the evil twin and the - you know, somebody coming back from the dead. And it's very - you know, the movie \"Soapdish,\" which is fairly old now, but it is very accurate in a lot of ways... GROSS: With Billy Crystal, right? Yeah. SAEDI: (Laughter) Yes. It's definitely very accurate in some of the ways. Like, some of the actors that gave us a lot of trouble, we would just kill them off. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So now you're working on a series on The CW called \"iZombie.\" And I confess I haven't seen the series, but I was reading about it. And the plot sounds kind of crazy. Like... SAEDI: (Laughter). GROSS: It sounds like the main character is a woman who becomes a zombie. She works in a morgue and eats the brains of people she autopsies. And after ingesting the brain, she takes on some of the characteristics of the person whose brain she ate, including some of their memories. So with that special power, she becomes a consultant to the police to help them solve murders. Do I have that right? SAEDI: Yes. (LAUGHTER) SAEDI: That's exactly right. GROSS: How do you cook that up (laughter)? SAEDI: Well, the show is based on a comic book, and I actually joined the writing staff in the second season. And I will say there's definitely moments where we're all sitting in the writer's room and we kind of look at each other and we think, I can't believe I'm getting paid to do this. I can't believe I'm getting paid to talk about what brains she should eat in this episode... GROSS: (Laughter). SAEDI: ...And how that'll impact the rest of the characters and all their stories... GROSS: And help the world (laughter). SAEDI: Yes, exactly. And, you know, we usually start every episode by trying to figure out, you know, who the murder victim should be and how they should get murdered. And usually we try and find a brain that's going to negatively or positively impact what the main character is dealing with in her own personal life. So it's a lot of fun. I mean, every week it's different. And this season - you know, the first few seasons, nobody knew that she was a zombie. And this season, the secret is out. And a good chunk of Seattle, where the show takes place, are now zombies. So it's a really fun show to work on. And in some ways, many of the stories that we've done this season have become allegories for what's going on politically in our country today. So it seems comical, but there's a lot of depth there as well. GROSS: Are all the more recent zombies good-guy zombies like the main character is? SAEDI: There's a good mix. There's definitely many bad zombies out there as well. And there's - in this season, the city of Seattle has a border wall around it, so nobody can leave the city or get into the city, so there's a human smuggling storyline that we do where - people who are coming into Seattle because they don't want to be separated from family members or people who are terminally ill and coming into Seattle and want to be turned into a zombie so that they won't die. But it's kind of interesting that I wrote this book on immigration, and there is definitely, like, an immigration storyline in \"iZombie,\" which you wouldn't think, considering the plot which you just described. GROSS: You're an American citizen now. You're married to someone who's American-born. And you have a child who's 15 months old. So your child is American. You're an American citizen now. You're married to someone who's American-born. And you have a child who's 15 months old. So your child is American. He's American-born. What does that mean to you? SAEDI: You know, one of the things that was really eye-opening after he was born was how quickly and easily we received his Social Security card in the mail. And that was a really significant moment for me because it sort of felt like my immigration story had almost gone full circle in that moment, of realizing everything that my family went through and everything that I went through to get a Social Security card. And he was born here, and so we just received it in the mail a couple weeks later. And in a lot of ways I was grateful for that, and I'm grateful for the fact that he's not going to have a lot of the same struggles that I did. A lot of what I write about in the book is those parts of me that are very American and those parts of me that are very Iranian and how challenging it can be to mix the two sometimes. And I think that's actually been amplified now that I'm a mother and now that I'm raising a child myself because I look at him and he doesn't - you wouldn't know that he was half-Iranian by looking at him. And I try and speak with him in Farsi, but my Farsi is not that great anymore. And there's this part of me that realizes that it's going to be even more challenging passing on my Iranian side to him because he's growing up in a home with two primarily English speakers, and he's not going to have that exposure to aunts and uncles and cousins the way that I did. Most of my family is still in the Bay Area, and I'm in Los Angeles. So that's a big part of becoming a mom and raising a child myself. And it really makes me sympathize with what my parents went through because I definitely want him to grow up knowing about his Iranian side, and I want him knowing how to speak Farsi and I want him being familiar with the smells of Iranian food that I grew up with. And I don't know how possible it is to do that for him because he is growing up in a household that's so different than the one that I grew up in. GROSS: OK. Well, thank you so much for talking with us. SAEDI: Thank you so much.

A satirical movie that envisions dictator Benito Mussolini staging a comeback opened in Italy just as the campaign for March 4 general elections was getting underway. It has received rave reviews. The mockumentary I'm Back is an Italian version of the 2015 German film, Look Who's Back, which envisioned the return of Adolf Hitler. In a country that has never come to terms with its fascist past, the Italian movie is seen as a warning shot as populism and racism taint the campaign. The film opened in a national climate of widespread unease over the arrival by boat of more than 600,000 mostly African migrants in the last four years. In one scene, the dictator is guest of honor on a TV celebrity show. The host asks, \"Duce, how does Italy look now?\" Wearing jackboots and military garb, his chin jutting forward, the Mussolini look-alike replies, \"it's like Rhodesia, Congo or Nigeria.\" When the audience laughs, he fires back, \"You won't find it so funny when an African steals your job.\" Luca Miniero, the movie's director, told the daily La Repubblica, \"I'm convinced that if Mussolini were to return today, he'd win the elections, except that he'd see his government fall after two years.\" In the real Italy, the latest polls favor a right-wing coalition \u2014 headed by one man trying to make a political comeback, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Italians thought they'd seen the last of the 81-year-old media tycoon \u2014 disgraced by sex scandals and court trials \u2014 since his tax fraud conviction bars him from running for office. Now, he aspires to be kingmaker. Berlusconi \"is the only one who has been able to put this together,\" says Roberto D'Alimonte, professor of political science at Rome's Luiss University, \"to create [a] coalition among strange bedfellows, the various segments of the Italian right.\" The coalition includes the League (formerly known as the Northern League), headed by Matteo Salvini. Salvini is anti-European Union, wants to legalize brothels and pledges to deport all undocumented migrants \u2014 whose arrival he blames on what he considers the lax immigration policies of the outgoing center-left government. Many observers say the use of racist campaign slogans has reached new levels and is encouraging violence. The migrant issue became even more explosive after a right-wing extremist shot and wounded six migrants from countries including Ghana, Mali and Nigeria, in the town of Macerata, in central Italy, earlier this month. The suspect \u2014 who has a Nazi tattoo on his forehead \u2014 claimed he acted in revenge for the murder of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose suspected killer is Nigerian. League leader Salvini was quick to say, whoever shoots people goes to jail, but added that uncontrolled immigration leads to social conflict. \"Those who allowed hundreds of thousands of phony refugees, and real criminals to land here, are morally responsible for acts of violence committed in Italy,\" Salvini said. Official statistics show the crime rate by noncitizens in Italy is lower than that of Italians. The League's escalating racist rhetoric poses problems for Berlusconi, says analyst D'Alimonte. \"He wants to appear as the moderate leader and he cannot go too far in following the League down the path of chastising immigrants,\" he says. And yet, in a TV interview after the shooting, Berlusconi did exactly that. \"Those 600,000 migrants who are here are a social bomb, ready to explode because they live on expediency and crime,\" Berlusconi said. Emma Bonino, a veteran human rights activist running on a pro-EU slate with the center-left coalition, also warns of dangers posed by that kind of statement. \"Violence is violence, it can never, never, never be excused,\" she said. \"Leaders and media should be careful in not fueling this sentiment, and it is exactly the opposite that is happening.\" The drive-by shooting in Macerata was only the latest in a series of attacks carried out by right-wing extremists. For the last five years, the Interior Ministry has recorded an average of one attack by a neofascist group per week, according to L'Espresso newspaper. Small, ultra-right-wing parties such as Casa Pound and Forza Nuova are also campaigning for the March 4 elections. This raises the specter that, for the first time since the 1945 fall of Mussolini's dictatorship, lawmakers who openly embrace fascism could be back in the Italian parliament.",

Critics have raised questions about her age as she runs for re-election.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., arrives for a Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in December. Critics have raised questions about her age as she runs for re-election. It can be a delicate matter to bring up someone's age. But in California, Sen. Dianne Feinstein's age has become a openly discussed issue in her campaign for a fifth full term. Feinstein \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 is 84, making her the oldest member of the United States Senate. But not by much. There are seven other senators who are also in their 80s, though none of them are running for re-election this year. Some political columnists have said that Feinstein shouldn't run again. Harold Meyerson, executive editor of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, made that argument in a column in the Los Angeles Times. \"This is a six-year term,\" Meyerson says, \"which is the longest term any elected officials in the United States can be elected to. So the issue isn't simply what shape is Dianne Feinstein in at age 84, it's also what shape will she \u2014 or anyone \u2014 be in at 91?\" There's no way to predict that, says Jennifer Ailshire, a professor of Gerontology and Population Health at the University of Southern California. People age differently from one individual to the next, she says. \"Some older adults are quite frail, while others are incredibly robust.\" And their chronological age doesn't really tell you much. \"Rather than focus on someone's age, we should be focusing on their biological age, which is the age of their cells, tissues and organs,\" Ailshire says. That's not the sort of information that voters have access to. What they do know about Feinstein is that she received a pacemaker last year, but only missed a single day of work. That work includes serving as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, as well as having senior status on Appropriations and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Throughout her career, Californians have known Feinstein as a cautious, middle-of-the road politician. That served her well when she was first elected to the Senate in 1992. The California electorate was also more moderate then. But Harold Meyerson says, California leans more to the left these days. \"So in many ways, I think, she still positions herself to the right of certainly where California Democrats are, and in many ways, of where California is.\" But it's never been Feinstein's way to be a liberal flame-thrower. Instead, as she told an audience in San Francisco last year, what's important is knowing how to get things done. \"You've got to be able to compromise,\" she said. \"And compromise, ladies and gentlemen, isn't a dirty word. Compromise is what moves this government forward.\" Feinstein has a major primary challenger from her left. He's Kevin de Leon, 51, leader of the California State Senate. And since California has a nonpartisan, top-two primary, he's likely to be her opponent in November as well. De Leon has blasted Feinstein for being too conciliatory towards President Trump and too slow to stand up for young people on DACA, the program for some undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children. For the record, Feinstein voted against the January budget resolution to re-open the government because it lacked an extension for DACA. De Leon's campaign declined to be interviewed for a story on Feinstein's age. He's been endorsed by the progressive political action committee, Democracy for America, which claims around 300,000 members in California. Communications Director Neil Sroka says what his organization wanted to know was, \"Who's going to be best equipped to lead the resistance to Donald Trump and set a path forward for what an inclusive, populist vision for this country looks like?\" And for his organization, that wasn't Feinstein. Her age isn't a problem, but her long tenure in the Senate is. \"We're going to need more [progressive] candidates moving up the ranks,\" Sroka says. \"We can't do that if the same old people are running for the same old offices over and over again.\" Feinstein is hardly the first candidate whose age has become an issue. But few have been damaged by it. In 1984, President Reagan famously teased his younger opponent, Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale, that he would not criticize him for his youth and inexperience. And just two years ago, when Arizona Sen. John McCain's primary opponent said he was too old to be running for re-election at the age of 80, her comments were called desperate, nasty and sick by the media; she lost decisively. But Dianne Feinstein may be more vulnerable. While polls show her ahead by double digits, one survey showed her support dropping several points when voters were told her age. Bill Carrick, Feinstein's longtime political strategist, says there have been older politicians going back decades \"and I never heard all this racket.\" Then again, he notes, they were all men. \"We now are getting to the point where there are senior senators who are female,\" which suggests, says Carrick, that the concerns expressed about Feinstein's age represent \"quite a double standard.\" Gerontologist Jennifer Ailshire says that if there's going to be a double standard, the science says it should be the other way round. \"Women have a survival advantage over men,\" she says. \"Scientists have found that men have higher epigenetic aging rates, meaning their cells and tissues are older, even when they're the same chronological age [as] women.\" Whether age should be an election issue will ultimately be settled by the voters. But those voters themselves are also aging. A dozen years from now, one-fifth of the U.S. population will be 65 years old or more.",

For months prior to the recent shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, suspect Robert Bowers spewed venomous bigotry, hatred and conspiracies online, especially against Jews and immigrants. During the Oct. 27 attack, according to a federal indictment, he said he wanted \"to kill Jews.\" He is charged with 44 counts \u2014 including hate crimes \u2014 for the murder of 11 people and wounding of six others at the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue. The attack follows a spike in anti-Semitic incidents, concerns about the rise in domestic extremism and calls for politicians to rethink their anti-immigrant rhetoric. We wanted to know what programs, if any, are effective in getting violent and violence-prone far-right extremists in America to cast aside their racist beliefs and abandon their hate-filled ways. Here are five key takeaways: 1) Neglected, minimized and underfunded Creating and expanding effective programs to get homegrown far-right racists to find the off-ramp from hate is, overall, an under-studied, underfunded and neglected area. White supremacy is really a problem throughout the United States. It doesn't know any geographic boundaries. It's not isolated to either urban or rural or suburban \u2014 it cuts across all. Pete Simi, Chapman University \"We haven't wanted to acknowledge that we have a problem with violent right-wing extremism in this kind of domestic terrorism,\" says sociologist Pete Simi of Chapman University, who has researched and consulted on violent white nationalists and other hate groups for more than two decades. \"White supremacy is really a problem throughout the United States,\" he says. \"It doesn't know any geographic boundaries. It's not isolated to either urban or rural or suburban \u2014 it cuts across all.\" But it's a problem and topic that America has \"tended to hide or minimize,\" he adds. That willful denial, Simi says, has left many nonprofits, social workers and police and other interventionists largely flying blind. \"There really haven't been much resources, attention, time, energy devoted to developing efforts to counter that form of violent extremism.\" In fact, the Trump administration in 2017 rescinded funding that targeted domestic extremism. The administration, instead, has focused almost exclusively on threats from Islamist extremists and what it sees as the security and social menace of undocumented immigrants including, again, whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. 2) There's no consensus on what really works The research done so far shows that adherence to white supremacist beliefs can be addictive. Some who try to leave can \"relapse\" and return to the hate fold. But Simi says, \"We're really very much in the early days.\" And there is no consensus yet on what works best over the long haul. Academically, there has been more attention and research on interventions with American gang members or would-be Jihadis. And while there is some crossover, far-right hate comes with ideological baggage often absent in gangs and is different from the religion-infused Jihadi belief system. 3) Best practices are costly and labor-intensive Can racist radicals and homegrown right-wing violent extremists successfully be rehabilitated and re-enter civil society? \"The answer to that question is absolutely 'yes,' \" Simi says. The groups with the best approach, he says, seem to be those that partner with a broad section of civil society \u2014 educators, social workers, those in health care and police \u2014 to tackle the full range of problems someone swept up into an extremist world might face. They may need additional schooling or employment training, he says or \"maybe they have some housing needs, maybe they have some unmet mental health needs,\" such as past trauma or substance use problems. It's a more holistic approach that he says, in the end, is far more effective and less costly than prison and packing more people into the already overcrowded U.S. criminal justice system. But that \"wraparound services\" model is also labor-intensive, expensive and hard to coordinate. It's also severely hampered, Simi says, by America's woefully inadequate drug treatment and mental health care systems. \"A big, big problem that we face as a society is abdicating our responsibility in terms of providing this kind of social support and social safety net for individuals that suffer from mental health,\" as well as drug problems, he says. 4) Life after hate Tony McAleer knows the mindset of the suspect in the synagogue shooting. A former member of the White Aryan Resistance and other hate groups, he once echoed the type of racist invective Bowers spewed online; the kind that sees a cabal of malevolent Jews running the world by proxy through banks, Hollywood, corporations and the media. I think of them as lost...And I can tell you being in that place is not a fun place to be. When you surround yourself with angry and negative people I guarantee you your life is not firing on all cylinders. Tony McAleer, Life After Hate And McAleer knows how savvy racist recruiters can be. He was one of them. \"I was a Holocaust denier. I ran a computer-operated voicemail system that was primarily anti-Semitic,\" he says. He eventually renounced his bigotry and helped co-found the nonprofit Life After Hate, one of just a handful of groups working to help right-wing extremists find an off-ramp. It also was among those that lost funding \u2014 a $400,000 Obama-era federal grant \u2014 when the Trump administration changed focus. In McAleer's experience, adherence to racist beliefs \u2014 whether as part of a group or as a lone wolf like the synagogue suspect \u2014 is more often sparked by a flawed search for identity and purpose than by a deeply held belief. The group doesn't attack people's ideology verbally. He calls that approach \"the wrong strategy. Because it's about identity.\" The best method, he believes, is simply listening and trying to reconnect to the person's buried humanity. McAleer says he tries to get at what's motivating the hate, to find out why people are really so angry and upset to begin with, and to start the dialogue from there. You condemn the ideology and the actions, he says, but not the human being. \"I think of them as lost. Somewhere along the line, they find themselves in this place,\" says McAleer, \"and I can tell you being in that place is not a fun place to be. When you surround yourself with angry and negative people, I guarantee you your life is not firing on all cylinders.\" He says that's the way he felt. \"I was just so disconnected from my heart.\" The birth of his children and compassion from a Jewish man, he says, helped him to leave that life and to reconnect with his own humanity and that of others. People often have never met the people that they purport to hate, he says. \"And there's nothing more powerful \u2014 I know because it happened to me in my own life \u2014 than receiving compassion from someone who you don't feel you deserve it from, someone from a community that you had dehumanized.\" 5) How do you scale compassion? But there are only a few programs like Life After Hate. And they're often small. Since the summer of 2017, for example, the Chicago-based group has taken on only 41 new people who want to leave their racist hate behind. \"Keep in mind, de-radicalization is a lifelong process,\" says Life After Hate's Dimitrios Kalantzis. \"We consider it a major success when formers remain active in our network, even if that means checking in within our online support group. That means they are engaged and unlikely to relapse.\" But is inspiring compassion really scalable, and how can groups more effectively structure and organize similar efforts? How can researchers and others scale it to reach as large a number of people as possible? \"That's the answer I can't provide because at this point, we really don't know,\" sociologist Pete Simi says.",

The remarks from the Wisconsin Republican came after President Trump said in a taped interview that he was considering such an order.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker Paul Ryan, pictured in September, said an executive order to remove birthright citizenship from the United States would be unconstitutional. The remarks from the Wisconsin Republican came after President Trump said in a taped interview that he was considering such an order. Updated at 5:35 p.m. ET House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed back on Tuesday on President Trump's claim that he can strip birthright citizenship from the U.S. via executive order, saying such a move would be \"unconstitutional.\" \"Well, you obviously cannot do that,\" Ryan told radio station WVLK in Kentucky. \"You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\" Ryan noted any changes to a constitutional amendment require an act of Congress, adding: \"We didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action, and obviously as conservatives we believe in the Constitution. ... I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution and I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.\" Trump announced his plan to circumvent Congress to revoke the 150-year-old birthright law in an interview with Axios on HBO that is slated to air Sunday. \"It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,\" Trump said. The potential move, which would very likely trigger numerous legal challenges, would seek to end the conferring of citizenship on all children born in the U.S. \u2014 which is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment \u2014 including children of noncitizen parents. The first sentence of the amendment reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" The concept is based on jus soli \u2014 \"right of the soil\" \u2014 meaning that children born in the U.S. have a claim to citizenship, even if their parents lack legal documentation to be in the country. Discussing his plan to roll back part of the Constitution, President Trump says, \"They're saying I can do it just with an executive order.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Coombs/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Discussing his plan to roll back part of the Constitution, President Trump says, \"They're saying I can do it just with an executive order.\" Trump has mentioned the idea of voiding the amendment before, most notably in August 2015, when the birthright issue became part of his hard-line policies on immigration as a presidential candidate. Now Trump is discussing the birthright citizenship law roughly one week before U.S. voters will head to the polls for the 2018 midterm election. In addition to guaranteeing citizenship by birth in the U.S., the 14th Amendment bars states from denying essential rights without due process. As the Library of Congress notes, the amendment \"greatly expanded the protection of civil rights to all Americans and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment.\" The amendment's final section notes that it is Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 who has the power \"to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\" The 14th Amendment became law in 1868, as a rebuke to the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which had held that freed slaves were not U.S. citizens. Since then, its meaning and reach have been debated in courtrooms and in American society, with many questions centering on the phrase \"the jurisdiction thereof.\" \"That means that they are subject to the laws of the United States, that they can, for example, be prosecuted for violating American law,\" constitutional law professor Suzanna Sherry told NPR in 2015. The law excludes, for instance, the children of foreign diplomats. In the 1860s, it was intended both to grant citizenship to freed slaves and to give peace of mind to immigrants. As Sherry, who teaches at Vanderbilt University, told NPR in 2015, \"the United States had experienced quite a bit of immigration, and immigration was viewed as a very good thing. And so this was essentially putting out a welcome mat to immigrants by ensuring that their children born here would be citizens.\" To change the law, Sherry said, you would need to either amend the 14th Amendment through Congress or ask the Supreme Court to overturn its earlier interpretation of the law and limit its benefit to people who are in the U.S. legally. While many legal scholars agree, the president says he has the power to act on his own. \"You can definitely do it with an act of Congress,\" Trump said in the Axios on HBO interview. \"But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.\" He added, \"We're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous, and it has to end.\" But birthright citizenship is the law of at least 30 countries, including many U.S. neighbors in North and South America. All of the countries in Europe grant automatic citizenship by jus sanguinis \u2014 by \"right of blood.\" Some, like France, also offer a path to children of immigrants to acquire citizenship at age 18. The president said he has spoken about the birthright issue with the White House counsel. As for when he might act, Trump said, \"It's in the process. It'll happen \u2014 with an executive order.\" Responding to the president's words, Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, predicted, \"This will set up the court fight.\" CIS identifies itself as a nonpartisan think tank, but it has consistently called for tougher U.S. immigration policies, and the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated it a hate group. If Trump moves ahead with his plan, Krikorian said via Twitter, \"the order will be enjoined, case will eventually reach SCOTUS, which then will finally have to rule on the meaning of 'subject to the jurisdiction.' \" Critics of birthright citizenship have said it encourages pregnant women who want to immigrate to travel to the U.S. to have their babies, hoping to gain citizenship for their children and, they say, potentially easing their own path to becoming U.S. citizens. But immigration advocates say those concerns are overblown \u2014 part of a campaign to stir up voters in an election season. While it's difficult to track the exact number of children whose parents are in the U.S. illegally, the Pew Research Center has reported that in 2014, 3.2 million children \u2014 nearly 6 percent of all K-12 students in the U.S. \u2014 had at least one unauthorized immigrant parent and were citizens because they were born in the U.S. If Trump were able to somehow roll back part of the 14th Amendment, the policy shift would not reduce the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to the Migration Policy Institute. In fact, it could do the opposite: When the group did a study projecting the effects of a potential repeal of birthright citizenship in 2015, it found that such a change would add millions of people to America's undocumented population within a few decades, essentially creating a new underclass. And besides, MPI's Michael Fix wrote when that study was published, \"Birthright citizenship is not what drives illegal immigration. Surveys have found that people come for jobs and to better their lives.\" Krikorian of the CIS said an executive order on the issue is \"long overdue.\" But Trump's idea to revoke birthright citizenship is \"ill-timed\" and misguided, says Kristen Clarke, the executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \"Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,\" Clarke said. Jess Morales Rocketto, whose Families Belong Together group has fought the Trump administration's family separation policy along the U.S.-Mexico border, was more blunt. \"This is ethnic cleansing,\" Rocketto said. \"This is an attempt to white-out America's history and heritage as a nation of immigrants. And it's unconstitutional.\"",

It has been the kind of month you don't want to remember. Killing in a synagogue. Explosives in the mail.  Deadly hurricanes. A grisly murder of a journalist inside a foreign consulate. Troops ordered to the border to block desperate migrants crossing Mexico in search of America. It may be that none of the dramatic events of this month will be decisive in determining the outcome of the midterm elections next month. But don't try to tell any of the candidates that. That's why everyone in politics either dreads or dreams of the \"October surprise,\" the late-in-campaign event or issue that suddenly upends all calculations and delivers electoral victory. The event or issue may be a natural disaster or of human origin, a scandal that erupts overnight or a stunning revelation that turns the tide. Some such game changer, or efforts to invent one, have been a feature of nearly every presidential campaign for at least the last half century. The phenomenon affects some midterm election cycles as well. And that's not even to mention all the statewide and local races that have been radically altered in the month before Election Day. Not infrequently, more than one surprise happens in the same October. Take the most immediate example of 2016, when not one but two or three major breaks in the campaign narrative occurred less than a month before Election Day. Late in that October, the FBI found a laptop from the home of an aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton contained emails from Clinton, whose missing emails as secretary of state had been a lingering campaign issue. When the FBI Director James Comey learned of this, he shared the information with the relevant Republican committee chairman on Capitol Hill, who shared it with the rest of the world via Twitter on Oct. 28. Although the FBI soon determined that these emails were copies of others seen earlier, the damaging headlines about a \"reopened investigation\" had already made a major dent in the voters' consciousness. Clinton herself has blamed her loss on this eleventh hour incident, among other factors. Many had felt certain Clinton would win, in part because of an earlier October surprise affecting the man who was her opponent, Donald Trump. On Oct. 7, the Washington Post had revealed a videotape of Trump using offensive language to brag of his aggressively sexual treatment of women. The recording was made without his knowledge shortly before a taping of the TV show Access Hollywood. On that same October day,  the Internet site WikiLeaks released emails from within Clinton's campaign operation and audio recordings of Clinton herself talking to Wall Street investment bankers. For the bankers, she expressed views on trade quite different from her stump speech populism. The specific phrase \"October Surprise\" has been in common usage since at least 1980. In that pivotal year, it was a surprise that did not happen that spawned decades of debate. President Jimmy Carter was seeking re-election that fall while straining to negotiate the release of 52 Americans who had been held hostage since the previous fall in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Challenger Ronald Reagan's camp feared such a release might be timed to prompt a grateful nation to reward Carter with a second term. Did Reagan's camp act on these fears by negotiating its own deal with the Iranians? Allegations have long persisted that Reagan's team worked a deal with Israel to sell crucial military parts to Tehran as a reward waiting until after Reagan took office to release the hostages. Official investigations by  committees in the House and Senate, under Democratic control, decided the evidence of such a plot was inconclusive. But there have been other instances of theatrical plot twists in the late innings of American elections. To mention just a few over the past 50 years: October 2012. We will never know what might have become of President Obama's bid for a second term if it had not been for \"Super Storm Sandy.\" Although technically no longer a hurricane, Sandy slammed the Eastern seaboard just before the election. Obama swung into action, hooked up with governors from both parties in affected states and spent the final days of the campaign wreathed in their appreciation. Republican challenger Mitt Romney was videotaped unloading supplies for some storm victims. October 2008. One candidate for an October surprise that seemed to flop was the revelation, four days before Election Day, that candidate Barack Obama had a half-aunt named Zeituni Onyango who was an undocumented immigrant living in Boston. She had been denied asylum and ordered out of the country four years earlier. The story was widely but not extensively reported, and had no discernible effect on the election. October 2004. On the 29th of October, Al Jazeera aired a videotape of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, taking responsibility for the terror attacks of Sept. 11 three years prior and castigating the U.S. for its support of Israel. In the final phase of the campaign between President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry, the tape refocused news audiences on Sept. 11 and the War on Terror. It was credited by some for the late \"Bush bounce\" that resulted in a slim victory for the incumbent. October 2000. The weekend before Election Day, Maine officials confirmed records showing presidential candidate George W. Bush had been arrested for drunk driving there in 1976. Bush held a news conference to confirm the incident, which happened when he was 30, and reiterating his decision to quit drinking when he was 40.  But this late hit was thought by some of Bush's own staff to have decreased turnout among Evangelical voters and contributed to Bush's loss in the popular vote that year (he won the narrowest Electoral College victory in history.) October 1972. There seemed to have been plenty of final nails in the coffin for the campaign of Democratic nominee George McGovern that year, not least being the news that his running mate had undergone shock therapy for depression. But 12 days before the November vote, incumbent Richard Nixon sent his national security advisor Henry Kissinger out to tell the news media \"We believe that peace is at hand.\" Kissinger was the chief negotiator for the U.S. in talks aimed at ending the Vietnam War. Nixon won the popular vote by 20 percentage points. This may have been the occasion for the first usage of the phrase \"October surprise,\" and it supplied the boost other candidates have dream of since. October 1968. If there was ever an October surprise in the making that might have altered history, it was the effort in this autumn by President Lyndon Johnson to achieve a breakthrough in the Paris peace talks over the war in Vietnam. Like Nixon four years later, Johnson believed some kind of agreement might well be achievable in the weeks before Election Day \u2013 a breakthrough that would secure the election for his vice president and  chosen successor, Hubert Humphrey. Substantial evidence suggests that Nixon, who was the 1968 Republican nominee against Johnson, also considered this is a real possibility. But Nixon did not just stand by to see what would happen. Biographer John Farrell, who spent years in the archives of the Nixon campaign and presidency, established in his 2017 volume that the Nixon team tried to retard those peace talks via side negotiations with the South Vietnamese government, who were told Nixon would get them a better deal. The contact was made through the back channel of Anna Chennault, the Chinese-born wife of legendary U.S. Army Gen. Claire Chennault, leader of the \"Flying Tigers\" squadron in World War II. The exact effect of these back-channel efforts remains a matter of debate, but in any event the South Vietnamese did not agree to a deal. Johnson announced a bombing halt but no real breakthrough. Nixon won a narrow but decisive victory in November. October in January. Whatever significance there may be in the October surprise tradition, it clearly resides not in the 10th month of the calendar but in its proximity to Election Day. Holding federal elections in November is a feature of the Constitution itself, but important state and local and primary elections are held at various times of the year. One of the best examples of an \"October surprise\" came in January 1979 in the form of a historic snowstorm that shut down the city of Chicago and brought down its Mayor Michael Bilandic. Having succeeded the totemic Mayor Richard J. Daley two years earlier, Bilandic was cruising to a full term in his own right when the city largely disappeared under 35 inches of the white stuff. It took days, even weeks, for city plows to get to the neighborhoods. Bilandic's longshot opponent, a city official he had once fired named Jane Byrne, pinned the blame for the snow fiasco on City Hall and upset the incumbent at the polls.",

Many say they are headed to the U.S. The White House said on Tuesday that a record number of migrant families have arrived at the Southwest border over the last year. The White House says it's seen a \"record-shattering surge\" of migrant families at the Southwest border in the past year \u2014 and wasted no time trying to blame those rising numbers on what it calls \"loopholes\" in U.S immigration law. More than 161,000 migrant family members were apprehended or found inadmissible at the Southwest border in FY 2018, which ended last month. That's according to figures released today by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The number of family units apprehended by immigration agents has been rising steadily since the summer, to a record total of more than 20,000 in September. That's despite the Trump administration's policy, which it's since abandoned, of separating migrant families at the border to deter illegal immigration. This is a crisis that is unprecedented in our history. Senior administration official Overall, the number of undocumented immigrants \u2014 including family units and those crossing alone \u2014 apprehended at the border last year held steady at about 521,000. That's a slight decline from the fiscal year 2017 total, and far below the high-water mark of the 1990s and 2000s, when more than a million apprehensions a year was routine. But a senior administration official insisted that comparison is misleading. \"This is a crisis that is unprecedented in our history,\" the official said on a conference call with reporters. A generation ago, the official said, the vast majority of immigrants were adults from Mexico, and most could be deported quickly. But that is not the case with migrant families and unaccompanied children from Central America, many of whom are seeking asylum in the U.S. \"This is not an issue of being able to get physical custody of an alien,\" the official said. \"The problem is that once apprehended, they can't be sent home.\" Most of the migrant families and children arriving at the border today come from Central America. Under U.S. law, and a long-standing legal agreement known as the Flores settlement, many of them have to be released into the U.S. to wait for their day in immigration court. Because of lengthy court backlogs, their cases can take months or years to play out. With just weeks to go before the midterm elections, the White House is arguing that Democrats are to blame for the surge in family migration. \"As a result of Democrat-supported loopholes in our federal laws, most illegal immigrant families and minors from Central America who arrive unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only released,\" said President Trump in a written statement. But immigrants' rights advocates see those same policies as crucial protections for families and children who are seeking asylum in the U.S. And they dispute the notion that U.S. immigration policy is what's driving those migrants to leave their homes in the first place. They argue that migrants are fleeing from violence and economic hardships in the so-called \"northern triangle\" countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 conditions that could get worse if President Trump follows through on his threat to take away foreign aid because of the migrant caravan that's making its way north across Mexico.",

Circuit Court of Appeals for 12 years. His tenure there offers some clues to how he'll handle the most controversial questions before the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh is a Supreme Court justice. That much is certain after senators narrowly approved his controversial nomination Saturday, putting an end to his bitter confirmation battle with a slim vote in his favor. But even as one phase of Kavanaugh's story ends, another is beginning: His lifetime tenure on the highest court in the U.S. And this story promises to last much longer. So, what can we expect to see from Kavanaugh on the biggest, thorniest issues likely to come before the Supreme Court? Of course that question won't be answered with certainty until we see him actually on the nation's highest bench \u2014 but there are clues to be found in Kavanaugh's past statements and opinions. Here's a brief breakdown of where the newly minted justice has come down on five major topics that have proven to be lightning rods in the courtroom and beyond. Scroll down or click from the list below to jump to a particular issue. AbortionInvestigating the presidentGunsCampaign financeFederal agencies and environmental regulations Brett Kavanaugh, seen getting sworn in before a confirmation hearing early last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brett Kavanaugh, seen getting sworn in before a confirmation hearing early last month. Perhaps the biggest question hanging over Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings in September was the matter of Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling made abortion legal nationwide \u2014 much to the anger and frustration of many conservatives, who have been seeking its reversal virtually ever since. With Kavanaugh on the court, conservative justices now have a solid majority, inspiring anti-abortion activists' hopes \u2014 and abortion rights advocates' fears \u2014 that the moment may finally be at hand. But is it really? Kavanaugh answered cautiously when asked about it during his confirmation hearings, saying the decades-old ruling \"was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.\" Asked about Planned Parenthood v. Casey \u2014 the 1992 case that affirmed Roe and asserted that states couldn't place an \"undue burden\" on women seeking legal abortions \u2014 he called it \"precedent on precedent.\" Those statements echo his comments in private before the hearings to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who supports abortion rights and who provided the critical vote needed to confirm Kavanaugh. At the same time, his record as a federal judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals adds nuance to these blanket assessments. One example surfaced as recently as last year. In a case that would later be decided by the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh's appellate court ruled in favor of an undocumented 17-year-old in immigrant detention who had been seeking an abortion. Kavanaugh wrote the dissent in that ruling, arguing that precedents are clear in \"allowing the Government to impose reasonable regulations so long as they do not unduly burden the right to abortion that the Court has recognized.\" The court's decision supporting the teen, Kavanaugh argued, \"is ultimately based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\" Still, even before he began his stint on the appellate court, Kavanaugh asserted that he would follow Roe v. Wade as established precedent. In his confirmation hearings to join D.C.'s federal appellate court, Kavanaugh assured Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of that \u2014 while remaining wary with his language, as he would more than a decade later. \"The Supreme Court has held repeatedly, Senator,\" Kavanaugh said, \"and I don't think it would be appropriate for me to give a personal view on that case.\" Again, like abortion, Kavanaugh's past statements on the extent and limits of executive power offer fodder for multiple interpretations. On the one hand, he cut his teeth as a young lawyer serving as an aide to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation of President Clinton. On the other, he voiced resistance to such probes about a decade later, after serving for years in the administration of President George W. Bush. \"Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is, I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on the never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible,\" he wrote in a 2009 law review article, laying out his case for a statute protecting sitting presidents from investigation. If we wanted a check on presidential malfeasance, Kavanaugh argued, the Constitution has already given us one: impeachment by Congress. \"We should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions,\" he added. \"The President's job is difficult enough as is. And the country loses when the President's focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution.\" That piece raised some eyebrows, particularly among skeptical Democrats \u2014 and particularly since the man who nominated him, President Trump, is now facing a special counsel probe of his own into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As Robert Mueller's investigation continues to deepen, the question of whether the president can be subpoenaed or indicted has been asked often. Kavanaugh's own answer remains unclear. For instance, just two years ago, he celebrated U.S. v. Nixon, the unanimous 1974 ruling that forced the embattled president to hand over subpoenaed materials, as one of \"the greatest moments in American judicial history\" \u2014 one in which \"judges stood up to the other branches, were not cowed and enforced the law.\" And during his confirmation hearings last month, he refused to answer senators' direct questions about the subject, saying that he, like other justices in their hearings before him, would not address \"hypothetical cases.\" That did not exactly ease Democrats' concerns. Judge Kavanaugh has said that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, cannot be prosecuted, should not be investigated and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at will. That should concern us all. Oddly enough, the high court has very seldom weighed in on the Second Amendment. In fact, the last landmark case to address the matter came a decade ago, when the Supreme Court's split decision in D.C. v. Heller expanded the amendment's protections to include not just groups, but individuals as well. That expansion did come with limitations, though \u2014 and as NPR's Nina Totenberg explained earlier this year, \"it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price\" of getting Justice Anthony Kennedy on board with the majority. Now that Kennedy has retired, what will his successor have to say? \"Kavanaugh believes in a very vigorous Second Amendment right to bear arms,\" UCLA law professor Adam Winkler told Totenberg, \"and he thinks there is little room for constitutionally permissible gun control.\" In this respect, Kavanaugh's position has been clearly defined. \"In disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns, in approving a ban on machine guns, and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed-carry and felon-in-possession laws, Heller established that the scope of the Second Amendment right \u2014 and thus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations \u2014 is determined by reference to text, history, and tradition,\" he wrote in 2011. The comment was part of his 52-page dissent from a federal appellate court ruling that backed a ban on assault weapons in Washington, D.C. He carved out a position that is strongly in favor of gun rights \u2014 and strongly skeptical of any new or novel limitations on gun ownership that break with \"tradition.\" In this respect, he argued, the Second Amendment should be treated much like the First. \"A ban on a class of arms is not an 'incidental' regulation,\" he wrote. \"It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech.\" Hints of Kavanaugh's position can be gleaned from a couple of recent cases before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 and that position looks not unlike that of his predecessor on the court, retired Justice Kennedy. Kennedy, the court's quintessential \"swing vote,\" famously swung toward the conservatives in the split Citizens United ruling, which held that the First Amendment protects unlimited independent political spending by corporations. That 2010 decision dramatically loosened campaign finance laws and opened the spigot on political money. Just one year later, Kavanaugh addressed the matter of campaign finance in a case concerning foreign political contributions. In this respect, he sided with precedent that non-U.S. citizens could not contribute directly to candidates or political parties \u2014 but he made clear that his opinion was to be taken narrowly, and did not address whether foreign nationals could make contributions on behalf of political issues. That limited scope took on added importance when the Supreme Court later affirmed the ruling of Kavanaugh's court. Now, as high court precedent, some have argued that the narrow ruling suggests foreign political contributions are OK \u2014 just so long as they support political issues, rather than actual candidates. In fact, that's precisely the argument put forward by a Russian firm that was indicted for interference in the 2016 election. In a court filing earlier this year, Concord Management and Consulting cited Kavanaugh's 2011 opinion in defending its efforts as mere \"issue advocacy,\" not outright support of a political candidate. But progressive advocate Chiraag Bains told NPR's Peter Overby that perhaps Kavanaugh's position on campaign finance can be seen even more clearly in a decision rendered one year before Citizens United. In that case, Kavanaugh ruled that the group EMILY's List could raise unlimited funds through a nonprofit wing dedicated to issue advocacy. \"That opinion, to me, shows that even before Citizens United, Kavanaugh had bought into the idea that donors have the right to make limitless expenditures based on the out-of-touch idea that if spending isn't officially coordinated with a candidate, it cannot ever be corrupting,\" Bains told Overby. Kavanaugh has proven to be a skeptic of the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal attempts to establish environmental regulations without consulting Congress. In 2012, he dissented from the appellate court ruling that upheld EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, saying that it didn't matter that they \"may well be a good idea as a matter of policy.\" \"The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important. But as in so many cases, the question here is: Who Decides? The short answer is that Congress (with the President) sets the policy through statutes, agenciesimplement that policy within statutory limits, and courts in justiciable cases ensure that agencies stay within the statutory limits set by Congress,\" he wrote. If federal agencies overstep those bounds \u2014 as the EPA did with its pollution regulations, according to Kavanaugh \u2014 they're grabbing powers from the other branches. \"In cases like this one,\" he noted, \"the bedrock underpinnings of our system of separation of powers are at stake.\" His prevailing point in this case \u2014 as with others, such as his 2013 dissent objecting to a Justice Department action against SeaWorld \u2014 was that agencies must stay in the lanes allotted to them. Or, as he asserted to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., during his confirmation hearings: \"Ultimately, my approach to statutory interpretation is rooted in respect for Congress.\"",

Wednesday was Day 2 of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh and it gave members of the Senate Judiciary Committee a chance to question the Trump nominee publicly and one-on-one. There were more protests, and much talk of precedent. Here are some of the highlights: 1. More protests Just like on Tuesday, there were sporadic interruptions of the hearing throughout the day by protesters in the Hart Building hearing room. The protests became so frequent at times that they began to seem a part of the ambiance. U.S. Capitol Police quickly and sometimes roughly moved the protesters out of the room before many of them could be clearly heard. \"What a bunch of dumbbells,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was overheard saying. At least one of the protesters was dressed as a character from television's The Handmaid's Tale, in a crimson robe and white bonnet, shouting, \"Stop Kavanaugh. Our bodies, our choice,\" as she was dragged out. Another activist shouted \"disabled people have human rights.\" Capitol Police reported 73 arrests Wednesday. At the start of the hearing Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, accused Democrats of coordinating with protesters, which Democrats deny. President Trump weighed in on the protests, too. In an interview Wednesday, Trump lashed out at the demonstrators, saying, \"I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don't even know what side the protesters are on.\" Trump said, \"In the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming.\" 2. Kavanaugh on hiring women law clerks The judge has made more than one mention of his mother, Martha Kavanaugh, who he said introduced him to law. She was a prosecutor and later a state circuit court judge in Montgomery County, Md. On Wednesday, Kavanaugh said his mother showed him \"the importance of women's equality.\" Her example and a newspaper article citing the scarcity of female clerks on the Supreme Court inspired him to hire three women as clerks when he became a federal appeals court judge in 2006. Judge Brett Kavanaugh parents, Martha Kavanaugh and Everett Edward Kavanaugh, look on as he testifies during the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Judge Brett Kavanaugh parents, Martha Kavanaugh and Everett Edward Kavanaugh, look on as he testifies during the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings Wednesday. \"I've been very aggressive in hiring the best\" clerks, Kavanaugh said, and understanding that \"the best include women.\" Kavanaugh said he has hired 25 women clerks, of whom 21 have gone on to serve as clerks on the Supreme Court, calling them \"an awesome group.\" If confirmed, he said he would continue the practice. Kavanaugh was also asked about his association with former Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, who resigned late last year after several women, including former law clerks, accused him of inappropriate touching and forcing them to view pornography in his chambers. Kavanaugh, who clerked for Kozinski in the early 1990s, called the revelation \"a gut punch.\" He said he spoke with Kozinski \"not often,\" after his clerkship, although he did work with him and 11 others on a book on judicial precedent. Kavanaugh said, \"No woman should be subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace, ever, including in the judiciary, especially in the judiciary.\" 3. Precedents, and \"precedent on precedent\" Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh thumbs through a well-worn, pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second day of his confirmation hearings Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh thumbs through a well-worn, pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second day of his confirmation hearings Wednesday. Maybe it was the book he co-authored on the topic, but Kavanaugh spent a lot of time Wednesday talking about precedents, and how they guide his judicial thinking. Much of that discussion centered on Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. Kavanaugh said Roe \"was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.\" Responding to questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Kavanaugh also spoke about a subsequent Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld Roe but also narrowed its scope. Casey, Kavanaugh said, was \"precedent on precedent.\" What that indicates about how Kavanaugh might rule on, say, a state law restricting abortion access is unclear. Kavanaugh also cited precedent in answers to questions ranging from his position against a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant who sought an abortion (Kavanaugh was dissenting, in the minority), to his opinion in a case involving the National Labor Relations Board, in which he voted to reverse the board's decision that undocumented workers qualified as employees and could vote in an election to form a union (again dissenting, in the minority). Kavanaugh said precedent is part of the stability and predictability of the American legal system. He also said precedent contributes to the independence of judges and the ability of people and organizations to rely on judicial opinions in ordering their affairs. But Kavanaugh allowed that the high court reverses its own precedents from time to time. He pointed to one such reversal \u2014 Brown v. Board of Education, which ended the \"separate but equal\" doctrine \u2014 as \"the single greatest moment in Supreme Court history.\" He also cited the notion of precedent as controlling what he was willing to discuss with senators during his confirmation hearings. Kavanaugh said his predecessors, including current members of the Supreme Court, when they had been nominees would not answer questions about how they would rule or even if they would take up various \"hypothetical cases,\" including whether the president must comply with a subpoena, or could pardon himself. Pointing to this past practice, Kavanaugh refused to engage on such questions Wednesday when posed by lawmakers. 4. If memory serves ... In a tense exchange before the close of the day's hearing, California Sen. Kamala Harris asked Kavanaugh a direct question about whether he had talked about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, a law firm where President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, is a partner. Kavanaugh hesitated. \"Be sure about your answer, sir,\" said Harris, who served as California's attorney general before being elected to the Senate in 2016. Complete exchange between @senkamalaharris and Judge Kavanaugh on Mueller Investigation. pic.twitter.com/FXhW3XmV19 What followed was a back and forth in which Harris struggled to get a definitive response from Kavanaugh while the nominee seemed to be trying to circumscribe his answer, suggesting that he did not remember and asking for the name of a specific person in the firm with whom he may have spoken. As Politico notes: \"Harris offered no further context for her line of questioning with Kavanaugh, which suggested that he may have discussed an investigation affecting Trump with Trump-connected lawyers but lacked any solid proof. The only explanation for the back-and-forth came from a Democratic aide speaking on condition of anonymity, who said Wednesday night that some in the party 'have reason to believe that a conversation happened and are continuing to pursue it.'\" It was a long day for all involved, with Kavanaugh being questioned for some 11 hours.  And Thursday they're back at it for a second round.",

His character Jose is a restaurant delivery worker and the star of his amateur soccer team.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Cinema Guild\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fernando Cardona, a real-life construction worker and Mexican immigrant, was cast in the lead role in En el S\u00e9ptimo D\u00eda. His character Jose is a restaurant delivery worker and the star of his amateur soccer team. Jim McKay used to walk into video stores back in the 1990s, where he'd see versions of himself: white males, in all kinds of movies. Then he tried to imagine being someone else. \"You'd go in these aisles, and you'd see box after box after box of VHSes,\" McKay says. \"And you'd just realize, like, for [a] young woman [of color], there's nothing there. She's not there. You're really not visible.\" His first two films, Girls Town and Our Song, are about young women of color coming of age \u2014 in fact, most of his films pay close attention to the lives of marginalized New Yorkers. His new film En el S\u00e9ptimo D\u00eda (Spanish for On the Seventh Day), centers around young, undocumented male immigrants from the Mexican state of Puebla. They work six days a week as cooks, delivery guys, cotton-candy salesmen. On their one day off, Sunday, they play soccer. A restaurant delivery worker named Jose scores the winning goal and sends his teammates \u2014 most of whom are also his roommates in a tiny Brooklyn apartment \u2014 through to the league championship final. He's in a great mood the next morning when he shows up for his shift. Then his boss arrives and speaks the first word of English in the film. The boss has bad news. He needs everyone to work an extra shift next Sunday \u2014 the day of the final. Jose spends the rest of the week \u2014 and the remainder of the film \u2014 debating whether he should keep the bad news from his teammates, or quit his job, or work and let his team down. Jim McKay says the story is an homage to one his favorite directors \u2014 the Briton Ken Loach. So is the casting of nonprofessional actors. In McKay's case, he recruited people from the same Brooklyn neighborhood where the film was shot. \"People who had never \u2014 who didn't know what a script was, had never seen a scene written out,\" McKay says. \"You had to kind of go, like, 'OK, you read this and then someone's going to.' You know, I mean, it was really starting from scratch.\" The process took seven months. The toughest casting call was the lead, because Jose appears in nearly every scene of the film. McKay found what he was looking for in a Mexican immigrant and construction worker named Fernando Cardona. \"Everything about him had something in common with Jose, if not directly, which was that he's a striver,\" McKay says. \"That ambition that he had really made sense with the character.\" McKay's 30-year-old star spends most of his days at the top of a tower just south of Central Park that's already up to 50 stories tall. Cardona showed up to do an interview in the Park carrying a bib for a long-distance run the next weekend. The weekend after that, he planned to go skydiving. \"I want to do everything but sometimes I can't,\" Cardona says. \"But all the things I do it, I do with my \u2014 my heart. You know, like I want to work very hard. It's the only way I can get something.\" Cardona says he was caught and detained the first time he tried to cross into the United States. He tried again, figuring he'd end up working in restaurants, like the characters in the movie. Cardona is thrilled that he got the chance to act. But he also saw it as an opportunity to shine a positive light on undocumented Mexican immigrants like himself. \"This is something for my culture,\" he says. \"Those people, they have time to see the movie, they going to see that ... we don't come to this country to destroy this country, to sell drugs, or all those bad things that the people they say about Mexican[s].\" Cardona says he's not worried about immigration authorities coming after him now that his face is all over a feature film. He's been sent back to Mexico before. If that doesn't happen, he'll keep working construction \u2014 and paying taxes \u2014 as he says he did for his work on the film. En el S\u00e9ptimo D\u00eda was shot over the summer of 2016, in the runup to the presidential election. Filmmaker Jim McKay says he resisted the temptation to make the film a polemic. \"It's really a story that \u2014 that would've been valid 12 years ago, and will, unfortunately, probably be valid into the future,\" he says. En el S\u00e9ptimo D\u00eda is currently screening in short runs across the country.",

With a population of just around 7,000, the small town of Galax in rural southwest Virginia has one of the fastest-growing Hispanic populations in the state. Young adults who were born in Galax or arrived as children are now starting families of their own. Immigration is near the top of the list of issues Americans find \"the most worrying,\" according to a new poll conducted for NPR by the research firm Ipsos. But Americans' views on immigration diverge sharply depending on party affiliation, where in the country we live, and whether we know people who were born outside the United States. To explore some of the poll's findings, we went to the small town of Galax, in rural southwestern Virginia, which has one of the fastest-growing Hispanic populations in the state. There, we found a community that holds many of the complicated \u2014 often conflicting \u2014 views on immigration that the nation does. About 7,000 people live in Galax, set in the gorgeous Blue Ridge Mountains, close by the North Carolina border. \"When I was growing up, Galax was very white; a very traditional small-town mountain community,\" says Elizabeth Stringer, 40, who teaches English as a Second Language at the high school. Over the past 18 years, she's seen her student caseload balloon. In the Galax schools now, almost a third of the students are Hispanic. Loading... Most of Stringer's students came from Mexico, but recently, she's been teaching more kids who fled from Honduras. \"Some of them through the desert,\" she says, \"some of them crawling through sewer pipes and being lost just to get here. \"I feel like anyone who can turn someone away who has done that to have a chance to live is just wrong.\" Armando Hernandez prepares lunch orders at El Torito restaurant in Galax, Va.

When Stringer hears President Trump compare undocumented immigrants to an \"invasion\" or \"infestation\" of the U.S., she bristles. \"I think of cockroaches,\" she says. \"I think of horrible nasty things to be eradicated and that's not what these people are. They're really good people.\" Another benchmark of Galax's demographic change: of the 11 starters on the high school boys' soccer team this past year, all but one were Hispanic. Striker Ricardo Osuna, 17, who just graduated from Galax High and whose father is Mexican, says the Galax community is open and welcoming. But the opposing teams? Not so much. \"When we played, there was a bunch of racism,\" he says. \"Like, 'Oh, wetbacks, get outta here!' Once I got a yellow card, and they were like, 'Hey ref, give him a green one, he probably needs it!' Everybody was really mad about it.\" The Latino soccer players have powered the Galax team to four state championships in the last five years. The champion team is celebrated with a triumphant victory parade through town, escorted by fire trucks and police cars. \"You can tell they've played for so long, since they were two or three years old,\" says head soccer coach Troy Barkley, 37. \"It's a way of life for some of these kids.\" Ricardo Osuna, right, who graduated from high school this spring, and head soccer coach Troy Barkley, left, leave the Galax High School field.

Barkley takes a liberal view of immigration, whether people have entered illegally or not. \"I feel like we're a nation of immigrants,\" he says. \"There's a reason they want to come here. Whether they're coming for a better life, or they're coming to escape something in their home country. \"I don't know how all of a sudden you can shut that off. I mean, that's kinda what the American dream's all about. So I think it's a good thing. Puts a lot of diversity in the community, makes it a real neat place to live.\" That doesn't mesh with the views of many of Barkley's Southwest Virginia neighbors. This part of Appalachia is solidly red. Nearly 80 percent of people in the surrounding counties voted for Trump, so the president's tough rhetoric on immigration and his zero-tolerance policies at the border have strong appeal here. Nationwide, our NPR-Ipsos survey shows a sharp partisan split. For example, 52 percent of Republicans support separating families who cross the border illegally, as a deterrent. Just 11 percent of Democrats and 25 percent of independents support family separation. Galax is famous for its musical heritage of old-time and bluegrass music; it hosts what it bills as the world's oldest and largest fiddlers' convention each August. The town used to be known for its once-thriving furniture and textile industry. Those factory jobs drew Hispanic immigrants to Galax starting in the 1990s, and even though many of the factories are now gone, the Hispanic population continues to grow. At Barr's Fiddle Shop on Main Street, a Galax institution, owner Tom Barr, 76, says he understands why people come: \"I've been to Central America, and I've seen poverty,\" he says. \"I don't blame them for trying to get here.\" Barr voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election. His son Stevie, 42, is a Trump voter, and says he admires the Hispanic population's work ethic. \"There's not a lot of folks around this area that I know of that will go and do what these Mexicans do. They work from daylight 'til dawn.\" But, he says, the workers should come legally. \"If you come properly, it's not an invasion,\" Barr says. \"I think it's a great thing. And if you're not going to come here and work and pay taxes and be part of what we believe in ... It's just the same way with the Muslims and other people. If you come here and you want to change all of our values, then you need go back home.\" Mike Stevens, 61, a furniture company executive, has stopped by the fiddle shop, and joins the conversation. Like Barr, he's a Trump voter. He supports building the wall at the Mexican border. Michael Stevens, senior executive vice president of Vaughan Furniture Company, sits at his desk in Galax, Va. Following the decline of the furniture production industry in Galax, the Vaughan Furniture Company was forced to largely shut down. Now Stevens oversees the leasing of their facilities and office spaces to other companies as they try to sell their large properties in town.\n                \n                    \n                    Madeline Gray for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michael Stevens, senior executive vice president of Vaughan Furniture Company, sits at his desk in Galax, Va. Following the decline of the furniture production industry in Galax, the Vaughan Furniture Company was forced to largely shut down. Now Stevens oversees the leasing of their facilities and office spaces to other companies as they try to sell their large properties in town. As for who should get priority as immigrants? \"Folks that need asylum,\" Stevens says, \"that truly need asylum. And folks that can benefit this country and not take advantage of the country.\" But, Stevens says, he believes that some asylum-seekers aren't legitimate; they're gaming the system. In the NPR/Ipsos poll, nearly 40 percent of those surveyed say that refugees and asylum seekers are taking unfair advantage of the system. Among Republicans, that number jumps to 65 percent. For Stevens, assimilation is key. \"I think folks need to come into this country and decide that they're gonna have the American values that we've had for 250 years, and say 'I'm an American. I'm no longer from [Mexico],' or wherever they come from \u2014 Honduras.\" \"Y'know, these two guys,\" Stevens continues, gesturing to the Barrs, \"We're Americans! We're not hyphenated Americans. I'm not a Polish-American, although I'm 50 percent Polish. I'm an American! So people should take the values of America, they should learn the language, and they should just say 'I'm an American.'\" Our poll shows Americans are evenly divided on whether immigrants do not easily assimilate into U.S. society. 33 percent agree that they do not; 31 percent disagree; 35 percent neither agree nor disagree or don't know. Still, Stevens believes those already in the U.S. should get a pathway to citizenship, to \"come out from the shadows,\" as he puts it: especially the DACA kids \u2014 the so-called \"Dreamers\" \u2014 brought here as children. On that, Stevens' views are in line with much of the country: 60 percent of those surveyed support giving legal status to DACA recipients. Galax resident Fabiola Escamilla is one of those DACA recipients. She was 13 when she came from Mexico without papers. Now 31, she has two sons, both born in the U.S., and she owns a small grocery store in Galax \u2014 a tienda \u2014 selling tortillas and salsa and arranging transfers for customers sending money back home. A small shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe sits behind the counter at the tienda that Fabiola Escamilla owns in Galax, Va. Escamilla is a DACA recipient.

After living for 18 years in this country, does Escamilla feel American? \"No,\" she replies. \"Mexican. 100 percent. I live in the United States, but I'm Mexican.\" As for her DACA status, she worries it will be snatched away. \"If Trump says you have to go, they kick you out,\" she says. \"It doesn't matter if you have DACA or not. I get really mad and really sad in thinking about the future.\" Escamilla believes the climate in Galax has gotten more hostile since Trump was elected, and as evidence, she mentions a troubling incident from last year. She was sitting outside her shop with her mother and some friends when a red truck drove by with an elderly white couple inside. \"And they scream at us, 'You immigrants, Mexicans, go back to Mexico! I'm gonna call the police!'\" she recalls. \"I was in shock.\" Disturbing as that encounter was, Escamilla didn't worry that the police would take any action against her. \"The police, they know me,\" she says. \"They come and buy drinks.\" The chief of the Galax police department, Rick Clark, 63, has lived in this community all his life. In Galax, he says, \"we're open and accepting. Work hard, pay your bills, take care of your kids, mind your own business \u2014 we're good with that.\" As the Hispanic population of Galax has grown, Clark has added two Hispanic officers to his police force of 24 to help build trust with the Latino community.

Clark supports giving undocumented immigrants legal status, even though, he admits, that's not necessarily a popular opinion here. And he believes Americans do have a moral obligation to take in those fleeing persecution or violence at home. \"I think that's what America stands for and it's why we were founded,\" he says. \"You know there's a phrase at the base of the Statue of Liberty: 'Give me your poor, your tired ...' I think we may have forgotten that.\" In our NPR-Ipsos poll, 46 percent of those surveyed agree that America has a moral obligation to accept refugees facing persecution; 26 percent disagree; and 28 percent said they neither agree nor disagree, or don't know. Our last stop in Galax is at a small Baptist church: Primera Iglesia Bautista. As the Hispanic congregation grew at the mother church, First Baptist, it also outgrew its space. So about four years ago, the Latino congregation moved to its own building for Spanish-language services. Ricky Alvarado helped start this church with his father, a pastor. Their family immigrated to the U.S. legally \u2014 \"the correct way,\" he says \u2014 from Costa Rica. \"I might be an oddball,\" Alvarado tells me. As a Latino Trump supporter, he agrees with the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy. \"You know the word itself says it: it's illegal,\" he says. \"You can't really go into someone's house or a country without permission. A lot of us did struggle a lot to become citizens of this country. And it's not fair if you come into this country illegally \u2014 come in through the window, I guess you could say, not the front door.\" At the same time, Alvarado knows that many in his congregation are undocumented. \"A lot of 'em actually came to this congregation a few days after they crossed the border,\" he says. \"There's desperation and there's a lot of a heavy background that they're running away from.\" So that puts Alvarado in a tough spot. \"This has become my family,\" he says. \"I would do anything I could to protect them.\" Like many in Galax, Alvarado has come to realize the immigration system in this country defies a simple fix.",

When it comes to immigration policy, American opinions often break down along party lines, with most Republicans supporting President Trump's views and Democrats vigorously opposed. But according to a new NPR-Ipsos poll, there is an even better predictor of how you feel about immigration: where you get your TV news. More than 1,000 people were asked about Trump's immigration policies and proposals and about which immigrants should get priority in the U.S. system. The poll was conducted in English and Spanish from June 19 to 20. Most respondents said they got their news mainly from TV. On some questions, people who get their TV news primarily from Fox News or CNN are even further apart than Republicans and Democrats, with viewers of the other big TV networks somewhere in between. Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson says he was surprised to find a connection in the data that is even stronger than partisanship.

The poll looked at other factors, including whether respondents live in a city, a suburb or a rural area. And there are some differences in opinion depending on where people live. Pollsters also looked at another factor they thought would really matter: whether respondents know anyone born outside the U.S., or are immigrants themselves. \"There is definitely a little bit of difference between people who are immigrants, or have an immigrant in their family, and people who don't know anyone from outside the U.S.,\" Jackson said. \"But it really pales when you at look at Republican and Democrat. And really compared to Fox and CNN,\" he said. For example, the poll asked whether immigrants are \"an important part of American identity.\" Barely half of Fox viewers said yes, compared with more than 70 percent of network TV and CNN viewers. When asked whether the U.S. has a \"moral obligation\" to accept refugees, only a quarter of Fox viewers said it does. Jackson says some of the biggest disagreements are over what is really motivating asylum-seekers to come here. \"CNN viewers, 68 percent of them think these people are fleeing real danger, real persecution. Whereas only 20 percent of Fox News viewers believe that,\" said Jackson. \"On the other hand, 72 percent \u2014 so almost three-quarters of Fox News viewers \u2014 think that refugee and asylum-seekers are just taking advantage of the system,\" Jackson said. \"They're trying to cheat their way in.\" A U.S. Border Patrol agent keeps watch at a gate on the U.S.-Mexico border fence near San Benito, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Loren Elliott/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A U.S. Border Patrol agent keeps watch at a gate on the U.S.-Mexico border fence near San Benito, Texas. It's not surprising, then, that there's a sharp difference in how poll respondents view the separation of migrant families who cross the border illegally, many seeking asylum. \"It's really the parents' responsibilities. They're the ones who take the kids through this ordeal to try to come to America,\" said Tricia McCary of Riverside, Calif., in a follow-up interview. McCary immigrated to the U.S. from China, legally, when she was 14, and is now a U.S. citizen. She said she rejected CNN as \"fake news\" after the 2016 election. Now McCary watches Fox News because she says that it's \"unbiased\" and that its coverage tends to match her views about undocumented immigrants. \"They're taking resources. They're taking jobs. And they're not contributing back to the community,\" McCary said. Contrast that with one poll respondent who doesn't watch Fox. \"I think that Fox News feeds on fear,\" said Bethany Bunnell, a Christian missionary in Minneapolis, in an interview. Bunnell says she gets her news from CNN and other online sources. She says the United States has an obligation to help people making the dangerous journey to the Southwest border to escape from violence and persecution. \"It would have to be a desperate situation to push them to such desperate measures,\" Bunnell said. \"I feel like we have the capacity to help. And why not welcome them?\" That said, the problem of what to do about asylum-seekers divides Bunnell's own family, just like it does the rest of the country. She says her parents watch Fox News.",

Updated 4:05 p.m. ET, July 19 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is asking a federal judge in Alabama to allow a group of Latino voters and the advocacy group Chicanos Por La Causa to defend a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Census Bureau's policy of including unauthorized immigrants in census numbers used to redistribute seats in Congress. The city of San Jose, Calif., Santa Clara County in California and King County in Washington joined them and filed a similar motion in court on July 17. Once a decade, the bureau counts every person living in the U.S. \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 for the census required by the Constitution, as the Census Bureau's acting director recently told NPR. After the Civil War, the 14th Amendment was ratified to mandate the counting of \"the whole number of persons\" in each state. That population tally determines the number of seats in the House of Representatives, as well as Electoral College votes in presidential elections, that each state gets. In May, the state of Alabama and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. They argue that the framers of the Constitution did not intend for the census numbers to include immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. In their complaint, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, alleges that after the upcoming 2020 census, the state may lose one of its seven congressional seats and one of its nine Electoral College votes to a state with a higher population of unauthorized immigrants. Alabama's complaint calls for the Census Bureau to exclude unauthorized immigrants from census numbers used for reapportionment. \"Adding a question regarding immigration status [to the census questionnaire] is one of several possible methods of excluding illegal aliens from the count used for apportionment,\" says a spokesperson for Alabama's attorney general, Mike Lewis, in an email. \"The reason why this has become so much more of an issue now than maybe it would have, you know, however many years ago is really the number of those who are in this country currently illegally,\" Marshall said in June after a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the census where he testified about the lawsuit. \"It's part of, I guess, a little bit of the national debate that we have right now about the enforcement of our immigration laws and what we've allowed.\" The Justice Department has assigned one of its attorneys, Brad Rosenberg, to the case. But the Trump administration has not yet filed a response to the complaint, which is due in court by Sept. 13, after a federal judge granted Rosenberg's request to extend the original deadline. A DOJ spokesperson, Devin O'Malley, declined to comment on when the department plans to file its reply and on the motions to intervene. At a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in May on the new citizenship question on the 2020 census, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, John Gore, was asked by Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., to comment on the importance of knowing the citizenship status of people counted for congressional reapportionment. \"I think that is a very important question and a very important issue,\" Gore replied. \"It's not one that the Department of Justice has taken a position on.\" The federal government's largest statistical agency has long included citizens of foreign countries living in the U.S. in national population counts. \"We have real concerns about whether the Trump administration, which is the defendant in the case, would actually put forward a vigorous defense of their continued counting of all persons as persons,\" says Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of MALDEF. On July 12, MALDEF filed a motion to intervene in the case on behalf of Chicanos Por La Causa and individual Latino voters from Arizona, California, Florida and Texas \u2014 states with high populations of Latino residents and unauthorized immigrants. In the court filing, Saenz argues that excluding unauthorized immigrants from census numbers could deny the communities where they live fair political representation. \"This is really attempting to reopen a debate that we haven't had in this country since the Civil War,\" he says, noting the original language in the Constitution specifying that enslaved people should be counted as \"three fifths of all other Persons.\" Attorneys for the city of San Jose, Calif., California's Santa Clara County and Washington's King County say their plaintiffs can lose access to federal dollars tied to census numbers if unauthorized immigrants are excluded from their population counts. \"Each of these jurisdictions is home to vibrant immigrant communities that also happen to include large numbers of undocumented people,\" says Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the legal groups representing San Jose and the two counties. \"They too stand to lose a significant share of federal funding if Alabama prevails in this case.\" Their court filing cites NPR's recent interview with the Census Bureau's Acting Director Ron Jarmin, who noted that \"whether it's funding for streets or for schools or for health care, decisions throughout the federal government are made based on the population of the local communities that people live in.\" Alabama's lawsuit against the Census Bureau comes as the agency is facing six separate lawsuits over a decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, to add a controversial question about U.S. citizenship status to the 2020 census. More than two dozen states and cities, as well as other groups, want the question removed because of fears of discouraging noncitizens from participating and harming the accuracy of the head count. While Ross has said the Justice Department needs responses from the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, a federal judge in New York City has said internal documents the Trump administration released suggest the decision to add the question may be politically motivated. In an email to Ross, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach suggested wording for a census citizenship question that asks noncitizens about their immigration status, after highlighting \"the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional reapportionment purposes.\" The Census Bureau referred a request for comment about the motions to intervene to the Commerce Department, which is also named in the Alabama lawsuit. A spokesperson for Commerce declined to comment. A spokesperson for Brooks deferred to the Alabama's attorney general's office for comment on MALDEF's filing, but a spokesperson for Marshall also declined to comment. Neither spokesperson has responded to NPR's inquiries about the motion by attorneys for San Jose, California's Santa Clara County and Washington's King County. Asked by a reporter after the House hearing in June whether he has any expectation that the Trump administration will defend the Census Bureau in this lawsuit, Brooks told NPR that he had not spoken with anyone in the administration about what position it will take. \"The Trump administration itself is going to have to decide whether they want to reward sanctuary states by giving them more congressional seats and more Electoral College votes than they would be due based solely on account of American citizens or foreigners who are lawfully in the U.S.,\" he said.",

President Trump is expected to announce his choice for Supreme Court justice Monday evening.\n                \n                    \n                    J. David Ake/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption News crews set up in front of the Supreme Court early Monday morning in Washington, D.C. President Trump is expected to announce his choice for Supreme Court justice Monday evening. Updated at 5:25 p.m. ET With just hours to go before the official announcement, President Trump has made a decision on his pick for the next Supreme Court justice, a source close to the decision-making process tells NPR's Mara Liasson. But there is still no indication which of the four finalists it will be. As of Monday morning, Trump was still deciding among  Judges Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge and Amy Coney Barrett. After less than two weeks of deliberations, Trump is set to announce Monday at 9 p.m. ET his nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, a choice that could well affect the court, and Americans' constitutional rights, for a generation. Ahead of the decision, Trump has built suspense about whom his pick will be. Departing his New Jersey golf club on Sunday afternoon, Trump told reporters he was still making up his mind. \"It's \u2014 well, let's just say it's the four people. Every one, you can't go wrong.\" Hardiman was the runner-up to succeed Antonin Scalia, the seat Neil Gorsuch eventually occupied after being confirmed in 2017. The president has again been impressed by his life story, as someone with humble roots \u2014 the first in his family to go to college and even that he drove a taxi to help pay for law school. But the president has also been impressed by Kavanaugh, the most experienced judge on the list, having penned nearly 300 decisions on the second-most-powerful court in the country; as well as Barrett, a devout Catholic, who has become a hero of religious conservatives after having her membership in a conservative religious organization questioned by Sen. Dianne Feinstein last year during her confirmation hearing to the federal bench. Kavanaugh's ties to the Bush administration and his lengthy paper trail as well as Barrett's lack of experience \u2014 just one year as a judge \u2014 were seen as negatives for each. Anticipation was high on Capitol Hill in the hours leading up to the announcement. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters that he was really pleased with the chance to confirm a second conservative justice to the Supreme Court in two years. \"I didn't know Justice Kennedy was going make this decision to retire but I like the timing and I think the quality of the potential successors is very high,\" Cornyn said. \"So I'm happy.\" The White House announced Monday that former Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., would guide the nominee through the confirmation process, including preparing for meetings with senators. Senate Republicans are pleased that Kyl will be the one to help the nominee navigate the arduous confirmation process. He is well-liked in the Senate and was personally recommended by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a good choice to support the president's nominee prep for one-on-one sessions on Capitol Hill. His job, known as the \"Sherpa,\" is to help the nominee anticipate the types of questions senators might pose. He might also be asked to sit in on the meetings or help guide the conversations behind closed doors. Kyl will also work with the nominee ahead of public hearings and other events. Republican aides said Monday that they expect the whole process could take about two months. It is a high-profile vetting process that will kick off with the public event at the White House on Monday night. Cornyn told reporters that he will join about 30 Senate Republicans at the White House prime-time announcement. Three of the most endangered Senate Democrats \u2014 Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\u2014 were also invited to the event but will not be attending. All of the candidates are relatively young and could help shape legal doctrine on the high court for decades to come. All are conservative jurists in the mold of Trump's previous Supreme Court pick, Gorsuch. Trump's approach to naming a new Supreme Court justice has unnerved some Democrats. \"I am concerned that he's making it like a game show,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told NPR's Morning Edition. \"I am thinking about this person. I am thinking of that person, but I will announce it on prime-time TV at the White House. Whoever is nominated, whoever he or she is, if they're confirmed, they're going to be there for a long time.\" The potential nominees Kethledge, a former Kennedy law clerk, has sat on the 6th Circuit since 2008 after being nominated by George W. Bush. He is 51, and among all the reported shortlisters, he is the only non-Catholic. He is an evangelical Christian whose book, Lead Yourself First, uses President Dwight Eisenhower, primatologist Jane Goodall, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King Jr. and others as examples of \"leaders who have used solitude to function more effectively.\" Sure to be controversial is a 2017 decision involving the alleged targeting of Hispanics for questioning by Border Patrol agents. In that decision, Kethledge accepted the assertions of Border Patrol agents that in using the terms \"wets\" and \"tonks,\" they were referring to undocumented persons generally and not to Hispanics specifically. And in a rape case, Kethledge dissented. He would have allowed the trial court to hear evidence of the accuser's sexual history with the defendant. In another criminal case, he wrote that police do not have to obtain a search warrant to obtain a suspect's cellphone location information. That decision was reversed by the Supreme Court this year in a landmark ruling. Barrett, who is 46, has less of a judicial record to review, having just been nominated to the appeals court by Trump last year. She is a former University of Notre Dame law professor (and a graduate of the school; Kavanaugh, meanwhile, received his undergrad and law degrees from Yale). She was a law clerk for Scalia. During her nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barrett was questioned about her religious beliefs. Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Barrett, a Catholic, that \"the dogma lives loudly within you,\" suggesting her faith would influence her judicial decisions \u2014 a statement that was roundly criticized. Barrett has been somewhat dismissive of the notion of following Supreme Court precedents, the doctrine known as stare decisis. She wrote that \"there is little reason to think that reversals [of past decisions] would do much damage\" to the court's reputation.\" Barrett said she tends to agree \"with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution,\" rather than a precedent she thinks is clearly in conflict with it.\" Such comments are likely to raise a red flag to moderate Republican senators like Susan Collins, R-Maine, who have said they would not vote for a nominee who has expressed doubts about observing precedents when it comes to abortion and other long-standing Supreme Court decisions. Hardiman, 53, was nominated to the federal trial court by George W. Bush in 2003 and to the 3rd Circuit in 2007, when he was confirmed by the Senate in a 95-0 vote. Trump is said to have particularly liked Hardiman's life story. He was the first in his family to go to college, at the University of Notre Dame, then worked as a taxi driver to finance his legal education at Georgetown Law School. More than the other potential nominees, Hardiman has a strong record in favor of gun rights. When the court he serves on upheld a New Jersey law requiring a gun owner to obtain a permit to carry a gun in public places and show \"a justifiable need\" to carry the gun, Hardiman dissented, chastising the majority for upholding a law that dates to 1966 (and arguably 1924) as insufficiently long-standing. In 2017, when Hardiman was last considered for a Supreme Court seat, he had the support of the president's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. Barry served alongside Hardiman as a federal appeals judge on the 3rd Circuit before stepping down last year. Kavanaugh, 53, was first nominated to the appeals court by President George W. Bush in 2003. He had previously worked with independent counsel Kenneth Starr in the investigation of President Bill Clinton and was involved in the Florida presidential vote recount in 2000. In his dozen years on the court, Kavanaugh has been involved in some 286 opinions. In a recent case involving abortion and immigration, he wrote a decision that temporarily barred a pregnant teenager in immigration custody from obtaining an abortion. The opinion, written for a three-judge panel, was eventually overturned by the full court. In a 2013 law review article, Kavanaugh wrote that after seeing firsthand the many difficult duties that a president encounters, he thinks that presidents should operate free from the threat of civil suits, such as the sexual harassment suit that led to Clinton's impeachment, and that presidents should also be free from criminal investigation. Those views could have implications for independent counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump. With a slim one-vote majority in the Senate, any GOP defections could prove problematic in winning confirmation for Trump's eventual choice \u2014 that is, if Democrats hold together in opposition. And that is a big if. Ten Democrats from states that Trump won are up for re-election this fall and will be under tremendous pressure to back the president's nominee. Other Democrats who represent heavily Republican states will also be under pressure to support the nominee. \"I'm open to voting yes. I'm open to voting no. We don't know who the nominee is going to be yet,\" Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., said in a Sunday interview on CNN's State of the Union. \"I don't think my role is to rubber-stamp for the president, but it's also not an automatic knee-jerk no, either.\" McConnell has promised a vote on the nomination before the November midterms, ensuring the outcome will be an issue before voters.

The internal White House debate over who should replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court reflects the broader political split within the Republican Party \u2014 and the mistrust that is nursed by outside-the-Beltway social conservatives about the more establishment and business-oriented wing of the party. So it is perhaps no surprise that a quintessentially Washingtonian fight has erupted between the supporters of the two leading candidates for the nomination, Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Judge Amy Coney Barrett. It's like a color war in camp. A prominent legal conservative of the behind-the-scene battle over Judges Kavanaugh and Barrett While Barrett's supporters portray Kavanaugh as insufficiently conservative, Kavanaugh's supporters portray Barrett as insufficiently experienced \u2014 a judge whose conservative credentials are not yet clear in her opinions. In truth, both are very conservative legal believers who would undoubtedly push the Supreme Court far to the right of where it was during Kennedy's more centrist conservative time on the Supreme Court. Barrett has a long paper trail of academic writing in the law, but Kavanaugh has a long paper trail of actual legal opinions. Both have written things that Democrats could use against them at confirmation hearings. But what is interesting to watch is two factions of Republicans, behind the scenes, battling each other, leaking unflattering and even false things about either Kavanaugh or Barrett. Social conservatives seem to have coalesced behind Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who spent much of her career as a law professor at Notre Dame.\n                \n                    \n                    University of Notre Dame Law School via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Social conservatives seem to have coalesced behind Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who spent much of her career as a law professor at Notre Dame. Social conservatives seem to have coalesced behind Barrett, who spent much of her career as a law professor at Notre Dame. She is a mother of seven children, two of them adopted from Haiti, and she is an active member of a particularly conservative Catholic religious group called People of Praise. Although there were rumors that her interview with President Trump did not go well last week, sources tell NPR that is not true and that the president wants to appoint her to the Supreme Court, but is concerned about her lack of a record on the bench. Within the White House, those in charge of the selection process, especially counsel Don McGahn, want a no-sweat redo of the process that produced the president's 2017 Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch. Trump essentially outsourced much of that selection process to the conservative Federalist Society. The result was that while the White House was in chaos in the early months of the administration, the Gorsuch selection went smoothly, as did a confirmation process that included getting rid of the century-old filibuster rule in the Senate that would have required a 60-vote majority to win confirmation. While social conservatives have repeatedly thanked Trump for the Gorsuch nomination, they seem to want more. In an open letter last week, leaders of the American Family Association, the American Principles Project and other socially conservative groups urged the appointment of Barrett. \"It is better to have a vacancy until next year than to fill the seat with a weak nominee who will betray your legacy and the constitution for the next 40 years,\" they wrote. Why the strong preference for Barrett over Kavanaugh? As one prominent legal conservative put it, \"It's like a color war in camp.\" Each side just distrusts the other. One suspects that, in the end, the president will go for the safest choice, the choice that will cause the least trouble and result in a relatively quick confirmation process. That would be Kavanaugh. While nobody is saying that the president has finally made up his mind, those opposed to Kavanaugh are running out of time to gin up a real opposition within the conservative movement. Of course, there is always the possibility that knocking out Kavanaugh would not mean knocking in Barrett. It might also mean that another one of the below judges gets the nod, including Judge Raymond Kethledge of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Michigan. The president met with Kethledge and reportedly got along with him. Still in the mix, too, is Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, the runner-up from the last go-round, when Gorsuch was elevated instead. Less likely, but also still a consideration, is Amul Thapar of Kentucky. Thapar is the preferred judge of Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky senator and Senate majority leader, who controls the confirmation process and timing in the U.S. Senate. Here's a look at the pros, cons and records of each of the candidates on the shortlist: Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Kavanaugh, 53, is a former clerk to the man he could replace on the Supreme Court, Kennedy. He was named to the D.C. Circuit by George W. Bush in 2003, but his confirmation was stalled by Democrats for nearly three years. They said he was too partisan, young and inexperienced. They also said he was too partisan because of his work for independent counsel Kenneth Starr in the investigation of President Bill Clinton, his involvement in the Florida recount in 2000, and his work as a counsel and later staff secretary for Bush, during which he took strong positions in favor of presidential power and privilege. In 2006, he was finally confirmed. Kavanaugh's record on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, with some 286-plus opinions, is definitely the most prolific of any of the potential nominees. It is a record noteworthy for its skill and conservatism. In a recent case that combined the controversial issues of abortion and immigration, he wrote a decision that temporarily barred a pregnant teenager, who was in immigration custody, from obtaining an abortion. The decision, for a three-judge court, was subsequently overturned by the full court, over Kavanaugh's dissent. He also dissented in a case involving a challenge brought by religious groups to the contraception provision of the Affordable Care Act. That regulation required religious groups to certify that they were exempting themselves from providing contraceptive services; it was eventually withdrawn by the Trump administration. On questions involving government regulation, he often, but not always, has sought to limit or throw out Obama-era environmental regulations. Kavanaugh has also authored or signed on to a number of opinions deferring to presidential power in high-profile cases. For instance, after the Supreme Court ruled that enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detentions in court, Kavanaugh was among the conservative judges on the D.C. Circuit who subsequently ruled in ways that critics have said actively subverted the high court's decision, so as to render it toothless. Finally, Kavanaugh wrote an extensive law review article in 2009 that could have implications for the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In that article, he said that after seeing firsthand the many difficult duties that a president encounters, he thinks, in retrospect, that presidents should operate free from the threat of civil suits \u2014 like the sexual harassment suit that led to Clinton's impeachment \u2014 and that presidents should also be free from criminal investigations. The article seems to suggest that both of these presidential protections should be enacted by Congress but does not say do without qualification. Such views could well have implications for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump, including the question of whether the president can be subpoenaed to answer questions about his possible involvement in criminal activity. The ultimate check on a president's criminal actions, Kavanaugh said, is impeachment, but he does not say how members of Congress might gather the needed information for such a proceeding. Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit Barrett, 46, a former University of Notre Dame law professor, was nominated to the appeals court by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in October 2017. She was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. At Barrett's confirmation hearing, some Democrats questioned whether her Catholic beliefs, which they characterized as religious \"dogma,\" would influence her legal decisions, a suggestion that outraged many of her defenders, both Catholic and non-Catholic alike. In her academic writing, she has written somewhat dismissively of the doctrine of respecting the Supreme Court's precedents \u2014 a doctrine known as stare decisis. \"There is little reason to think that reversals [of past decisions] would do much damage\" to the court's reputation, she wrote. \"I tend to agree with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution\" rather than to a precedent she thinks is clearly in conflict with it. Such comments are likely to raise a red flag to Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, who have said they would not vote for a nominee who has expressed doubts about stare decisis when it comes to abortion and other long-standing Supreme Court decisions. Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit Kethledge, another former Kennedy law clerk, has been identified as the third top contender for the open court seat. First nominated to the 6th Circuit by George W. Bush in 2006, his nomination stalled because of opposition from Michigan's two Democratic senators. Among all the reported short-listers, Raymond Kethledge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the only non-Catholic.\n                \n                    \n                    Image from video provided by C-SPAN via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Among all the reported short-listers, Raymond Kethledge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the only non-Catholic. Bush renominated Kethledge in 2007, and he was finally approved by the Senate in 2008. He is 51, and among all the reported short-listers, he is the only non-Catholic. He is an evangelical Christian whose book Lead Yourself First uses President Dwight Eisenhower, primatologist Jane Goodall, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King Jr. and others as examples of \"leaders who have used solitude to function more effectively.\" Among Kethledge's notable rulings is a 2016 decision in favor of a group called NorCal Tea Party Patriots, condemning the IRS for appearing to target conservative groups by slowing down their applications for tax-exempt status. Sure to be controversial is a 2017 decision involving the alleged targeting of Hispanics for questioning by Border Patrol agents. In that decision, Kethledge accepted the assertions of Border Patrol agents that in using the terms \"wets\" and \"tonks,\" they were referring to undocumented persons generally and not to Hispanics specifically. And in a rape case, Kethledge dissented. He would have allowed the trial court to hear evidence of the accuser's sexual history with the defendant. In another criminal case, he wrote that police do not have to obtain a search warrant to obtain a suspect's cellphone location information. That decision was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court this year in a landmark ruling.

The 52-year-old Hardiman was nominated to the federal trial court by George W. Bush in 2003 and to the 3rd Circuit in 2007 and was confirmed by the Senate in a 95-0 vote. He was the runner-up to succeed Scalia on the Supreme Court, the seat Gorsuch was eventually tapped to fill. Trump is said to have particularly liked Hardiman's life story. He was the first in his family to go to college, at the University of Notre Dame, then worked as a taxi driver to finance his legal education at Georgetown Law School. More than the other potential nominees, Hardiman has a strong record in favor of gun rights. When the court he serves on upheld a New Jersey law requiring a gun owner to obtain a permit to carry a gun in public places and to show that he has \"a justifiable need\" to carry the gun, Hardiman dissented, chastising the majority for upholding a law that dates to 1966 (and arguably 1924) as insufficiently long-standing. In 2017, when Hardiman was last considered for a Supreme Court seat, he had the support of the president's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. Barry served alongside Hardiman as a federal appeals judge on the 3rd Circuit before stepping down last year.

The son of Indian immigrants, Thapar, age 49, has had a meteoric rise. Originally from Michigan, he is a personal favorite of Senate Republican leader McConnell of Kentucky, who in 2006 handpicked him to be one of two U.S. attorneys in the state. A year later, Thapar was nominated to the federal trial court by President George W. Bush and confirmed unanimously. He was the first federal court judge of South Asian descent. In 2017, Trump nominated Thapar to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers much of the Midwest. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Thapar's father, Raj Thapar, who owns a heating and air-conditioning supply business in Toledo, Ohio, says his son is \"so conservative that he 'nearly wouldn't speak to me after I voted for Barack Obama.' \" Most of Thapar's judicial record stems from his tenure as a federal district judge. However, a significant part of his record would seem to reflect his tenure as a federal prosecutor in Cincinnati; Washington, D.C.; and ultimately as the chief federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Kentucky. One high-profile case involved three members of the Christian pacifist group Plowshares, including a nun in her 80s, who were convicted of invading a federal nuclear plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., splattering blood and writing anti-war messages on the wall. They were convicted of a variety of charges, including sabotage. Thapar denied their motion for a judgment of acquittal on the sabotage charge, saying the Constitution leaves the judgment of whether it makes \"sense to deal as harshly with non-violent protesters as with foreign saboteurs ... to the policymaking branches.\" He then sentenced two of the protesters to five years in prison, and the 84-year-old nun, Sister Megan-Rice, to a 35-month term. The sabotage conviction was later overturned by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, in an opinion written by another Trump potential nominee, Kethledge.

He has promised to deport migrants.\n                \n                    \n                    Gregorio Borgia/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini applauds during the swearing-in ceremony for Italy's new government in Rome on June 1. He has promised to deport migrants. European Union leaders wrangled over migration policy reforms in an all-night meeting in Brussels. And one of the bloc's newest and loudest critics, the barely month-old government of Italy, is claiming a big win. In the early hours of Friday, the EU states said they agreed on a package of plans, which included key demands from Italy: more support for \"front-line\" entry countries, stronger efforts to counter human smuggling and the establishment of more centers for holding and processing asylum-seekers. Italy is a front-line country for immigrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean to Europe. Its populist leaders oppose a rule that says the country where migrants first land is responsible for determining whether to let them stay. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte \u2014 in his government's first major EU summit appearance \u2014 had threatened to veto any deals if his country did not get more help with migration issues. He sounded satisfied with the outcome. \"Italy is no longer alone,\" Conte told reporters as he left the meetings Friday. The Italian populists' rise to power, analysts say, came largely because of a sense among voters that Italy has been abandoned by its EU partners in handling the migrant crisis. But it's one of Conte's deputies \u2014 Interior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 who has emerged as a powerful hard-liner shaping the country's anti-immigration stance. In office less than a month, Salvini has dominated the national spotlight and thrown down the gauntlet to the European Union. He has said Italy is ready to renegotiate its financial commitments to the EU if more is not done to help the country deal with migration. As leader of the right-wing League party, Salvini campaigned on the slogan \"Italians first\" \u2014 with clear echoes of Trumpism, which he endorsed early on \u2014 and pledged to deport 100,000 undocumented migrants in his first year in office and to expel hundreds of thousands more in the rest of his term. The government has turned away hundreds of migrants on rescue ships this month. But kicking out people already in Italy has proved difficult. More than 600,000 migrants from dozens of countries have landed by sea in Italy since 2014, according to United Nations data. Many have applied for asylum. Italy rejected 42,000 asylum claims last year, according to the Asylum Information Database website. But the country expelled a little more than 7,000 migrants in 2017, The Associated Press reported. The news agency said many of the migrants' home countries lack diplomatic agreements with Italy and are unwilling to take deported citizens back. But Salvini has repeated his vow to expel undocumented migrants. He is one of Italy's deputy prime ministers as well as its interior minister \u2014 a key domestic security post overseeing law enforcement. Within days of taking office on June 1, Salvini ordered a block on docking rights to Aquarius, a humanitarian relief ship carrying more than 600 migrants rescued at sea. The ship, which was off Italian waters, ultimately found refuge in the Spanish port of Valencia after several days sailing in rough seas. Salvini was adamant, saying earlier this month that \"if anyone in the EU thinks Italy should keep being a landing point and refugee camp, they have misunderstood.\" Registering Roma A few days later, Salvini was denounced by critics in and outside Italy for saying he wants a census or registry of Roma people in Italy. (The Roma are also called \"Gypsies,\" though many community members find the term derogatory.) \"The plan's aim is to care for Roma children who,\" Salvini claimed in a Facebook post, \"are brought up into a life of crime.\" Human rights activists in Italy are furious. They have pointed out that about half of the estimated 120,000 to 180,000 Roma population in the country are Italian citizens. Speaking of Roma who are Italian citizens, Salvini said, \"unfortunately, we have to keep them.\" The Italian Constitution bans taking a census based on ethnicity. Moderate and leftist Italian politicians said the census idea recalled late 1930s fascist-era laws persecuting minority groups including Roma and Jews. The Roma census proposal was a step too far even for Salvini's government coalition partner and fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio. \"We can't do it,\" Di Maio, the leader of the 5-Star Movement, said of the proposal. \"Let's start working on the problems of millions of Italians who can no longer eat.\" From marginal to dominant figure Despite accusations of racism and xenophobia by critics on the left, Salvini is emerging as the dominant figure in Italian politics. Only a few months ago, he was considered a marginal candidate. But in the March 4 general election, the League party won 17 percent of the vote. The 5-Star Movement scored 33 percent, but that was not enough to govern alone. So it joined forces with the League to form a government. Since March, the League's popularity surged to more than 29 percent in a recent poll. It has been quite a ride for Salvini since his political career began in the 1990s, in what was then called the Northern League, a secessionist group that blamed southern Italians for the country's economic problems and corruption. In 2013, he took over the party leadership and dropped \"Northern\" from its name. He sought to rally all Italians and shifted the focus to negative impacts of globalization, income inequality, joblessness, resentment toward EU regulations and, most of all, fears deriving from a perceived surge in migrant arrivals. Salvini adopted slogans of the neo-fascist group CasaPound Italia, such as \"Italy for Italians.\" In a short time, Salvini has become one of the most prominent European champions of populist and nativist policies, Euroskepticism and what is called \"sovereignism,\" the doctrine of maintaining independence from international associations such as the EU. His strongest allies outside Italy include Nigel Farage, the promoter of Brexit in the U.K., France's hard-right leader Marine Le Pen and Hungary's increasingly authoritarian and anti-immigrant leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, hailed the creation of Italy's new populist government. \"The Italian people have gone farther, in a shorter period of time, than the British did for Brexit and the Americans did for Trump. Italy is the leader,\" he said in March, according to The New York Times. Bell'incontro oggi al @Viminale con John R. #Bolton, consigliere del presidente @realDonaldTrump per la sicurezza nazionale. Piena condivisione sui temi della lotta all'immigrazione clandestina e del terrorismo. pic.twitter.com/QBL8jk3hPr On Tuesday, Salvini tweeted a photo of himself shaking hands with John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, and wrote that the two engaged in \"sharing on issues of combating illegal immigration and terrorism.\" One of the administration's adversaries, meanwhile, is the government of France. President Emmanuel Macron has warned of what he sees as the dangers of populism spreading across Europe. \"You can see them rise a bit like a leprosy all across Europe, in countries where we thought that would be impossible to see them again, in neighboring countries,\" Macron said on June 21. Without mentioning Italy by name, he added, \"They're saying the worst things, and we're getting used to it. They're making provocations, and nobody is horrified by that.\" But this week in Brussels, France and Italy apparently saw eye to eye on some things. As talks went into the wee hours, Bloomberg even said it was \"Macron's bow to Italy\" that made Friday's deal happen. For now, the populists are relishing an early victory. \"I am satisfied and proud about the results our government achieved in Brussels,\" Salvini said Friday in a statement. \"In contrast to nothing\" achieved by previous Italian governments, he continued, \"many of our requests were accepted. On others, there is still work to be done. But finally Italy has emerged from isolation and is once again a player.\"",

David Koch, one half of the billionaire duo that built one of the nation's largest privately owned companies and one of its most controversial political networks, has announced his retirement from politics and business. In a letter to Koch Industries employees written by his brother Charles Koch, the men announced that David was stepping down due to health concerns. \"We are deeply saddened by this, as we miss David's insightful questions and his many contributions to Koch Industries,\" Charles Koch wrote. \"He was instrumental in building our Chemical Technology Group 1,000-fold from a single-product business.\" David Koch was diagnosed with prostate cancer 25 years ago and was hospitalized in 2016. He has focused many of his philanthropic efforts on finding a cure for prostate cancer, including with contributions of nearly $600 million to medical research and institutions. But Koch is perhaps better known for his work as an industrialist and his support for libertarian political causes. Koch Industries is the second largest privately held company in America, with revenue of $100 billion in 2017, according to Forbes. The emergence of the Koch brothers as household names, especially in political circles, accompanied the rise of the tea party movement during and after Barack Obama's campaign for the presidency. The Kochs' funding of libertarian, conservative and Republican causes was viewed by Democrats with disdain during the Obama era. \"What is un-American is when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system to benefit themselves and the wealthiest one percent... the Koch brothers seem to believe in an America where the system is rigged to benefit the very wealthy,\" then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said during a floor speech in 2014. Continued Ried: \"The Koch brothers and other moneyed interests are influencing the politics in a way not seen for generations.\" David Koch is now stepping away from all of these political activities, even as his brother Charles remains the CEO of Koch Industries and a prominent voice within the Koch political network, which includes groups such as Americans for Prosperity. That political network shows no signs of slowing down. The Koch network has plans to spend up to $400 million on politics and policy initiatives during the 2018 midterm election cycle. And in a sign about its shifting strategy, it appears to be more willing to take on the Trump administration than many other political organizations on the right. The Koch network has signaled its willingness to challenge the president on trade tariffs; has announced that it spend money to support a Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, for backing a deregulation bill; and sent out mailers backing Democrats who stood with them on supporting a permanent fix for DREAMers, undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors.",

Mattarella approved the lawyer's nomination to serve as prime minister. It took Italy's leading parties nearly three months of turbulent negotiations to hammer out a governing arrangement, but they've finally done it. The 5-Star Movement and the League \u2014 two populist parties that have agreed on little aside from their shared hostility toward the domestic political establishment, illegal migration and the European Union \u2014 finally settled on an unconventional pick for prime minister: lawyer Giuseppe Conte, a political novice with no government experience. Italy's center-left president, Sergio Mattarella, formally approved Conte's nomination for premier Wednesday after a few days of deliberation, giving him the mandate to form a government. Conte and the ministers he selects still require a vote of confidence in parliament, though the new government is expected to approve. The move ends the uncertainty that had simmered for weeks in Italy's upper echelons of power, since the 5-Star Movement, a Web-based protest party, and the far-right League emerged as the principal winners of March's parliamentary elections. At the time, as NPR's Sylvia Poggioli noted, local media declared that the results made Italy \"ungovernable,\" and that prophecy appeared close to fulfillment earlier this month. Now that Conte has assumed the mantle of prime minister-designate and begun the complicated task of completing his cabinet, the question of who will lead has been answered \u2014 but many other pressing puzzles remain. Among them is a simple question: Who, exactly, is Conte? The 53-year-old law professor has no official political affiliation, has no government position and has even faced doubts around details on his resume. He was such an obscure choice for premier, in fact, that Agence France-Presse reports that his news conference Wednesday marked \"the first time many had heard Conte's voice.\" \"I'm preparing now to defend the interests of all Italians in all places, in Europe and internationally,\" he told journalists after his two-hour meeting with Mattarella, according to Reuters. \"I will be the defense lawyer for the Italian people.\" Conte has quite a task ahead of him, both at home and abroad. Both parties at the heart of his coalition found success at the polls \u2014 riding a wave of popular dissatisfaction with the status quo, aiming their barbs at the EU and at the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy over the past four years. Poggioli reported that the League's Matteo Salvini, for one, made a campaign promise to deport all undocumented migrants. But beyond those leanings, agreements have been hard to come by since the election \u2014 so hard, in fact, that the parties have reportedly proposed a \"conciliation committee\" to try to settle disputes within the coalition. Their program, forged from long and, at times, strained negotiations, also includes a mixture of lower taxes and higher spending that has unnerved some European economists wary of ballooning debt. But the skepticism goes both ways, as the fledgling coalition has vaguely promised to assert Italy's sovereignty and review its agreements with the EU. Some European officials, such as Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, have expressed hope that common ground can still be found. \"The fact that Giuseppe Conte spoke in favor of a dialogue with the European institutions is a step in the right direction,\" he said.",

He was joined by committee Chairman Mike Conaway (from left), House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Updated at 6:21 p.m. ET The House rejected a $867 billion farm bill on Friday \u2014 after spending days negotiating with key conservatives in an attempt to pass the bill without the support of Democrats. The vote was 198-213. Every Democrat voted against the measure, as did 30 Republicans. Many of the GOP lawmakers are members of the House Freedom Caucus and voted no after failing to get concessions on spending and a future vote on immigration in exchange for their support. Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters after the vote that voters elected Republicans to rein in illegal immigration and lawmakers have failed to act. \"Some members have concerns about the farm bill. but that wasn't my main focus,\" Jordan said. \"My main focus was making sure we do immigration policy right.\" The failure was an embarrassment for House leaders, who tried to pressure their members to fall in line on the farm legislation. Leaders promised conservatives a chance to vote on a hard-line immigration bill in the coming weeks, but that did not satisfy the influential bloc. Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., said leaders believed they had the votes for the farm policy, but conservatives chose to wreak havoc anyway. \"We had enough members who were willing to vote yes on the farm bill,\" McHenry said. \"[They] had a commitment on when we would vote on immigration but wanted to hijack the process to get an immigration vote before they actually fulfilled their pledge that they made to their constituents on the farm bill.\" The future of the bill is uncertain. Republican leaders are discussing ways to bring it up again. A revote could hinge on whether GOP leaders agree to a vote on a controversial immigration bill that many Republican moderates oppose. Those members, many running for re-election in competitive districts, are pressing, instead, for a vote on a measure that gives a path to citizenship for children of undocumented workers. In a statement, White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said President Trump \"is disappointed in the result of today's vote, and hopes the House can resolve any remaining issues in order to achieve strong work requirements and support our nation's agricultural community.\" On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted his support for the farm bill. Tomorrow, the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill, which includes work requirements. We must support our Nation\u2019s great farmers! The Freedom Caucus had extra leverage in the talks because most Democrats oppose this farm bill because of changes to food stamps. The farm bill is generally known as the biggest safety net for millions of farmers across the country. But it also includes the Supplemental Nutrition Program \u2014 known as SNAP or food stamps. Last year, 40 million people used the program, totaling about $70 billion in spending. Republicans and Trump want strict work requirements for people who receive those benefits, a plan Democrats reject. That left House leaders searching for conservative votes. But conservatives oppose the amount of spending on SNAP in the bill. The food stamp fight turned the once-bipartisan safety-net package into another contentious political battle in the House. It also pits the House against the Senate, where Republicans are working with Democrats on a compromise bill. The top GOP senator crafting that chamber's version, Pat Roberts of Kansas, has already indicated he is starting from a different framework. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., followed through on a threat to hold up passage of the bill until the group can extract a vote on security-focused immigration legislation by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. His proposal has been opposed by Democrats and would have required passage on the strength of GOP votes alone \u2014 a level of support that GOP leaders insisted the Goodlatte bill does not have on the House floor. And conservatives, like Meadows, have turned the legislation into a last-minute election-year opportunity. They want Republicans to deliver on their promise to cut government spending. \"You know, 76 percent of this farm bill has nothing to do with farms,\" Meadows said in a recent appearance on C-SPAN. \"When you look at that, 24 percent of it actually is about farms and supporting our farmers.\" But food stamps are in the farm bill because of politics. The program was added in the 1970s as a way to persuade urban lawmakers to vote for an expensive safety net for farmers. And for decades, it worked. That coalition is at risk of crumbling this year after House Democrats all but abandoned negotiations. Last month at a hearing on the bill, Collin Peterson, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, blamed Republicans for forcing Democrats out of the negotiations. \"I didn't walk away; we didn't walk away,\" Peterson said. \"We were pushed away by an ideological fight I repeatedly warned the chairman not to start.\" Peterson, of Minnesota, said he has worked with Republicans on every farm bill since the early 1990s. Following Friday's vote he said he was willing to work with Republicans on a bill, and deliver votes from Democrats, provided that food stamps are protected. \"If they will listen to me I can deliver a lot of Democrats on this bill,\" Peterson said. \"If they listen to me. That's up to them. The ball is in their court.\" But House Republicans had the backing of Trump on the food stamp provision. They wanted strict requirements that recipients who are healthy and able to work spend time searching for jobs \u2014 and getting training or volunteering. And they say voters agree. Republicans point to polls from the right-leaning Foundation for Government Accountability. The group's vice president for federal affairs, Kristina Rasmussen, says the support crosses ideological lines. \"You see 7 out of 10 Democrats supporting these ideas,\" Rasmussen said in an interview. \"Independents usually come in at 8 out of 10, Republicans 9 out of 10.\" Support or no, this version of the bill would have been dead on arrival in the Senate, where Democrats have more sway. \"Regardless of what happens in the House, and I hope they can get something passed, the Senate is working toward a bipartisan bill because we have to get 60 votes,\" Roberts said prior to the vote. The current farm law expires at the end of September \u2014 all but ensuring that the fight will continue right up until the next election.

It's rare that a candidate for public office would be happy to come in second. But that is the case in the governor's race in California. There has been no question about the front-runner. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, former San Francisco mayor, has led in every poll. But that doesn't just affect his fellow Democrats. California has an open primary, which means that every candidate from every party competes on the same ballot. The top two finishers, regardless of party, go head-to-head in November. The great fear among Republicans is that they could be shut out entirely. The number of California voters registered as Republicans has declined steadily over the years. They're now just 25 percent of the electorate. So if Republican voters are divided, a Democrat could claim second place. No one would like to see that more than Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles. He has been shoring up his support in familiar places. Recently he was in South L.A. to thank African-American political, religious and community leaders for their endorsements. \"This community opened up a door for me,\" said Villaraigosa. \"I never would have been mayor of Los Angeles if in 2005, we hadn't had an outpouring of support [here] and I never forgot that.\" Villaraigosa has never run for a statewide office before. So he has also been campaigning and raising money in California's agricultural Central Valley, not usually fertile soil for Democrats. Antonio Villaraigosa went to South Los Angeles earlier this month to thank African-American political, religious and community leaders for their endorsements.\n                \n                    \n                    Ina Jaffe/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Antonio Villaraigosa went to South Los Angeles earlier this month to thank African-American political, religious and community leaders for their endorsements. Some polls have shown him in second place, some in third, one in fourth. He hasn't held public office for five years. But his name recognition is likely to rise, courtesy of millions of dollars in independent expenditures from wealthy advocates of charter schools. Sharing second, third and fourth place in the polls with Villaraigosa are two Republican candidates. John Cox is a businessman from Chicago who has never held elective office, though he has run for several of them. His Republican rival is state Assemblyman Travis Allen, who touts his Southern California roots and his love of surfing. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox (left) and organizer Carl DeMaio (center) lead a petition drive last month to repeal California's gas taxes and vehicle registration fees.\n                \n                    \n                    Julie Watson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox (left) and organizer Carl DeMaio (center) lead a petition drive last month to repeal California's gas taxes and vehicle registration fees. At the state GOP convention in San Diego last weekend, Caroline Abate stood outside the hall waving signs for both Cox and Allen. \"Endorse somebody!\" she pleaded with delegates. Republicans need to choose one of these guys, Abate said, and she didn't seem to care which one. A party endorsement will unify Republican voters, she said, because  \"if they split the vote, Antonio Villaraigosa is going to get No. 2 ... and it's going be over for Republicans in June.\" On paper, Cox and Allen seem to check the same boxes. They both support President Trump's plan for a border wall. They both want to repeal the recent California law that protects undocumented immigrants. They both want to dump an increase in the tax on gasoline. Their big differences are in style. John Cox looks every bit the distinguished, older business executive, and he sees the state through that lens. He told convention delegates that California has been mismanaged and that it'll take a businessman to fix it. \"Businesspeople solve problems,\" said Cox. \"[They're] not a bunch of rhetoric, not a bunch hot air. They get results and that's what people want.\" While Cox is using part of his personal fortune to fund his campaign, his opponent Travis Allen's campaign is running on fumes. Allen tries to make up for it with boundless confidence and by touting his early and passionate support for Donald Trump, whom Cox did not vote for. \"Did we take back our country in 2016?\" Allen asked to the cheers of the crowd. \"Are you ready to take back our state in 2018?\" In the end, neither Allen nor Cox could muster enough support to win the party's endorsement. It looks like they'll be fighting for the same dwindling pool of conservative voters until primary day, decreasing their chances of making the runoff. Delegate Karen Roseberry found that prospect alarming and begged the delegates to reconsider.  There is so much more at stake she said, than just the governor's race. \"Every down-ticket race is counting on this,\" she said. \"We need a Top 2 finisher in November and that comes when the party is united.\" Those down-ticket races worrying Roseberry include at least half a dozen vulnerable Republican House seats. If Democrats can grab those, it would help them tip the balance of power in Congress.  No one knows what the impact on Republican turnout will be if there are only Democrats to choose from in the California governor's race. But Republicans are hoping they won't have a chance to find out.",

Solicitor General Noel Francisco is a familiar face in conservative legal circles. But he could be about to enter a new and uncomfortable period in the national spotlight if he becomes the chief overseer of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Francisco, 48, has been the Trump administration's top representative at the Supreme Court since September of 2017, when a divided Senate voted 50 to 47 to confirm him to the post. He's the third-ranking Senate-confirmed officer inside the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the Russia investigation. If Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees it, were removed from his position, that responsibility would fall to Francisco. President Trump has said he's holding open his options for dealing with the Justice Department. He has joined Republicans in Congress in complaining about the \"bias\" of people inside federal law enforcement, about the frame job they say is being perpetuated, and what they call Rosenstein's slowness in producing documents to lawmakers. Rosenstein said this week he would not be \"extorted\" but eventually, Trump warned, he may act on his own. \"Why such unequal 'justice?'\" he wrote on Twitter. \"At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved!\" A Rigged System - They don\u2019t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal \u201cjustice?\u201d At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved! If that means Rosenstein could be dismissed, that would set up Francisco  to take his place. The \"dream job\" Francisco launched his career with clerkships for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and the retired appeals court judge J. Michael Luttig. Two of his mentors told NPR the solicitor general spot is a \"dream job\" for Francisco, who was a law partner at the Jones Day firm with White House counsel Don McGahn and several other attorneys who assumed top legal positions in the Trump administration. Even so, the idea of Francisco taking over responsibility for the Russia probe makes little sense to Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who also served as U.S. attorney for that state. \"I can tell you, Noel Francisco, very talented lawyer, but to be Solicitor General, you have a specific skill set and running a Russia collusion investigation is probably not one of them,\" Christie told ABC News in April. In fact, Francisco is on record expressing doubts about the role and reach of special counsels. In 2007, he told a House panel, \"my own personal belief is that when you hand these issues off to career prosecutors in the public integrity sections in the U.S. attorneys' offices in the Department of Justice, those attorneys are generally better able to assess whether a case should be pursued.\" Francisco may be best known for arguing, and winning, the case of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who was convicted of bribery and public corruption offenses. The Supreme Court ultimately threw out the conviction. Francisco also won a case invalidating the Obama administration's use of recess appointments at the National Labor Relations Board. \"I have total confidence in his integrity, I think he's a great person, he's been a great friend, and he's been a fantastic lawyer,\" said Hank Asbill, who worked with him on the McDonnell case. Asbill said his former law partner would be \"totally equipped\" to oversee the Russia probe. \"I'm sure if Noel is asked to make any decisions in that regard that he'll evaluate the relevant facts and the legal issues on the merits ... and he'll make whatever decision he thinks is the most appropriate,\" Asbill added. Legal veteran Francisco served as a junior lawyer in President George W. Bush's White House and worked in the Justice Department's elite Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush years. He was part of the team of attorneys who helped Bush, working around the clock during the recount process in Florida during the 2000 election. \"It was exhausting but extremely important, obviously,\" said Chuck Cooper, who hired Francisco to work at his law firm during that period. \"The potential that we saw in him as a very young lawyer ... is something others have seen in every stage of his career.\" More recently, he endeared himself to conservatives by defending the Bush administration's firing of U.S. attorneys. In 2016, Francisco wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled, \"The FBI Treated Clinton with Kid Gloves.\" None of those things came up during his Senate confirmation hearing in May 2017, which took place the morning after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Comey's dismissal was what helped prompt Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel to investigate allegations of Russian election interference. At the hearing, Francisco spoke with emotion about his late father, who spent his childhood in the Philippines, ravaged during World War II. \"He once told me as a young boy, he was forced to live in the remnants of a bombed-out tank,\" Francisco recalled. \"Whenever I face the joys or difficulties of life, I think of that little boy.\" Later in the hearing, Francisco told Senators he knew he would have a responsibility beyond simply winning or losing in court. \"After all,\" he said, \"the Department of Justice's goal is not just to win, but to ensure that justice is served.\" It's too soon to assess Francisco's record as solicitor general. The office has reversed course many times from stances the Obama administration took. But Cooper, a mentor to Francisco, said that's to be expected given the substantial policy shifts between the two White Houses. But one move from the office drew bipartisan outcry. The solicitor general filed court papers suggesting opposing lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union should face discipline in a case involving an undocumented immigrant seeking an abortion. Two sources told NPR that people had urged the solicitor general not to file the document, but he went ahead. The ACLU later said the brief was \"baseless, irregular, and alarming.\"",

At last count, nearly a dozen local governments in California have voted to oppose what is known as the state's \"sanctuary law\" \u2014 Senate Bill 54 \u2014 escalating tensions over the long-divisive issue of illegal immigration in the Golden State. The law, passed last year, aims to protect some immigrants in the country illegally by limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. California is believed to have the largest population of undocumented immigrants, and the state is on the front lines of the resistance to the Trump administration. But the recent wave of opposition to California's opposition to the administration is turning some heads. Much of it began in the small Orange County suburb of Los Alamitos, where the city council passed a measure last month to opt out of the \"sanctuary\" law. \"I don't like the direction California is [going],\" says Warren Kusumoto, mayor pro tem of the city. Kusumoto decided to draft the initiative because he said Los Alamitos is caught in the middle of a national political fight and is being asked to work under conflicting laws. The small city of 11,000 also has close economic ties to the federal government. It is home to several companies with large federal contracts as well as a U.S. military base. But there are also bigger symbolic reasons at play. Kusumoto is frustrated more broadly with state policies on everything from taxes to immigration. \"As a state, we've squandered away what the Greatest Generation provided for us,\" he says. Kusumoto is a Republican and Japanese-American \u2014 in his words, a product of immigrants. \"I believe my grandparents did it the right way, they were able to immigrate, become naturalized eventually and citizens,\" he says. \"Why is that not the right way for anybody to come over here as immigrants?\" In some Southern California suburbs, and in many rural areas, there is mounting frustration that views like Kusumoto's are being crowded out by liberal cities that have gone to battle with President Trump. \"When you start to legislate that we cannot cooperate or communicate with another law enforcement partner, that is problematic,\" says Orange County Undersheriff Don Barnes. Last week, the sheriff's office began posting the release dates of inmates online, using an existing database, they say, to alert federal immigration authorities to potential issues. That move was widely seen as an open defiance to the state government in Sacramento. Sheriff officials had loudly opposed SB-54 when it was under consideration last year. \"We shouldn't be mixing public safety with politics,\" Barnes says. \"And there's a crossover that keeps happening that is becoming more politically driven [that is] disregarding the public's safety.\" Still, it is clear that at least the undercurrent of this recent backlash in Southern California is also political. \"It's the dying gasp of Orange County's nasty brand of conservativism that's infected the body politic of the United States for far too long,\" says Gustavo Arellano, a longtime liberal columnist here. One reason the wave of conservative opposition has turned some heads is that pundits had been predicting that Orange County in particular was beginning to turn blue. In the 2016 presidential race, for instance, the county voted Democratic for the first time since 1936. The demographics have changed dramatically since the 1990s. Whites are now in the minority in the county. But Arellano says more diversity doesn't necessarily mean it's more Democratic. Many of the city councils \u2014 and the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which voted to join the Trump administration's lawsuit against California \u2014 are still controlled by Republicans. And 2016 may have been an anomaly, he says. \"Ultimately, the Orange County dream is suburbia, and suburbia turns even the most fresh-off-the-boat person from Mexico or whatever into a rock-ribbed Republican,\" Arellano says. So the national political divide is just as sharp \u2014 and complicated \u2014 in Southern California as it is anywhere else. At heated public hearings, you can see a mix of local grass-roots activists from both sides mingling with Trump supporters who travel from meeting to meeting, some from as far away as Arizona. \"Put the lives of Americans and American safety first,\" said Jennifer Harrison, of Phoenix, who testified this week at a hearing in Escondido. \"Americans have dreams too.\" Earlier this week, Escondido became the latest city to pass a resolution condemning California's sanctuary law, voting to file a legal brief in support of the Trump administration's lawsuit against the state. In Los Alamitos, where the recent backlash began, Warren Kusumoto says he was surprised by all the attention that his council's \"opt out\" ordinance got. He also resents that some on the left have cast his city as some sort of anti-immigrant enclave. \"I may be anti-illegal immigration, but I don't hate people,\" Kusumoto says. Los Alamitos leaders aren't sure whether their decision will hold up if it's challenged in court. But, they say, it has started a much needed debate.",

President Trump is calling for troops on the Southern border, something the past five presidents have all done on a limited basis. Updated at 8:40 p.m. ET President Trump signed a proclamation Wednesday for the deployment of National Guard troops along the Southern border with Mexico in a bid to cut down on illegal immigration. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said earlier in the day that Trump's order would direct her department and the Pentagon to work with governors of the states along the Southwestern border. Speaking at the White House, Nielsen said, \"Our current border security and immigration laws fail the American people. The system rewards bad behavior. It does not punish lawbreakers. It undermines our nation's economic interests.\" She said the National Guard troops would be deployed as quickly as possible and gave no indication of how long the mission might last. Asked how many troops would be involved, Nielsen declined to give a number, saying, \"As many as is needed to fill the gaps today.\" The DHS's Customs and Border Protection reported Wednesday that apprehensions of people entering the U.S. illegally at the Southern border jumped by 37 percent in March from the February level, and by 203 percent from March 2017. Trump indicated Tuesday that he wanted the troops to secure the border. \"We're going to do some things militarily,\" Trump said. \"Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're going to be guarding our border with the military.\" \"That's a big step,\" Trump continued. \"We really haven't done that before, or certainly not very much before.\" However, the move actually has many precedents. Every president since Ronald Reagan has called on the National Guard for limited, temporary missions along the frontier. Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today. The troops have been used primarily for surveillance and other support activities. Troops are forbidden to conduct civilian police actions, such as detaining suspects and using force, under a law first signed by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. Trump's remarks on Tuesday appeared to catch many off guard \u2014 including the military. Here are some of the questions raised by the president's comments. 1. How have presidents used troops in the past? In 1986, Reagan declared drug smuggling a national security threat and launched a multipronged approach that included the National Guard as well as several law enforcement bodies. He also signed a bill that provided amnesty for 3 million migrants who had entered the U.S. illegally. His successors, including George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, have all called in the troops. George W. Bush deployed some 6,000 National Guard troops in 2006 for what proved to be a two-year mission, assisting the border guards with both undocumented immigrants and drug smuggling. Barack Obama ordered a similar, if somewhat smaller, operation, in 2010. Around 1,200 National Guard troops were called up initially. By 2012, the numbers on the ground were scaled back and a greater emphasis was placed on aerial surveillance. 2. What is the current situation on the border? After rising for decades, illegal immigration dropped after the 2008 recession that resulted in a sharp decline in economic opportunities. In addition, the Obama administration deported more than 2 million undocumented migrants, more than any other president. The Obama administration focused primarily on convicted criminals and those apprehended shortly after coming across the border. Illegal immigration took another downturn when Trump assumed office last year with his promise to crack down on illegal immigration and build a border wall. 3. So what prompted the president's decision to call on the National Guard? While illegal immigration remains at a low level compared with in past decades, there has been an uptick in recent months, according to figures from Customs and Border Protection. \"The numbers we're releasing for March will indicate a staggering increase from last year,\" said a senior administration official during a conference call with reporters. \"As of last April, we were at historic lows,\" the official said. \"We are no longer at that point.\" Critics say the president is acting more out of politics, noting that the $1.3 trillion spending bill he signed last month did not include the billions he wanted to build a border wall, a fundamental campaign pledge. Trump has been speaking out \u2014 and tweeting \u2014 about immigration issues for the past several days, including a claim that \"caravans\" of migrants are crossing the border. (NPR has fact-checked some of those recent claims here.) 4. How much authority does the president have? The role of the National Guard or any other troops is limited by the Posse Comitatus Act. President Hayes signed the measure in 1878 with the intent of ending the law enforcement role that federal troops were carrying out in the former Confederate states. The troops were supervising elections, chasing down criminal suspects and looking for illegal whiskey production. The law, amended most recently in 1981, does permit the military to do things like help out on U.S. soil in the aftermath of a natural disaster. When it comes to the border with Mexico, this has meant providing surveillance and other support roles. Texas already has the National Guard and Dept. of Public Safety deployed to the border. https://t.co/HFNfC9ckRH However, the military cannot act as a police force and make arrests or use force. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that a small number of Texas National Guard members would remain on the U.S.-Mexico border, where they have been for the past three years under his authority, conducting surveillance. They will begin taking federal orders this month, he added. About 100 service members will remain in the border region, The Associated Press reported, citing Lt. Col. Travis Walters, a spokesman with the Texas Air National Guard. 5. How is Mexico reacting? The Mexican ambassador to the U.S., Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez, said his government has asked for clarification from the Trump administration. \"It's certainly not something that the Mexican government welcomes,\" he told CNN. In an interview with NPR on Tuesday, Guti\u00e9rrez said, \"We're trying to find the best ways to manage migration flows in a way that it's respectful both to the laws of the United States and Mexico.\" He also said most migrants reaching the Southern U.S. border are \"no longer Mexicans; they are Central Americans.\" The immigration issue is a hot-button topic in Mexico's presidential campaign. The leading candidate, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said this week that \"Mexico and its people will not be the pi\u00f1ata of any foreign government.\" As the crowd jeered at the reference to Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador added: \"It's not with walls or use of force that you resolve social problems.\"",

The board voted to oppose California's sanctuary law for undocumented immigrants. The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted 3-0 to buck California's political leaders and join a federal lawsuit against that state's sanctuary law. That law, known as SB 54, limits the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies with federal immigration authorities. It was designed to help protect undocumented residents from deportation and signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown in October 2017. The Justice Department, led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, responded this month by suing California and two state officials. The suit argues that the California law is unconstitutional because the federal government has sole authority over immigration matters. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reported, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is seeking to throw out this law. Orange County throwing its weight behind the administration is symbolic. California is often seen as the front line of the Trump resistance movement. The commission here is controlled by Republicans. But the county went blue in the last presidential election for the first time in decades. The hearing at times got heated; Trump supporters in 'Make America Great Again' hats celebrated the vote. Immigrant-rights protesters rallied outside calling the decision racist and politically motivated.\" The move comes a day after the County Sheriff's Department announced that it will make public a list of when inmates are released from custody. As the Orange County Register reported, \"As of Monday, March 26, an existing 'Who's in Jail' online database includes the date and time of inmates' release \u2014 a move agency officials say will enhance communication with its law enforcement partners. \"The release date information applies to all inmates, not just those who are suspected of being in the country illegally. But the goal is to assist agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. \"'This is in response to SB-54 limiting our ability to communicate with federal authorities and our concern that criminals are being released to the street when there's another avenue to safeguard the community by handing them over (to ICE for potential deportation),' Orange County Undersheriff Don Barnes said. \"Orange County officials did not confer with ICE before making the change, he said.\" Last Monday, the city council of Los Alamitos, Calif., an Orange County city of fewer than 12,000 residents, voted to exempt itself from the state's sanctuary law.",

            "article_content": "Immigration policy has been a leading issue in national politics, and it has special resonance in Texas, which is holding the first primary in the new election season.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm Rachel Martin at our member station KERA in Dallas, Texas. And we are here today because Texas is holding the first primary in this year's midterm elections. And it is hard to talk about politics in Texas without talking about immigration. Texas has the longest border with Mexico of any state. John Burnett covers immigration for NPR, and he is on the line from Austin, his home base. Hey, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Welcome to Texas, Rachel. MARTIN: So happy to be here. Thank you. So obviously, immigration is very front and center in the national political discourse right now. How is that debate playing out in the Lone Star State? BURNETT: Well, historically, Texans have had laissez-faire attitudes toward immigrants, both legal and illegal. Lots of people came across without papers, and they did the hard jobs that Texans didn't want to do. And what's more, 1 in 6 Texans is foreign-born, and lots of Mexican-Americans have family in the Mexican border towns, even. But opinions have been shifting to the right on immigration. Here's what a recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll found about Texas conservatives. Most Republican Texans want fewer legal immigrants. They want to halt protection for DREAMers - those young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally. They support a border wall, and they think undocumented immigrants should be immediately deported. MARTIN: And I understand that you have met this man, a conservative political commentator, podcast host, who is thriving in this climate in the state. BURNETT: Let's meet George Rodriguez of San Antonio. He's a Mexican-American podcaster who's tired of hearing America called an immigrant nation. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"EL CONSERVADOR\") GEORGE RODRIGUEZ: Howdy, howdy, howdy, my friends. George Rodriguez, El Conservador, talking to you from San Antonio, deep in the heart of South Texas. How's everybody today? BURNETT: El Conservador - that's conservative in Spanish - records his podcast in his bedroom. He's surrounded by memorabilia, photos, coffee mugs and certificates from his two decades of service in the federal government. He held a variety of posts in the Reagan, Bush I and Clinton administrations from Interior to Housing to FEMA. But El Conservador's passion is immigration. RODRIGUEZ: Every nation has the right to protect its borders. Somehow we've lost the way on that aspect of it. BURNETT: I caught up with Rodriguez last month at the Border Security Expo in San Antonio. The trade show was bristling with the latest technology to detect people sneaking across the border. RODRIGUEZ: My thinking of illegal aliens is that they're here illegally, period. Any type of justification after that, to me, is a moot point. That you are working, that you are providing really doesn't matter to me because you have entered the home without permission. BURNETT: With immigration constantly in the headlines, Rodriguez has become a go-to guest for Univision and Fox. He's in demand to sit on panels at universities and town halls for a right-wing perspective. RODRIGUEZ: I believe I get greater credibility because I am Mexican-American, because I am a South Texan born and raised. BURNETT: The 65-year-old commentator brags that he's a sixth-generation Texan, born on the border in Laredo. RODRIGUEZ: America is a nation of people who came here as immigrants, but we are a nation of citizens now. And I reject whenever somebody says we're a nation of immigrants. No, I'm a citizen. I'm not an immigrant. BURNETT: This has put Rodriguez at odds with the Latino political establishment in San Antonio, which skews Democratic. They call him... RODRIGUEZ: A vendido, a sellout. BURNETT: ...And worse. Here is Rodriguez several years ago when he was president of the San Antonio Tea Party. He's urging a high school teacher to expose his students to more diverse viewpoints. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RODRIGUEZ: I would have you teach more... UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Quiet, please. RODRIGUEZ: ...Balanced, conservative thoughts, rather than just bringing folks that bring liberal ideals and placards here. JONATHAN BRYANT: You could just say what you are, a Nazi. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whoa, whoa. RODRIGUEZ: OK. OK. BURNETT: The teacher's response led to calls for him to be fired, though he wasn't. Rodriguez shrugs off the recollection because El Conservador's moment has arrived. Texas nativism is ascendant. The president's harsh statements on immigrants have expanded Rodriguez's audience. He's waited all of his adult life for a president like Donald Trump. He recalls during the campaign when Trump visited the Border Patrol in Laredo, and during a press conference, pointed across the bridge to Mexico. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, there's great danger with the illegals, and we're just discussing that. But we have a tremendous danger on the border with the illegals coming... RODRIGUEZ: I fell in love with him at that point. That's it. That was it. BURNETT: So Rachel, \"El Conservador\" podcast started two years ago at the same time that Trump's campaign was gaining steam. The podcast now has 3,000 followers, from San Antonio to Moscow. MARTIN: All right, so it's definitely a factor - immigration and people - how they are thinking about it in these midterm elections. I mean, we hear this talk about this Democratic momentum in Texas, John. Can you give us an example of a place that might be turning more purplish? BURNETT: Yeah. The 23rd District of Texas stretches from El Paso to San Antonio. It's got more than 800 miles of the Rio Grande, so border and immigration issues are huge down there. And it's a toss-up this year. The incumbent is Will Hurd, a demo - ah - a Republican. He doesn't have strong primary opponents, so he'll be fighting for his seat against five Democrats. And they're going to have a hard time going to the left of him on immigration. He's against a wall. He thinks it's the least effective way to secure the border, and he favors a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. MARTIN: All right, NPR's John Burnett. He'll be helping us cover the Texas primaries. Thanks so much, John. BURNETT: You bet, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Under President Trump, Latino immigrants in the U.S. illegally are under enormous pressure. ICE has dramatically intensified its efforts to detain and deport undocumented persons. That was a cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform, and after his election,  officials at a mosque in Cincinnati announced they intended to become a sanctuary congregation, ready to shelter asylum seekers or migrants in need \u2014 whether Muslim or not. But just three weeks after the election they backed off that offer of providing shelter within the mosque. \"So I think that announcing yourself as a sanctuary has its implications, whether you're a mosque, a church, a synagogue, or anything,\" Imam Omar Suleiman told NPR's Renee Montagne. Suleiman is the founder and president of the Yaqueen Institute for Islamic Research near Dallas, Texas. He says ICE has been particularly aggressive in Dallas, where the area leads the country in the number of deportations since the election of Donald Trump. Last year, Suleiman was one of the people calling for mosques to join the sanctuary movement in response to increased deportation. The adversity that the Muslim and Latino communities face is similar, he said. \"I think the tools that have been employed against immigrants are the same tools that have been employed against refugees, which are the same tools that have been employed against the Muslim community as a whole, which is the dehumanization \u2014 the 'otherizing' \u2014 that allows people to subconsciously accept this idea that we somehow do not deserve the same level of dignity and respect and liberty that everybody else does,\" Suleiman says. But there is already a deep anti-Muslim sentiment, he adds, pointing at mosque burnings that have taken place since President Trump was elected. He says Muslims are already under a lot of scrutiny and an additional layer to that could exacerbate something that is already an issue and endanger both the Muslim and the Latino communities. \"The idea here is that the goal of sanctuary is to provide safety, and if we cannot provide emotional, physical safety, then it would sort of be defeating the purpose,\" Suleiman says. \"You know, there are other ways to express solidarity and support but announcing your particular mosque as a sanctuary could potentially endanger that particular Muslim community and then obviously the immigrants themselves that would seek shelter would be under that intensified scrutiny.\" NPR's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for digital.",

They are both Hungarian. They are both powerful. And three decades ago, they both worked to topple communism in their homeland. But any alliance between Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros is long over. Orb\u00e1n, 54, has turned on his onetime benefactor in a battle that appears nasty and personal, at least in public. Each calls the other a serious threat to Hungarians. Orb\u00e1n accuses Soros \u2014 a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 who survived Nazi-occupied Hungary and later made his fortune in America \u2014 of trying to wrest control of their native country from those elected to office. The prime minister vows to stop the 87-year-old investor and business magnate who is spending most of his fortune promoting liberal and progressive causes around the world, including democracy building in the former Eastern bloc. (Soros' Open Society Foundations have been a financial supporter of NPR.) During a speech last November to his right-wing Fidesz Party, Orb\u00e1n accused Soros of fostering Muslim immigration that he said threatens to turn Hungary and Europe into \"a mixed population\" stripped of its Christian identity. He claimed the billionaire's goal is to \"sweep away governments which represent national interests, including ours.\" Orb\u00e1n likened Soros and his nongovernmental organizations to Soviet propagandists: \"We old warhorses recognize them by their smell,\" the prime minister said. \"What we did not tolerate from the Soviet Empire, we shall not tolerate from the Soros empire. We shall defend our borders, we shall stop the Soros plan, and eventually we shall win.\" Orb\u00e1n declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, defended the government attacks on Soros and groups supported by Open Society Foundations. The latest assault involved bills introduced on Feb. 13 in Hungary's parliament that, if passed, could lead to many foreign-funded NGOs shutting down. \"These organizations definitely don't have a democratic mandate because they have never been voted for, nobody elected them, and definitely the only force is the money behind them,\" Kov\u00e1cs said. \"And there are going to be sanctions against them if they don't behave according to the law.\" But Soros argues such measures reflect the prime minister's autocratic ambitions. He accuses Orb\u00e1n of corruption and tearing down the fledgling democracy they helped bring to Hungary. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n addresses a press conference after attending a plenary session at the European Parliament in Brussels last April, after the EU launched legal action against Hungary.\n                \n                    \n                    Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n addresses a press conference after attending a plenary session at the European Parliament in Brussels last April, after the EU launched legal action against Hungary. \"Orb\u00e1n has been very successful in making the mafia state work efficiently,\" the billionaire philanthropist told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in late January (here are links to his speech). \"He has got spies in every emerging, clean [party] that could attract the electorate.\" Soros declined to be interviewed for this story, but Patrick Gaspard, who is the president of Open Society Foundations, rejected the Hungarian government allegations. He said the work his boss has done for the past 30 years is strictly limited to building up civil society and democracy. \"You can't get more personal than billboards with George Soros' face all over the country,\" Gaspard said, referring to government-funded placards in Hungary that accuse Soros of wanting to transplant millions of people from Africa and the Middle East and warn Hungarians not to let him \"have the last laugh.\" \"George Soros has a thick hide and he can certainly absorb these attacks with grace as he has for some time now and will not be dissuaded,\" Gaspard added.

The Hungarian government said it would end its disputed ad campaign against Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. Nor will his Open Society Initiative for Europe based in Budapest, said its director, Goran Buldioski. Shortly after he graduated with a law degree, Orb\u00e1n applied to this Soros-funded group and received a scholarship of about $10,000 to attend Oxford in 1989. Buldioski said Orb\u00e1n's attacks are of growing concern to Hungarian civil society. \"This is really playing with dangerous stuff here, especially knowing the history of this country,\" he said. \"Let me spell it out \u2014 the anti-Semitism. It's not spoken directly, but the overtones are very, very clear.\" IMF, EU, migrants, now Soros But the prime minister's decision to launch an attack against Soros and the civil society he supports comes as little surprise to Botond Feledy, senior fellow at the Center for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy in Budapest. He said the strategy is one that has worked well for populists across Central Europe: shift voter attention away from domestic issues by finding a foreign boogeyman. \"First it was IMF, then it was the EU, then the migrants and now we have George Soros,\" Feledy said. \"So this is actually a continuing campaign which keeps the majority of Hungarian voters at bay, not to take their own government as the forum against which they should protest\" about concerns they might have. Laszlo Keri, who is a former political science professor of Orb\u00e1n's, agreed. He said he's sure his former pupil will do whatever it takes to win another term as prime minister during upcoming national elections on April 8. \"His biggest personal tragedy was losing the 2002 election,\" Keri explained. \"So I daresay there is no connection between the real Soros and the Hungarian campaign production\" version. Harshest bills yet Orb\u00e1n's pursuit of Soros and the foreign-funded NGOs started shortly after President Trump took office. Some political observers NPR interviewed said Orb\u00e1n saw the American leader as an anti-Soros ally and counted on his administration offering little resistance to Budapest's move against organizations linked to the billionaire in Hungary. (The U.S. joined Europe last year in objecting to Hungary's attempt to shut down the Soros-founded Central European University in Budapest. But the EU has been more assertive, launching legal proceedings against Orb\u00e1n not only over the university but also his government's attacks on NGOs.) The Hungarian government's latest \"Stop Soros\" bills are the harshest yet. They would empower the interior minister to ban nongovernmental groups that are deemed a \"security risk\" or support immigration, while also levying a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to those supporting migration that remain open. Proponents claim the measures are aimed at curbing illegal immigration, but Orb\u00e1n's many critics charge the aim is to silence dissent and control Hungarian civil society. If the measures pass, those who will pay the price are many of the 55,000 NGOs registered in Hungary, said Veronika M\u00f3ra, who heads the Hungarian Environmental Partnership Foundation in Budapest, an umbrella group for organizations involved in environmental or local community causes. She warned the laws could bankrupt many nonprofit groups in Hungary, including those that have nothing to do with Soros. \"We even heard about stories like a small association of voluntary firemen working in a village, who received from an Austrian or German similar organization a used fire engine, which is still quite valuable. But all of a sudden that [legislation] makes them a foreign-funded organization,\" M\u00f3ra explained. Some Fidesz lawmakers say a vote on the \"Stop Soros\" measures aren't likely before the April 8 parliamentary elections.",

Updated on Jan. 31 at 12:47 a.m. ET President Trump sought to strike a unifying tone with his first State of the Union address, but some of his rhetoric on immigration and his promise to put \"America First\" was clearly aimed at his base. As a March 5 deadline approaches for Congress to come up with a legislative implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Trump outlined the ways he wants to roll back legal immigration as a compromise for giving a path to citizenship for up to an estimated 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought here as children. But his rhetoric elicited boos from Democrats in the chamber \u2014 underscoring the very real difficulty of reaching a bipartisan deal \u2014 as the president alluded to the common term of \"DREAMers\" for those immigrants. \"My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans \u2014 to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream,\" Trump said. \"Because Americans are dreamers too.\" Trump also pointed out guests in the chamber whose children had allegedly been killed by the MS-13 gang, and he called on Congress \"to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.\" \"For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives,\" Trump said. And throughout, Trump highlighted his \"America First\" agenda. For example, in terms of legal immigration, Trump wants to end the visa lottery system, limit family reunification policies to spouses and children only and build a \"great wall\" along the Southern border, which was a signature campaign promise. \"We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as president of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities,\" Trump said.

Trump addresses a very divided nation Trump's first year has been marked by record low approval ratings, and a majority of Americans said in a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that Trump has done more to divide the country than to unite it. Trump didn't mention at all the albatross that has hung over nearly his entire presidency \u2014 the ongoing special counsel investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. And Trump only mentioned Russia \u2014 which he has been accused of being too cozy with \u2014 once in the entire speech. \"As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad,\" Trump said. \"Around the world, we race rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values,\" he said. Nonetheless, Trump began the address with a unifying, uplifting tone, talking about how Americans have responded to tragedies the country has faced over the past year, from natural disasters to mass shootings. \"Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there's a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it,\" Trump said. \"So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong and proud America.\" \"But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be,\" the president continued. He also pointed out House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.,  who survived a life-threatening shooting at a congressional baseball practice last June, calling him the \"legend from Louisiana.\" \"In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy,\" Trump said. \"Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.\" Despite his comments about the need for national unity, the president also forcefully highlighted one of his more divisive comments early in his remarks Tuesday. Trump alluded to his call to fire NFL players who kneel during the national anthem. Many saw those remarks at the time as racially charged, given that most of the athletes taking a knee as a silent protest were black players seeking to protest police brutality particularly affecting African-American communities. But Trump's efforts last year to spotlight the kneeling protests have been a popular play with his conservative base. Pointing out 12-year-old Preston Sharp, attending the speech as Trump's guest, who had taken it upon himself to put flags on veterans' graves, Trump used the opportunity to call for more adherence to \"our civic duty as Americans.\" \"Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,\" Trump said. Economic gains a highlight of Trump's first year Trump played up his economic success and highlighted the GOP tax plan passed last month, the signature achievement of his first year in office. \"Small-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time,\" Trump said. The president, however, did not mention that just hours before he was set to deliver his speech the stock market closed by taking a triple-digit hit. \"Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business, to lower tax rates for hard-working Americans,\" Trump said in touting the new tax law. The president also promised that this year \"will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system. And millions of Americans will have more take-home pay, starting next month. A lot more.\" And he underscored his more protectionist, populist approach to trade, which has been another hallmark of his tenure and a departure from even past GOP presidents like George W. Bush. \"America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation's wealth,\" Trump said. \"The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair, and very importantly, reciprocal.\" Trump also called for a $1.5 trillion package \"to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure\" in partnership with state and local governments, \"and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment.\" \"We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?\" Trump queried. \"I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.\" Angelica Magana, 34, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient who was brought to the United State at the age of 8, and Victor Guzman, an undocumented resident, react to President Trump's remarks about his immigration policy during a State of the Union watch party Tuesday in Chicago.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Angelica Magana, 34, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient who was brought to the United State at the age of 8, and Victor Guzman, an undocumented resident, react to President Trump's remarks about his immigration policy during a State of the Union watch party Tuesday in Chicago. North Korea, Guant\u00e1namo Bay and fighting terrorism Trump also touted his success in combating ISIS and announced he was directing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to keep open the U.S. detention facility in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. \"When necessary, we must be able to detain and question [terrorists]. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are,\" Trump said. \"In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2014 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\" He also called for an increase in military spending, including efforts to \"modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.\" The biggest nuclear threat \u2014 which at times Trump has often seemed to provoke via Twitter \u2014 is North Korea. \"North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening,\" Trump said. \"Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. \"We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies,\" Trump continued, highlighting the country's oppressive regime by adding some late guests with deeply emotional stories. In attendance were the parents of Otto Warmbier, a college student who was detained by North Korea and finally sent home to the U.S. badly injured, where he died soon after. And Trump also pointed to Ji Sung-Ho, who grew up in North Korea, narrowly escaped from the country and lost both his legs. In a dramatic moment, Sung-Ho displayed the crutches he used to escape the country. Trump also used Sung-Ho's story to bring his roughly 90-minute speech to a conclusion, ending with broad patriotic images and his campaign slogan. \"The people dreamed this country. The people built this country, and it is the people who are making America great again,\" Trump said. \"As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for \u2014 there is nothing we cannot achieve.\" Credit:  AP The Democratic response: \"Bullies,\" \"partisanship\" and \"chaos\" Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. \u2014 a 37-year-old rising star and scion of the famed political family \u2014 delivered the official Democratic response to Trump's speech and seized on the division in the country that he argued has been inflamed by the president. \"It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it's far bigger than that. This administration isn't just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection,\" Kennedy said. Kennedy also mentioned the \"#MeToo\" movement borne out of the growing disclosures about sexual harassment and sexual assault in multiple industries and talked of the efforts of \"Black Lives Matter\" \u2014 two things Trump did not touch on. \"Bullies may lend a punch, they may leave a mark, but they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of the people united in defense of their future,\" Kennedy said. \"Politicians can be cheered for the promises they make. Our country will be judged by the promises we keep.\" Trump supporters in Cincinnati at a State of the Union watch party hosted by the Hamilton County Republican Party.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump supporters in Cincinnati at a State of the Union watch party hosted by the Hamilton County Republican Party.",

Updated at 7:55 p.m. ET President Trump said Wednesday he is willing to be interviewed under oath by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign. In an impromptu meeting with reporters, Trump said he is \"looking forward\" to talking with Mueller. \"I would love to do it,\" he said, going on to say he \"would do it under oath.\" Trump added he would take his lawyers' advice. Trump has given conflicting answers as to whether he would agree to a potential interview with Mueller. In June, the president said he was \"100 percent\" willing to do so. But during a news conference earlier this month, when asked about reports that the special counsel planned to seek such an interview, Trump dodged the question. Mueller has indicted multiple former associates of the president, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador. Trump maintained on Wednesday there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and the Russians, but he added that he \"couldn't have cared less about Russians having to do with my campaign,\" calling himself \"one of the greatest candidates\" and \"much better\" than 2016 rival Hillary Clinton. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia attempted to tip the scales in favor of Trump. The president made the comments just before departing for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The special counsel is also thought to be probing whether Trump sought to interfere with the Justice Department's Russia investigation. Mueller's appointment came after the president abruptly fired then-FBI Director James Comey last year. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that after firing Comey, Trump summoned then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe to the Oval Office for a meeting, where the president asked McCabe whom he voted for in the 2016 presidential election. McCabe said he did not vote, \"several current and former U.S. officials\" told the Post. Trump said on Wednesday that he didn't recall asking McCabe about his voting record and called it a \"very unimportant question.\" Trump also elaborated on his immigration plan that the White House is expected to unveil on Monday, ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday. He said his plan would offer a path to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program over a period of 10 to 12 years. The Obama-era program shielded from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Congress is trying to come up with a compromise on the DACA program, which Trump set to expire in March. The issue became a wedge in last week's budget negotiations that resulted in a three-day government shutdown. The DACA program is slated to end on March 5, but Trump said that those protected by it should \"not be concerned\" about possibly being deported. Trump also said he wants $25 billion to build his border wall, which he touted repeatedly during the campaign, along with $5 billion for other security measures.",

Republicans are using tough language in the current immigration debate. They speak of the threats and dangers posed by those in the U.S. illegally. Their words largely echo those of President Trump in warning that immigrants steal jobs from Americans and drag down the standard of living. A blunt Trump campaign ad released during the recent government shutdown accused Democrats of being \"complicit in all murders by illegal immigrants.\" But it wasn't always so. For decades, leading figures in the GOP went out of their way to sound a compassionate note when it came to immigration policy. In recent years that rhetoric fell out of line with where the Republican base was, giving Trump the opportunity of a lifetime in 2016. Reagan opposed \"putting up a fence\" Even in the age of Trump, Ronald Reagan remains the iconic conservative standard bearer for many in the party. At a 1980 GOP presidential debate in Houston, Texas, Reagan spoke of Mexico as \"our neighbor to the south.\" He added, \"We should have a better understanding and better relationship than we've ever had.\" And as he continued, Reagan sounded a lot like he was weighing in on today's immigration debate. \"Rather than talking about putting up a fence,\" the future president said. \"Why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems?\" It's the kind of line you might hear from just about any Democratic senator in 2018. On the stage debating him that day was another 1980 GOP presidential hopeful and future president, George H.W. Bush. He was asked by an audience member if children in the country illegally should be allowed to attend U.S. public schools. Bush didn't hesitate, saying he doesn't want to see 6- or 8-year-olds being uneducated or \"made to feel that they're living outside the law.\" Reagan eventually signed a major immigration law that toughened border security, but offered amnesty to immigrants in the country illegally who entered before 1982. The \"compassionate conservative\" A couple of decades later, the presidency of George W. Bush brought another major push for immigration overhaul. Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer notes that the 43rd president's campaign slogan of \"compassionate conservatism\" applied to immigration. Fleischer says that because Bush had been governor of Texas, he had a realistic view of who was coming across the border. \"As a border governor, he had a personal understanding and a personal relationship with many of the immigrants who crossed the Rio Grande and came to Texas for work and liberty and for America's opportunity,\" Fleischer said. Bush proposed changes to U.S. immigration law at an event at the White House in January 2004 that would make it easier for people to cross back and forth over the border to work legally in the United States. Bush described the problems he saw brought about by existing law. \"Many undocumented workers walked mile after mile, through heat of day and cold of the night. Some have risked their lives in dangerous desert border crossings,\" Bush said. \"Workers who seek only to earn a living end up in the shadows of American life.\" Trump harnesses the GOP base Over the past decade, though, a very different discussion of immigration has taken hold within the GOP, eventually building to the launch of Trump's presidential campaign in June 2015. \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump said that day at Trump Tower. \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting.\" Pair that with the \"Build the Wall, Build the Wall\" chanting by the candidate and the crowds at Trump rallies both before and after his election, and you get a pretty good distillation of how Trump's immigration rhetoric has tracked with the GOP base. \"Donald Trump talks about immigration in a way that's very different from how George Bush talks about it, or Mitt Romney talks about it, or John McCain talked about it,\" Fleischer said. \"But it's also true that Donald Trump won the election.\" So far, such talk has worked with Trump's hard core supporters. What it means in terms of getting what he wants from Congress, or down the road at the ballot box, remains to be seen. Key, according to Fleischer, is how working-class voters look at the issue. \"Frankly, I think the biggest change was the economy weakened,\" he said. \"People in America were worried about their jobs and their livelihood, and they did worry about a surge of people coming through illegally, a lower-priced labor force that would squeeze Americans.\" Economists say what drives wages goes way beyond immigration, but such worries gave the topic more potency than it previously had within the GOP. But Mark Krikorian, an advocate for less immigration at the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Immigration Studies, has a his own theory. He doesn't think attitudes toward immigration have changed much at all among Republican voters. He thinks it's a case of past leaders simply being out of touch with where the party rank and file were on the issue. \"Ordinary Republican voters were just much more hawkish on immigration than Republican politicians and advisers and fixers and donors and the whole political class,\" Krikorian said. Conservative voters were strong enough to prevent passage of immigration legislation pushed by President George W. Bush, whose support among Hispanics reached 40 percent in the 2004 election, a high for the GOP. In 2013, conservatives in the House blocked an immigration bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. It came as the Republican Party was looking for ways to appeal to Hispanic voters following Mitt Romney's loss as the GOP presidential nominee in 2012. In 2016, Krikorian said Trump recognized an opening: \"He took advantage of that gap between what the actual voters wanted and what the political class was offering.\" There were other early signs of how the issue would play within GOP politics. In 2010, Marco Rubio won a Senate seat from Florida after successfully wooing support from the rising Tea Party movement. Once elected, Rubio \u2014 the son of Cuban immigrants \u2014 began working on the 2013 immigration legislation with a bipartisan group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight.\" He was immediately shunned \u2014 and jeered in some cases \u2014 by Tea Party conservatives who once saw him as the future. Rubio ran for president in 2016, but never seriously threatened Trump's chances, as the eventual nominee made the immigration issue his own. All of this is taking place as the United States becomes a more diverse nation, with Hispanics the fastest growing minority population in the country. In fact, the U.S. is on track to be a majority-minority nation by the year 2044, according to the U.S Census Bureau. It was former President Barack Obama's back-to-back election victories in 2008 and 2012 that prompted a great deal of soul-searching within the Republican Party about immigration and about appealing to minority voters more broadly. Part of the proposed solution was to speak compassionately about the issue of immigration. Here's how former George W. Bush adviser Karen Hughes put it in an opinion piece published by Politico: \"The immigration rhetoric that came out of the Republican primary seemed harsh, unwelcoming and offputting to many minority voters. Obama increased his share of the Hispanic vote and won it 69 percent to 29 percent (per The New York Times exit poll); likewise he built a huge margin among Asian voters, 74-25, almost doubling the margin of his support compared to 2008. Both of those constituencies are hardworking, upwardly mobile, family-oriented, and should be open to Republican appeals if we don't make them feel unwelcome.\" Trump's election in 2016 seems to have put such sentiment on hold indefinitely for the GOP. Now Congress is tackling immigration once again. This time it appears there will be some kind of legislation passed. It may include some resolution for many of the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. What's different this time is that many Republicans lawmakers have closed that gap with the GOP base. Any immigration legislation that passes will likely not be in line with what Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush once supported, but by virtue of being something President Trump supports likely would have the approval of his base.",

As President Trump approaches his first anniversary of taking office, he and others are taking stock. \"2017 was a year of tremendous achievement, monumental achievement, actually,\" Trump told members of his Cabinet last week. \"I don't think any administration has ever done what we've done and what we've accomplished in its first year.\" The president has delivered on some of his major campaign promises. Other pledges are still works in progress, while some commitments have been quietly discarded. In the closing days of the 2016 campaign, Trump issued an ambitious checklist of things he wanted to accomplish in the White House. Here's how he's doing so far. (Jump to: the promises that have been accomplished, those that are incomplete or those seemingly forgotten.) Judiciary\"We confirmed an incredible new Supreme Court justice and more circuit court judges in our first year than any administration in the history of our country,\" Trump said last week. \"And we have many more coming.\" Thanks to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Trump had a large number of vacancies to fill on the federal bench as soon as he took office. He quickly tapped Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat vacated by the late Antonin Scalia. Trump has also moved aggressively to fill lower court vacancies with young, conservative judges who could be shaping federal jurisprudence for decades to come. Though some of his nominees have withdrawn under criticism of their qualifications. Taxes The $1.5 trillion tax bill signed in December was Trump's first major legislative accomplishment. And while many economists are skeptical the measure will spark the kind of economic growth Trump has promised, it will put more money in many Americans' pockets. \"Hardworking American families will receive tremendous tax relief,\" Trump said last week. \"We lowered our tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit.\" The tax savings in the bill are heavily tilted toward the wealthy. But the bill does offer some of the savings for child- and elder care that Trump promised during the campaign. Deregulation The administration has moved quickly to roll back regulations adopted under previous presidents. Some of these moves have been challenged in court, but Trump and his Cabinet are chipping away at rules governing the environment, labor and finance. Just this week, a financial watchdog agency announced that it plans to reconsider an Obama-era rule governing payday lenders. Energy During the campaign, Trump promised to lift restrictions on domestic energy production including oil, natural gas and coal. The administration has worked to open more land and offshore waters to drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. But the boom in domestic energy production predates the Trump administration and has largely been fueled by technological improvements such as hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking.\" \"The global energy market has been turned upside down by what's happening in the United States in terms of shale gas and shale oil,\" said energy historian Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. \"For the industry, the notion that new regulations are not going to be imposed and that some of the regulations are going to be rolled back has been important in terms of investing. But the primary drivers are price, opportunity, and technology.\" What's more, the abundance of cheap natural gas continues to put downward pressure on demand for coal, despite Trump's pledge to bring coal jobs back. Trans-Pacific PartnershipIn one of his first acts as president, Trump formally withdrew the United States from a 12-nation trade deal negotiated under former President Barack Obama. That made good on a pledge Trump made during the campaign, although his rival Hillary Clinton also opposed the trade deal and Congress was unlikely to ratify the agreement in any case. \"The president kept a key promise,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \"I would add it was one of the easiest things for him to do.\" Critics argue that withdrawal has weakened America's standing in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region and handed a windfall to China. Hiring Freeze Trump delivered on his promise to temporarily freeze federal hiring outside of the military, although that freeze has since been lifted. The federal government had 16,000 fewer employees in December than it did a year ago, a drop of less than 1 percent. ImmigrationThe Trump administration has taken a hard line on illegal immigration, giving enforcement officers wide latitude to deport anyone in the country illegally, and announcing plans to phase out legal protection for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children (putting the onus on Congress to sort a longer-term solution). So far, though, Trump has not succeeded in constructing his border wall, nor has come anywhere close to deporting the more than 2 million people he promised. After dropping sharply in the early months of the Trump administration, illegal crossings of the U.S. border with Mexico have begun creeping up again. The administration has tried repeatedly to \"suspend immigration from terror-prone\" regions. Early efforts were blocked by the courts, although the most recent iteration of the travel ban is in effect while legal challenges continue. The administration's efforts to block payments to so-called \"sanctuary cities\" have also been stymied by lawsuits. Repeal and replace ObamacareDespite repeated efforts, the GOP-controlled Senate never mustered the simple majority needed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The president has vowed to keep trying, although it's not clear there's much appetite for that in Congress during this election year. While Trump has repeatedly tried to sabotage the health care program \u2014 by halting cost-sharing subsidies to insurance companies for example and slashing its marketing budget \u2014 nearly 9 million people signed up for Obamacare coverage in the most recent enrollment period. TradeDuring the campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, end international trading abuses and impose a tariff on U.S. companies that locate factories overseas. The U.S. has entered negotiations with Mexico and Canada over NAFTA. But much of the president's broader trade agenda has moved slowly, if at all. In the first 11 months of 2017, the U.S. trade deficit grew by nearly 12 percent. \"Donald Trump, early in his presidency, signed a flurry of executive orders related to trade,\" said Scott Paul, whose group represents domestic manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union. \"While all of these trains left the station, some of them got derailed, and others didn't arrive when they were supposed to and we're still waiting on concrete action from this administration.\" ClimateAs part of his announcement in June that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Trump made good on his promise to halt payments to United Nations climate funds. So far, though, there's no indication that money has been redirected to American water and environmental projects as Trump pledged during the campaign. Trump is also working to undo the \"Clean Power Plan\" at the heart of former President Barack Obama's climate agenda. But tax incentives for wind and solar power survived in the GOP tax bill signed in December. \"That's what's going to drive renewable investment in the United States,\" said Yergin, author of The Prize and The Quest. \"And of course many states continue to have mandates about renewable energy.\" InfrastructureA bid to encourage $1 trillion in new infrastructure investment \u2014 using limited federal dollars to leverage private and local government money \u2014 has not yet materialized. But it may in 2018. Education Legislation to foster school choice has not passed in Congress, although the new tax bill does allow families to use tax-free college savings accounts to pay for private, K-12 education. Crime Although Congress has not passed the crime bill Trump promised during the campaign, the administration has created a task force on violent crime and increased the availability of surplus military gear to local police. The Justice Department has also instructed federal prosecutors to seek tougher penalties for criminals \u2014 reversing an Obama-era move away from mandatory minimum sentences for low-level offenses. Military Trump's effort to lift the cap on military spending and boost the defense budget substantially is one element of the budget brinkmanship playing out in Washington this week. Stay tuned. Labeling China a currency manipulatorTrump quietly dropped this campaign promise after learning, belatedly, that China hasn't been artificially depressing its currency in years. Congressional term limitsA proposed constitutional amendment to limit the terms of lawmakers seems to have dropped off the president's radar. However, a record number of Republican House members are retiring voluntarily this year. Draining the swampAs part of his campaign pledge to end corruption in Washington, Trump promised to impose a variety of limits on the \"revolving door\" between government and industry. He did impose a five-year ban on presidential appointees going to work as lobbyists, along with a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments. \"Those are good things,\" said Noah Bookbinder, who runs the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. But Bookbinder argues they don't go far enough. The revolving door continues to spins freely in the opposite direction, as corporate lobbyists take jobs in government, often overseeing the very industries where they used to work. More than a third of the political appointees in the EPA used to work in industries such as oil, coal or chemicals, Bookbinder said. \"You've got conflicts of interest for officials from the president on down sending a message that mixing of business interests and official responsibilities is not only something that this administration is not so concerned about but something that is maybe even encouraged,\" Bookbinder said. \"This administration has been as swampy and unethical as any in the history of this country.\"",

Some New York City street vendors have started selling out of their homes to reduce their visibility and risk of being detained or deported.\n                \n                    \n                    Rachael Bongiorno for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Julia prepares tortillas for her family's dinner before she sets up her table to sell elote and atole from her driveway. Some New York City street vendors have started selling out of their homes to reduce their visibility and risk of being detained or deported. In a narrow alley just behind a busy Queens street, Hern\u00e1n's kitchen makes more than 4,000 churros each day for street vendors to sell across New York City. From 3 a.m., hours before nearby shop owners unlock their front gates, the kitchen fills with the sound of churro batter beating against the sides of large industrial mixers. The kneaded dough is shaped by a long dispenser that drops it into sizzling hot oil. The churros \u2014 long, striated doughnuts \u2014 are finished with a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon and stacked high on baking trays by Hern\u00e1n's wife. Hern\u00e1n moves quickly, grabbing dough from the mixer before hurrying to the fryer so the churros are ready when his vendors come to pick up their orders. Time is of the essence \u2014 he can't risk losing any more buyers. It took Hern\u00e1n 14 years to build up his wholesale churro business but only one week, following the election of Donald Trump, for him to lose half of his customers. \"My business has been affected greatly this year. My vendors are scared they will get caught and deported,\" Hern\u00e1n says, speaking in Spanish. We are not using his or other vendors' full names because of their fear of deportation. \"They have left and started working other types of jobs now.\" Within the first 100 days of Trump's presidency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 41,000 people \u2014 an increase of 37.6 percent from the previous year. The surge in ICE arrests across the nation, coupled with other immigration policies of the Trump administration, have spurred a noticeable drop in vendors selling on New York City streets, as well as a decline in the number of street vendor customers. \"I remember the first few months of [Trump's presidency] there was no one on the streets in Queens. There were not a lot of vendors out or people walking to be the customers of vendors,\" says Sean Basinski, director of The Street Vendor Project, a nonprofit organization that provides legal representation and advocacy for street vendors in the city. There's no statistical information on the economic impact the Trump administration's immigration policies have had on street vendors, many of whom are undocumented immigrants. But in the Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Jamaica, where selling food and other items on the street is common practice, some vendors say they have lost a significant portion of their income. Fresh churros are drained before they are stacked on trays for vendors to pick up.\n                \n                    \n                    Rachael Bongiorno for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fresh churros are drained before they are stacked on trays for vendors to pick up. \"There was a period that there were a lot of rumors that ICE was on Roosevelt Avenue [a busy commercial street in Jackson Heights] \u2014 that there was an ICE van there by the subway,\" Basinski says. \"I don't think that was true, but people thought they were going to get picked up.\" Last year was a turning point for Hern\u00e1n's churreria. He had finally earned enough income to afford a larger facility with industrial equipment and an additional baker. But with his income now cut in half, he has returned to the streets to sell churros. On Sundays he drives with his wife to suburban Westchester and Pennsylvania to sell his churros to churches with large Latino congregations. Hern\u00e1n came to New York 17 years ago from Ecuador. A few weeks after arriving, he got a job at a car wash, where he made $30 a day. He recalls never having had that much money in his hands before. But after watching the quick exchange of money by a young churro seller at a train station one night, he decided to become a churro vendor himself. When he realized he could make more money supplying other vendors as a churro baker, Hern\u00e1n convinced a Mexican baker to teach him the craft. He then began building a network of vendors to buy his churros. In Queens neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights and Corona, where more than 57 percent of the total population is foreign-born and over 100 languages are spoken, street vending provides an opportunity for many immigrants to make a living. But for some, that's become increasingly difficult. On a warm fall afternoon, women are lined up on Roosevelt Avenue selling cuts of roasted pork shoulder wrapped in tortillas, shish kebabs cooked on aluminum grills hovering over shopping carts, and $1 tamales kept warm in beverage coolers. Glady, a street vendor who sells shish kebabs, says she has lost half her income this year. Even on this fine day, she has had few customers. \"I haven't even made $50,\" she says in Spanish, as she heats up the grill. \"The change in president has caused people to not want to spend their money because they might arrest us one day. A lot of my friends have left.\" Ruth, a vendor working across the street from Glady, waits for familiar faces to buy her chicharron (pork cracklings), braised pork and beef cuts stacked up high over a hot flat grill. She believes customers aren't buying because they are afraid to be visible and are saving money in case they or members of their family are deported. \"A lot of people don't come like before, because they don't want to risk [it]. People are avoiding a lot of cost because if something happens to them, at least they have some savings,\" Ruth says in Spanish. \"They don't have that liberty to buy like before we had this new president.\" There are an estimated 20,000 street vendors in New York City. In 1981, the city capped the number of street vendor permits it issues at around 5,000. This means that roughly 80 percent of vendors are unable to operate their food businesses legally. Matthew Shapiro, senior attorney at The Street Vendor Project, says many immigrants are unable to find traditional jobs. Street vending is an easily accessible line of work that allows them to make a living. But unlicensed vendors run the risk of being ticketed or even arrested by local law enforcement. In the current political climate, those risks are magnified for undocumented vendors who peddle without permits. Any contact undocumented immigrants have with the criminal justice system is widely seen as raising their vulnerability to being detained by ICE and potentially deported, Shapiro says. \"Since we've had such a hard line immigration stance coming out of the federal government, this puts them at further risk,\" Shapiro says. \"So if they are out there selling and breaking the law, that could result in higher-level immigration consequences.\" For example, some immigration attorneys express concern over the increase in ICE arrests in and around courthouses.According to the Immigrant Defense Project, these arrests in New York increased by 900 percent in 2017. While some vendors continue to struggle to make a living on the street, others have sought new, less visible occupations. One vendor, Julia, used to sell lunches from a street cart without a permit. But for the past couple of years, the mother of three has been selling food from her home to reduce her risk of being arrested or detained. \"If I keep going to court [to pay tickets for vending without a permit], they could deport me,\"Julia says, in Spanish. Like other street vendors we spoke with, Julia has seen a drop in income this year. Julia was born and raised in El Salvador; 15 years ago, she settled in Nassau County, Long Island, in a town with a large immigrant population. She began selling food throughout the neighborhood in order to sustain her family. Then one night, ICE knocked on her door at 2 a.m. and arrested her partner. The agents entered their bedroom and woke them. At the time, Julia was pregnant. She had no idea how she would support her family after the father of her children was deported. \"You can imagine how I feel when I see ICE cars [even now],\" she says. \"I stay paralyzed.\" In the early evening, a light bulb attached to an extension cord illuminates a stock pot of boiled corn (elote) and atole (a corn beverage infused with cinnamon, sugar and milk) on a folding table in Julia's driveway. As curious neighbors stop by for a warm beverage, she scoops the steaming atole into styrofoam cups and slathers cobs of corn with mayonnaise, crumbly white cheese and hot sauce. Although Julia once made $500 a week as a street vendor, she now settles for the $100 she makes from selling outside of her garage. Her new approach avoids the fines she once received, and she says she now sleeps with the peace of mind that she and her daughters are safe. Basinski of The Street Vendor Project says that a large decline in street vendors and their income could have significant cultural and economic implications for the city. \"Who could imagine New York City without street vendors?\" Basinski asks. \"If we don't have the streets as a home for small businesses to start and to thrive and grow, eventually that's going to affect the economy of New York City.\" A 2012 study conducted by the Institute for Justice found that street vendors contributed 17,960 jobs, $71.2 million in taxes and $192.3 million in wages to the city's economy that year. Hern\u00e1n, who once dreamt of expanding his churros business nationwide, has now put his plans on hold. If more of his vendors quit selling churros, he worries that next year will be the last for his churreria. \"I will have to close my business and go back to selling churros by myself,\" he says. \"Only the bravest will sell next year.\" This story is a collaboration with Feet in 2 Worlds.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state and object to Israeli building there and throughout the West Bank.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state and object to Israeli building there and throughout the West Bank. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital. President Trump has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But a third of Jerusalem's residents are not Israeli citizens at all. They're Palestinians who hold Israeli residency papers. Israel has revoked those papers from thousands of Palestinian residents, rights groups say. Jerusalem's mayor, however, would not acknowledge it. \"I'm not aware of anybody that his residency was provoked [sic],\" Mayor Nir Barkat said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition about the revocations. \"I think, factually, this is probably not true.\" But according to an August report by Human Rights Watch, Israel has revoked the residency status of at least 14,595 Palestinians in East Jerusalem since Israel captured the territory from Jordan in 1967. The group cited data that lawyers and rights groups collected from Israel's Interior Ministry through freedom of information requests and court cases. In recent years about 100 Palestinians annually have been stripped of their residency rights in the city, though in 2008 alone more than 4,500 Palestinians lost their residency permits, according to data compiled by the rights group HaMoked. The Interior Ministry did not respond to several requests by NPR for comment. Most of these revocations happened to Palestinians who left the city for an extended period of time, rights group say. Some groups have called it a \"silent transfer\" of Palestinians out of the city amid a battle over East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. \"It's the opposite of encouraging people to be part of Israeli society. It's to push them out,\" said Daniel Shenhar, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinians whose residency rights have expired. \"It's not violent. It's bureaucratic.\" After Israel captured East Jerusalem, the Palestinians who lived in that territory did not receive Israeli citizenship, but rather the lesser status of permanent residency. It does not give Palestinian residents of Jerusalem the right to vote in national elections that Israeli citizens enjoy. Yet it does grant them other rights, like access to national health care, social security and the right to work and travel throughout Israel. But unlike Israeli citizens in Jerusalem, Palestinians native to Jerusalem can lose their residency status and Israeli social benefits if they are away from the city for more than seven years, according to Shenhar. This affects Palestinians who go abroad to study or work, or who marry and have children abroad and wish to move back to their native city with their families. Khulood Kawamleh, 31, finds herself stateless. She was born in the United Arab Emirates to a Palestinian father from Jerusalem, but was never considered an Emirati national. Her father made frequent trips to his native Jerusalem to maintain his Jerusalem residency papers, and in 1999, when she was 13, her father moved the family to the city so they could become documented, too. But Israel never accepted her and her brother's request for residency permits, and offered no explanation, she said. She remains undocumented till today, without a bank account, driver's license or any ID. She keeps to a small section of the West Bank on the outskirts of Jerusalem to avoid detection by Israeli security. She dreamed of studying medicine in Germany, but has no travel documents to go abroad. Her lawyer says he's still fighting to get her a permit. You feel you're in a big cage. Maybe it's a strategy from Israel to make people lose hope in their country, that it's not the place to stay in. Khulood Kawamleh, 31, a stateless resident with a Palestinian father from Jerusalem \"You feel you're in a big cage,\" Kawamleh said. \"Maybe it's a strategy from Israel to make people lose hope in their country, that it's not the place to stay in.\" By contrast, Israeli citizens from Jerusalem can travel abroad, have families, return to the city and register their children as Israeli citizens, said Shenhar, the Israeli lawyer. \"I don't need to think twice if I can go study abroad,\" he said. Long legal battles have brought changes. Palestinians who wish to return to East Jerusalem are generally able to restore their residency status if they request it, Shenhar said. But they must first live in Jerusalem for at least two years on temporary status, and during that time, if they return with a spouse and children, their families must live without Israeli social benefits, he said. In the last couple of years, amid a wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings, Israel has stripped residency rights from Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, and their families, if they were found to have carried out such attacks. This revocation policy is currently suspended, Shenhar said. The Israeli Supreme Court this year set a precedent, saying Palestinians from Jerusalem have a special status and their connection to the city must be considered with regards to residency rights. There is a path for Palestinians from Jerusalem to cement their ties to the city: They may apply for Israeli citizenship. In recent years, according to Danny Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer specializing in East Jerusalem, the number of Palestinians in the city applying for Israeli citizenship has risen. But he says the number of citizenship requests Israel has approved has dropped.",

            "article_content": "President Trump campaigns ahead of Tuesday's midterms. A legal battle begins over whether a controversial question remains on the 2020 census. Iran plans to sell oil and break U.S.-imposed sanctions.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Ohio, Indiana, Missouri - President Trump has a full day of campaigning scheduled before Election Day tomorrow. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah. And he's been all over the place over the weekend. He was in Montana, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee. He's been talking up the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, did you see those numbers on Friday? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering). TRUMP: These are big numbers. America now has the hottest economy on earth. GREENE: OK. And the president is also sounding pretty bullish on his party's chances of keeping, maybe even expanding, their majority in the U.S. Senate, though not so much when it comes to keeping control of the House. MARTIN: All right. NPR politics correspondent Asma Khalid has been traveling with the president in these final hours, and she joins us now to talk about what she has seen and heard. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: So over the past couple of weeks, we have definitely heard the president lean into immigration as a theme. But we heard him just there touting the economy. How has he struck that balance, if there has been a balance? KHALID: Well, he has been touting the healthy economy, it seems like, more lately. You know, he's speaking about the record number of jobs. He's even talking about the tax cuts again. He likes to say that Democrats create mobs, Republicans create jobs. That's a line that we heard quite a bit. But he also, you know, as you mention, veers back into talking about cultural issues, particularly immigration. And he's trying to rally his base with threats, whether they're real or not, that if Democrats take over Congress, we'll see more people coming into the country illegally to commit crimes. You know, Rachel, what I thought was really interesting, though, is that over the weekend, we also saw former President Barack Obama campaigning in Indiana and Illinois, and he described this election as kind of a test of our character. You know, he said that Trump was fearmongering over immigration. And he in fact accused Republicans of blatantly lying about their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act's protections for preexisting conditions. MARTIN: So you mentioned that Barack Obama was in Indiana trying to shore up support for who is - Joe Donnelly, who's really become, like, an embattled Democrat fighting for his seat. And President Trump trying to capitalize on that. KHALID: Yep. You know, and he's also going to Indiana today. He'll also be going to Missouri. And really, that is precisely his goal, right? He really wants to flip those Democratic seats. Missouri and Indiana are two of the closest Senate races in the country, with Senator Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly. These are both incumbent Democrats, and these are both states that Trump won by about 20 percentage points in 2016. One note, though. He's also going to Ohio today to focus on the governors' race there, and that's why he was in Georgia over the weekend. You know, Trump's strategy is really to focus on places where he thinks he has the ability to sway the electorate. MARTIN: Right. And we've seen that that hasn't necessarily been in House races. That's where Democrats feel an advantage. So you also have been reporting all year about demographics, different voter groups. So as a result of what you have been learning, what are you looking for in the election tomorrow? KHALID: Well, early in the night, the No. 1 thing I'll be watching for are issues - health care versus immigration. These are two top issues we've seen in polling, and they've largely become a proxy for partisan partisanship. No. 2, real quick, I want to focus on the margins for two key demographics - white women and married women, in major part because the important races for the House are going to be fought in districts where the suburban women vote is key. MARTIN: OK. Great. We'll look out for that. Asma Khalid. She is co-host of the NPR Politics Podcast. Thanks so much, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. A trial is going to start today that could determine whether a controversial new question will stay on the 2020 census. GREENE: Yeah. It's a straightforward question, but there's so much packed into it, especially in this political moment. The question is, is this person a citizen of the United States? Six lawsuits have been filed in an effort to get the question removed, and the first trial starts today in New York City. No matter which side wins, this issue is really likely to be appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. MARTIN: NPR national correspondent Hansi Lo Wang has been covering these lawsuits since the beginning and joins us now. Hey, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Good morning Rachel. MARTIN: All right, Hansi. There are going to be people out there who are listening to this who say, wait, isn't the whole point of the census to count the number of U.S. citizens? So explain why this additional question is such a big deal. WANG: The census is a head count of both U.S. citizens and noncitizens. You know, who is counted is not based on citizenship. It's actually based on who's living here. And so asking about... MARTIN: People in America, regardless of citizenship. WANG: Exactly. Any person who is living in the country. And so asking about citizenship status - right now there is a body of research that the Census Bureau is putting out that is suggesting that this will lead to possibly a bad count, inaccurate information being collected. And the reason for that is that many people are scared of this question. There were focus groups conducted, and many people think that this question, they think that this is a way for the government to locate undocumented immigrants. And that's going to make the Census Bureau's job very, very hard. Their job, again, is to count everyone once and where they live. And, you know, it's not only their job. This is a constitutional requirement. MARTIN: So the fear is that people just wouldn't answer the question, would lie about how many people are actually living in their household, for fear of some kind of repercussions about their citizenship? WANG: Exactly. Or try not to answer at all. MARTIN: So why then was this added? Why is it that the Trump administration wants this question in there? WANG: That is one of the main questions in these lawsuits. What the Trump administration has said, you know, back in March when this question was announced, that this was for the Voting Rights Act - better enforcement of protections against racial discrimination, that this was a request coming from the Justice Department and the Justice Department needed more detailed data about citizenship. But just last night, I've seen court filings from testimony from the head of the Justice and Civil Rights Division, John Gore. And he testified that this citizenship question is not necessary for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Also the Census Bureau, after they received this request, they urged the commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census and also he was the one who decided to put this question onto the census, they urged him to pick an alternative to adding a citizenship question, an alternative way of collecting citizenship data that would be more accurate and costs less money. But the secretary really, really wanted to get a citizenship question onto the census. MARTIN: So what are you going to be looking for? As we noted, there have been several lawsuits filed. This is the first one, starting today. What are you going to keep your eye on? WANG: We're going to look for exactly, you know, what this judge rules. This is not going to be the final word. This is going to be really the beginning of a process that will go, very likely, all the way to the Supreme Court. The Census Bureau wants to have an early ruling, but it may not come until June when rulings are due by the Supreme Court. And that really puts pressure on the census because forms are supposed to be printed starting in May. MARTIN: Wow. Right. So it just takes so much money and so much time just to get the census printed and ready to go, they're going to - there's some urgency here in getting this decision made. WANG: Exactly. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang, thank you so much. We appreciate it, Hansi. WANG: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Next, to Iran, where the U.S. has turned up the pressure once again by reimposing economic sanctions. GREENE: Yeah. So let's get up to speed here. President Trump announced the return of sanctions six months ago. That's when he withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. That was the deal that required Iran to stop its nuclear program, and in exchange they could open up their economy to foreign trade and business. Well, some sanctions went back into force in August, but the ones taking effect today target Iran's major economic lifeline, its oil and gas exports. MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon covers Iran and joins us now from Istanbul. Peter, how painful are these sanctions likely to be? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, we're talking about a serious loss of oil revenue, certainly. The estimate is that Iran stands to lose about a million barrels a day in lost sales. The shipping industry, the financial sector, insurance, they're all being hit, as well, in this round of returning sanctions. So far, Tehran's been pretty defiant about all of this. President Rouhani says Iran will ignore the sanctions, keep selling its oil. He says it's the U.S. that's isolated, not Tehran. None of the other signatories, it's true - Russia, China, Germany, France or Britain - support this move. However, at the moment what's happening is Iran is scoring political points while the U.S. is inflicting real economic pain. MARTIN: I mean, isn't Rouhani right to some degree? I mean, can't Iran just keep doing trade, keep selling oil and gas to the European countries that have stayed in the Iran nuclear deal? KENYON: That actually is a big question. They can do that to a limited extent, probably. But while countries are vowing to defy these American sanctions, it's probably more useful to look at what the companies are doing. They're the ones who would be spending the money, and dozens of companies have already cut off their business with Iran explicitly because they're worried about losing access to the U.S. market. It includes French, Indian, Norwegian oil companies, the shipping giant Maersk, a whole bunch of European and Asian car companies, airlines, banks, construction, telecom firms. I mean, the list goes on. These sanctions are clearly having an impact. MARTIN: So the European governments can say all they want about wanting to keep trading business open with Iran as part of the nuclear deal, but they can't control their private corporations who say, listen, we don't want to jeopardize our U.S. markets and so we're going to curb our... KENYON: Exactly, and that's where the bottom line is. Yeah. MARTIN: Interesting. So returning the U.S. to a more hardline position on Iran has not exactly been something President Trump has kept a secret. He's wanted to do this for a long time as part of his broader Mideast foreign policy. But this move at this moment, this is a little awkward, is it not? Because it happens to directly benefit Iran's chief rival in the region Saudi Arabia. KENYON: Well, that's exactly right. And Saudi Arabia is currently engulfed in a scandal, the killing of a Saudi journalist inside the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul. So the troubles in Riyadh are seen in Iran as something of a gift. Officials there, government media, have been very busy condemning the Saudis over this killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who dared criticize the Saudi government. President Trump, meanwhile, says he doesn't like hearing about things like murders inside consulates, but he's not willing to punish the Saudis by canceling arms sales, which is a move other countries are considering. There's even a lawsuit about it in the U.K. Analysts are wondering if this furor will then die down and the Saudis will resume their role as the main ally in the region along with the Israelis. But the other question is whether this impacts other issues, like the ongoing war in Yemen, essentially a proxy war between the Saudis and the Iranians. MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon for us this morning. Peter, thanks so much. We appreciate it. KENYON: Thanks, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "More and more people are walking illegally into Canada as President Trump cracks down on immigrants in the United States. The increased number is testing a nation that historically welcomes refugees.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The uncertainty for immigrants in the United States is prompting more to cross the border into Canada. The latest people unsure of their future are about 200,000 Salvadorans who are in the U.S. under temporary protected status, which the Trump administration could extend or not today. Haitians and others have faced similar moments, and the net result is testing the U.S.'s northern neighbor, which historically welcomes refugees, as Lorne Matalon reports from Montreal. LORNE MATALON, BYLINE: Here's a recent bulletin from Canada's national public network, the CBC. (SOUNDBITE OF CBC NEWS BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Canada is bracing for a possible new wave of asylum-seekers. MATALON: Among the new arrivals is Agathe St. Preux, a Haitian. I met her as she shared lunch with other Haitians at a cafe. She says she lived in Miami for 12 years, but last summer, as signs signaled the end of a temporary U.S. residency program for Haitians, St. Preux crossed into Canada illegally and made her way to Montreal. AGATHE ST. PREUX: It's like I breathe better. Life is quiet here, and people are kind. MATALON: Canada has historically valued the skills and money that many migrants bring in. But Canada's refugee system's become overloaded since the election of President Donald Trump. DAVID BERGER: We've got a backlog today of maybe 30,000 claims, whereas about two years ago, the backlog was maybe 10 or 15,000. MATALON: That's David Berger, an immigration lawyer and former member of Canada's Parliament. New arrivals are supposed to get an immigration hearing within 60 days. That isn't happening. Berger says there aren't enough immigration judges, known in Canada as decision-makers. BERGER: We believe the government has to appoint more decision-makers. A hundred and twenty decision-makers is just not enough. MATALON: One national poll suggests 4 in 10 Canadians believe the country is taking in too many refugees. Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been criticized for a tweet he sent out last January saying, to those fleeing persecution, terror and war, Canadians will welcome you. Trudeau says immigrants benefit Canada culturally and economically. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: ...That being welcoming and open is a source of strength and... (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS) MATALON: In 2017, Canada took in 43,500 refugees, many who arrive by walking illegally into Canada. That number will rise to more than 50,000 by 2020, part of what Canada's ruling Liberal Party calls the most ambitious immigration levels in recent history. The fate of refugees has also complicated the Canada-U.S. diplomatic relationship at times. Trudeau's tweet was sent out the same day the Trump administration moved to ban travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations. Marjorie Villefranche heads Maison d'Haiti - Haiti House - a resource center for refugees. MARJORIE VILLEFRANCHE: I think that the tension is, how can a country like Canada, you know, admit that the United States is not a safe country? Politically, it's very difficult to - you know, to say that. MATALON: Canada does a lot to at least help refugees get started, even before a final decision on whether or not they can stay permanently. When refugees arrive, they get a monthly stipend - around $650. Their children can go to school, and like all Canadians, they get healthcare. Philip Oxhorn's a political scientist at McGill University. PHILIP OXHORN: There's undoubtedly overcrowding, but the state has done as much as one might expect, given the huge relative increase in the numbers of people coming. MATALON: Oxhorn says Canada is wrestling with those numbers. But given the government's plan to increase immigration levels, he expects the country will continue to value the place that refugees hold in Canada's multi-ethnic tapestry.

Updated at 12:24 p.m. ET One of the nation's most vocal promoters of unsubstantiated voter fraud claims hopes to eliminate his own party's sitting governor in Tuesday's primary. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach de-facto led President Donald Trump's voter fraud commission. He's a provocative, self-styled champion of election integrity \u2014 dogged by allegations of links to white nationalists and opposed by civil rights groups who see him as pursuing thinly veiled voter suppression. The day before the primary, President Trump tweeted an endorsement for Kobach, \"he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement! Strong on Crime, Border & Military.\" Kris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas.  He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement! Strong on Crime, Border & Military. VOTE TUESDAY! Trump made no reference to the voter fraud commission, which brought Kobach and the president together, but voter registration is still Kobach's rallying cry. \"Every time a non-citizen votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen,\" he said in a recent interview. \"That's a problem.\" But in federal court in March, experts tore apart his claims that non-citizens are carrying out widespread voter fraud. The judge who tried the case ruled against him. That ended what the ACLU called the nation's strictest voter registration system. Kobach had blocked tens of thousands of people from joining Kansas voter rolls. The same court case saw Kobach held in contempt for violating an injunction meant to safeguard voting rights. He was charged lawyer fees for that, and fined for misleading a judge. All of this happened even as Kobach campaigned to unseat Gov. Jeff Colyer. But it's unclear whether his courtroom woes will turn voters against him. Colyer is leveraging Kobach's most embarrassing moments in hopes that it will. \"There is only one candidate on this stage,\" Colyer said at a recent debate, \"who has been fined by a federal judge for lying to a federal court.\" Colyer is a fellow conservative who inherited the governorship earlier this year when his deeply unpopular predecessor left for a U.S. State Department job. But he isn't a shoo-in. Seven candidates are vying for the GOP nomination. The winning nominee doesn't need a majority \u2014 just the highest percentage of votes. At Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., political scientist Bob Beatty says that means Kobach's base could be his ticket to defeating Colyer. \"His strategy, and it may be a very good one, is, 'I don't need to change anybody's mind,' \" Beatty says. \" 'I just need to get my people out.' \" Kobach is selling himself as the true conservative \u2014 someone who won't compromise with the Republican party's moderate branch, let alone Democrats. \"If you're talking about a wishy-washy politician who just says whatever he thinks you want to hear,\" Kobach says, \"you don't know if that guy's going to deliver.\" The former law professor \u2014 with degrees from Harvard, Yale and Oxford \u2014 lost his bid for Congress in 2004 by a hefty margin. But he continued to build his profile by crafting and defending anti-immigration laws around the country. He has hosted his own talk radio show, writes for Breitbart and is a go-to guest when Fox News needs an unapologetic conservative. His critics accuse him of pandering to or benefiting from white nationalist sentiment, but he dismisses them. \"I don't have a racist bone in my body,\" he says. \"I believe we are all God's children.\" Kobach has repeatedly said Somali refugees stole a 2010 election in Kansas City \u2014 even though a court found that untrue. He's a key supporter of Trump's claim that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote in 2016. Politifact has dubbed the assertion \"Pants on Fire\" false. Kobach's war against voter fraud bonded him with the president from the start. He has confirmed Trump considered him to lead the Department of Homeland Security before tapping him for the voter fraud commission. More recently, the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., has been helping Kobach raise money for his campaign. Despite his White House contacts, Kobach says his aspirations aren't national. \"My objective is to lead the state of Kansas,\" he says. \"And to solve a couple of problems that we have.\" Top on his list, he says, is cutting taxes and finding ways to discourage immigrants who enter the country illegally from making Kansas their home. This story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics.",

Merkel's conservatives reached a \"breakthrough\" deal with the Social Democrats toward building a new coalition government, sources close to the negotiations said.\n                \n                    \n                    John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption German Chancellor Angela Merkel shakes hands Friday with the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Martin Schulz. Merkel's conservatives reached a \"breakthrough\" deal with the Social Democrats toward building a new coalition government, sources close to the negotiations said. Meet the new German government, same as the old German government. At least that's the plan of Chancellor Angela Merkel and her political allies, who Friday crafted a deal aimed at ending Germany's 3 1/2-month political crisis. It may appear an odd strategy, given that German voters gave the previous government the boot. All three parties making up the last grand coalition \u2014 the Christian Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) \u2014 ended up with historically low returns in last September's federal elections. But with snap elections looming after the conservatives tried and failed to reach a deal with several other German parties, the old partners were pressured by the German president \u2014 and ultimately, the public \u2014 to join together one more time. They avoided the lengthy public spectacle of earlier failed talks, which took place in November, and limited their negotiations to a single week in Berlin with an agreed-to \u2014 and largely observed \u2014 news blackout. Final talks began at 8 a.m. on Thursday and lasted 24 hours. Looking the worse for wear after the marathon session, Merkel, her CSU counterpart Horst Seehofer, and SPD leader Martin Schulz all praised each other and their parties' negotiators for persevering. \"I wasn't certain it would work,\" Merkel told reporters. \"The only thing clear to me is that that was a pretty difficult task but ... we kept telling each other we wanted to find a way forward and that's why we succeeded.\" Schulz thanked Merkel and Seehofer for their willingness to compromise, even though for months, he had openly rejected joining with them, vowing to make his party the main opposition party that would keep the chancellor in line. On Friday, he defended his and other SPD leaders' 180-degree turn. \"At a time when [German] society is drifting apart, we wanted to hold the society together,\" Schulz told reporters. Hurdles still remain. The SPD membership will vote on the proposed deal on Jan. 21, and their approval is by no means a given, says Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. The SPD \"referendum will, in fact, be a hard thing to win,\" Schwarzer tells NPR. \"If we think back to the election night, when Martin Schulz announced he would never enter into a government with Angela Merkel \u2014 and now he tries to convince his party base of just that \u2014 it shows the political challenges.\" SPD Parliamentarian Hilde Mattheis, who opposes a grand coalition, told the daily Schwaebische Zeitung that the mood in her party \"is still very fragile.\" If the SPD enters the government, she said, it will be handing the main opposition role in parliament to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). That is a big concern among many German politicians, given AfD was the third largest vote-getter after the conservatives and the Social Democrats. Being the largest opposition party in the German parliament means AfD will get to head a number of parliamentary committees and will receive public funding and other tools through which to promote its anti-Islam and anti-immigration political agenda. \"This will change the political debate in Germany,\" Schwarzer said. \"And that's something that Germany really has to prepare for.\" AfD leaders wasted no time tweeting their displeasure over the grand coalition deal and its first-ever cap on asylum seekers. Merkel and her allies agreed to a total yearly maximum of 220,000 people. In addition, following the passage of a new law next summer, up to 1,000 family members of refugees per month would be allowed to come to Germany. \"Unbelievable,\" tweeted AfD parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel, calling the proposed limit a \"farce.\" She wrote: \"How does the [Grand Coalition] plan to enforce an upper limit WITHOUT border security, our proposal for which was categorically rejected?\" The 28-page coalition deal also includes agreements on a variety of other topics, like emissions standards, more federal oversight over German education and increasing social welfare benefits. Seehofer told reporters this grand coalition would be different than the last one, and said the deal highlights that \u2014 for example, by including a basic pension guarantee. \"We learned during the election campaign \u2014 unfortunately too late \u2014 that having this basic guarantee was suddenly a top issue for people again,\" he said. The markets rallied at the news of the prospective deal and the euro jumped to a three-hear high. Many of Germany's international allies congratulated Merkel and the other governing coalition leaders. French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux called the agreement \"good for Germany, good for France and good for Europe.\" Prime Minister Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria, which holds the rotating European presidency, said he hoped \"that this process will come to an end soon because it will be for the benefit of all. \"All the topics that we raise also depend on the cooperation with Angela Merkel,\" Borissov said. \"We are waiting on this quite impatiently.\" But Schwarzer says Friday's deal is only a partial victory for Merkel, who has been politically weakened by her refugee policy and the mediocre election results. \"To some extent, it is clear that the Merkel era will come to an end,\" Schwarzer says, adding Merkel isn't likely to run again. \"So the question, for instance, will be whether she will stay for the whole term or whether she will actually build a successor and hand over to that person.\" Seehofer predicted a new government could be in place before April, if the Social Democrats give Schulz a green light later this month. If not, the political crisis in Germany could begin anew.",

            "article_content": "Nearly 1.8 million people live in Gaza. In recent days, as the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, dozens of people have died in protests along the fence between Gaza and Israel.  STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: And I'm Steve Inskeep reporting from Gaza. We're in this territory at the western border of Israel where Israeli troops killed many people yesterday as they were trying to leave. Gaza health officials put the death toll at at least 60. Protesters were approaching fences that wall off this Palestinian zone. It was the deadliest day in six weeks of protests. We're going to bring you, now, the story of the day before that violence, a day that we arrived in Gaza about 8:30 in the morning. (SOUNDBITE OF TURNSTILES CLICKING) INSKEEP: First, you have to get in. And to reach Gaza from Israel proper, we walked through a series of those steel turnstiles. You know, the kind that led you through, but only one way? Then a motorized cart picked us up. Giant wall with guard towers that make you think of a prison. And it wheeled us across a no man's land that smelled of untreated sewage to the next checkpoint, where NPR employee Abu Bakr Bashir guided us through. We've been through an Israeli checkpoint, a Palestinian Authority checkpoint. And, what is this? ABU BAKR BASHIR, BYLINE: Hamas checkpoint. INSKEEP: These are the guys with uniforms and guns. BASHIR: Yeah. The only guys with the guns are the Hamas guys. INSKEEP: That's right. Israelis hold the outside. The Palestinian Authority holds an inside checkpoint. But the real Palestinian checkpoint is inside that, run by the people with power in Gaza. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the United States but has held power here since winning elections in 2006. It rose among refugee families who fled Israel decades ago. They now live in a place where the buildings are shabby, the sea is brown with pollution, the economy is stagnant and Israel's security measures mean most people cannot get permission to leave. For one Palestinian we met, the frustration of those fences inspired a question. AHMAD ABU ARTEMA: What if there is no borders at all between the countries, between the peoples? INSKEEP: The man posing that question is of medium build, with glasses, and the cloth called a keffiyeh around his shoulders. Ahmad Abu Artema is a 33-year-old writer and says that since he was 2, he's only been allowed to leave this tiny territory a few times. ABU ARTEMA: What happened with me in Cairo, it was the first time to hear the sound of the civil planes. INSKEEP: Civilian airplanes? ABU ARTEMA: Yes. Here in Gaza, usually I hear the planes, F-16s then... INSKEEP: The F-16s. ABU ARTEMA: ...Bombs. Then bombs. INSKEEP: Commercial planes in Cairo made him feel the same way as Israeli warplanes that he knew. Years ago, he began talking of flying himself, flying over the Gaza fence like a bird. ABU ARTEMA: Why not we be like birds? Birds, they can cross this fence easily and back. INSKEEP: He talked with his friends of peaceful protests, of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, of hundreds of thousands of people scaling the fence in numbers too great for Israel's army to stop. Little happened until this year. That's when Hamas threw its power behind the protest idea, which meant the events grew more bloody than Artema anticipated. People raced toward the fences starting in March. On Sunday, Hamas was keeping people engaged until the next big wave. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING) INSKEEP: At noon, men in uniform halted all traffic in the center of Gaza City for five minutes. It was said to be an action planned in sympathy with the protests. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING) GAIL AUSTIN, BYLINE: There are people greeting each other in the middle of the streets, giving each other kisses on each cheek just in between the cars. INSKEEP: That's our editor Gail Austin. At 12:05, cars began rolling past a giant billboard portraying a young man with a slingshot slinging a stone. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING) INSKEEP: That billboard bore the date of Monday, May 14. Those are some of the small ways used to mobilize the population for a perilous cause. We drove to see a Hamas spokesman. Ismail Radwan sat with us beneath a Palestinian flag and a Hamas flag. What have the protests accomplished up to now, in your view? ISMAIL RADWAN: (Foreign language spoken). INSKEEP: He said brought the whole Palestinian cause back onto the table of the international community. He said Hamas has found these six weeks of protest to be so successful, the organization is planning several weeks more. It's a relatively new tactic for Hamas, which is much better known for its armed militant wing, but Hamas says it still maintains the right to bear arms against people they view as oppressors. Does Hamas still stand for the removal of the state of Israel, the elimination of Israel? RADWAN: (Through interpreter) This is not the way you ask Palestinians or Hamas a question. INSKEEP: \"We're in a coalition now with the Palestinian Authority,\" he said. \"Like them, we're only demanding a Palestinian state on currently occupied territory.\" I reminded him, though, of something that Israel says. They say, we must use strong measures against Hamas because Hamas wishes to eliminate Israel. When Israel says that, is it a lie? RADWAN: (Foreign language spoken). INSKEEP: He said, that's just anti-Palestinian propaganda but later added it was essentially true. RADWAN: (Through interpreter) Now, to go to the recognition, Hamas does not recognize the Zionist entity because it's an occupation. INSKEEP: This view has given Israel reason not to deal with Hamas, instead cracking down on Gaza. Now thousands of Gazans were preparing to push back. Near a spot where Palestinians often gather to approach the fence, we met Mohammed al Kurd. He was 16. He held a heavy metal tool in his hands. What are these? What are these things in your hands? MOHAMMED AL KURD: (Foreign language spoken). INSKEEP: \"It's a bolt cutter,\" he said, \"for the Israeli fence.\" He said he had made it to the fence in the past without being shot. KURD: (Through interpreter) It is very amazing. It makes you feel that you're actually, you're doing something good for your land, for your country. INSKEEP: And as he thought ahead to Monday, he was dreaming of breaching the fence and burning military buildings on the far side, and walking to the village in Israel where his grandparents once lived. As we talked, children strolled on the bare sand toward Israel's barrier. So now we have a couple of kids who are just marching off into no man's land. Neither of them can be 18 years old. We heard shots from the direction of Israeli troops. Three gunshots now. And there's some kids down here. They're just wandering around toward the fence. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS) INSKEEP: That was closer. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE RUNNING) INSKEEP: The small crowd of young men retreated ever so slightly for the moment. That was Sunday. They were waiting for Monday, the day when thousands of people turned out for the protests, and more than 50 would be killed. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The government shutdown enters its 10th day. Volunteers in El Paso, Texas, staff pop-up medical clinics to screen migrant children at the border. Ballots are counted in Congo's presidential election.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: How do Congress and the president find their way out of a partial government shutdown? NOEL KING, HOST: If you're just catching up after a few days off, the news of the shutdown is the same as when you left. Today is a work day for many people but not for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. President Trump demanded funding for a border wall. He wants it attached to an otherwise routine spending bill. In the last days of the fully Republican Congress, the House and Senate passed different measures. Now President Trump has been talking with some Republicans, but it's not clear what he's willing to offer Democrats who are about to take over the House. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley covers the White House and has been covering this story of course. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Anybody have any ideas how to get out of this? HORSLEY: (Laughter) They're looking around. You know, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had lunch with the president yesterday and floated this idea of perhaps swapping the billions of dollars in wall funding that the president wants for a reprieve for the so-called DREAMers - that is, young people who were brought to the country as children and were living in the country illegally - and others who've been living here on a temporary status. Worth noting, though, you know, the president had a deal like that earlier in the year that would have included a lot more wall funding. INSKEEP: Yeah. HORSLEY: And it was blown up by some of the hard-liners within the White House. INSKEEP: And so it was the president who turned down that deal before and the president who would need to sign on this time. Is there any indication the Democrats would still take that deal, Scott? HORSLEY: Democrats seem to be holding a firm line. They're saying, we're not interested in funding your wall. And of course their leverage will only increase later this week. Up until now, Democrats have really only had veto power to block legislation in the Senate. But come Thursday, they will control the House. INSKEEP: Scott, I just want to make sure I understand the stakes here as hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain off the job and some agencies remain partially closed. The president originally demanded a wall across the entire border, has more recently said it's OK to have a wall across most of the border. And even more recently, he's changed his images of the wall to make it a fence. So he wants a fence over lots of the border. And there's already fence over lots of the border. Are we - is this debate actually getting smaller and smaller to the point where it's not really about very much? HORSLEY: It's a very symbolic debate and really has been all along. But the president has kind of toggled between messages. On the one hand, he says we must have a wall to protect border security. In other settings, though, he'll say the wall is largely built. So he's been very inconsistent in his message. And he's been mocked by Democrats for that changing description of the wall. I think the House speaker in waiting, Nancy Pelosi, joked that before long he's going to have a beaded curtain. INSKEEP: We're - (laughter) a beaded curtain. HORSLEY: And, you know, you're right, Steve, about the impact of the shutdown. It has been somewhat muted up until now during the holidays except for those 800,000 federal workers who are either furloughed or working without pay. But over time, you know, the effects will begin to pile up. Later this week, we're going to see the Smithsonian museum shut down along with the National Zoo. The EPA halted operations over the weekend. So the effects will be mounting. I talked to a fellow with a nonprofit group that works at Joshua Tree National Park out in California. You know, right now they have volunteers stocking the bathrooms with toilet paper. But over time, he said, the pit toilets are going to fill up; the dumpsters are going to fill up. And that's kind of a metaphor for what's happening throughout the government. INSKEEP: Perfect ending - Scott, we'll just leave you right there. HORSLEY: Good to be with you, Steve. INSKEEP: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Happy New Year to you. HORSLEY: Happy New Year. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The Department of Homeland Security wants more stringent medical screenings of minors detained at the border. KING: Right, this is happening after two migrant children died while in U.S. custody. But more of these screenings mean more resources, and government agencies are already overwhelmed. The U.S. government reportedly released more than 1,600 migrants last week. These are people arrested at the border who can't be detained. INSKEEP: Some of them end up in shelters. And Monica Ortiz Uribe spent time with a pediatrician who treats migrants at one shelter. She's on the line. Good morning. MONICA ORTIZ URIBE, BYLINE: Hi, good morning. INSKEEP: Just to understand who we're talking about here, these are people who were effectively arrested by Border Patrol or are taken into custody by ICE and then released by ICE. Is that right? URIBE: Yeah, that's correct. So, you know, the policy - the so-called catch and release policy applies mostly to Central Americans who can't automatically be turned around and deported the way Mexican nationals can be. So when ICE apprehends a Central American migrant, they can either put them in a detention center or release them with a future date. And because the courts are so backlogged, the immigration courts, they - these migrants can often wait for months or years in the U.S. before their case is decided. INSKEEP: Oh, which is the very thing that President Trump says he dislikes because he sees it as an incentive for people to cross the border illegally. They effectively get here even if they've got a court date looming over their heads. But... URIBE: Correct. INSKEEP: ...The administration is releasing people because they can't detain all of them. Are aid organizations in El Paso able to absorb all the families that are coming now? URIBE: Well, that's the million-dollar question. So far they have been. Donations have kept up, and they've been able to find enough space so that migrants can spend one or two nights here in El Paso before continuing on to meet relatives in other parts of the U.S. But, yeah, the director of the local shelter network is named Ruben Garcia. And he says their goal is to find enough beds for 3,000 people per week in case the numbers increase. RUBEN GARCIA: It's going to take activating more sites. It's going to mean finding more churches or organizations that are willing to receive refugees. URIBE: So the key word here is willing. Annunciation House runs on the public's goodwill, and that's online financial donations and an army of volunteers. If the number of migrant families starts to exceed their capacity, Garcia says they may have to turn to the city of El Paso for help, asking it to open up more shelters and provide the staff to run them. INSKEEP: Although we heard there the appeal not for governments to step up but for private citizens. Who is stepping forward? URIBE: Yeah, the variety is extraordinary. These are low-income folks who rely on a food pantry for meals. They've volunteered to cook for the migrants. People have flown in from as far away as Maine to help out for a week or two. Then there's the college students who are on winter break. People go to Costco and fill up a cart with diapers and jackets to take to the shelters. I'm also told that the wife of Stanford's head football coach in town for today's annual Sun Bowl game brought the migrant families Popeye's chicken for lunch yesterday. One volunteer told me it's like a big Mexican family. When more people show up for Christmas, you simply find the extra room. INSKEEP: Oh, goodness, OK, so a kind of festive scene even though it's in some ways dark because people don't know what their future is going to be. URIBE: Yeah, it's bringing a lot of people out to help, inspiring their, yeah, sense to help. INSKEEP: Monica, Happy New Year. URIBE: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's reporter Monica Ortiz Uribe in El Paso, Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We go now to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a presidential election has been called into question. KING: That's right. After more than two years of delays, Congolese went to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president. Now the votes are being counted, and opposition candidates are alleging widespread irregularities. The outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, says the problems were minor, and he's praised the Congolese people for voting in peace and dignity. INSKEEP: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is in the capital, Kinshasa, covered the vote, is monitoring developments. Hey there, Ofeibea. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings. INSKEEP: What's happening? QUIST-ARCTON: Oh, my goodness, let me just remind you, Steve, why these elections are so important and so key and why the stakes are so high, because of course President Joseph Kabila, who has been in power for almost 18 years, says he's stepping down. And the election has been delayed for two years, since December 2016, prompting the opposition to charge that Kabila was trying to remain in power and stay past his mandate. And, you know, Congo's presidential election should enable this vast country, which is rich but poor, to finally have a peaceful and democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. So that's why these elections are so important and why there's so much tension. INSKEEP: Well, absolutely, because if you don't have a transfer of power, you by definition don't really have a - don't really have a democracy. You certainly don't have an open election system. So why is the opposition saying there was a problem with this election? QUIST-ARCTON: They say right from the start - and one of them, Felix Tshisekedi, has deplored what he called disorder. Now, he says the Congolese government has deliberately manipulated election day chaos because it wants to trigger a court challenge to allow Joseph Kabila, who has effectively been this caretaker president for two years, to stay on. And analysts say they're only - you know, the only thing they can do then is go to court. But any sort of court challenge would be a dead end for the opposition. You have Martin Fayulu, another opposition candidate, who read out a long list of supposed irregularities, he said, including jammed voting machines, late opening of polling stations, missing voters' registers. And he says, you know, opposition coalition observers who are meant to be in the polling stations were kicked out when it came to the time to count ballots, so there a stream of fury from the opposition about all that's going on. INSKEEP: Were there independent monitors of this election, Ofeibea? And if so, what are they saying? QUIST-ARCTON: Let me tell you not from The Carter Center in Atlanta and not from the European Union but, yes, lots and lots of local ones, 20,000. But even these election observers reported multiple difficulties in voting. The influential Catholic Church, which has mediated in peace talks between the government and the opposition, voted at least 1,500 problems, a third of them with these controversial new voting machines which were apparently sourced in South Korea and being used for the first time. Technology flummoxed not only the machines, which jammed and didn't work, but also lots of voters who are used to manual ballots, so lots and lots of problems. The question is, though, will the vote be credible? Will the results be credible? Will the Congolese who were determined to vote in their millions finally choose the president they feel should be the president and not who anyone else feels should be the president? That is the key... INSKEEP: And... QUIST-ARCTON: ...After election. INSKEEP: And we will be listening for your reporting. Ofeibea, thanks so much. QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure. Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: And Happy New Year to you, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 12:20 p.m. ET Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her ruling alliance have secured another term in power following Bangladesh's general election Sunday, during which the military was deployed and almost 20 people were killed. The results, announced Monday by the Bangladesh Election Commission, have been rejected by the main opposition party, which accuses Hasina's party of rigging the election, according to the Associated Press. Voting in Bangladesh election disrupted by violence[tap to expand]https://t.co/tQuiSI8RT1 pic.twitter.com/FGWuFlK9Mp On Monday, Hasina said her government tried to ensure a free election and that the opposition lost because it lacked leadership, Reuters reports. The United Nations in a statement issued Monday said it was aware of the violence and \"reports of irregularities\" in the elections. \"We call on all sides to exercise restraint and ensure a peaceful post electoral environment, where people can maintain their right to assembly and expression,\" a U.N. spokesman said. \"We encourage the parties to address electoral complaints in a peaceful manner and through legal means. Violence and attacks on people and property are not acceptable.\" Hasina, who has been in office since 2009, is credited with almost a decade of continued GDP growth in Bangladesh as well as the development of a roughly $30 billion garment export industry, second-largest only to China. She also has been applauded for her handling of the Rohingya refugee crisis, reports Al Jazeera. Her ruling Awami League alliance won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats up for grabs during Sunday's election, AP reports. Joyeeta Bhattacharjee, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank based in New Delhi, says Hasina's development-centered pitch helped her win re-election. She told NPR the country's improving economy \"has boosted the morale of the people like anything.\" For common people, especially in an impoverished country like Bangladesh, Bhattacharjee says, everyday issues such as economic growth and development are more important than human rights violations and cracking down on free speech. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has accused Hasina's decade-long rule of becoming increasingly authoritarian, according to AP. The lead-up to this weekend's election saw a widespread crackdown on dissent and the media. Hasina's opponents also complained that they were unable to campaign freely because of intimidation, allegations the ruling party denies. Hasina's administration also drew flak for the arrest of a prominent Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam. And her political rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been imprisoned since February after being sentenced to five years for alleged corruption and was ineligible to mount her own campaign, reports Voice of America. These concerns prompted the U.S. to send election monitors, according to Reuters. During Sunday's vote, at least 17 people were killed, despite some 600,000 security forces being deployed to contain any violence, police tell the news agency. Opposition alliance leader Kamal Hossain called Sunday's vote \"flawed\" and he called for a new vote under a neutral administration \"as soon as possible,\" according to Reuters. His party won just seven parliamentary seats, AP reports. \"We've had bad elections in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,\" Hossain told Reuters. He said candidates witnessed ballot-stuffing, vote-rigging and the barring of opposition polling agents from voting centers by ruling party activists. The Election Commission will investigate the allegations, which the ruling party deny. The last time Bangladesh went to the polls in 2014, the BNP boycotted the election, more than half the parliamentary seats went uncontested and violence left at least 18 people dead.",

The year was filled with political news as we tracked the 2018 midterm elections. We continued our coverage of Puerto Rico's recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria significantly damaged the island in 2017. Photographers documented South American migrants who traveled in caravans in hopes of reaching the U.S. We worked closely with the NPR investigations team on stories about a silent epidemic of sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities and how the government has not intervened in continued health problems associated with coal mining. As part of the Above The Fray fellowship, we worked on stories in Papua New Guinea, which has one of the highest rates of intimate partner violence in the world. NPR's international desk reported on the many facets of China's influence around the globe in its series China Unbound. Stories about everyday life in the U.S. kept us busy as we examined what it's like in prison when working on a college degree or raising children. By partnering with Gene Demby on NPR's Code Switch team, we explained the lasting history of housing segregation in the country. We dug into home price data 10 years after the Great Recession to see where housing affordability stands. This year, we brought back The Picture Show, a platform that focuses on visual stories. Photographers shared their projects such as discovering new traditions during Eid al-Fitr, documenting a migrant caravan and covering a pageant that crowned Miss Navajo Nation. There were plenty of stories that took us away from the busy news cycle, including a look at melodic drumming. We answered questions like how birds get oxygen inside their eggs before they hatch. We highlighted the joy of building kites in the Hakimpara Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. Here is a look back at a collection of memorable stories from the year. Seven months after Hurricane Maria, thousands of people in the Puerto Rican mountains were still waiting for the lights to come back on. Why was power restoration for the last 2 percent so difficult?

However, it wasn't until 2014 that people came together and organized a migrant caravan from the border of Guatemala and Mexico to the U.S.-Mexico border. Besides allowing people to band together to migrate in a much safer way, these caravans are mostly driven by a common theme or goal, whether as assistance to those affected by the earthquakes in Oaxaca and Mexico City or in solidarity with those already traversing the country aboard freight trains in search of a new life in the U.S. or Mexico. The 2018 caravan was joined in April of this year by Diversidad Sin Fronteras, Diversity Without Borders, the second trans-gay-migrant caravan, which celebrates inclusivity and diversity among migrants.

Some of the \"kites\" are little more than a plastic bag flapping on a string. But some are more sophisticated, with long tails and frilly tassels. Studies show that troops who repeatedly fire powerful, shoulder-launched weapons can experience short-term problems with memory and thinking. They may also feel nauseous, fatigued and dizzy.

One late night in the spring of 1984, a group of sauced drag queens leaving Pyramid Club in Manhattan came up with an idea: a Woodstock for drag performers. Flash-forward a year: The first official Wigstock was born in Tompkins Square Park. Over the next 16 years, the performers kept coming and crowds kept swelling, sometimes into the tens of thousands. Eventually, a combination of inclement weather and trouble getting permits nixed the outdoor festival for good around the turn of the millennium. But over Labor Day weekend, after a 17-year hiatus and a massive rise of drag in pop culture, Wigstock returned \u2014 reborn on a rooftop venue in the city's Seaport District, with a massive sound system and partners like Tony Award-winning actor Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka. Housing segregation is in everything. But to understand the root of this issue, you have to look at the government-backed policies that created the housing disparities we see today. Gene Demby explains how these policies came to be and what effect they've had on schools, health, family wealth and policing. Loading... Don't see the graphic above?

As of late November, 38 of the 41 congressional districts that Democrats turned from red to blue were suburban, according to an analysis by The New York Times. But more granular than congressional districts overall are the counties that compose them. We mapped the percentage of House ballots cast for the party that received the most votes in each suburban county, and we looked at how that compared with 2016.

It's a nice arching shot, but the ball bounces tenuously on the rim and doesn't go in. It's late June and Angel is already thinking about playing for his high school basketball team in Texas, 1,700 miles away. But he doesn't know whether he'll get there in time for November tryouts. That's because Angel's parents are farmworkers. In the early 1990s, before Angel was born, his family started migrating from Texas to North Dakota, where there was work harvesting potatoes, corn, beans and beets. That flexibility is a big deal for employers who rely on seasonal workers to quickly harvest and process crops before they spoil. But it puts workers' kids \u2014 more than 300,000 of them nationwide, according to the Department of Education \u2014 in a tough situation: keeping their grades up in a system designed for students who start and finish the year at the same school. Your body needs oxygen to function \u2014 and that was true even before you were born. As you grew inside your mother's womb, even before you had working lungs, your cells were crying out for oxygen. And your mother kindly answered that call. Oxygen and nutrients from her blood made their way down your umbilical cord, through your belly button, and fueled your body. Now consider a chick \u2014 before it has hatched. It's cut off from its mother by a hard shell and a couple of membranes. There's no way for the hen to get her still-developing offspring the oxygen it desperately needs; the pre-hatchling is on its own. So why don't bird embryos suffocate inside their eggs?

The mid-20th century was a bad time to be an apple lover. The produce section of supermarkets only had a few apples, and one stood tall above the rest: Mealy, and tough-skinned, it was the Red Delicious. Back in those days, apples were a commodity, and the race to provide apples at the lowest price suppressed prices for all apple growers and discouraged apple innovation. A few things helped change that world for the better \u2014 and chief among them was the discovery of the Honeycrisp. This is the story of that miracle apple and the innovation that made the business of better apples sustainable \u2014 all while hastening the downfall of the Red Delicious.

It's well known that President Trump wants a wall on the southern U.S. border. He insists it's urgent to curb illegal immigration. But more than any wall, new barriers to legal immigration are likely to have more bearing on people trying to enter the United States. The United States is rejecting more legal immigrants than ever before. The first casualty in 2018 was the U.S. refugee resettlement program, says Larry Yungk, a former official at the U.N. refugee agency and now co-chair of the advisory committee of Church World Service's refugee program. \"This is one where the knobs were in reach,\" he explains, referring to the president's prerogative to set the yearly refugee admission cap. After framing refugees as a security threat, Trump slashed resettlement admission numbers for a second year to a historic low, says Yungk. Just 22,491 refugees were resettled in the U.S. in fiscal year 2018, roughly half the 45,000 cap. \"He has managed to convince people that somehow, out of the 75 million persons who enter the U.S. each year who are not American citizens, refugees are the ones we should worry about the most,\" he says. Now, the refugees approved for resettlement are mostly from Africa and European countries from the former Soviet Union. More than 2,500 were from Ukraine in fiscal 2018, according to the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. At the same time, the number of Muslim refugees is down by 90 percent since fiscal year 2017, and Latin American refugee numbers are down by almost 40 percent, even though these asylum seekers are coming from regions that produce some of the highest numbers of refugees due to civil wars and violence. Just 62 Syrian refugees were resettled in the U.S. in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The cuts have been devastating for resettlement agencies. There are nine voluntary agencies that receive federal funding based on the number of refugees they resettle. Drastic budget cuts and staff layoffs began in 2018 and are expected to continue through 2019. \"This is very much the dismantling of the program's infrastructure in the U.S.,\" says Jennifer Quigley, an advocacy strategist with Human Rights First in Washington, D.C. She believes the president's aim is to zero out the refugee resettlement program. \"We would not be surprised if we do not have this program at the end of this administration,\" she says. Administration officials have offered different reasons for the cuts, including security concerns, protecting American jobs and support of the U.N. refugee agency for work in Lebanon and Turkey. When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in September that the U.S. would admit no more than 30,000 refugees in fiscal year 2019, he said the lower refugee ceiling would help improve national security. Still, restricting the refugee program appears part of a larger administration aim to restrict or close paths to legal immigration, advocates say. A variety of programs are targeted and have new restrictions. The Department of Homeland Security has its highest rate of denial on record for foreign-born U.S. residents applying for work permits, travel documents and applications based on family reunification and petitions for fianc\u00e9s. New policies slow or stop the admission of skilled foreign workers and entrepreneurs. The number of international students in the U.S. has declined in the past two years, in part because of visa restrictions. The U.S. military has also abruptly discharged some foreign-born recruits who were promised an expedited path to citizenship. Hundreds of thousands of longtime U.S. residents have lost temporary protected status and are now subject to deportation. The TPS program, established by Congress in 1990, was created to offer protections to foreign nationals of countries devastated by natural disasters or armed conflict. It allows them to get work permits, pay taxes and establish new lives in the U.S. Even as the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies have triggered a crisis on the southern border, another less-known crisis is brewing along the northern U.S. border with Canada. Fearing Trump's crackdown, thousands have entered Canada at unmarked locations along the border this year. The largest group is Haitians, fearing deportation with the cancellation of TPS protection, followed by Nigerians, Turks, Syrians and Eritreans. The wave of asylum seekers has swamped Canada's immigration system. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blames his country's migration woes on the U.S. policies. In an interview last week, Trudeau cited \"domestic realities within the political context in the United States\" for driving people to flee across the Canadian border. The stream of asylum seekers has become a political wedge issue for Trudeau, who is up for re-election in the fall of 2019. Polls show a majority of Canadians believe there is a migration crisis as opposition politicians hammer Trudeau for failing to control the border and disregarding public safety. \"You have political leaders on the right whipping up hysteria. The genie is out of the bottle in terms of political rhetoric, and I don't think we are going to be able to put it back,\" says Craig Damian Smith, associate director of the Global Migration Lab at the University of Toronto. \"I think the danger is in the public discourse and eventually the violence towards asylum seekers and growing xenophobia. It's scary, especially when Canada is supposed to be this beacon of liberalism and multiculturalism.\"",

The U.S. has ushered in its first Native American and Muslim congresswomen, its first lesbian mom in Congress and the first openly gay man elected as a governor. South Dakota and Maine elected their first female governors, Tennessee and Arizona sent their first women to the Senate, and Massachusetts and Connecticut elected their first black women to the House. As NPR has previously reported, record numbers of Native Americans, Muslim Americans and women, including many women of color, ran for office in 2018. A \"rainbow wave\" of LGBTQ candidates also sought office. And after the ballots were cast, all those groups notched notable firsts. No, voters did not elect the first Native American governor (Paulette Jordan lost in Idaho) or the first openly transgender governor (Christine Hallquist lost in Vermont). And in Georgia, Stacey Abrams' bid to be the country's first black female governor is still up in the air \u2014 Secretary of State Brian Kemp has a slim lead, but Abrams has not conceded and is pushing for a runoff. But here are some of the winning candidates who made history on Tuesday: First openly gay man elected governor: Colorado Democrat Jared Polis Jared Polis arrives onstage with running mate Dianne Primavera in Colorado.

Polis defeated Walker Stapleton to become the first openly gay man elected governor in the U.S. \"We proved that we're an inclusive state that values every contribution regardless of someone's sexual orientation or gender identity,\" Polis said during his victory speech, according to Denver's CBS4 TV station. \"For the LGBTQ pioneers ... who endured so much hardship and hurt to make it possible for so many of us, myself included, to live and to love openly and proudly, and to the people in this room, I want to say I am profoundly grateful for all the work we've done to overcome.\" New Jersey's former Gov. Jim McGreevey came out as gay as he resigned. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT governor elected when she won her office in 2016. Polis' partner, Marlon Reis, and two children, Caspian and Cora, will be moving into the governor's mansion. \"Polis made millions in e-commerce and backs single-payer health care, set a goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, supports greater distances between oil and gas drilling operations and homes and schools, and wants the state to fund preschool and full-day kindergarten,\" writes Bente Birkeland of Colorado Public Radio.

Davids is a lawyer and a former MMA fighter (one of her ads featured her attacking a punching bag). \"We have the opportunity to reset expectations about what people think when they think of Kansas,\" Davids said in her victory speech, according to The Kansas City Star. She is also the first openly gay congresswoman from Kansas. \"She really feels like the voice for all the LGBT folks in the Midwest,\" one LGBT activist told the Star. Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, sailed to an easy win in New Mexico's 1st District. She, too, is a lawyer, as well as a former tribal administrator and field organizer for Barack Obama. \"Somebody has to be the first,\" she told NPR's Leila Fadel in Albuquerque this summer. \"Native women, I mean, we've been on the front lines for a long, long time. Think of all the Native women who have fought for treaty rights and fishing rights and all of those things.\" A number of men with Native American ancestry have served in the U.S. Congress since the 19th century. There are currently two Native Americans in Congress, both Republican men from Oklahoma: Markwayne Mullin, a enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, and Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation. First Muslim congresswomen:  Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both Democrats Omar and Tlaib both won handily in heavily Democratic districts that are majority white and overwhelmingly non-Muslim. \"I stand here before you tonight as your congresswoman-elect with many firsts behind my name,\" Omar said in her victory speech. \"The first woman of color to represent our state in Congress. The first woman to wear a hijab to represent Minnesota ... The first refugee ever elected to Congress. And one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\" She is the first Somali-American in Congress. She is taking over the seat of Democrat Keith Ellison, who became the first Muslim elected to Congress back in 2006. \"Omar is the youngest of seven children,\" NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao reported in 2016. \"She and her family fled from the Somali civil war and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. When she came to the United States in 1995, she spoke only Somali. As her English improved, she began translating for her grandfather at political events in the Twin Cities.\" Tlaib is a Detroit native and the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, making her the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress. She secured the seat back in August, when she won the Democratic primary to replace long-serving Rep. John Conyers, who resigned after sexual harassment allegations. She faced no Republican candidate in the general election. As NPR has previously reported, Tlaib's Muslim and Palestinian identity drew national attention, but the local focus was on her strong reputation as a constituent-focused state lawmaker and her progressive politics. Tlaib is an environmental advocate who faced off against Koch Carbon in a fight over petroleum coke storage along the Detroit River. She ran to the left of other Democratic candidates. \"I'm a different kind of public servant,\" Tlaib told the Detroit Free Press after her victory. \"I do activism work here at home. I grew up in a community that founded the labor rights movement. ... Being [in Congress] is going to be important so that my residents feel like they have a seat at the table but also someone with a lot of courage to stand up and speak up.\" First Latina congresswomen from Texas: Democrats Sylvia Garcia and Veronica Escobar Democrat Sylvia Garcia is one of two Latina congresswomen elected in Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard W.

She is taking the seat vacated by Beto O'Rourke, who challenged Ted Cruz's Senate seat. Garcia won in the 29th District, succeeding longtime Democratic Rep. Gene Green for a district covering the eastern Houston area. When the Texas Tribune asked her this spring about her widely anticipated win, Garcia said she wasn't focusing on being one of the state's first Latina representatives. \" I don't really ever think about those things,\" she said. \"I never really wanted to be the first. I wanted to be the best.\" First lesbian mom in Congress: Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig, a former health care executive, is the first lesbian mother to be elected to Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Mone/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Craig, a former health care executive, won a tight race for Minnesota's 2nd District, defeating incumbent Jason Lewis. The race was a rematch; Craig fell short of unseating Lewis back in 2016. Craig and her wife, Cheryl Greene, have four sons; one is in high school and three are in college. Craig and her former partner had to fight a legal battle to adopt their son, Craig's oldest child, because of opposition to same-sex adoption. In her victory speech, Craig said her victory would not have been possible \"without the love and support of my family.\" A crowd of her supporters chanted \"Cheryl! Cheryl!\" as the couple embraced. She then thanked each of her sons one by one, boasting about their school performance and job offers along the way. \"I'm not running because I would be the first lesbian mom,\" Craig told NPR earlier this fall. \"But that's pretty cool I would be.\" Craig is also the first openly gay woman from Minnesota to be elected to Congress. Massachusetts' first black member of the House: Democrat Ayanna Pressley Democrat Ayanna Pressley is the first black woman Massachusetts has ever sent to Congress, and the state's first black member of the House of Representatives.\n                \n                    \n                    Joseph Prezio/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Ayanna Pressley is the first black woman Massachusetts has ever sent to Congress, and the state's first black member of the House of Representatives. Pressley is the first black woman Massachusetts has ever sent to Congress and the state's first black member of the House of Representatives. Her primary win was a surprise \u2014 and a message to the Democratic establishment. Her opponent, a popular longtime incumbent, had the backing of the party while she mustered grass-roots support. \"The Democratic Party has referred to African-American women as the backbone of the party, but in recent years, some black organizers have expressed frustration that the party has not invested in recruiting black candidates,\" NPR's Asma Khalid reported this fall. \"Pressley's victory is a sign that organizers and activists are no longer willing to wait for the party's blessing.\" Pressley spoke to NPR this fall about the challenges she faced in running for office as a black woman: \"I was told everything from I shouldn't be wearing my hair in twists, I shouldn't wear hoops, I shouldn't be as transparent about my personal hardships. I think that more of us need to feel empowered ... to authentically represent our lived experience.\" Massachusetts' first black member of Congress was Edward Brooke. When Brooke was elected in 1966, he was the first black senator elected by popular vote (state legislators sent two black men to the Senate during Reconstruction). Tennessee's first female senator: Republican Marsha Blackburn Blackburn is a \"loyal conservative foot soldier,\" NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote last year, further to the right than outgoing Republican Sen. Bob Corker. In 2002, when she was elected to the House of Representatives, \"she became the first woman elected to Congress in Tennessee who hadn't followed her husband in the position,\" Taylor reported. But unlike many Democratic women running for office this year, Blackburn did not emphasize her gender on the campaign trail. After she won the primary, her history-making victory on Tuesday was widely expected. Tennessee hasn't elected a Democratic U.S. senator since the 1990s. Arizona's first female senator: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema or Republican Martha McSally As of 8:30 a.m. ET, Arizona's Senate race was still too close to call, with McSally slightly leading in votes. But no matter who wins, Arizona will be sending a woman to the Senate for the first time. Both Sinema and McSally currently serve in the House of Representatives. Sinema, who, if she wins, would also be the country's first bisexual senator, ran as a centrist. McSally, a former Air Force pilot who was the first U.S. female fighter pilot to fly in combat, had to run to the right to make it through the Republican primary. Connecticut's first black woman sent to Congress: Democrat Jahana Hayes Hayes is a history teacher \u2014 the 2016 National Teacher of the Year \u2014 who ran on a progressive platform, supporting a single-payer health care system and immigration reform, as well as support for public education. She's joining Connecticut's all-Democrat delegation in the House of Representatives. \"I never ran on a platform that was about, you know, my race or my identity. But obviously I can't take this skin off,\" she told NPR this summer. \"It's a huge part of who I am. And I think what it represents is that everybody in this community has a place in Congress.\" She won office as part of a blue sweep of Connecticut's House seats \u2014 again. Connecticut has only sent one other African-American to Congress: conservative Republican Gary Franks, who served in the House of Representatives in the 1990s.

In 2010, when Noem was first headed to Capitol Hill as a freshman congresswoman, NPR described her as a \"rising star.\" Hoem \"took over her South Dakota family farm operation after her father died in a farming accident,\" Lee Strubinger of South Dakota Public Broadcasting writes. \"That experience, she says, ultimately got her involved in politics with a focus on reforming government and the tax code.

            "article_content": "Democrats have retaken the House and Republicans consolidated control of the Senate. In Florida, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, who is in the mold of President Trump, is projected to win.  NOEL KING, HOST: Democrats have retaken the House in the midterm elections. That puts an end to two years of one-party rule in Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Republicans consolidated their control of the Senate. Three conservative-leaning states unseated Democratic senators last night - North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri. And Republicans will now have 54 seats there to 46 for the other side. KING: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow have been keeping up with all of this. Good morning to you both. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: Scott, let's start with the House. The Democrats took control. How'd they do it? What were the key pickups? DETROW: There were a couple surprising upsets here and there, picking up a seat in Oklahoma City or on the South Carolina coast. But by and large the battlefield was exactly where Democrats had focused and expected to do well. And that's the suburbs - particularly seats that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 that sent Republicans to the House - high-income, high-education suburbs in the Philadelphia area, the Miami area, the Denver suburbs. You can go city by city. And they're still counting the votes in California. But Democrats are leading narrowly in a couple more key races there, looking like somewhere in the range of 30 seats, plus or minus a few in the end the Democrats picked up here. KING: And, Mara, this means that Nancy Pelosi is likely the next speaker of the House. Last night, she said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration. KING: All right. So what is - what does she mean? Where do you think we're headed with Democrats in control of the House? LIASSON: Well, I think that Democrats will do oversight. In other words, they will do the things the Republican House wouldn't do over the White House. And I think that's probably the biggest story and the most significant shift of power from last night. This is a real-life change. They're going to investigate the Trump administration - and not just Donald Trump, but pretty much every cabinet agency is going to come under scrutiny. Now, the other big question is, do the Democrats and the Republicans have any political muscle memory to do bipartisan legislation? That used to happen in divided governments. The big question is, can Trump and the Democrats find some common ground on infrastructure or on drug prices? Or does legislation pretty much grind to a halt and oversight takes over? INSKEEP: We should note also that the House results are where we can see something of a national popular vote. If you add it up, it appears - although we're still, of course, getting some votes from different places - Democrats won by seven or eight points, quite substantially in the popular vote, which was the only way that they could carry the House given the advantages that Republicans had through the distribution of population and redistricting and gerrymandering and so forth. KING: Yeah. I mean, just a really good indication of, you know, what people were thinking, I suppose. Meanwhile, the Senate - Republicans held onto majority in the Senate. Here's Ted Cruz, who beat back a challenge from Beto O'Rourke in Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: All the money in the world was no match for the good people of Texas and the hard-working men and women across our state. (APPLAUSE) KING: That was a very closely watched race. Scott, what were the key seats that the Republicans flipped in the Senate? DETROW: And a very close race. KING: Yeah. Yeah. DETROW: But in the end, the Republican wins in Texas, as most people expected would happen. Yeah. Republicans had big wins in North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, defeating Democratic incumbents there. They're ahead in a very close race in Florida - Senator Bill Nelson trailing Governor Rick Scott, though the AP has not called that race yet. Republicans also have a narrow lead in Montana, where Democrat Jon Tester was defending his seat. So in the end, Republicans could pick up two to four seats in the Senate. That makes a big difference. And certainly, Republicans had home turf here. Democrats were defending a historic number of seats, particularly in kind of hostile territory in terms of states where President Trump remains very popular. But Republicans are going to add to their lead in the Senate. And that's a big deal because we saw over and over again the last two years how that narrow Senate majority made it hard for Republicans to, among other things, repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now they have more breathing room. Another key point, as Mara talked about oversight in the House of Representatives, if the Democrats in the House did try to and did impeach President Trump after Mueller's report comes out, the idea that a 53- or 55-seat Republican Senate would convict the president on impeachment... INSKEEP: Yeah. DETROW: ...Is very, very small. INSKEEP: Can I mention one development, though? Because Ted Cruz is able to celebrate a big and hard-fought win there. But when you look at the number of people who voted in Texas, it is remarkable. I went back to the last midterm. There was a Senate race in Texas. John Cornyn won. And there was something like 4.3 million Texans who voted. This time, apparently, something like 8.2... KING: Wow. INSKEEP: ...Million - almost 4 million more - something very close to the 2016 presidential race - in a midterm. And it's going to be worth asking, did Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat, find new voters there? And also, by the way, Ted Cruz? LIASSON: There's no doubt that the consolation prize for Democrats in Texas was that they made progress in their long-term project, which is turning Texas purple. And Beto O'Rourke helped Democrats build a party in Texas. And it's a battle of inches. But Democrats that I talked to feel that next time is going to be an even closer - and pretty soon, in the next couple of cycles, they'll start electing Democrats in Texas. KING: You know, Mara, it was notable that Democrats ran younger candidates, women, minorities, LGBTQ people. And many of them did win last night. What does that say about the Democratic Party going forward? LIASSON: It says that the Democratic Party is a lot more diverse than the Republican Party. And when you look at the picture of the Republican conference in the House and the Democratic caucus in the House after January, one is going to look older, whiter, more male, more rural. The other one is going to look younger, more female and browner. And that's where the Democratic Party is headed. Now, that being said, I think one of the big stories of last night that's important is that the Democratic Party did not lurch to the left. KING: Right. LIASSON: I mean, the - some of the most progressive candidates - Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Gillum - we don't know about Stacey Abrams yet - but they didn't win. So the narrative that the Democrats are moving to the left, and progressive candidates are the way to go for them I don't think was borne out by last night's results. DETROW: That's especially true in the House, where, by and large, the new Democratic majority was built on moderate Democratic candidates who played strongly to their district and on issues like health care, not going after President Trump 100 percent. KING: There were also three dozen governor seats up for grabs last night. And we're going to hear from Florida in just a minute. But Georgia was another race that people were watching very closely. Scott, what did you notice there? DETROW: I would put that in the same camp as Texas, where Democrats were really excited by their candidate, Stacey Abrams. She did turn out a lot more Democrats than Georgia typically sees. But it looks like she is on pace to be narrowly defeated by Republican Brian Kemp there. Democrats are stinging on that loss, about the loss in the Florida governor's race, two candidates they were really excited about. But the fact is Democrats picked up governorships in key states, including Kansas and Wisconsin, where Democrat Tony Evers has defeated Republican Scott Walker, a high-profile Republican, who is running for a third term and had actually won the governor's office three times if you include that recount halfway through his first term. A couple other pickups for Democrats in state houses, as well. That's a big deal. And Democrats also flipped several legislative seat districts. KING: All right. A lot more this morning. Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow, thanks so much. DETROW: Thank you. LIASSON: Thank you. KING: All right. We're heading now to Florida, which was a big battleground state this year. INSKEEP: Republican Ron DeSantis won the governor's race. He narrowly prevailed over Andrew Gillum, who was campaigning to become the state's first black governor. And as we heard, the Senate race between current Governor Rick Scott and incumbent Bill Nelson, Democrat, is still too close to call, according to NPR News, although Scott has a little bit of an edge. KING: All right. NPR's Debbie Elliott is in Pensacola. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: This governor's race got a lot of attention. Ron DeSantis ended up the winner. How is that victory going to be interpreted in Florida? ELLIOTT: I think very much a win for the president. You know, Trump endorsed DeSantis very early, even though his candidacy was considered a long shot to better-funded and more well-known Republican contenders. And DeSantis acknowledged that in his victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: I'd like to thank our president for standing by me when... (CHEERING) DESANTIS: ...For standing by me when it wasn't necessarily the smart thing to do. ELLIOTT: Now, he sounded a lot like Trump when he was out on the campaign trail on a host of issues, notably immigration. He's a former Republican congressman and Navy officer. And he beat Democrat Andrew Gillum, the African-American mayor of Tallahassee who had run this progressive campaign. You know, he had been calling for universal Medicare, for example. And we did see race come into this in a very ugly way. There were some nasty, racist robocalls circulating in Florida, which - DeSantis had been accused of using racially coded language when he warned voters to, quote, \"not monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. And then on Gillum's side, he had to cut ties with a campaign volunteer who was caught on video calling Florida a, quote, \"cracker state\"... INSKEEP: And we should note... ELLIOTT: ...So it wasn't pretty at times. INSKEEP: ...We should note on top of that the president of the United States came to Florida on Friday night and said of Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, he's, quote, \"just not equipped, just not equipped to be your governor,\" whatever that means. KING: Which, I guess, brings up the question... ELLIOTT: Right. Also, again, people interpret as, is that racially coded language trying to get white voters to come vote against him? KING: Which brings up this question, Debbie - do you think that the results in Florida tell us anything more broadly about the state of politics in the U.S.? ELLIOTT: Well, I think Florida can be seen as sort of a laboratory for all of these issues that divide America, race being one. Also, gun control, for example... KING: Yeah. ELLIOTT: ...You know, the Parkland school shooting survivors have kept that issue at the forefront here. Immigration. You know, when I was at the polls talking to voters yesterday, that came up more than anything. On one side, Republican - typically Republican voters - telling me they're concerned about border security. And people who are voting Democrat telling me that they were worried about how this country treats immigrants and refugees. So people are divided on that. KING: And we'll note on our way out that, yesterday, voters in Florida approved an amendment to restore voting rights to some convicted felons. NPR's Debbie Elliott from Pensacola, Fla. Debbie, thanks for the great reporting. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF LAKEY INSPIRED'S \"CHILL DAY\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ilhan Omar pauses while speaking during the Democratic Farmer Labor Party endorsement convention in Minneapolis on June 17.\n                \n                    \n                    Emilie Richardson/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar pauses while speaking during the Democratic Farmer Labor Party endorsement convention in Minneapolis on June 17. On a recent Saturday afternoon in an office in St. Paul, Minn., a flurry of calls went out to Native American and Latinos voters reminding them to vote Nov. 6. And there was a new group added to the list: Muslims. Until last year, ISAIAH, a multi-racial coalition of faith communities in Minnesota, was mostly made up of churches. Now, 24 mosques have joined the voter turnout effort. The group is focused on getting communities of color to vote this year in reaction to what it describes as politics of fear and a rise of white nationalism. With Muslims and immigrants used as boogeymen in political rhetoric, Imam Asad Zaman, executive director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, said, getting his community to the ballot box is vital. Zaman is leading the local Muslim effort to get out the vote and has been a leader on political engagement in the community for more than 15 years. And there are more Muslims now running for office, hoping to be part of a \"blue wave.\" In Minnesota, nine Muslims are on the ballot for state, federal and local offices. \"Many candidates running for office are using Islamophobia as a means to get to political power. That is absolutely un-American,\" Zaman said. \"The community is under assault. Fortunately, most of us are beginning to wake up.\" The community is under assault. Fortunately, most of us are beginning to wake up. Imam Asad Zaman He points out that in Minnesota there are 50,000 registered Muslim voters. Though Muslims make up a small voting bloc \u2014 they're about one percent of the nation's population \u2014 those votes can matter in close elections. Many feel a renewed sense of urgency to choose leaders that will represent them. \"You have President Trump, even as a candidate and obviously after taking office,\" said Wa'el Alzayat the head of Emgage Foundation, \"espousing anti-Muslim views and stoking Islamophobic sentiment and signing into law what we consider to be a Muslim ban that unfairly targets people of our faith.\" Alzayat's organization works to increase Muslim political participation. About two-thirds of Muslim voters identify as Democrats according to the Pew Research Center and about 13 percent as Republican. Rashida Tlaib is photographed outside the Michigan Capitol in 2008. Elected to the 12th District of the state House, Tlaib is the first Muslim woman ever to serve in the Michigan Legislature.\n                \n                    \n                    Al Goldis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rashida Tlaib is photographed outside the Michigan Capitol in 2008. Elected to the 12th District of the state House, Tlaib is the first Muslim woman ever to serve in the Michigan Legislature. This year Muslims could shift even more blue, Alzayat says. And while turnout is typically lower in mid-term elections than presidential ones, he says there are already signs that Muslims are planning to vote in bigger numbers this year. In some key states they could have an outsized impact. \"What's interesting is that they are clustered in key areas including battleground states such as Virginia, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and especially in urban areas,\" Alzayat says. \"So, for example you have about 120,000 registered Muslim voters in the state of Michigan. You have about 120,000 registered in Florida. You have about 100,000 registered in Virginia and those numbers really matter because in close elections ... just a few votes can make a difference let alone tens of thousands, if not 100,000.\" Minnesota elected the first Muslim man to Congress in 2006, Keith Ellison. He is one of two Muslim men in Congress right now. And now the state is likely one of two sending the first Muslim women. The other is Michigan, where Democrat Rashida Tlaib won her primary and is expected to head to Congress. Ilhan Omar is running for Ellison's seat. And Ellison is in a very tight race for attorney general. The Democrat's campaign has been clouded by domestic abuse allegations that Ellison denies and that his party investigated and said were unfounded. He's also running statewide for the first time and the state is less diverse then the district he currently represents. Omar won her primary in a district that's gone to Democrats for more than 50 years. She's petite but when she walks into a room, she owns it. On a recent afternoon she's giving a rallying speech to volunteers. When she's introduced, she's met with raucous applause. Ilhan Omar (lower right) sits with a crowd of volunteers and Democratic Farmer Labor party members.\n                \n                    \n                    Leila Fadel/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ilhan Omar (lower right) sits with a crowd of volunteers and Democratic Farmer Labor party members. \"As an immigrant I truly believed when I was coming to this country that people had the tools necessary to life to live a life that is prosperous, that is just and free,\" she said. The audience murmured in agreement. \"So every single day I am shocked with the hypocrisy of this country. That we are the wealthiest nation in the world. But we cannot figure out how to house our homeless people. We can't figure out how to feed our kids in the school system.\" She'll be a lot of firsts if she makes it to Congress. The first refugee, the first Somali, the first Muslim woman. But that's not how she captured the enthusiasm of her mostly white district. She did it, she said, by talking directly to voters who share her values. The democratic socialist beat her closest opponent by over 20,000 votes. \"For me as an immigrant who didn't speak the language, when I would have struggles as a kid my dad would say 'once you are able to communicate with people, they're able to connect with you beyond your otherness,'\" she said. \"That is really the message I've carried throughout my life.\" And it was the crux of her campaign, talking directly to voters who are like her and different than her. She says, she spends most of her time talking to people and doesn't depend on ads and fliers in the mail. The strategy worked, because Muslims or Somalis alone didn't win her the primary or her current seat in the state house. \"Seventy percent of the people I currently represent and the people that I will have the opportunity to represent in Congress are white,\" she said. \"And you know nearly 90 percent of them are non-Muslims. And so it is important for me to get an opportunity to sit with folks, for them to have a discussion with me about their struggles and what's at stake.\" She calls her politics, the politics of moral \"clarity and courage.\" Her platform includes canceling student debt, banning private prisons, registering new voters automatically when they're 18, passing the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act. And Somalis are particularly excited about her possible election to Congress. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country. At Karmel Mall, known as the Somali mall, cafes serve cardamom and cinnamon spiced coffee with condensed milk, women's clothing stores hawk colorful loose fitting dresses and men get groomed at barber shops. One person after the next says they plan to vote and to vote for Ilhan Omar if they're in her district. \"I can't wait, to be honest,\" Kaltun Ali says. \"For me it's personal to be honest. I am Somali and I am Muslim.\" The respiratory therapist is shopping for curtains with her daughter Nayla. This year, since the election of President Trump, she says, she's been afraid. \"America became unsafe for us and very sad and racist and a lot of bigotry so I want to vote,\" she says. \"I want to send my message that we have a voice.\" Her words underscored by last month's shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that killed 11 Jewish people and the shooting of two African-Americans at a grocery store in Kentucky. Last year, a Minnesota mosque was bombed. \"We are all American at the end of the day,\" Ali says. \"If we're Somali versus white or any people versus another it's not safe for anybody.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump's rhetoric on immigration continues to escalate in the last days before the midterms. Some of the remarks coming from the White House about asylum are debatable.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: With days to go before the midterm elections, President Trump is ratcheting up his rhetoric on immigration. He continues to focus on the caravan of Central American migrants heading north through Mexico. Here's what he said at the White House yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The current influx, if not halted, threatens to overwhelm our immigration system and our communities and poses unacceptable dangers to the entire nation. CHANG: But immigration experts say the president's remarks about migrants and asylum-seekers were riddled with false and misleading statements, statements meant to stoke fear of immigrants and drive the president's supporters to the polls. Joining me now to fact-check some of Trump's claims is NPR's Joel Rose. Hey, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So first, the president says there's a crisis at the border. That's his word. Is crisis a word you would use to describe what's going on? ROSE: Well, I guess crisis is in the eye of the beholder. The number of people apprehended at the border is down from the Obama years, and it is way down from the record highs of the 1990s and the 2000s. But the administration would argue that it is a crisis today because it's a different mix of people who are showing up at the border. A generation ago, it was mostly migrant laborers coming across, mostly alone. Now you see many more families, many more children. And those groups have many more protections under the law and get to stay in the U.S. while they fight in immigration court to win their asylum cases. CHANG: Well, the president says he wants to deny asylum to migrants who don't present themselves at official ports of entry. Can he actually do that? ROSE: Well, if he does try to issue an executive order like that, it will certainly be challenged in court. The law of the land, the Immigration and Nationality Act, says that any migrant who is physically present in the U.S. can claim asylum, quote, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" unquote. But the president could argue that he has a right to shut the border for national security. He made a similar argument in support of his travel ban executive order. You probably remember. And he did eventually win before the Supreme Court. CHANG: Trump also says he wants to hold asylum-seekers indefinitely in tent cities. Can his administration do that? ROSE: There are strict rules about the treatment of migrants in detention, especially children. And immigrant rights activists say that massive tent cities would certainly violate those rules. But the Trump administration seems undeterred. In fact, it is already fighting in court to roll back those protections. So it does not seem to be backing down from a fight on that. CHANG: Listening to his recent remarks - I mean, the president has always taken a tough stance on immigration. That's nothing new. He's used harsh rhetoric before. So do you see this as more of the same, or do you sense actually a shift in tone? ROSE: I do feel like there is a new level of intensity that we're seeing this week. I mean, just look back at the week. On Monday, he sent thousands of troops to the southwest border. On Tuesday, we got a report that the White House wants to do away with birthright citizenship. On Wednesday, the president tweeted an inflammatory ad that compares migrants in the caravan to a convicted cop killer who entered the U.S. illegally years ago. And yesterday in his speech, he said repeatedly that these are, quote, \"tough people,\" unquote, and really that we should be afraid of them. CHANG: I mean, obviously the president is ramping up this intensity to try to rally his base. But do you think that these tactics could backfire with some voters? ROSE: Well, certainly critics say that this is all just fearmongering and political theater, you know, days before an election. I talked with Karen Musalo at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies in San Francisco. She says this migrant caravan is largely composed of women and children who are making a dangerous journey together just for self-protection. KAREN MUSALO: There's a deep irony, a sort of tragic irony to characterizing the fact that they're coming together, that they're this marauding army rather than these are very vulnerable individuals desperately fleeing violence who have come together as a group to really have the protection and the solidarity of each other. ROSE: And who really, it should be pointed out, are still, you know, hundreds of miles away from the southwest border and won't even get there for weeks. CHANG: That's NPR's Joel Rose. Thanks, Joel.

President Trump has threatened to close the border to asylum-seekers.\n                \n                    \n                    Gregory Bull/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People line up to cross into the United States to begin the process of applying for asylum near the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Tijuana, Mexico. President Trump has threatened to close the border to asylum-seekers. With days to go before the midterm elections, President Trump continues to ratchet up his rhetoric on immigration. The president's latest target is asylum-seekers, whom he accuses of exploiting \"loopholes\" in U.S. immigration laws. In a televised speech from the White House on Thursday, Trump threatened to close the Southwest border to asylum-seekers \u2014 including the latest group of Central American migrants making their way through Mexico \u2014 unless they present themselves at official ports of entry. But refugee and asylum experts say his plan would violate U.S. law. They say the president's remarks about asylum were riddled with inaccuracies and misleading statements intended to stoke fear of immigrants and drive the president's supporters to the polls. We'll focus here on five statements President Trump made Thursday in the Roosevelt Room. 1. An overwhelming influx \"The current influx, if not halted, threatens to overwhelm our immigration system and our communities, and poses unacceptable dangers to the entire nation.\" The total number of migrants apprehended at the Southwest border was actually down slightly last year, to about 521,000, and remains far below the kind of apprehension numbers that were routine in the 1990s and 2000s. But the Trump administration argues that the current \"crisis\" is the result of a major shift in who is showing up at the border. A generation ago, migrants apprehended at the border were largely single adults, mostly from Mexico, who could be deported relatively quickly after they were caught. Today migrants are much more likely to be coming from Central America. Last year, a record number of apprehended migrants were part of family units. That means they have greater protections under U.S. law. In practice, many of these asylum-seekers are released into the U.S. to await their day in court, which can take months or years. 2. No more \"catch and release\" \"These policies lead to the release of illegal aliens into our communities after they've been apprehended. But we're not releasing anymore. Big change, as of a couple of days ago. We're going to no longer release. We're going to catch; we're not going to release. They're going to stay with us until the deportation hearing or the asylum hearing takes place. So we're not releasing them into the community.\" In fact, under U.S. law, migrant families who have requested asylum are not considered illegal immigrants. And they are being released in large numbers up and down the border. In El Paso, Texas, Ruben Garcia, director of a local shelter called Annunciation House, told reporter Mallory Falk of member station KRWG the shelter had received 332 people Thursday released from immigration custody and are expecting 225 more Friday. In Arizona, Matthew Casey of member station KJZZ spoke with an official at Capellania Cristiana Llamados Para Servir, an organization working with churches in metropolitan Phoenix. The official confirmed the organization expects 90 families at two different churches on Friday and 400 more migrants from Yuma to start arriving in Phoenix late this weekend. These migrant families are generally released to join relatives in other parts of the country and will be issued a Notice to Appear in immigration court for their asylum hearing. 3. They never show up \"Then they never show up, almost. It's like a level of 3 percent. They never show up for the trial. So by the time their trial comes, they're gone. Nobody knows where they are.\" Actually, the majority of asylum-seekers do show up to court. According to the Department of Justice statistics for the 2016 fiscal year, only about 2 in 5 cases were decided in absentia. Immigrant-rights advocates say the number of asylum-seekers who do show up would be even higher if they had attorneys and more support from court staff to let them know when and where to show up. They point to a pilot program that was highly successful at getting immigrants to show up in court before it was canceled by the Trump administration. 4. Abusing asylum \"This endemic abuse of the asylum system makes a mockery of our immigration system, displacing legitimate asylum-seekers \u2014 and there are legitimate asylum-seekers \u2014 while rewarding those who abuse or defraud our system, which is almost everybody. Everybody is abusing it.\" Immigration lawyers say this is a wild exaggeration. It's true that only a fraction of all asylum claims are actually successful. Last year, immigration courts rejected more than 60 percent of asylum claims, a number that has been steadily rising since 2012. The administration argues that rejection rate is itself evidence of fraud. But immigrants-rights advocates dispute that. They say immigration courts are supposed to decide each asylum case on its own merits and that the low acceptance rate is simply evidence that the system is working \u2014 and that asylum cases are not easy to win. 5. It's an invasion \"Some people call it an invasion. It's like an invasion. ... These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men.\" The president has claimed repeatedly, without evidence, that the migrants include dangerous criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" But reporters on the ground say the migrants comprise mainly women and children who are fleeing from violence and extreme poverty in Central America. Refugee and asylum experts accuse the president of fearmongering to rally his political base for the midterm elections. There's a \"tragic irony\" in portraying the asylum-seekers as a marauding army, said Karen Musalo, director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law. \"Individuals have come together to walk north in a caravan because the journey north for asylum-seekers has been so dangerous,\" Musalo said in an interview. \"These are very vulnerable individuals, desperately fleeing violence, who have come together as a group to have the protection and solidarity of each other.\"",

Many people see a connection between President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and hate crimes. Hours after the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, President Trump denounced the attack. \"The scourge of anti-Semitism cannot be ignored, cannot be tolerated,\" Trump said on Saturday at a campaign rally in Illinois. But some are still troubled by what the president has not said about the synagogue killings. Authorities say the alleged shooter was motivated by hatred of Jews. On social media, the shooter also raged against immigrants. \"This wasn't just an anti-Semitic act. But it was also an act against refugees and against immigrants,\" said Mark Hetfield, the CEO of HIAS. The Jewish organization was founded in the 1880s as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and now helps resettle refugees from all over the world in the U.S. The Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was one of many across the country that had participated in a \"National Refugee Shabbat\" this month that was organized by HIAS. Hateful words always lead to hateful acts. And that's exactly what happened here. Mark Hetfield, HIAS Just before the attack there, the alleged shooter, Robert Bowers, posted on social media accusing HIAS of bringing violent \"invaders\" into the country. \"The reason he had targeted the Jewish community on this particular day is because he saw Jews as helping refugees come into the country,\" Hetfield said. \"And President Trump didn't mention that.\" To Hetfield and other critics of the president, there's a connection between the Pittsburgh shooting and the administration's rhetoric about immigrants. \"Hateful words always lead to hateful acts. And that's exactly what happened here,\" Hetfield said. \"Words matter. And they especially matter when they come from the president of the United States.\" In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh shooting, advocates for migrants and refugees are calling on Trump to tone down his anti-immigrant rhetoric. But with just over a week to go before the midterm elections, there's no reason to think that the president will heed those calls. By the end of his speech at the Illinois rally, Trump was back to familiar talking points about \"criminal immigrants,\" vowing to stop the migrants slowly making their way across Mexico to the Southwest border. \"They have to come in legally. Like all of the millions of people that are waiting on line right now. They've can't break into our borders. They're not going to,\" Trump said. Monday, the Department of Defense announced that the president is sending thousands of troops to the Southwest border. And the White House is mulling over an executive order that would close the border to migrants. The president's supporters dismiss any connection between his rhetoric on immigration and the motivations of the Pittsburgh attacker. \"Trying to understand this kind of behavior is impossible,\" said Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors lower levels of immigration. \"It seems very cynical for people to try to take the activity of a deranged person, and turn around and try to alter and shape our national political debate on frankly one of the most important issues of our time,\" said Stein. But immigrant-rights advocates say that debate has been swamped by disinformation and fearmongering. The alleged synagogue shooter, for example, shared conspiracy theories on social media about Jews supporting the migrant caravan. \"There seems to be real fear out there of the 'other,' \" said Hetfield. \"And rather than addressing this fear and confronting it, these leaders that we have are stoking those fears.\" Trump himself warned, without evidence, that there are \"unknown Middle Easterners\" mixed in with the caravan. Reporters for NPR and other media on the ground say the only migrants they have seen are those fleeing from violence in Central America, many of whom do want to come to the U.S. legally \u2014 by seeking asylum.",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she will step down from leading the Christian Democratic Union and won't seek re-election, rattling the political scene in Germany and setting the stage for her to eventually be replaced in her country's highest office. \"The time has come to open a new chapter,\" Merkel said. Merkel, 64, announced the move on Monday, speaking in Berlin after meetings about her party's struggles in Germany's recent election. \"The news comes after Merkel's party lost significant ground in Sunday's regional election in the state of Hesse,\" Esme Nicholson reports from Berlin for NPR' Newscast unit. \"Her federal coalition partner, the Social Democrats, also fared poorly. Commentators say the results reflect widespread dissatisfaction with the current federal administration.\" Her current term as chancellor runs into 2021 \u2014 and Merkel said she is \"prepared\" to stay in the chancellor post through her current term. We\u2019re LIVE as Angela Merkel is set to speak to the media in light of reports that this will be her last term as German chancellor.https://t.co/aqzAkaIrA9 Political analysts in Germany are wondering if Merkel might not serve out a full term if she's not leading her own party \u2014 a pairing that Merkel herself has previously said is crucial to being an effective chancellor. Merkel also said she won't seek to return as her party's leader when the CDU meets in December, setting off speculation over who in her party might try to replace her. Merkel, her party and its allies in a governing coalition have been under attack by far-right politicians, who have been able to translate tensions over Germany receiving refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries into election wins and a growing base of support. Merkel said the election results in Hesse were bitterly disappointing. In the past, such losses sometimes have been treated as a regional blip. But in this case, Merkel said, her political allies in Hesse had suffered because of negative fallout from Germany's national political scene. The surprise announcement that Merkel would leave her party's leadership but remain in the chancellorship did not satisfy her critics. According to Deutsche Welle, as news of Merkel's move spread, Christian Lindner, who leads the center-right Free Democrats (FDP), said, \"She's quitting the wrong office.\" When Merkel took office in 2005, her U.S. counterpart was President George W. Bush. Much has changed since then, and as the gap between the U.S. and its European allies has widened during the Trump administration, Merkel's international profile has grown. Her name has been mentioned as a possible future leader of the European Union \u2014 but Merkel repeatedly dismissed that idea on Monday, saying she has no intention of running for any other political office.",

Hundreds of migrants have arrived at the Guatemalan border town of Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n, along the southern border of Mexico, James Fredrick reports for NPR. Organizers of the caravan say they are waiting for thousands more to join them in the coming days, before attempting to cross the Mexican border. Hundreds of migrants from the #CaravanaMigrante are already in Tecun Uman, the Guatemalan town bordering Mexico. They\u2019re waiting for the thousands more to arrive and plan to walk to the Mexican border peacefully. Surprisingly good spirits here. Listen to @npratc today for more pic.twitter.com/fTnvYgJE2t Mexico has ramped up security along its southern border and says that only migrants with valid paperwork will be allowed to enter Mexico \u2014 namely, a passport, which most of those in the caravan do not have. \"You can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here for the imminent arrival of this caravan,\" Frederick told NPR, while standing on a bridge that links Mexico and Guatemala. Most of those who had gathered were from Honduras, he said, but there were also people from El Salvador and Guatemala. Judy, a 34-year-old woman in the group who requested that her last name not be used, said that her home country of Honduras has become very dangerous: no safety, jobs, and the hospitals lack medicine. Basic freedoms are being oppressed by the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, she said, and Honduras simply feels unlivable for her right now. Mexico's interior ministry said it would ask the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for support, as it prepares to receive possibly thousands of refugee requests in the coming days. The Mexican government says that the migrants may apply for asylum in Mexico, but that they'll have to do so from a detention center. Mexico warned that if migrants are caught crossing illegally, they will be detained and deported. With the midterm elections in the U.S. just weeks away, President Donald Trump kept immigration front and center, by threatening to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico to prevent the migrants from entering. \"I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\" he tweeted Thursday. ....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!.. In the spring, Trump tweeted angrily when an earlier caravan of Central Americans made their way through Mexico with the intention of crossing into the U.S. He threatened to cut foreign aid to Honduras and send the military to the border. In the end, some of the migrants went home and a few hundred crossed the San Ysidro port of entry, south of San Diego, and requested asylum. It's uncertain how the president would block the current group of immigrants from crossing at a legal port of entry. Longstanding federal and international laws allow immigrants to present themselves at a border crossing and seek protection as refugees. They are referred for a \"credible fear\" of persecution or torture screening to an asylum officer, who decides if they should be deported or continue the asylum process. People in a migrant caravan make their way towards the border with Mexico on Thursday in Siquinal\u00e1, Guatemala.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People in a migrant caravan make their way towards the border with Mexico on Thursday in Siquinal\u00e1, Guatemala. Recent presidents, including Trump, have deployed National Guard troops to the southwestern boundary to assist Border Patrol in catching and processing unauthorized immigrants. But they have not blocked the ports of entry, which are under the control of agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. President Woodrow Wilson sent active-duty troops to the border during the Mexican Revolution, roughly 100 years ago, to stop raiders such as Pancho Villa from crossing into border states. Today, the migrants Trump wants to keep out appear to be mainly young Hondurans, including parents with small children, who are seeking asylum in the United States. Trump tweeted there are \"MANY CRIMINALS\" in the caravan, without providing evidence. Trump has long maintained that \"catch-and-release loopholes\" in U.S. immigration laws lure immigrants here from Central America. The Department of Homeland Security is compiling year-end figures for apprehensions at the southern border. DHS Spokeswoman Katie Waldman wrote in an email to NPR that the department's totals will likely show \"record numbers of families arriving illegally in the United States this year.\" While thousands of immigrant families are being arrested at the border every week in places like Texas' Rio Grande Valley and Nogales, Arizona, the numbers are still far below the peak in 2000, when 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants were arrested. The difference is that the big numbers 18 years ago were mainly single Mexican males who were quickly deported, whereas the current surge is primarily made up of families seeking amnesty, which allows them to remain in the U.S. for months or years while their case grinds through the backlogged immigration courts. Waldman added that the agency \"is examining all options to secure the border.\"",

            "article_content": "Bavarian voters dealt German Chancellor Angela Merkel a tough blow Sunday. Her conservative allies there are projected to receive their second-worst result in regional elections since 1946.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her supporters took a political hit in elections yesterday in Bavaria. It was called a protest vote by a lot of German political observers. And it was to the benefit of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which will enter the Bavarian parliament for the first time. The real winner, though, in these elections came as a surprise. Here's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: The big winner in Bavaria on Sunday was the left-leaning environmentally friendly Green party, which came in second place. Political observers say the unexpected result showed that the decision by Merkel's conservatives to move further right this past year backfired. Some analysts also predict that Merkel's sister party, the Christian Social Union or CSU, might now try and partner with the environmentalists to govern Bavaria. The CSU, despite its poor showing, was the highest vote getter but lost majority control. Ingolstadt legislator-elect Stephanie Kuerten told NPR she has doubts about whether her Green party would end up in a Bavarian coalition with the Christian conservatives. STEPHANIE KUERTEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: \"If the CSU can manage it, they'll avoid talking to us at all. And in any event, we won't be part of a coalition just for the sake of governing.\" She quipped, \"I think the opposition bench is pretty comfortable too.\" Merkel's other coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats, also suffered a devastating loss in Bavaria, scoring just under 10 percent of the vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREA NAHLES: (Speaking German). NELSON: Andrea Nahles called the result bitter and blamed the poor performance in Bavaria on squabbling within the Merkel-led government in Berlin. There's talk her Social Democratic Party might pull out of the government, which would likely mean Merkel would have to quit. That prospect is welcomed by Alternative for Germany. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALICE WEIDEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: The far-right group\u2019s parliamentary co-chair, Alice Weidel, said the Bavarian vote showed that Merkel must go. As to what the chancellor's Bavarian sister party plans to do is unclear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HORST SEEHOFER: (Speaking German). NELSON: German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CSU, says his party would, quote, \"draw the necessary consequences from the poor results.\" Disputes between him and Merkel over how to control Germany's border following the refugee crisis almost led to the collapse of their fragile coalition earlier this year.

If results hold, the Sweden Democrats, a nationalist party with neo-Nazi roots, will remain the third-largest party in parliament, handing the governing Social Democrats a stinging setback. With 84.4 percent of votes counted, the Sweden Democrats had 17.6 percent of the vote compared with 28.4 for the Social Democrats, according to the Sweden public broadcaster SVT. After an initial exit poll from SVT showed the Sweden Democrats with the second-largest amount of votes, the center-right Moderate party surpassed the nationalist group, with 19.8 percent of voter support. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, reporter Maddy Savage says that among the eight parties gunning for seats in parliament, there's historically \"a sense of left or a sense of right bloc that's able to form a coalition.\" But as Savage notes, that's not the case this year, in an unpredictable election where much of the vote has hinged on voter attitudes on the issue of immigration. Sweden, recognized for its open-door immigration policy, has long been a destination for refugees. After the country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 migrants in 2015, some Swedes have been rethinking its immigration policies. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reported, Sweden passed a law in 2016 enforcing all municipalities to accommodate its share of migrants. To curb the flow of migrants entering the country, Sweden implemented identification checks at the Sweden-Denmark border. Sweden also enacted a temporary law to limit the amount of time refugees are allowed to stay in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats, led by Jimmie Akesson, links the country's rising crime rate to immigration, but official figures can't prove any correlation. As freelance journalist Sidsel Overgaard reported for NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday: \"Sweden does not track the ethnicity of perpetrators, so making a connection between immigration and crime is a largely speculative exercise.\" Akesson told supporters on Sunday that the projected 63 seats his party would clinch in the 349-seat parliament is a victory. \"No one can take that away from us,\" he said, according to The Guardian. The newspaper adds: \"He said he was interested in cooperating with the other parties, and wanted to tell the Moderates in particular 'how to govern the country ... We strengthen our kingmaker role. We will will have an immense influence over what happens in Sweden in the coming weeks, months, years.' \" For their part, both major blocs are strongly against normalizing relations with the far-right party. Instead, Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson told supporters on Sunday night that a four-party opposition alliance \"is clearly the largest,\" reports The Washington Post, and that Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, leader of the ruling Social Democrats, should resign after a disappointing showing. In response, Lofven said he plans to remain in his position, the Post reports. The prime minister said \"the results are still unclear,\" but that mainstream parties now have a \"moral responsibility\" to form the next government. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, don't have anything to offer except \"hatred,\" Lofven said.",

            "article_content": "Voters in Malmo, upset at the recent arrival of large numbers of migrants and asylum-seekers, are turning to a populist anti-immigrant party ahead of Sunday's general election.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Sweden holds national elections on Sunday. And for some voters, their decision may hinge on what they think of the city where they live. Malmo is a diverse and lively city in Sweden, with nearly 1 out of every 3 residents born in another country. The city also struggles with gang-related violence. Sidsel Overgaard discovered that different people in the same city see it very differently. SIDSEL OVERGAARD, BYLINE: It's a cloudy morning in Malmo, and Eva Winberg and her friend have decided to pay 25 krona for a bus tour. EVA WINBERG: I like to see the Malmo and hear the history and see the sights. OVERGAARD: These women aren't tourists. They live here. But as the bus gets rolling, it's easy to see why they might need this update. UNIDENTIFIED TOUR GUIDE: (Speaking Swedish). OVERGAARD: Malmo, a city of 330,000, is adding 5,000 residents a year. Cranes puncture the skyline, and we pass one new building after another. A beautiful school... WINBERG: Really nice. OVERGAARD: ...A rainbow colored shopping center... WINBERG: Oh, the police station is going to be built here. OVERGAARD: We also stop alongside some of Malmo's more notorious neighborhoods. WINBERG: I've never been to this place before. This is one of the places that you avoid to go to. OVERGAARD: But even here, the story line is positive as the guide points to physical improvements aimed at helping integration and reducing crime. Winberg is impressed. WINBERG: It's a social thinking about this. And they have lots of things like that here. OVERGAARD: This is a good news tour for a reason. The guide is deputy mayor Andreas Schonstrom, a member of the country's incumbent Social Democrats. He is well aware that recent news about Malmo has focused on high-profile shootings and even grenade explosions. But, he says, for most residents, that is not real life. ANDREAS SCHONSTROM: When we look at the numbers today, Malmo is growing rapidly. We have huge economic growth. The unemployment rate is going down. OVERGAARD: But it's a narrative that's proving hard to sell against another, more succinct message. TOMMY JOHANSSON: We have too many foreigner in this town from the Arabian countries. OVERGAARD: Tommy Johansson is in the center of Malmo, where a large crowd has gathered for a speech by the leader of the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats. JOHANSSON: We cannot go outside when it's dark anymore. We have to take taxis, everything. It's not safe. OVERGAARD: The Sweden Democrats draw a direct line between immigration and crime. While the rate of certain violent crimes is up in Malmo, the overall reported crime rate has gone down. But Sweden Democrat voter Jonas Norden believes that's because people have given up on calling an overwhelmed police force. JONAS NORDEN: It's so much crime, so they can't handle it all. OVERGAARD: Twenty minutes to the south, Ibrahim Taha, who grew up in Malmo's Rosengard neighborhood, says it's not as bad as the media suggests. IBRAHIM TAHA: Yeah. I've been living there for 17 years. I can tell you like this, all right, I had my issues with some people. But other than that, it's really safe. OVERGAARD: But, he says, problems with integration are real. He moved here from Iraq at age 9 and didn't have an ethnically Swedish friend until age 16. TAHA: They have not met each other. The Swedes have not met the immigrants. The immigrant have not. So it's a two-way racism, and it's creating really big problems. OVERGAARD: Taha believes one way to change that is by engaging in the democratic process, which is why he's here in the Holma neighborhood, trying to increase voter turnout among immigrants. Most of the young adults he approaches say they will, or already have, voted. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: One-hundred percent. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: One-hundred percent. OVERGAARD: Syrian refugee Moada Mardeni admits she doesn't really like politics but says voting is her duty as a new Swede. MOADA MARDENI: Because I have to do something good for this country. They let us to stay here, to have homes, to study. So I have to do something good for this country, too. OVERGAARD: And for her new hometown. For NPR News, I'm Sidsel Overgaard in Malmo, Sweden.

On Sunday, Swedes will vote in national elections for the first time since a wave of immigration changed the country's tone of debate. Sweden began opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers after the last election, in 2014. Since then, well over 300,000 people have applied for asylum, mostly from Syria, as well as from countries including Iraq and Iran. Nationalists point to a rising crime rate and incidents of gang violence as evidence of the need for closed borders. Those on the left point to Sweden's strong economic growth, low unemployment rate and overall relative well-being as a sign that more countries could be following the lead of this self-described humanitarian superpower. What's certain is that Swedes' attitudes vary widely about the country they live in \u2014 and this will be reflected in the way they vote. A single day in Malm\u00f6, Sweden's third-largest city, seen from three different vantage points, reveals a country \u2014 and a people \u2014 at a crossroads. An upbeat tour On a cool, cloudy morning, Eva Winberg and her friend Birgitta Lyberg\u00e5rd have decided to pay 25 krona ($2.74) for a bus tour of the city. Winberg's youngest son is getting married to an Iranian woman he met at university, but not till the next day, so she figures she can squeeze in a tour of the city with her friend. The two women climb aboard with about 50 retirement-age Swedes. But none of these people are tourists. They live here. As the bus gets rolling, it's easy to see why they might need an update. Malm\u00f6, a city of about 330,000, has been growing at a rate of 5,000 people per year. Roughly a third of the city's residents were born outside of Sweden. Cranes puncture the skyline, and the bus cruises past one new building after another: a sparkly new school, a rainbow-hued shopping center, the site of a future police station \u2014 all part of a concerted effort on the part of local leaders to transform Malm\u00f6 from an industrial hub to a financially diversified and sustainable city of the future. The bus also stops in some of Malm\u00f6's more notorious neighborhoods, where national police have been called in to work alongside local officers in the face of increasing gang violence. \"I've never been to this place before,\" Winberg says, lowering her voice. \"This is one of the places you avoid to go.\" The tour guide, though, paints a different, positive story \u2014 he points to physical improvements aimed at helping integration and reducing crime. Winberg seems particularly impressed by a housing development where a resident-owned caf\u00e9 attached to a brightly lit laundromat encourages social interaction. \"It's a social thinking,\" she says. \"They have done lots of things like that here!\" This is a good-news tour for a reason: The guide is Malm\u00f6's deputy mayor Andreas Sch\u00f6nstr\u00f6m, and this is one of about 20 bus tours his party \u2014 the incumbent Swedish Social Democratic Party \u2014 is hosting in the run-up to the election. The Social Democrats are the historical powerhouse behind the country's generous, and popular, welfare state. But they have been losing strength for decades. Most recently, the party has been accused of naivety in its handling of the refugee crisis, and for failing to alleviate the gang violence that has made shootings and even grenade explosions a regular part of the local news. But Sch\u00f6nstr\u00f6m says the vast majority of residents aren't touched by the violence. \"When we look the numbers today, Malm\u00f6 is growing rapidly. We have huge economic growth, the unemployment is going down,\" he tells NPR. And Sch\u00f6nstr\u00f6m says his party does talk honestly about the problems afflicting the city \u2014 \"but we will not recognize that the problems are about Muslims.\" \"It's not about what kind of religion you have, and whether you eat pork or not,\" he says. \"It's about social problems: unemployment, schools, education, segregation in our living areas... It's about empowering people.\" A nationalist rally That narrative is proving a hard sell against the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats' message. Supporter Tommy Johansson conveys it succinctly: \"We have too many foreigners in this town. From the Arabian countries.\" Johansson is part of a large crowd that has gathered in the center of the city to hear a speech in the afternoon by Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson \u2014 \"the king,\" according to Johansson. Like most Sweden Democrats, Johansson draws a direct line between immigration and crime. Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie \u00c3\u0085kesson gives a speech in Malm\u00c3\u00b6 on Aug. 31. Polls suggest his anti-immigrant party could make a strong showing in Sunday's election.\n                \n                    \n                    Johan Nilsson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie \u00c3\u0085kesson gives a speech in Malm\u00c3\u00b6 on Aug. 31. Polls suggest his anti-immigrant party could make a strong showing in Sunday's election. \"We cannot go outside when it's dark anymore,\" he says. \"We have to take taxis. It's not safe.\" While the rate of certain violent crimes is up in Malm\u00f6, the overall reported crime rate has gone down. Because Sweden does not keep records on the ethnicity of perpetrators, substantiating a link between immigrants and crime is a largely speculative exercise. But political scientist Mikael Sundstr\u00f6m from Lund University says that hardly matters. \"You don't need solid data to sell the idea, from the Sweden Democrats' point of view, that immigrants are linked to crime,\" he says. \"You just need to make sure that it stays in the public mind that this or that crime was committed by an immigrant.\" And in that, he says, they have succeeded. Polls suggest the Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement, could garner 20 percent of the vote this weekend, potentially becoming Sweden's second biggest party. An immigrant's experience In a plaza in Malm\u00f6's Holma neighborhood, Ibrahim Taha and his colleagues from a voting advocacy group have set up a small table with snacks. This quickly attracts the attention of several 12-year-old boys on scooters and bikes, chattering with each other in a mix of Swedish and Arabic. As the boys grab handfuls of chips, Taha starts quizzing them in Swedish. \"How many years between elections?\" he asks. \"Four!\" they yell. \"Who is the Prime Minister?\" \"STEFAN L\u00d6FVEN!\" The competition is heating up. \"Harder?\" he asks. Two \"democracy ambassadors\" for a get-out-the-vote organization started by Ibrahim Taha chat with boys in Malm\u00f6's Holma neighborhood. \"The Sweden Democrats have a view that you can only be black or white,\" Taha says. \"And reality is not like that. You can be a lot of people at the same time. The Sweden Democrats don't understand that this is a contribution to society.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Sidsel Overgaard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Two \"democracy ambassadors\" for a get-out-the-vote organization started by Ibrahim Taha chat with boys in Malm\u00f6's Holma neighborhood. \"The Sweden Democrats have a view that you can only be black or white,\" Taha says. \"And reality is not like that. You can be a lot of people at the same time. The Sweden Democrats don't understand that this is a contribution to society.\" Harder questions it is. \"What year did women in Sweden get the vote?\" With hardly a pause, one of the boys throws down the answer \u2014 \"1921!\" \u2014 before zooming off on a victory lap. Half of these boys were born here, half of them somewhere else. This neighborhood, though not one of the most dangerous, is considered a risk area. In two hours on the plaza, not a single ethnic Swede passes by. Taha moved to Sweden from Iraq in 2002, at age 9. He didn't have an ethnically Swedish friend until he was 16. Nine years later, integration is still a real problem, he says. A \"two-way racism\" permeates Swedish society, he says, \"and it's creating really big problems.\" And yet, he says, at least to some extent, the boys in this neighborhood are all growing up with two identities: Swedish and Palestinian, Iraqi, Syrian or others. And that dual identity, says Taha, is the Sweden of the future. It's also why, he believes, the Sweden Democrats will ultimately lose momentum. \"They tell you, you need to feel loyalty to only Sweden. And that's a major problem for people like me. And there are a lot of people like me,\" he says. \"The Sweden Democrats have a view that you can only be black or white. And reality is not like that. You can be a lot of people at the same time. The Sweden Democrats don't understand that this is a contribution to society.\"",

A refugee crisis is growing in Central America as tens of thousands of Nicaraguans pour into neighboring Costa Rica seeking safety from the political crisis at home. For more than four months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has responded forcefully to nationwide protests, which initially began in opposition to a hike in social security taxes and quickly erupted into a call for his resignation. More than 300 people have been killed, hundreds more disappeared and thousands have fled the country, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization in Managua. The Organization of American States has condemned what it calls \"serious human rights violations\" perpetrated by Ortega's government and allied \"parapolice forces\" against protesters. Last month, police and armed militias stormed into a small central Nicaraguan town where Jos\u00e9 Murillo and his friend Freddy Mondrag\u00f3n guarded a blockade, a round-the-clock protest against President Ortega. Outmanned and out-armed, Murillo says their simple brick barricade quickly fell. Demonstrators march to demand freedom for political prisoners in Managua on Aug. 11. The ongoing unrest in Nicaragua began in April, when President Daniel Ortega announced cuts to the social security system and small protests by senior citizens were violently broken up.\n                \n                    \n                    Alfredo Zuniga/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators march to demand freedom for political prisoners in Managua on Aug. 11. The ongoing unrest in Nicaragua began in April, when President Daniel Ortega announced cuts to the social security system and small protests by senior citizens were violently broken up. \"The government had us already on their list, a long list of all those in town who supported the anti-government protests,\" says 54-year-old Murillo. He says a fellow protester from their town was arrested and told relatives to warn the others about the list. \"That's when the persecution began,\" adds Mondrag\u00f3n, who is 43. Both men, who worked in farming and construction, say they heard that masked men came looking for them at their homes. \"We fled into the mountains,\" he says. \"We survived up there for 15 days. It was harsh, very harsh, so we decided we had to keep moving and we came here,\" says Murillo. A week ago, along with five others from their town, the group walked for three days, crossed a river by boat, sneaked into Costa Rica and arrived in the small northern town of La Cruz. They aren't alone. As many as 23,000 Nicaraguans have come seeking asylum in Costa Rica since anti-Ortega protests erupted across their country in mid-April, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The pace of refugees fleeing picked up greatly after Ortega launched a repressive crackdown on protesters in mid-July, killing hundreds and jailing thousands. The U.N. refugee agency said, as of July 31, an average of 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum every day in Costa Rica and called on international support to aid the refugees. Murillo and Mondrag\u00f3n are staying in a tent shelter set up by migration authorities a mile and a half outside La Cruz. They want to claim asylum, but that requires getting to the capital San Jos\u00e9, about 170 miles away by bus. The fare will cost about $10 each, which neither of them have. Relatives back in Nicaragua have wired some money, but at La Cruz's Western Union office, the cashier tells Murillo through a glass window that he can't give it to them. Murillo and Mondrag\u00f3n fled without a passport and neither have a Costa Rica-issued ID. Many Nicaraguans coming across the border have a family member already in Costa Rica, which has a history of taking in migrants. The International Organization for Migration estimates as many as half a million Nicaraguans live here. For those without a relative to stay with, the camp, able to shelter up to 2,000 people, is a lifeline. One of two camps the Costa Rican government has set up for Nicaraguan (and other refugees) increasingly coming to the country. This one in La Cruz, Costa Rica, about 10 miles from the Nicaraguan border, has 60 tents and can shelter up to 2,000 refugees. According to U.N. officials, 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum in Costa Rica daily.\n                \n                    \n                    Carrie Kahn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption One of two camps the Costa Rican government has set up for Nicaraguan (and other refugees) increasingly coming to the country.

According to U.N. officials, 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum in Costa Rica daily. Inside the expansive camp, set up in an empty lot, a group of Nicaraguans play dominoes on a picnic table placed in an outdoor kitchen. Across the dirt field are a dozen portable shower stalls, port-a-potties and a large stone basin to hand wash clothes. Uriel Cruz is sitting out the domino game. He's trying to get a fire started in one of the wood-burning stoves to make some coffee. A skinny pipe is helping him fan the flames with some direct air. Cruz, who is 46 and married with two sons, says he worked in his northern Nicaraguan town as a legal adviser to the mayor. After the protests began, he says, the city started taking half his paycheck to fund pro-government protests and pay the paramilitary fighters. After he complained to his employers, he was summoned to late-night meetings at city hall with unidentified armed men. The last time they called him in, he says, he didn't go. \"They were probably going to kill me or throw me in jail for being a terrorist,\" he says. Thousands have been jailed in recent weeks since President Ortega enacted a sweeping new law that critics charge criminalizes all types of protest. Punishment is up to 30 years in jail. For now, some residents of La Cruz say they are happy to help out the refugees. Leonor Perea owns a seafood restaurant down the street from the refugee tent camp. Her specialty is a large bowl of fish soup. \"We should help them, they are our neighbors,\" says Perea, who's owned the restaurant for 42 years. But she says she hopes the authorities are properly vetting them to weed out any bad elements. Nicaraguan refugees fleeing their country due to unrest take part in a demonstration to thank the people of Costa Rica for their support in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Carlos Ulate/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nicaraguan refugees fleeing their country due to unrest take part in a demonstration to thank the people of Costa Rica for their support in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, on Wednesday. But some Costa Ricans' patience may be waning. Last weekend, protests broke out in a downtown San Jos\u00e9 park where many Nicaraguans congregate. A crowd holding Costa Rican flags and shouting \"Nicaraguans go home!\" clashed with residents supportive of the immigrants and refugees. Authorities arrested 44 people and seized machetes, knives, Molotov cocktails and a baseball bat, San Jos\u00e9 police told local media. Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado responded to the violent outburst in the capital urging the country to avoid falling into \"provocations or hatred.\" \"Today we are receiving people in our country, some are wounded or at risk, others are persecuted. Due to their vulnerable situation they seek refuge or a peaceful place in our country,\" he said in a televised message. But he also promised his government will screen the newcomers and deport any who threaten national security or break the law. Back at the tent shelter, Uriel Cruz says he hopes talks will resume between President Ortega and a coalition of civic and church leaders seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and early elections for next year. But he's not optimistic. Neither are others in the camp. Some say they are willing to take up arms in order to return \u2014 a troubling sentiment given Nicaragua's history of bloodshed during the 1979 revolution and subsequent U.S.-backed Contra war that lasted more than a decade. \"We need international help to come in and remove Ortega,\" says Cruz. \"All we want is to go back home.\"",

AILSA CHANG, HOST: A refugee crisis is growing in Central America as tens of thousands of Nicaraguans pour into neighboring Costa Rica. They're seeking safety from a deepening political crisis at home. For more than four months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has responded to nationwide protests with force. More than 300 people have been killed, hundreds more disappeared and thousands sent into exile. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Last month, police and armed militia stormed into the small central Nicaraguan town where Jose Murillo and his friend Freddy Mondragon manned a blockade, a round-the-clock protest against President Daniel Ortega. Outmanned and out-armed, Murillo says their simple brick barricade quickly fell. JOSE MURILLO: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"The government had us already on their list, a long one of all those in town who supported the antigovernment protests,\" he says. Murillo, who's 54, says a fellow protester was arrested and told relatives to warn the others about the list. FREDDY MONDRAGON: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"That's when the persecution began,\" adds Mondragon, who's 43. Both men say they heard that masked men came looking for them at their homes. \"We fled into the mountains,\" they said. MURILLO: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"We survived up there for 15 days. And it was harsh - very harsh. So we decided we had to keep moving. And we came here,\" says Murillo. Along with five others from their town, the group crossed illegally into Costa Rica a week ago and arrived here in the small northern city of La Cruz. And they aren't alone. More than 23,000 refugees have entered Costa Rica since anti-Ortega protests erupted in Nicaragua on April 18. The pace of refugees fleeing picked up greatly after Ortega launched a repressive crackdown on protesters in mid-July, killing hundreds and jailing thousands. U.N. officials here say about 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum every day. Most Nicaraguans coming across the border these days have a family member living in Costa Rica. The International Organization for Migration estimates as many as half a million Nicaraguans call Costa Rica home. For those without a relative here, a camp about a mile and a half outside of town with enough tents to house up to 2,000 people is a lifeline. (SOUNDBITE OF DOMINOES RATTLING) KAHN: A group of Nicaraguans play dominoes on a picnic table set up in an outdoor kitchen area in the back of the camp. Across the dirt field are a dozen portable shower stalls, port-a-potties and a large stone basin to hand-wash clothes. URIEL CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Uriel Cruz is sitting out the domino game. He's trying to get a fire started in one of the wood-burning stoves for coffee. A skinny pipe is helping him fan the flames with some direct air. CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Cruz, who is 46 and married with two sons, says he worked in his northern Nicaraguan town as a legal adviser to the mayor. After the protests began, he says the city started taking half his paycheck to pay pro-government protesters and paramilitary fighters. He complained and was called to late-night meetings at city hall with unidentified armed men. The last time they called him in, he says he didn't go. CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"They were probably going to kill me,\" he says, \"or throw me in jail as a terrorist.\" Thousands have been jailed in recent weeks since President Ortega passed a sweeping new law that critics charge criminalizes all types of protest. Punishment is up to 30 years in jail. Cruz says he hopes talks will resume between President Ortega and a coalition of civic and church leaders seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and early elections for next year. But he's not optimistic. Neither are others in the camp who say they're willing to take up arms in order to return. CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Cruz says he hopes there will be international help coming to remove Ortega because, he says, \"so many of us - all we want to do is go back home and soon.\" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, La Cruz, Costa Rica.

Hallquist became the first openly transgender person to win a major party nomination for governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vermont Democratic gubernatorial nominee Christine Hallquist embraces a supporter. Hallquist became the first openly transgender person to win a major party nomination for governor. Tuesday's elections in four states \u2014 Wisconsin, Minnesota, Connecticut and Vermont \u2014 produced some noteworthy results. Here are four takeaways: 1. It was a big night for Democratic diversity Christine Hallquist, a former energy company executive, became the first openly transgender person to win a major party's nomination for governor. And the Democrat's candidacy may not be one just for the trivia books \u2014 she has a chance at winning this fall. Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott has seen his poll numbers nosedive after signing gun-control legislation into law in April. Vermont may have a reputation as a fairly liberal state, but it also has a sizable pro-gun population as well. Scott was met with protests the day he signed the legislation, with activists calling him a \"traitor.\" For a Republican to win statewide in Vermont, he needs his base firmly behind him, and then to win over independents and peel off some Democrats. But Scott had a lackluster primary performance. A third of Republicans voted for his little-known opponent, Keith Stern, a political novice and produce-store owner who ran on fiscal conservatism and a gun-rights agenda. Hallquist wasn't the only example of diversity among the winners Tuesday night. State Rep. Ilhan Omar is likely to become the first Somali American to go to Congress this fall after winning her primary in a heavily Democratic Minnesota district.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption State Rep. Ilhan Omar is likely to become the first Somali American to go to Congress this fall after winning her primary in a heavily Democratic Minnesota district. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota is well positioned to become the first Somali-American to head to Congress, and Connecticut may send its first African-American woman, Jahana Hayes, to Washington as well. (Hayes was the 2016 National Teacher of the Year.) Omar, a former Somali refugee, made history in 2016 by becoming the first Somali-American to win elective office in the United States, taking a state House seat in Minnesota. Omar's win follows on Rashida Tlaib's victory in Michigan last week. Tlaib is running unopposed and will be the first Palestinian-American member of Congress. Chris Johnson of the Washington Blade pointed out Tuesday night that Hallquist's win marked a milestone for Democrats. This year, they have nominated candidates for governor who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, filling out the letters in the acronym LGBT. All 4 letters in LGBT acronym have won Democratic nomination to run for governor this year:L \u2014 Lupe Valdez, lesbian candidate in TexasG \u2014 Jared Polis, gay candidate in ColoradoB \u2014 Kate Brown, bisexual incumbent in OregonT \u2014 Christine Hallquist, trans candidate in Vermont It also highlights how, demographically, the two parties are worlds apart. Nearly 9 in 10 people in the Republican Party are white, while about 6 in 10 Democrats are, according to a large compilation of interviews conducted by Gallup in 2013. And Trump has doubled down on that difference, catering to white grievance to win in 2016 and to keep his base behind him as president. Democrats seem more in line with businesses and universities, which are increasingly sensitive to embracing diversity, while conservatives react reflexively against \"identity politics.\" That reaction is part of what drove Trump's winning coalition in 2016. The demographics of the country's voters are certain to become more diverse over the next several decades. Consider that even if a wall is built around the entire country, and no immigrants are ever allowed in again, the majority of kindergartners in the country are now non-white. Still, 71 percent of voters in 2016 were white, according to exit polls, which means in the short run, at least, Trump has made the gamble that there may be enough voters to propel him to a second term. Lack of support among whites was one big reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. She won just 37 percent of the white vote, the lowest share of any Democratic presidential candidate since Walter Mondale, who lost in a historic landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1984. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the lowest share of the white vote of any Democratic nominee in more than three decades.\n                \n\n                    Domenico Montanaro/Exit poll data compiled by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University\n                    \n\nhide caption What this diversity will mean in this year's election \u2014 and in 2020 \u2014 is unclear, but political polarization and cycles of bitter backlashes are typical when a country is in social, cultural and political upheaval. 2. A new phase in the #MeToo era? Speaking of social and cultural inflection points, nine members of Congress have resigned or not sought re-election this year because of sexual harassment and abuse allegations. But Tuesday night, Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison won a resounding victory for the Democratic nomination for attorney general in Minnesota \u2014 despite facing accusations of domestic violence. Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and the party told NPR Tuesday that it is \"reviewing\" the allegations against Ellison. It called any allegations of domestic abuse \"disturbing and should be taken seriously.\" Ellison vehemently denies the allegations. But Ellison's case highlights a shift in how the party and public have responded to different cases in the #MeToo era \u2014 and perhaps reflects a new chapter in the handling of these kinds of allegations. Some Democrats chafed at how quickly Al Franken, the former senator from Minnesota, was forced out. And there are Democrats, like Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, who generally call for due process. (She has not commented on Ellison's case, and has been cautious in calling for members to step aside.) But some Democrats are questioning what the standard is for the party, if it is going to believe accusations (without further evidence) or if some change is happening. \"The Franken incident has got a lot of Democrats thinking, 'We've lost a progressive hero and, right or wrong, we've lost him too fast,'\" said one longtime Democratic strategist. \"So, there's a little bit of a calibration on how we address these issues.\" And, the strategist noted, with Franken there were pictures and multiple accusations. Former DNC communications director Luis Miranda sees only one way for the party to deal with the question. \"The party has no choice but to suspend [Ellison] at a minimum until they figure out what's going on,\" he told NPR, adding, \"We set too high a standard not to take this seriously.\" There is clearly a tension emerging. It's going to be very tricky going forward not just in politics, but more broadly. 3. Education has emerged as a big theme in 2018 In addition to Hayes, a former national teacher of the year, winning in Connecticut, Wisconsin Democrats nominated the state schools superintendent, Tony Evers, to square off against Scott Walker for governor. The irony of Evers potentially winning in November against Walker is rich. Walker has been public enemy No. 1 for teachers and teachers unions because of how he targeted public-sector unions. Education is becoming a driving theme this year. As Republicans in state houses have gone after education funding, sparking teacher strikes across the country. As West Virginia Public Broadcasting's Dave Mistich noted last month, \"Some of those educators are now running for public office and are on the ballot in North Carolina, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado and in West Virginia where those strikes began.\" And it's likely to be an issue in Kansas, too, where sitting Gov. Jeff Colyer conceded Tuesday night to Trump-backed state Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach has been controversial for backing strict voter ID laws and hardline immigration measures \u2014 many of which have collapsed under judicial scrutiny. And he was the driving force behind the president's \"election integrity\" commission, which disbanded after it failed to find any proof of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 elections. His win means Democrats think this is another seat they can put in play. And an issue sure to be part of their push in the general election is education funding after cuts from former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback led to big teacher protests. The Democrat in the race is state Sen. Laura Kelly, who helped lead opposition to Brownback's tax plan. 4. Democratic turnout was high \u2014 again Week after week, from special elections to primaries, Democrats have seen high turnout. It was no different Tuesday night, which is notable because Republicans hope to compete in many of the races in these four states in the fall, and to put Democrats on the defensive. But whether they were the governors' races in all four states, a Senate race in Minnesota or key House races in Minnesota and Connecticut, Democratic turnout outpaced Republicans' \u2014 and in some cases swamped them. Here's a look at turnout in those key races, in order of largest to smallest Democratic total turnout advantage: Minnesota Senate +268,000Minnesota Governor +261,000Wisconsin Governor +132,000Connecticut Governor +69,000Vermont Governor +31,000Minnesota 8th Congressional District +18,000 Connecticut 5th Congressional District +7,000Minnesota 1st Congressional District +5,000 Note: Turnout comparisons were not possible in two other potentially competitive House races, Minnesota's 2nd and 3rd congressional districts, because candidates there ran unopposed.",

Updated at 12:30 a.m. ET Vermont voters made history on Tuesday as Christine Hallquist, a transgender woman, won the Democratic primary for governor. Hallquist, who will now face Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott in the general election, becomes the first openly transgender person to ever win a major party's nomination for governor in U.S. history. If she wins in November, she'd be the nation's first transgender governor. Hallquist, a former energy company executive, defeated three other candidates to win the Democratic nomination, but Scott won't be easy to beat, even in solidly blue Vermont. The GOP governor had enjoyed high approval ratings and the Cook Political Report still rates the race as solid Republican. Scott did see his approval ratings drop, though, when he signed a sweeping package of gun control measures \u2014 though that mainly came from within his own party, and is probably one reason he was only getting about two-third of the vote in the GOP primary. Polls show Scott still has good numbers among Democratic voters, though. Hallquist easily defeated three Democratic opponents, including 14-year-old Ethan Sonneborn. Even though he wasn't old enough to vote for himself, Sonneborn ran for governor thanks a quirk in the state constitution that didn't set age requirements for the governor. Sen. Bernie Sanders also won the Democratic nomination for Senate, though the possible 2020 presidential hopeful plans to decline it again to run as an independent. Scott Walker's bid for third term set, but Tim Pawlenty loses his Democrats also hope to unseat Republican Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin, and their nominee in that quest will be state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers. An NBC News/Marist poll last month showed Evers beating Walker by double digits as President Trump's approval ratings have fallen in the state he carried in a surprise in 2016. Walker is trying to win a third term after having survived a 2012 recall election and won re-election in 2014. But his first election in 2010 and his re-election both came in GOP wave years. Now with momentum on their side nationally, Democrats think they can finally take out Walker, a polarizing figure in the state given his anti-union crusade. Walker has seen his own numbers drop in the state after his failed 2016 presidential bid. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appears with President Trump at a Foxconn facility opening in June. Walker's reelection bid could be in danger since his approval ratings fell after his failed 2016 presidential bid, which was quickly overshadowed by Trump's presence in the race.\n                \n                    \n                    BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appears with President Trump at a Foxconn facility opening in June. Walker's reelection bid could be in danger since his approval ratings fell after his failed 2016 presidential bid, which was quickly overshadowed by Trump's presence in the race. Another former GOP White House hopeful failed in his comeback bid, as former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty lost the state's Republican gubernatorial primary to 2014 nominee Jeff Johnson. Pawlenty, who made a short-lived presidential run in 2012, had been seen as the heavy favorite, possibly giving Republicans a chance to win back the seat of retiring Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Johnson will now face Democratic Rep. Tim Walz in the general election. Walz, who successfully defended a swing congressional district for years, defeated state Attorney General Lori Swanson and state Rep. Erin Murphy to secure the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination. Wisconsin, Minnesota set a number of races to watch In Wisconsin, Republican Bryan Steil and Democrat Randy Bryce will face off in November to succeed retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan in the state's 1st Congressional District. Steil, a businessman who had Ryan's endorsement, defeated several GOP candidates to win the nomination and will be the favorite this fall. Democratic congressional candidate Randy Bryce celebrates his primary win with a supporter in Racine, Wis., on Tuesday night. Bryce will face Republican Bryan Steil for the seat being vacated by retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic congressional candidate Randy Bryce celebrates his primary win with a supporter in Racine, Wis., on Tuesday night.

Bryce defeated teacher Cathy Myers to win the Democratic nomination, and while the iron worker generated buzz last year with his populist announcement video that went viral, his past arrests, including one for a DUI, and delinquency on child support payments could hamper his bid. Wisconsin Republicans also chose state Sen. Leah Vukmir as their nominee to challenge Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Vukmir, who had the support of much of the state's GOP establishment, defeated Marine Corps veteran Kevin Nicholson. An NBC News/Marist poll in July showed Vukmir trailing Baldwin by 17 points. National Republicans \u2014 who face a tough congressional map across the country \u2014 see the possibility of congressional takeovers in some of the Minnesota races on the ballot Tuesday. The state's 1st District \u2014 vacated by Walz, who won the nomination for governor \u2014 and the 8th District, left open by Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan, who unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor \u2014 are both rural districts that Trump carried in 2016 by double digits. Minnesota Democrats nominated former Obama Defense Department official Dan Feehan in the 1st District. He'll face Jim Hagedorn, the party's nominee against Walz the past two cycles. In Minnesota's 8th Congressional District, Republican St. Louis County Commissioner Pete Stauber, who was endorsed by Trump, will take on state Rep. Joe Radinovich, who who won the Democratic primary and was the national party's preferred candidate in the tough district. Democrats have pick-up opportunities, too, in the Twin Cities suburbs. Freshman GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, who's come under fire for sexist comments when he was a radio host, will have a rematch with 2016 nominee Angie Craig. And in the 3rd District \u2014 which Hillary Clinton won two years ago \u2014 Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen will face Democratic businessman Dean Phillips. Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith easily won her primary as she pursues a full term. Smith, the former lieutenant governor, was appointed to fill the seat after Sen. Al Franken resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Smith was challenged by former George W. Bush ethics lawyer Richard Painter, an outspoken Trump critic who decided to switch parties to run against her. But with about 35 percent of precincts reporting, Smith was winning with over three-fourths of the vote to Painter's 14 percent. She will be heavily favored over Republican state Sen. Karin Housley, who won the GOP nomination. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison also easily won the Democratic primary to be the state's next attorney general, defeating four opponents despite last-minute allegations of domestic abuse. Ellison, the Democratic National Committee's deputy chairman, has denied the allegations. The DNC told NPR on Tuesday that it is reviewing the allegations. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American state legislator in the country, won the Democratic primary for Ellison's seat in the heavily Democratic 5th District. When she was a child, Omar's family fled their country's civil war and spent several years in a refugee camp in Kenya before settling in the U.S. She's now likely to join Michigan Democratic congressional candidate Rashida Tlaib, who won her primary last week, as the first two Muslim congresswomen in history. Changes coming to Connecticut? Republicans could see pick-up opportunities in Connecticut, too. They chose wealthy businessman Bob Stefanowski, who campaigned as a conservative outsider, as their nominee for governor, and believe they have a shot given outgoing Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy's sagging approval ratings amid a state budget crisis. Stefanowski will face Democratic nominee Ned Lamont, who garnered national attention in 2006 for defeating Sen. Joe Lieberman in the state's Democratic primary. In the general election, Lamont lost to Lieberman, who successfully ran as an independent. In the open 5th Congressional District, Connecticut Democrats nominated progressive Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, over the Chamber of Commerce-backed Mary Glassman. Republicans chose former Meriden Mayor Manny Santos as their nominee. Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, won the Democratic primary in Connecticut's 5th Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Caron King/Connecticut Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, won the Democratic primary in Connecticut's 5th Congressional District.

Preliminary results indicate Erdogan has avoided a runoff. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a second five-year term on Sunday in an election granting the Turkish leader unprecedented executive powers. Addressing supporters from the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, headquarters in the nation's capital hours after his victory, Erdogan claimed Turkey's 81 million residents were the winners of the hotly contested election, state run media Anadolu reported. \"Winners of June 24 elections are Turkey, Turkish nation, sufferers of our region and all oppressed in the world,\" he said to cheering crowds, adding that the country \"will look at its future with so much more trust than it did this morning.\" Erdogan also claimed the AKP, and its allied Nationalist Movement Party, the MHP, had retained their control of parliament. Early Monday morning, the Supreme Election Council announced Erdogan received the absolute majority in the presidential election with 53 percent of votes after 97.7 percent of ballots had been counted. The win allowed Erdogan to escape a runoff against his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, who posed the greatest threat to ending Erdogan's 15-year political dominance. Ince, a former teacher-turned-lawmaker with the Republican People's Party, the main secular party known as the CHP, garnered 31 percent of votes,  according to election officials. As of Monday morning he had not conceded the election and urged election observers not to leave ballot boxes. The election council will announce final results on Friday. Erdogan's victory ensures he'll stay in office for 20 years \u2014 until 2023 \u2014 and ushers in a powerful new executive presidency that eliminates the prime minister's role. The current prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said he expects he'll be appointed vice president. The expanded authority of the office is the result of constitutional changes narrowly approved in a referendum last year, which will afford Erdogan autonomy to directly appoint top public officials. He'll also have the ability to rule by decree, intervene in the country's legal system and dissolve parliament. Additionally, as NPR's Peter Kenyon reported, the new system grants Erdogan the possibility of running for a third term \"should parliament call snap elections in his final term.\" The AKP says the changes are intended to make Erdogan's government more efficient and workable while he enacts rapid reforms that are fundamental to his agenda. Critics say it is a blatant power grab and pushes Turkey closer to authoritarian rule. Sunday's elections were supposed to be held in 2019, but Erdogan moved them forward by more than a year. Throughout his presidency, Erdogan has reintroduced Islamic conservatism to civic institutions in a quest to forge a \"pious generation.\" After a failed coup in 2016, tens of thousands of people were arrested and about 150,000 public servants and soldiers were fired from their jobs. One of his primary campaign promises was to lift a state of emergency he imposed following the coup attempt. \"Starting from tomorrow, we will be in a rush trying to deliver on promises that we have made to our nation,\" he said Monday during the early morning victory speech. He promised to confront terrorist groups and liberate Syrian lands so that refugees could safely return to their homelands.",

            "article_content": "GOP voters punish Republican candidates who don't support President Trump. And, China welcomes the summit results, especially if it means the U.S. suspends military exercises in South Korea.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: OK. So what do we make of this? North Korean state media are saying more than the White House did about yesterday's presidential summit. The North Koreans claim that President Trump made big concessions. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, these reports say that the president agreed to a step-by-step process of nuclear disarmament and also talked about the U.S. lifting sanctions. And this, of course, raises this question of exactly what the two men agreed to face-to-face that might not have been in writing. INSKEEP: OK. So what are the claims? Let's start with NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's been following this story. Hey there, Anthony. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: And he was of course part of our team at the Singapore summit. What are the North Koreans claiming that goes beyond this very brief statement that President Trump and Kim Jong Un put out after the meeting? KUHN: OK. So the Korean Central News Agency, the main state-owned news agency, is reporting that Kim and Trump agreed that denuclearization would be a step-by-step process. And each time North Korea takes a step towards denuclearization, they get rewards or incentives. And as recently as May, the Trump administration was saying no, we're only going to reward North Korea when it's completely gotten rid... INSKEEP: Yeah. KUHN: ...Of its nukes. Otherwise, the U.S. is going to get played. North Korea is going to take those rewards but keep their nukes in the end, just as they've done in the past. Now, remember that the U.S. has not confirmed these North Korean media reports. But it does suggest that some verbal agreement was made between Trump and Kim which was not included in their joint statement. And if it turns out to be true, it will be very interesting that we are getting this from North Korean state media first. INSKEEP: Is there any hint that this claim by the North Koreans could be true - any bit of information in there that makes it seem credible? KUHN: You could say that. This report also mentioned a couple other things. One is that the U.S. is going to suspend military exercises with South Korea, and President Trump actually confirmed this in his presser yesterday. This was not in the statement. And it was also interesting that South Korea and the U.S. military in South Korea were not informed about this. They didn't know about it. INSKEEP: OK. So there is, then, some... KUHN: A Chinese analyst who spoke to me today said this was too good to be true. INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. So there is, then, some suggestion that perhaps the two leaders went a little bit beyond their communique. What else is North Korea saying? KUHN: They're also saying that the U.S. could lift sanctions before North Korea completely denuclearizes. And, you know, President Trump did say at his presser yesterday that he hoped that sanctions could be lifted soon. So Trump's position has changed in recent months. And it's changed a lot closer to what North Korea and China want. INSKEEP: One other thing before we analyze this further, Anthony - this phrase security guarantees - there is a general notion of that, that the U.S. would guarantee North Korea's regime security in some way. Is there any more detail from the North Koreans about what that might mean? KUHN: We don't know yet. But an analyst pointed out to me yesterday that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last August that the U.S. does not seek the overthrow of the North Korean regime. And that's the sort of guarantee North Korea's talking about. That's the only thing which would cause them to give up their nukes, if at all. INSKEEP: OK. So a little bit more information - maybe - from at least one side about this summit. Anthony, thanks very much. KUHN: You bet, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn. Now let's get some response from here in the United States. How was this summit received by American lawmakers? GREENE: Well, American lawmakers were getting all of this news and trying to figure out what was happening in Singapore on what was a busy day. Some of them were running in primary elections. And also, Republicans were trying to push forward on the issue of immigration. INSKEEP: NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell has been covering all this. Hey there, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi, there. INSKEEP: So what are lawmakers saying about the summit and the communique that came out of it? SNELL: There was a lot of cautious optimism and a lot of questions from lawmakers. So Vice President Mike Pence came up to Capitol Hill to brief Republicans about the summit. And after that meeting, Republican senators came out saying that it wasn't really clear to them exactly what was agreed to. And they want to see what the president can do. They want to see him continue to negotiate. But people like Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and top party leaders said that they just worry about negotiating with Kim. And they want to kind of just let this president have more space. Here is what Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KENNEDY: Dealing with a butcher like Kim is like hand-feeding a shark. You can do it. But you have to do it very, very carefully. INSKEEP: Hand-feeding a shark - OK. SNELL: Yeah. I mean, part of what they said is that they would love it if Congress could have a role in overseeing this agreement. But that would be a treaty. And treaties take 67 votes to be ratified in the Senate. And that is really hard to get even when people generally agree on what the outcome should be. And this Congress has not always been agreeing with this president about the way they would like to go on just about anything. INSKEEP: Awful lot of interesting responses. One of them was on Twitter in a thread yesterday by Mike Gallagher, a representative from Wisconsin. He's only, I think, 34 years old - mid-30s, Iraq veteran. And he underlined a reality here that there actually wasn't an agreement yesterday. They had a meeting. They restated some points that they had said before. And if there was anything agreed to, as the North Koreans claim, it's something that was private or not written or that we don't know about yet. And Gallagher, in this long thread, essentially worries about where this is going, worries about whether it ends up like another Iran deal, where there's some kind of agreement that leaves a lot out that lawmakers have to worry about later. SNELL: The Iran deal did come up in a lot of my conversations. But there was so much optimism about the fact that a lot of these Republicans really believe that the president has an unconventional approach and that he could get some sort of deal that previous presidents couldn't. INSKEEP: Certainly was a dramatic show in Singapore. Let me ask about another thing that was happening at the same time though, Kelsey, because lawmakers have been discussing immigration and what, if anything, they can try to vote on that President Trump might sign. Have they made any progress? SNELL: Late yesterday evening, Republican leaders in the House announced that they had an agreement to forgo this whole conversation we've been having about overthrowing leadership's judgment and needing to have a vote on a very, I guess, moderate bill working with Democrats to pass the DREAM Act. INSKEEP: Oh, there was a discharge petition to... SNELL: Right. So - yeah, which is basically a sense that the Republicans wanted to vote on something - or a small set of Republicans wanted to vote on something leaders wouldn't allow. INSKEEP: They would have forced their leaders to do it. SNELL: They fell two votes short. INSKEEP: Oh. SNELL: So the signatures did not - they did not reach their goal. Instead, leaders reached this agreement to have a vote on two bills, one that would largely match the four pillars that President Trump laid out outlining security and cutting back on immigration and then something a little bit more moderate - because the message that leaders sent to most of their members was, it would be demoralizing to their base and frustrating for them to vote on something that would get Democrats votes. They didn't want to pass an immigration bill out of the Republican-controlled Congress on mostly Democratic votes. INSKEEP: OK. So as far as that discharge petition goes, never mind. Kelsey, thanks very much. SNELL: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Kelsey Snell. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. We're covering this story of more than 600 migrants who were rescued from the Mediterranean over the weekend. GREENE: Yeah, they boarded a ship that was sailing near Italy's southern coast when it was ordered to stop. Both Italy and Malta refused the migrants entry. Spain has now stepped in, saying they are welcome in Valencia. And we spoke earlier with Dr. David Beversluis with the aid group Doctors Without Borders. He is on the boat with the migrants, and he says the journey has been difficult. DAVID BEVERSLUIS: They're stressed out. They're tired. It's been a very long last several days. And it's continuing for the next several days at least, until we arrive in Spain. INSKEEP: Reporter Lucia Benavides has been covering this from Barcelona. She's on the line. Hi, there. LUCIA BENAVIDES: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: OK. First, why did Italy turn this ship away? BENAVIDES: So Italy has a new coalition government that has run on an anti-immigrant platform. They're asserting their stance against refugees entering Italy. And - although it's also worth it to note that on Wednesday morning, Italy did let an Italian coast guard vessel dock in Sicily with more than 900 migrants. So they are still letting migrants in, but it seems that they're only letting in Italian maritime vessels as opposed to foreign country NGOs. And it's also important to note that Italy has been dealing with the bulk of the immigration crisis seen in Europe since 2014. INSKEEP: Yeah. BENAVIDES: They've seen hundreds of thousands of migrants arrive, usually crossing from Libya. And so in the last few years, Italy has been doing a lot of kind of questionable things to deal with immigration, like making controversial deals with Libya to intercept migrants. It's been documented that a lot of the migrants that are sent back to Libya in detention centers there are experiencing human rights violations like slavery and torture. And Italy has also been investigating a lot of NGO search and rescue vessels and... INSKEEP: OK. BENAVIDES: ...Detaining the boats - yeah... INSKEEP: OK. So... BENAVIDES: ...Although no official charges have been made. INSKEEP: So we're getting a sense that Italy is not cutting off migration, but it is certainly doing a lot of different things. And this is one more to limit migration. Very briefly, then, why is Spain saying yes when so many other countries are saying no? BENAVIDES: Yeah. So Spain actually has also had a change of government. And the new government is socialist, pro-European, pro-immigration and feminist. And so this is kind of their first chance to portray this image of themselves. And, you know, there's no concern as of yet about taking in too many refugees in Spain because Spain hasn't taken that many refugees in in the past. And in fact, they've been criticized for that. INSKEEP: OK. Lucia, thanks very much. BENAVIDES: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's reporter Lucia Benavides speaking with us via Skype as Spain prepares to accept some migrants turned away elsewhere.

            "article_content": "Venezuela held a presidential election on Sunday as the country struggles with inflation and food shortages. Preliminary results indicate President Maduro has won a second term.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Let's turn to the news overnight from Venezuela. President Nicolas Maduro has declared victory in his re-election bid. But the challenge to his leadership is clearly not over. Maduro's opponents are calling his victory illegitimate. Outside observers agree, including the Trump administration, which is threatening new sanctions against Venezuela. So how would that impact a country that has already been dealing with economic collapse? And how exactly did its socialist leader come to reclaim the presidency amid widespread hunger and a refugee crisis? Let's turn to NPR's Philip Reeves, who joins us from Caracas. Hi, Phil. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi. GREENE: So why is this election outcome so in dispute right now? REEVES: Well, specifically, because of the way the government tried to pressure people into voting for Maduro. It set up little red tents, in some cases right by polling stations. Officials at these tents were asking people to hand over a benefits card that they have. It's called the Fatherland Card. A lot of Venezuelans, particularly the poor, have these. They're used for tracking food handouts. And during his campaign, Maduro had said there'll be a big prize for voting. Officials were scanning this card with their cellphones. And people had the impression that they'd win something if they voted for Maduro, money perhaps. GREENE: That sounds like a bribe in many ways. I mean, that sounds like the government's not being subtle at all about this. REEVES: Well, the main challenger to Maduro, ex-governor Henri Falcon, would certainly agree with that. He says he received hundreds of complaints about it. And that's one reason why he says he refuses to recognize the result. But, you know, there's a bigger picture here in this election. In the run-up to the election, the government increased food handouts, stocked stores. It controls most of the media and used that. Its electoral board is government controlled. And it banned the two most prominent opposition leaders from running, which is - you know, these are just some of the reasons why the U.S. and some major Latin American countries have been saying for a long time that this isn't free and fair. And that's why they're not recognizing the result. GREENE: OK. So a couple of questions about what's next here - the U.S. is saying not only they're not going to recognize a result but they want to maybe impose new sanctions that would directly target corrupt regime officials like the president but not target the people of Venezuela. Is that possible? REEVES: Well, it depends on what the sanctions are. And so far, you know, while certainly biting, sanctions haven't brought about a change of behavior. There are concerns that if the U.S. was to extend sanctions into the oil sector, overwhelmingly the source of Venezuela's foreign revenues, this could make the humanitarian crisis notably worse. So it's a difficult tool to apply, especially given the state of the situation here. I mean, you know, you've got hyperinflation pitched to be - expected to be 13,000 percent this year. GREENE: Wow. REEVES: Basic infrastructure is crumbling. People spend hours every day lining up at banks to get out tiny amounts of cash. David, I saw people paying with a banker's card at kiosks for a single cigarette because of such a dire shortage of cash. GREENE: That's amazing. Well, what - and the other question I have, Phil - if you're the opposition now, anything you can do to challenge Maduro now that this election is over? REEVES: Well, the opposition has been divided. It's been lacking leadership. Venezuelans seem totally exhausted and disillusioned. And they've lost faith in them. Now they will be making an effort to unify, start a fresh campaign to pressure Maduro. And the other thing to watch here is the military. Historically, it's a central player in all of this. There's growing evidence of dissent within the ranks. GREENE: All right, NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Caracas, Venezuela. Phil, we appreciate it. REEVES: You're welcome.

Venezuelan leftist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has easily won a second term, but his main rivals have refused to accept the results, calling the polling fraudulent \u2014 a view shared by the United States and many independent observers. Venezuela's National Election Council, run by Maduro loyalists, said that with nearly 93 percent of polling stations reporting by Sunday, Maduro had won almost 68 percent of the vote, beating his nearest challenger, Henri Falcon, by almost 40 points. \"They underestimated me,\" said a triumphant Maduro to cheers from his supporters as fireworks sounded and confetti fell at the presidential palace in Caracas. Maduro, 55, replaced Hugo Chavez when the longtime Venezuelan socialist died of cancer in 2013. Since then, Maduro has presided over a collapsing economy, hyperinflation, widespread hunger and a mass of refugees trying to escape the desperate conditions. The country has been further hit by falling oil exports and U.S. imposed sanctions. Fewer than half of registered voters turned up at the polls, but the opposition, which has boycotted the election, said even that figure was inflated. Those opposed to Maduro have long maintained that the election is fraudulent, not least because the opposition's most popular leaders \u2014 the ones with the best chance of unseating the president \u2014 were barred from running. As NPR's Philip Reeves reports from Caracas, \"Throughout the day voting stations appeared almost empty around the capital.\" Despite that, election officials claim turnout of nearly 50 percent. \"The process undoubtedly lacks legitimacy and as such we do not recognize it,\" said Falcon, a 56-year-old former state governor. According to The Associated Press, \"Falcon was joined in his call for a new election by third-place finisher Javier Bertucci, who got around 11 percent of the vote. Bertucci, a TV evangelist, stopped short of challenging the results, saying what he called a mistaken opposition boycott also boosted Maduro.\" Reuters writes: \"Falcon, a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government's placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \"red spots\" close to polling stations nationwide. Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued \"fatherland cards\" at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a \"prize\" promised by Maduro, which opponents said was akin to vote-buying. The \"fatherland cards\" are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers.\" In the run-up to the election, Freedom House issued a statement calling it \"clearly unconstitutional\" and called Maduro a \"dictator\" who has crushed all opposition. As voting took place on Sunday, a senior State Department official warned that the U.S. might press ahead on threats of imposing crippling oil sanctions, according to the AP.",

In response, a new YouTube video aspires to foster tolerance by having people from marginalized groups bake and sell bread to customers at a Warsaw bakery. Above, some of the loaves baked and handed out as part of the campaign. Each loaf is wrapped in a black ribbon with a photo and information about the person who baked it. \"Does this bread taste the same as it would taste as if a Pole had baked it?\" asks Salam Salti. He is wearing a white apron and a baker's cap with his name on it. Salti is participating in a new Polish campaign called Nasz Chleb Powszedni, or \"Our Daily Bread,\" which aims to inspire tolerance and understanding in Poland by having people from five marginalized groups \u2014 gays, Jews, Muslims, refugees and black people \u2014 bake and sell bread to customers at the Putka Bakery in Warsaw. The experience is encapsulated in a three-minute video released on YouTube. The next part of the campaign includes selling bread baked by minorities in various cities around the country. The campaign is headed by two women, Anna Bi\u0144czyk and Magdalena Korzy\u0144ska. \"We were looking for something that would connect people instead of dividing them,\" says Bi\u0144czyk. The video jumps between shots of the participants preparing, kneading and dusting bread among snippets from events in Poland containing nationalist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and anti-Muslim messages. Although Polish Defense Minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak claims that xenophobia is a rare occurrence, the numbers tell a different story. The Stefan Batory Foundation, a non-governmental organization that supports democracy in Poland, issued a report that analyzed the use and consequences of hate speech among Polish adults and young people (16-18 years old) first in 2014, and again in 2016, times surrounding the parliamentary elections of 2015. It found that incidents of hate speech aimed at minority groups (refugees, immigrants, Muslims, the LGBT+ community, Jews, Roma, and people of color) increased during that period, and that more Polish people were exposed to hate speech in public spaces, the media and online. The report said that repeated exposure to hate speech was associated with a higher tolerance for it. The National Public Prosecutor's Office reports that the number of cases against racist, xenophobic or homophobic crimes has been rising steadily since 2012, when there were 473 cases reported. In the first part of 2017 alone, that number was 947. \"Hate speech and violence motivated by prejudice are not rare in Poland. They are poisoning the public sphere. The amount of hate based on someone's ethnic origins, race, nationality or sexual orientation is huge in Poland,\" says Damian Wutke, secretary of the Association Against Racism and Xenophobia, one of the two organizations involved in making the video. The other is Chlebem i Sol\u0105 (With Bread and Salt), which is devoted to helping refugees. Salti has been living in Warsaw since 1991, and he says he feels both Syrian and Polish. He is now a well-respected gynecologist, but claims that he still occasionally hears racial slurs, such as \"dirty Arab.\" He says he replies to them with humor: \"Thank you for letting me know. I'm now going home to take a shower.\" To counteract these trends, Bi\u0144czyk and Korzy\u0144ska decided to dig deep into the symbolic importance of food, and most specifically, bread. \"In Poland, bread has a place on every table, regardless of our opinions and prejudices,\" Bi\u0144czyk explains. \"Shared meals are moments that should bring people together \u2014 and bread is a symbol that is almost sacred. We share it. We pray for it. No one should lack for bread and you should never throw it away,\" says Wutke. Traditionally, if a piece of bread falls on the floor, it is picked up, blessed with the sign of the cross and sometimes even kissed. Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote, For that land where a scrap of bread is picked up From the ground out of reverence For Heaven's gifts ... I am homesick, Lord! Like many Polish intellectuals, writers and artists of the late 19th century, Norwid himself spent a lot of time living abroad, including New York, Berlin, London and finally Paris where he died. This was motivated both by his desire to study painting in Germany and Italy, and the fact that at that time, Poland was divided between Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and didn't exist as an independent country. Many intellectuals were forced into exile. Throughout history, Poles also moved abroad in search of better opportunities, especially after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and getting a job in Western Europe became easier. This type of emigration is called za chlebem, or \"after the bread.\" But can food \u2014 and especially bread \u2014 help foster tolerance and understanding? Salti believes so. \"Food is not just food. It's one of life's basic pleasures. Not everyone likes drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana, but a common meal can bring people together. You can eat my food. I can eat your food. And the gap between us has decreased,\" he says. Although the makers of Nasz Chleb Powszedni had problems convincing bakeries to participate (many owners were worried about how business would be affected by such a campaign), the video was hugely popular in Poland, and gained the attention of several major media outlets, including Gazeta Wyborcza, the country's most prominent newspaper. The video attracted more than one million views on the first day. \"It was so popular because it left the viewer with a feeling of reassurance, it's very positive. And that's what we're missing in Poland the most,\" says Bi\u0144czyk. And despite some rather frightening events in Poland \u2014 a 14-year old Turkish girl was violently beaten in Warsaw in January \u2014 there is some hope that \"hate will never become our daily bread. I believe that Poland can be a country where everyone feels safe,\" says Wutke. When Salti asks his customers whether they could detect a difference in the taste of the bread now that they knew who made it, one woman says, \"No.\" Another man adds, \"It's normal.\" And a third person says: \"There is no difference. A human being is a human being, always.\" Olga Mecking is a writer, journalist, and translator based in the Netherlands.",

Today's number: 10 \u2014 that's the percentage of Hungarians who feel \"totally comfortable\" having an immigrant as a friend. Every day at noon, Ibrar Hussein Mirzai hears the cathedral bells as he leaves his intensive Hungarian-language class in the small, leafy town of F\u00f3t, just north of Hungary's capital Budapest. The 18-year-old Afghan refugee says he finds the sound almost as relaxing as the devotional Sufi qawwali music he grew up listening to in Quetta, Pakistan, where his family settled after fleeing the Taliban in Afghanistan. \"I learn the language to go to university and after that to live a normal life,\" says Mirzai. \"Living in a safe place, having a job, having your family with you. This is what a normal life means to me.\" Mirzai, a shy math whiz with a schoolboy grin, escaped Sunni Muslim militants in Quetta who targeted people like him, members of the primarily Shiite Muslim Hazara ethnic minority. He traveled thousands of miles to get to Europe \"for a chance to study without fearing for my life.\" Now he has asylum \u2014 in one of the most anti-refugee countries on the continent. Mirzai was among 1,216 granted protection in Hungary last year \u2014 about a third of total applicants, according to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, human rights watchdog. His friends who have sought asylum in Germany and Austria told him he was nuts to take refuge in a country they thought had an impenetrable language and hostile people. \"I never thought that I would stay here in Hungary,\" says Mirzai. \"I didn't have any other way to find a peaceful place for me to live my life.\" In a newly published European Union survey on immigration, only 10 percent of Hungarians said they would feel \"totally comfortable\" having an immigrant as a friend. Fifty-five percent said they would feel \"uncomfortable.\" Yet tens of thousands of Hungarians have themselves migrated to Western Europe in the last decade. And 62 years ago, more than 180,000 fled the country after the Soviet military crushed a nationwide anti-communist uprising. Despite its past, Hungary joins other former Eastern bloc countries as the European Union's most strident opponents of accepting refugees from war-torn Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n won his third term in early April by promising to defend \"Christian Europe\" against \"Muslim invaders\" \u2014 his shorthand for refugees. He is referencing a moment in the late Middle Ages. It's a period coded into the noon ringing of Hungary's church bells \u2014 including the one at F\u00f3t's Roman Catholic cathedral. Catholic priest S\u00e1ndor Sebok says he feels for refugees but says Muslims cannot integrate into historically Christian societies in Europe.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Catholic priest S\u00e1ndor Sebok says he feels for refugees but says Muslims cannot integrate into historically Christian societies in Europe. The cathedral's parish priest, S\u00e1ndor Sebok, explains that in 1456, Pope Callixtus III ordered church bells be rung every day at noon in honor of Hungarian military hero J\u00e1nos Hunyadi, credited with stopping the Ottoman invasion of Hungary. The priest draws a parallel from Hunyadi to Orb\u00e1n, who he says prevented a Muslim \"invasion\" of Europe in 2015. That's when Hungary closed its borders to hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers on their way to Germany. \"These healthy young men who come here as migrants, I see them as soldiers coming here to conquer Europe,\" Sebok says. \"What Islam didn't manage to do with the sword back in 1456, it is trying to do now through migration.\" Across the street from the cathedral, Ilona Kapin Ha\u00e1sn\u00e9 runs a kiosk selling newspapers, candy, soda and cigarettes. She says she's upset that the world views Hungarians as racist and xenophobic, having an irrational fear or hatred of foreigners. \"Hungarians are not the kind of people who don't take in the persecuted, like young, defenseless children,\" she says. She's referring to a local children's center, where a few teenage refugees live. Mirzai, the Afghan teen, stayed there until he turned 18. Sometimes the kids come in to buy soda or candy from her kiosk. She likes it when they linger to practice Hungarian with her. But she says she was alarmed when \"too many\" came to her shop in 2015. One night, she says, a group jostled her as she closed the kiosk. \"Let's be honest, they are different,\" she says. \"Our religion is different. Our everything is different.\" About half of Hungarians identify as Christians, most of them Catholic. \"The beast in us\" About 15 miles south of F\u00f3t, in Budapest, sociologist Endre S\u00edk explains these fears are existential, rooted in Hungary's history of being invaded. \"It is the fear that our world would collapse, we will lose everything we have \u2014 the way we think, the way we construct our reality,\" he says. Since 1992, as part of the TARKI Social Research Institute, S\u00edk has polled Hungarians on which nationalities \u2014 \"Chinese, Romanians, Arabs from various countries, Africans from various countries\" \u2014 they would admit into the country. A growing number has said they would reject all of them. It is the fear that our world would collapse, we will lose everything we have \u2014 the way we think, the way we construct our reality. Endre S\u00edk, sociologist He wanted to see if this rejection was limited to existing prejudices. So, in 2006, inspired by a 1946 study by American psychologist Eugene Hartley, he added a fictional ethnic group to the survey question \u2014 the Pir\u00e9z people, or the Pir\u00e9zians. Most Hungarians rejected them, too. Later, some used the rejection of the fake Pir\u00e9z people as a way to satirize Hungarian intolerance. S\u00edk recalled someone making a Pir\u00e9zian anthem and flag. A Hungarian writer living in Ukraine started blogging as \"The First Pir\u00e9z.\" \"Being a Pir\u00e9z means laughing in the face of xenophobes and racists,\" says K\u00e1roly D. Balla, aka The First Pir\u00e9z, over Skype, quoting what he called the \"Pir\u00e9z Manifesto.\" He reminds his readers that Hungarians themselves have been once welcomed as refugees. They live as minorities in other nations. \"Whoever incites hatred against strangers also incites hatred against their own nation,\" he warns them. But he acknowledges that his readership is tiny. S\u00edk says he's not surprised Hungarians rejected even a made-up community. \"The Hungarian form of xenophobia is, let's say, the classic form: 'They are different, we don't know them, therefore we hate them.' That's the beast in us.\" Educators Marcell Kenesei (left) and Peter Neumann at the offices of Centropa Hungary in Budapest. \"I identify myself as a Hungarian Jew,\" Kenesei says. \"For some, it's an oxymoron.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Educators Marcell Kenesei (left) and Peter Neumann at the offices of Centropa Hungary in Budapest. \"I identify myself as a Hungarian Jew,\" Kenesei says. \"For some, it's an oxymoron.\" Changing the narrative Educator Marcell Kenesei says he sees the main problem: Hungary is a largely white, Christian country where only 5 percent of the population is foreign-born. \"There are few opportunities to meet someone from a different background,\" he says. He knows this firsthand. \"I identify myself as a Hungarian Jew. For some, it's an oxymoron,\" he says. \"Either you are Jewish or Hungarian.\" For instance, Kenesei says he spoke out earlier this year against holding a Mass and memorial for Hungary's Nazi-allied wartime leader, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Some Hungarian nationalists told Kenesei to \"go back to Israel.\" Today there are an estimated 100,000 Jewish Hungarians. In 1941, there were more than 800,000. Kenesei is the deputy director of Centropa Hungary, a nonprofit focusing on Jewish history. He also supervises programs that bring together children from different religious or ethnic backgrounds to craft songs, videos and murals together. \"And the notion is that when they finish with the project, they will be proud of what they have done, and they have done it with someone else,\" he says. \"And this creates a certain kind of interest towards others.\" But he says these tiny steps forward won't amount to much if the government keeps its pledge to crack down on groups that support migration. \"You don't know how far this government will go,\" he says. Budapest has already had two big protests against Orb\u00e1n this month. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to slam his xenophobia and demand new elections. Mirzai, the Afghan refugee, is trying to focus on the positive. \"The government is not representing everyone,\" he says, sipping tea at a cafe at Central European University, where he takes courses. The university, founded by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, is one of the institutions that has been targeted by the Orb\u00e1n government's illiberal policies. \"The Hungarians who are around me, they're kind with me, they are good with me,\" Mirzai says. He likes his teachers, his housemates, the supermarket checkout ladies who remind him of his grandmother. When he was feeling down a few weeks ago, he read a memoir on healing by Hungarian-born psychotherapist Edith Eger, who survived the Holocaust. The Hungarians who are around me, they're kind with me, they are good with me. Ibrar Hussein Mirzai, Afghan refugee in Hungary \"In that book, she was saying that if 'I survived today, I would survive tomorrow,' \" he says. He rises at dawn for a full day of classes and study sessions at the library. He returns to the room near F\u00f3t he shares with another refugee at 10 p.m. It's a routine with a goal. \"I want to become a citizen,\" he says. Hungary has granted protection to only a third of Afghans seeking asylum there. Mirzai wonders if it helped that he translated for the police and social workers while he was stuck at a camp (\"a prison, really\") on the Hungarian-Serbian border for 86 days. He does not ignore the polls showing Hungarians' negative attitudes toward foreign people. But the recent European survey also showed that those who actually live in cities with immigrants tend to say they feel comfortable befriending them. This gives Mirzai hope. \"If [the Hungarians] live with me, they will change their minds by themselves,\" he says. \"I am just a normal person like them. I don't have any problem with them. They don't have to have any problem with me.\" Journalist M\u00e1t\u00e9 Halmos contributed reporting in Budapest and F\u00f3t, Hungary.",

What do a chicken, gorilla, invisible man and Santa Claus have in common? They are all candidates on ballots that will be cast during parliamentary elections in Hungary on Sunday. These costumed humans belong to a satirical political party started in Hungary in 2006. It is called \"Two-Tailed Dog,\" known by its Hungarian acronym MKKP, and is fielding candidates in various districts for the first time in nationwide elections. Gergely Kov\u00e1cs, the party's founder and leader, said it all makes perfect sense: \"Santa Claus has got lots of spare time because he works only one day a year, so he can campaign for us.\" The invisible man, he added, \"is very useful because it's very easy to Photoshop him\" onto pictures of important people like the pope. As for the chicken and gorilla, \"We are a dog party, so we welcome animals.\" Who wouldn't want to vote for his party? It promises free beer plus eternal life \u2013 plus 20 years, because the party had to sweeten the pot now that it is running in national elections, Kov\u00e1cs explained. Its 39 candidates have their own platforms. Kov\u00e1cs, for example \u2014 who is running without a costume \u2014 pledges to replace rich residents with poor people in his ritzy hilltop neighborhood overlooking Budapest. \"Not the whole population, only about 20 percent,\" he said \u2014 to improve the mood of residents who feel outdone by their wealthy neighbors. The \"gorilla,\" Budapest resident Veronika Juh\u00e1sz, is promising \"not to promise anything\" to her constituents. Except, that is, to build a launching pad for rockets filled with the \"cuddle hormone\" oxytocin to promote world peace \u2014 and to plant trees. \"Well, basically, I am a gorilla gardener, so that's my job,\" she said, drawing stares during an interview in her gorilla costume with NPR on Budapest's Margit Bridge. \"Usually it's mistakenly written as 'guerrilla gardening.' It's actually 'gorilla gardening' ... in a jungle like this. A protestor wearing a sticker reading \"Relax, look deep into my eyes and vote us\" takes part in a march by the Hungarian satirical Two-Tailed Dog Party in Budapest on March 15.\n                \n                    \n                    Ferenc Isza/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protestor wearing a sticker reading \"Relax, look deep into my eyes and vote us\" takes part in a march by the Hungarian satirical Two-Tailed Dog Party in Budapest on March 15. \"It's my first time running for office,\" she added. But \"it's not my first time running to the office, because usually I'm a bit late.\" Kov\u00e1cs said he draws inspiration from other political satirists, including the Yes Men, an American activist, anti-consumerist duo that tackles social and political issues, and Germany's Die Partei, or \"the party.\" Die Partei only has one member in the European Parliament, but \"you know German humor,\" Kov\u00e1cs quipped, \"so it might be hard for them to make a joke party in Germany.\" He said running for office was something he never envisioned when he founded the party, named for the English saying about being as happy as a dog with two tails. At first, its main activities were performance and street art, as well as posters parodying the political elite. But things became more serious when Two-Tailed Dog began tackling national issues \u2014 like the Hungarian government's vilification of mostly Muslim migrants. In 2016, when Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n organized a referendum to snub Brussels over the European Union's refugee distribution plan, the satire kicked into high gear. Hungarian government billboards saying \"Did you know? Migrants were responsible for the Paris attacks\" or \"Did you know? Brussels wants to resettle a town-full of migrants in Hungary\" were countered with Two-Tailed Dog retorts such as: \"Did you know? Over one million Hungarians want to relocate to Western Europe\" and \"Did you know? There is a war in Syria.\" Orb\u00e1n's referendum failed because only about 40 percent of eligible voters took part. Hungarian elections officials later fined the satirical party $3,100 over its campaign to get referendum voters to invalidate their ballots. Some 6 percent did. The legal issue arose over Two-Tailed Dog encouraging voters to upload pictures of their desecrated ballots; photographing ballots is illegal in Hungary. A Hungarian court reduced the fine to $390, but in January, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled against Hungary altogether, saying it had violated the EU's freedom of speech principle in the case. During the current election season, Two-Tailed Dog generated enough public support to qualify for campaign funding, which the party said amounted to $750,630. The party said that prompted a new initiative called the \"first people's campaign money squandering fund,\" in which the party is funding community projects, including a mobile planetarium and a van for \"clown doctors\" who treat the seriously ill and help make them laugh. How popular the party actually is among Hungarians isn't clear. Kov\u00e1cs can't even say for sure how many members his party has \u2014 they've never been counted. But political humor has a long tradition in the Central European country and historians say it was a popular form of passive resistance during the Communist era. \"They [Two-Tailed Dog] have an impact on the discourse in Hungary,\" said G\u00e1bor Gy\u0151ri, a political analyst at Policy Solutions, a progressive think tank in Budapest. But, he said, \"I don't think they have much of an electoral impact. Apart from saying that the entire political elite is rubbish and essentially and should be replaced, they don't have much of a program for Hungary.\" Gy\u0151ri is among Hungarians who criticized a recent appearance by Two-Tailed Dog's chicken candidate on Hungarian state television, on which opposition parties were given only five minutes to state their campaign platform. The chicken candidate, who appeared in costume, drank water and clucked as the commentator asked him questions. The mocking response resonates with Hungarians, given that \"we have a government that is increasingly autocratic, and we have an opposition that appears impotent,\" Gy\u0151ri said. \"At the same time, I think that somebody using five minutes of national television by clucking as a chicken is not the best use. Somebody I heard said it best: 'I think for the first minute it was funny, and after that, it became kind of embarrassing.'\" Hungarian government spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs said he's not worried about Two-Tailed Dog peeling away legitimate votes. \"Humor has always had a role in politics. We believe it still has,\" he said. \"But it's obvious that the government parties are the ones actually who are carrying the message that is for the interest of the Hungarian people.\" But at least one Two-Tailed Dog candidate has a fighting chance of winning, Gergely Kov\u00e1cs believes. That would be the chicken. Also known as J\u00f3zsef Tichy-R\u00e1cs, he has become rather famous, Kov\u00e1cs said. Toward the end of his controversial TV appearance, Tichy-R\u00e1cs clucked out binary code spelling the words \"free beer.\"",

            "article_content": "Credit:  NPR Rasha al-Ahmed imagined Europe would be a clean, generous place \u2014 not a makeshift tent in an olive grove where the mud is mixed with human waste and rotting food. \"A safe life with a house and enough food,\" she said, shuddering as she wiped fetid mud from her 1-year-old daughter's cheeks. \"That's what I hoped for when I crossed the sea from Turkey to Greece.\" Ahmed is 25, tall and no-nonsense, with three young children and a wise-cracking husband, Waleed, who worked as an ironsmith and roofer in Deir Ezzor, the city in eastern Syria where they're from. They left Syria in November, worn down by a war that, after seven years, appears to have no end in sight. They tried to live in Izmir, Turkey, but after only a month there, they felt trapped. Turkey hosts more refugees \u2014 3.5 million \u2014 than any other country in the world. Most are Syrian. Waleed could not find work, even the most menial and low-paying kind. They saw other Syrians begging on the streets. So they borrowed money to pay smugglers who helped them cross the Aegean Sea to Greece. The family arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos in December. Two years ago this month, under a deal the European Union sealed with Turkey, Lesbos and several other Greek Aegean islands became processing centers for migrants arriving to the EU by sea. They aren't allowed to leave these islands until their requests for asylum are processed. Those who are denied are supposed to be deported to Turkey. Those who receive asylum can go on to mainland Greece \u2014 to subsidized housing or, if that's not available, to another refugee camp that's better equipped than those on the islands. Ahmed says she didn't realize that Europe had soured on asylum-seekers and that several EU countries are trying to block them from arriving. A smuggler in Turkey told her and her husband that refugees are welcome in Europe and the family would have to stay for just a couple of weeks in Greece and then could go on to Germany. When they arrived on Lesbos, Greek police took them to an EU-subsidized camp run by Greek authorities and international volunteers, but it terrified them. Trash lined every corridor. The overwhelming stench of rotting garbage, urine and feces made them want to vomit. The few toilets overflowed with human waste. Women shared tents with unrelated men. Other refugee women warned Ahmed not to walk around by herself \u2014 there were drug dealers and drunk men. She heard people screaming in food lines and watched fights break out. She looked up and saw razor-wire fencing. \"Europe does not see us as human,\" she remembers thinking that day. The doors close The European Union started closing its borders to migrants in October 2015, when Hungary blocked asylum-seekers who had previously been waved through the Balkans and Central Europe so they could reach Western Europe. It was the height of Europe's refugee crisis. That month alone, the U.N. recorded more than 200,000 migrants crossing from Turkey to Greece \u2014 all of them bound for Western Europe. By the end of 2015, more than a million migrants had entered the EU. Most were from war zones \u2014 Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. More border closures followed. By February 2016, with thousands of migrants stuck in Greece, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was warning that the country was becoming a \"warehouse of souls.\" The next month, the EU worked out its deal with Turkey aimed at discouraging migration. Just before the deal was sealed, European Commission President Donald Tusk hinted that anyone who didn't qualify for asylum would be swiftly deported. \"Do not come to Europe,\" Tusk warned would-be migrants. \"Do not believe the smugglers. Do not risk your lives and your money. It is all for nothing.\" The EU paid Turkey roughly $3 billion to accept deportees and better patrol its coast to prevent more migrants from entering Europe. It also promised to fast-track EU visas for Turks and expedite Turkey's EU membership process. And the EU said it would accept Syrians in refugee camps after they'd been vetted in Turkey. Two years later, the number of asylum-seekers crossing from Turkey has dropped by more than 80 percent, with 29,595 arriving in Greece in 2017. Most of the nearly 172,000 migrants who crossed the Mediterranean last year went to Italy, despite efforts to keep them away. After they arrive on the Greek islands, the Greek Asylum Service, which is understaffed, often takes months to process asylum requests. If the requests are rejected, they're often followed by lengthy appeals. Amal Adwan, a 47-year-old teacher from Damascus, Syria, must stay on Lesbos until she exhausts all appeals for her asylum request, which was denied on the basis that Turkey is a safe country. \"Syrians face discrimination in Turkey,\" she says. \"We cannot find work, and if we do, they don't pay us.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Daphne Tolis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Amal Adwan, a 47-year-old teacher from Damascus, Syria, must stay on Lesbos until she exhausts all appeals for her asylum request, which was denied on the basis that Turkey is a safe country. \"Syrians face discrimination in Turkey,\" she says. \"We cannot find work, and if we do, they don't pay us.\" Amal Adwan, a 47-year-old teacher from Damascus, arrived on Lesbos from Turkey about seven months ago. Her asylum request was rejected on the basis that Turkey is a safe country for refugees. \"I was shocked,\" she said, \"because I didn't know that there was a deal with Turkey to send us back. I found out about [it] when I arrived on the boat. It's like Europe no longer accepts Syrians as refugees.\" While living for months in Turkey, she said she tried repeatedly to find work, to no avail. She worried about being forced to live on the streets. Now she has appealed Greece's rejection of her asylum request, and is waiting for an answer. \"I want to land somewhere where I can support myself. I will stay in Greece if I can get a job,\" she said. \"I speak English. I am educated. I don't want to be dependent on state handouts.\" Maria Stavropoulou, the former director of the Greek Asylum Service, told the newspaper Kathimerini in January that there was a backlog of more than 9,000 asylum cases at the time. \"If there were no arrivals on the islands, I would say that [asylum] proceedings could be completed in two to two-and-a-half months,\" she said. In 2017, the number of asylum claims in Greece rose by 15 percent, according to the asylum service. Its staff received 58,661 asylum requests in 2017 and awarded protection to 10,364 people. Applicants came mostly from Syria, Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. Stavropoulou added that only 16 percent of migrants arriving can be returned to Turkey under Greek and EU law. Far fewer have in fact been returned. Only about 1,400 of the more than 46,600 migrants who arrived on the Greek islands since the March 2016 deal have been returned to Turkey, according to the U.N. refugee agency. \"We are the criminals\" As a result, the refugee camps on Greek islands, built to house no more than 2,000 people each, often hold more than three times that number. Leila Hassan, who's 20 and from Somalia, said that when she first arrived at Moria camp, she wanted to turn around and go back to Mogadishu. \"Because [the camp] is like a prison, and we are the criminals,\" she said.

Eva Cosse of Human Rights Watch says this is exactly the message the EU wants to send. \"It's like the EU is saying, 'Don't come here, because if you do, this is what you're going to suffer,' \" she says. \"Overcrowded, very dirty, very unsanitary camps, sleeping literally on the concrete, on the ground. And this is happening in the European Union. It's unimaginable.\" Human rights groups want the EU to end the so-called containment policy and let asylum-seekers leave the islands and go to the Greek mainland while awaiting a decision on their claims. But Gerald Knaus, who leads the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based think tank, and served as the main architect of the EU-Turkey deal, says that would void the deal and \"only result in a return to the status quo, which was a situation where, on an average day in January or February 2016, 2,000 people were coming to the Greek islands, a lot of people drowned, and those who made it were moved to the mainland, so the humanitarian crisis existed elsewhere.\" The EU has allocated nearly a billion euros, more than $1 billion, in migration aid to Greece and insists Greek authorities are responsible for managing refugee camps. But the former migration minister, Yiannis Mouzalas, who was replaced this month, repeatedly criticized the EU for failing to provide extra staff to the asylum service and for taking too long to relocate refugees, including many unaccompanied children in Moria camp. When Mouzalas handed over his post to Dimitris Vitsas in a public ceremony, he warned Vitsas that Greece is in a \"very difficult phase of the migration crisis.\" \"We have messages from the U.N. refugee agency regarding a new crisis in Syria and a lack of funding for camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon,\" Mouzalas said. \"The conditions are being created again for a new crisis.\" \"You won't get through\" Managing migration remains one of the EU's biggest challenges. It's caused a political backlash in countries from Britain \u2014 where anti-migration feelings fueled the Brexit vote in 2016 \u2014 to Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban is poised to win re-election next month amid statements that migration will cause \"terror, women and girls will no longer be safe and our cultural identity will ...evaporate.\" Another anti-refugee EU leader, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, has said that the EU must be ruthless when it comes to migrants. \"Our approach must be to protect the external borders and to tell whoever tries to come to Europe illegally, 'you won't get through,' \" he told Politico in 2016. Kurz holds up Australia's treatment of asylum-seekers as a model. He has suggested the EU use Greece's Aegean islands in the same way that Australia has parked asylum-seekers for years in neighboring Pacific nations such as Nauru or Papua New Guinea.

In February, lawyers from islands that house migrants \u2014 Chios, Lesbos, Kos, Samos and Rhodes \u2014 held a news conference threatening to sue on the islands' behalf, on the basis that the detention of migrants on the islands is a violation of both Greek and international law. \"Why is this happening at all?\" Rasha al-Ahmed, the 25-year-old Syrian mother, and her family did not stay inside the Moria camp on Lesbos. It was just too crowded. Residents of Lesbos demonstrate on Nov. 20, 2017, against an increase in the number of asylum-seekers on the island.\n                \n                    \n                    Anthi Pazianou/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Residents of Lesbos demonstrate on Nov. 20, 2017, against an increase in the number of asylum-seekers on the island. Instead, after a couple of days, they improvised a tent on a neighboring hill dotted with olive trees. They made the tent out of salvaged wood, rusting metal rods and recycled tarp that leaks when it rains. \"The hardest thing for me is to try to find a proper place to get clean,\" Ahmed said back in December. \"I wash the kids every day, even in cold water, but I can't keep them clean because of all the mud. I haven't taken a shower in two weeks.\" Hundreds of other migrants also pitched tents in the olive groves that surround the camp. This troubled Panagiotis Chronis, a 72-year-old retired computer engineer who lives in the lemon-scented village of Moria, for which the camp, previously an army barracks, is named. \"The migrant camp of Moria is now the second-largest town on Lesbos,\" he said. \"Next to it, the village of Moria is just a tiny little thing.\" Kleoniki and Panagiotis Chronis live in the village of Moria, for which the nearby camp, previously an army barracks, is named. \"What's happening here is unacceptable,\" Kleoniki Chronis says. \"Unacceptable for the refugees, for us, for Greece and for Europe.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kleoniki and Panagiotis Chronis live in the village of Moria, for which the nearby camp, previously an army barracks, is named. \"What's happening here is unacceptable,\" Kleoniki Chronis says. \"Unacceptable for the refugees, for us, for Greece and for Europe.\" His wife Kleoniki, 59, laments that their village, a short walk from the camp, was once known for its well-preserved ancient Roman aqueduct. But since the refugee crisis started, the name Moria, she says, is \"synonymous with Europe's 'Guant\u00e1namo.'\" \"What's happening here is unacceptable,\" Kleoniki Chronis says. \"Unacceptable for the refugees, for us, for Greece and for Europe.\" The villagers of Lesbos, many of whom are descendants of refugees from Anatolia in Turkey, have shown great generosity to asylum-seekers arriving on their shores. Some were nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize, and two shared the U.N. refugee agency's highest humanitarian award that year. But there are deepening concerns, especially in Moria, that the island has become an exile center for people that the rest of Europe doesn't want. Like other villagers, the Chronises are concerned that overcrowding at the camp is not only bad for the refugees, but also for their village. Panagiotis says migrants have stolen and slaughtered local goats and chickens, picked fruit off trees and chopped down olive trees for firewood. \"If I was in the same situation, and my children were cold and hungry, I'd do the same thing,\" Kleoniki Chronis says. \"My question is, why is this even happening at all? This is not a war zone. It's not the Third World. It's Europe. We are in the European Union.\"",

Venezuela's downward economic spiral has led to widespread food shortages, hyperinflation and now mass migration. Many Venezuelans are opting for the easiest escape route \u2014 by crossing the land border into Colombia. There were more than half a million Venezuelans in Colombia as of December, according to the Colombian immigration department, and many came over in the last two years. Their exodus rivals the number of Syrians in Germany or Rohingya in Bangladesh. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm, calls it the world's \"least-talked-about\" immigration crisis. But Colombians are taking notice. In fact, President Juan Manuel Santos is asking for international aid to cope with the large numbers of immigrants, many of whom are impoverished, hungry and desperate. \"I appreciate the offers of financial and other aid from the international community,\" Santos said last week. \"We need it because unfortunately this problem gets worse day by day.\" Santos suggested that the crisis will last as long as Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela's increasingly authoritarian president, remains in power. His socialist economic policies have led to a collapse of the local currency and inflation expected to hit 13,000 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Still, Maduro is widely expected to secure another six-year term in the April 22 election, in part, because the most popular opposition candidates have been banned from running. Earlier this month, Santos announced measures to tighten the border but the immediate result has been a spike in new arrivals as Venezuelans rush to cross the frontier before the new rules take hold. Families clog the bridge spanning the T\u00e1chira River, the busiest border crossing between the two countries, as they push baby strollers, carry boxes and drag roller luggage into Colombia. For many, their first stop comes a few feet inside Colombian territory, in the Norte de Santander region, where they unload their jewelry to dealers who purchase precious metals. At one shop, newcomers pull off their rings and unpin their brooches and necklaces. Workers use files and acids to check the purity of the metal. Then shop owner Jos\u00e9 Alvarado negotiates prices. He offers the equivalent of about $7 for a woman's silver bracelet and $275 for a man's gold ring, but he rejects a watch for its dubious quality. A Venezuelan who fled his homeland two years ago, Alvarado says he understands what his compatriots are going through. He says the most heartbreaking case was a couple that sold their wedding rings after 40 years of marriage. \"People cry a lot when they sell their jewelry. But they have no choice,\" he says. Indeed, Venezuelans need the cash as they travel deeper into Colombia or journey south to Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina. On the border bridge, several Venezuelans employed by Colombian travel agencies hawk bus tickets. Passage to Lima sells for $241, while Buenos Aires costs twice as much. These freelance agents live on the Venezuelan side of the border and say they too want to get away. But lacking money and passports, they can only dream about the destinations they are trumpeting. All sorts of businesses have sprouted in C\u00facuta, Colombia, around the Venezuelan immigration boom. This man is looking to buy locks of hair to be used for hair extensions.\n                \n                    \n                    John Otis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption All sorts of businesses have sprouted in C\u00facuta, Colombia, around the Venezuelan immigration boom. This man is looking to buy locks of hair to be used for hair extensions. A few miles up the road, in the Colombian border city of C\u00facuta, a new business has sprung up to take advantage of the crisis. In the city plaza, hair dealers are looking for clients to sell them locks for making hair extensions. They wear signs around their necks stating, \"we buy hair,\" and shout out the same message. Nearly all their customers are penniless Venezuelans, including Jefferson M\u00e1rquez. He arrived two days ago from the Venezuelan city of M\u00e9rida with the hair of his 14-year-old cousin in a plastic bag. He sells it for about $4, which he plans to send back to his family. Another potential vendor is Karelis Nieves. She worked at a supermarket in the Venezuelan city of Maracay but says the business collapsed after it was expropriated by the government. Nieves, 23, came to Colombia last month and is trying to scrounge up money to support her parents and 2-year-old daughter back home. But the hair broker requires locks that are at least a foot-and-a-half long. After pulling out his measuring tape, he informs Nieves that her flowing brown hair is a few inches too short. There are other ways to get by, including selling street food, working construction and busking. Street musician Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda says he fled to Colombia four months ago. Due to the collapse of Venezuela's currency, his salary as a mechanic on an oil rig was no longer enough to feed his family of four. Masterly on the harp, Garc\u00eda has teamed up with a Venezuelan guitarist and the duo plays Venezuelan folk music, called llanero. The spare change people toss into their open guitar case adds up to about $10 a day \u2014 more than Garc\u00eda made for a week's work in Venezuela. But others resort to prostitution or street crime to survive, says Carlos Luna, head of the C\u00facuta Chamber of Commerce. In addition, he points out that throngs of Colombians who moved to Venezuela during that country's periodic oil booms \u2014 or to escape from violence during Colombia's long-running guerrilla war \u2014 are now returning. Luna says C\u00facuta must not open refugee centers because he says they would only attract more Venezuelan migrants and exacerbate the problem. However, churches and charities now run a few soup kitchens and shelters where migrants are allowed to stay for 48 hours until they move on to their next destination. One of the kitchens near the border bridge serves 1,000 lunches per day, including today's meal of chicken and spaghetti. Among the diners is Danny M\u00e1rquez, who arrived the day before. He used to run a thriving business selling cleaning supplies in Venezuela. But the economic crisis drove him bankrupt. He used to be solidly middle class and is clearly distraught at having to ask for food. \"This is the first time in my life that I've set foot in a soup kitchen,\" says M\u00e1rquez, who has tears in his eyes. He plans to resettle in Chile. But M\u00e1rquez is bitter about having to abandon his homeland. \"I resisted for two years,\" he says. \"I vowed to myself: 'I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving.' But then things became impossible.\"",

The migrant transit complex on the Hungarian side of the border has been expanded to become one of two new detention centers for asylum seekers in the Hungarian transit zone and contains shipping containers that are used to automatically detain migrants in the transit zone while their claims are investigated. Hungary has quietly closed its borders to nearly all asylum seekers, which human rights advocates say violates international laws and is stranding thousands of refugee families in Serbia. NPR interviewed asylum seekers, refugee advocates and a lawyer all with direct knowledge of the near closure and the resulting panic and despair. They report that since Jan. 22, Hungary is allowing only one asylum seeker per day to cross from Serbia into each of its two \"transit zones.\" The widely criticized zones \u2013 surrounded by barbed wire and dotted with shipping containers configured into living space \u2014 are the only places asylum seekers entering Hungary are allowed to go unless they already have refugee status from another EU country. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi last September likened the transit zones to detention centers and called on Hungary to improve access for asylum seekers. Now, access is reduced to two people per day. Critics of Hungarian refugee policy say what the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his ruling Fidesz Party is trying to do is boost approval ratings before parliamentary elections on April 8. They've adopted an anti-refugee platform that's been shaken by the recent revelation that Hungarian authorities approved twice as many asylum applications in 2017 than the year before. The near closure of the border \"is absolutely unbelievable,\" said Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. \"This means only unaccompanied minors or single men can get in \u2013 no families whatsoever.\" Afghan asylum seeker and his 2 1/2-year-old daughter.\n                \n                    \n                    Soraya Nelson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Afghan asylum seeker and his 2 1/2-year-old daughter. Government denies imposing limits The Hungarian government denies it is imposing any limit, but acknowledged few asylum seekers were entering the country as of late. At a weekly government press conference yesterday in Budapest, Janos Lazar, the head of the Hungarian prime minister's office, said immigration authorities can't help it if asylum seekers don't want to come. \"There is no such rule that they can take in one daily,\" he said. \"But if there's [only] one man standing there, why should 10 customs officer[s] sit there?\" His claim of few takers is improbable given there are thousands of people trying to get into Hungary at the moment from Serbia. UNHCR last month reported 4,196 new refugees, asylum-seekers in migrants in Serbia, of whom only one in nine are looking to stay there. The NPR team interviewed three Hungary-bound asylum seekers in Serbia Friday alone. One Afghan man who was walking with his 2 \u00bd-year-old daughter to buy milk at a grocery store in Subotica, a 20-minute drive from the Serbian border with Hungary, said he's been waiting for four months at a refugee camp funded by Germany and that used to be a dog shelter. \"Everyone is afraid\" \"All of us here are in despair. We are ready to scream, we are so upset. Our fates are unclear,\" he said, asking we not identify him or his family after a Serbian police officer drove up and harassed him for talking to NPR. He, his young daughter and 12-year-old son are trying to reunite with his wife, who is an asylum seeker in Frankfurt and who hasn't seen her children or husband in two years. Fellow camp residents Sheerali Rezaie and his wife, Fatimeh, said they are at their wits' end. Going back to their volatile province of Daykundi in Afghanistan is out of the question and they have no choice but to keep trying to get to Hungary, he said. The couple, who were taking their daily walk outside the compound, are also trying to get to Germany with their two sons. Their eldest son is 23 and living in Munich, where he's applied for asylum, they said. \"This camp is hell,\" Sheerali Rezaie said. \"The food is bad and there's nothing for us here.\" He said now that only two people are being allowed into Hungary, \"Everyone is afraid.

Decline in asylum seekers since September 2015 Timea Kovacs, a Hungarian lawyer who represents refugees in the transit zones, said she's been bombarded with text messages and emails from asylum seekers stranded in Serbia since the near closure began. They \"are very worried,\" especially the families, she said. \"Some of them were waiting there for more than one year.\" She and the refugee advocates say the decline in the number of asylum seekers allowed into Hungary has been gradual since Budapest built its first fence in September 2015 to stem the flow of migrants crossing its formerly open border with Serbia. Since then, the fence has been reinforced multiple times. It is a daunting barrier, outfitted with barbed wire, heat sensors, video cameras, and armed police patrols that quickly detect any attempted breech. Kovacs says most asylum seekers now appear to accept the only way in is to enter the two transit zone camps outside the Hungarian border towns of Tompa and Roezske. But those opportunities are dwindling. In 2016, 60 asylum seekers total were allowed to enter each day into the Hungarian transit zones; then it was reduced to 30. Last year it was 10, and now it's two.",

After five hours of uncharacteristic sniping and emotion, Germany's Social Democrats at a party congress in Bonn on Sunday voted 362-279 to enter into formal talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a new German government. It's a vital step to ending a nearly four-month long political crisis in Germany after last September's elections failed to give any party \u2013 including Merkel's conservatives \u2013 a majority. Previous attempts by the chancellor to join with other German political parties in a governing coalition failed. The Social Democrats had also initially refused to join her, given their historically poor showing during the last elections. Many in the party interpreted the results as voter backlash to the last government, in which they were also partnered with the conservatives. Social Democrats who opposed forming a new government with Merkel argued that the values of their party were at stake and that their leaders shouldn't be afraid of new elections, which were likely if the vote had failed. One key Social Democrat \u2013 former German Labor Minister Andrea Nahles \u2013  finally lost her temper. \"People, we aren't giving up the [party] just because we decide to govern with the others,\" she shouted, referring to the conservatives. \"But  if you think we didn't do it well enough last time in terms of standing up for our positions, as others have told me, you are right.\" She said that will change in the new government. Social Democratic party leader Martin Schulz told delegates that during the upcoming talks, he'd fight for more concessions on health, labor and refugee policies. He also stressed a stable, German government was needed to stand up to right-wing extremists. \"Europe is waiting for a Germany that knows its responsibility for Europe and act decisively,\" Schulz added. According to The Associated Press, Merkel welcomed the decision, saying she hoped to soon build a \"stable government that can tackle the questions of the future.\" Negotiators for both sides say a new German government should be in place by April.",

Czech President Milos Zeman has won the first round of voting in the Czech Republic's presidential election Saturday, but will have to face second-place finisher Jiri Drahos in a runoff election later this month after failing to win a majority of votes. Zeman, 73, who has been president of the central European country since 2013, emerged with 38.6 percent of the vote. He has stoked controversy in parts of Europe with support for Russia's Vladimir Putin and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Zeman was also an early supporter of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. Zeman's challenger for the second round, chemistry professor Jiri Drahos, finished second with 26.6 percent with all votes counted, according to the Czech Statistical Office. Former diplomat Pavel Fischer came in third with 10.2 percent, while the six remaining candidates all finished with less than 10 percent each. The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but the president has the power to appoint the country's prime minister after general elections and has an influential voice in politics. Zeman has called for an end to European Union sanctions against Russia and has proposed holding a Czech referendum on leaving the EU (though he said he would vote to remain). \"While Zeman calls himself a 'eurofederalist,' he's scorned the EU for its determination to accept and integrate Muslim refugees, who, he said, will eventually impose Sharia Law, chop off thieves' hands and stone adulterous women,\" Bloomberg Politics writes. According to The Economist, in October, Zeman held a fake AK-47 inscribed with the words \"For journalists.\" In addition to support for Russia, Zeman wants to improve Czech relations with China. \"Zeman has won backing from poorer and rural voters in the country of 10.6 million by opposing what he calls urban elites detached from the lives of ordinary people,\" Bloomberg writes. The 68-year-old Drahos is the former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences and is seen as pro-European. He supports continuing Czech membership in NATO and the EU. Four other presidential candidates have endorsed Drahos in the runoff election scheduled for Jan. 26 and 27, according to The Guardian.",

He's one of millions of people worldwide who have recently been forced out of their homes from war.\n                \n                    \n                    Felipe Dana/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Suleiman Ibrahim Osman, from Syria, sits outside his tent in the Kawergosk refugee camp in northern Iraq in April. He's one of millions of people worldwide who have recently been forced out of their homes from war. Last year began with an angry phone call about refugees, famously leaked later. The newly inaugurated Donald Trump exploded when Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, asked him to honor a U.S. pledge to resettle some 1,200 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centers. \"This is a stupid deal,\" Trump fumed to an astonished Turnbull. \"This shows me to be a dope.\" A day earlier, the president had signed an executive order temporarily halting the entire U.S. refugee resettlement program and slashed the number of expected arrivals President Obama had set. Trump complained that by honoring the deal with Australia he was \"going to get killed\" politically and abruptly hung up the phone. The damage has already been done. ... The layoffs are already doing structural damage. It's going to take a long time to rebuild. Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq It was the harbinger of policies set in motion to unravel the U.S. refugee resettlement program, an issue that defined Trump's election campaign and has shaped much of his first year in office. Attempts to shut down the program, challenged in the courts, have evolved to more calculated bureaucratic challenges that will have long-term consequences, says Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq. \"This is strategic, that's why it's different from previous anti-immigrant mindsets. It is a conscious effort to deconstruct the system,\" Crocker says. He points to dramatic budget cuts for the nine private, voluntary agencies that for decades have contracted with the State Department to resettle and integrate the refugee population in communities across the U.S. \"The damage has already been done. These agencies run on the slimmest of margins. The layoffs are already doing structural damage. It's going to take a long time to rebuild,\" he says. With Trump's travel ban, plus a scaled back refugee program, 2017 was an assault on immigration by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Quigley, a refugee advocate with Human Rights First, a nongovernmental organization in Washington. \"There are multiple avenues by which they are trying to cut off different kinds of legal immigration,\" she says. In September, President Trump dramatically lowered the cap for refugee admissions in fiscal year 2018 to 45,000. That's well below the annual refugee arrivals under President Barack Obama and even lower than most years during George W. Bush's presidency. Over the course of Trump's first year in office, he's repeatedly said refugee resettlement must be temporarily limited due to national security concerns. When he unveiled his first National Security Strategy on Dec. 18, he cited \"chain migration\" \u2014 meaning any immigration to the U.S. based on family ties to a legal immigrant or refugee \u2014 as a security threat and called for Congress to reverse America's family reunification policy. But rights groups say they see a bigger aim, supported by powerful anti-immigrants groups: to vastly restrict refugee resettlement as part of a wider agenda to limit legal immigration. The Trump administration is \"trying to dismantle the program piece by piece. It's clear they want a smaller program and not include some populations,\" says Jen Smyers, the advocacy director of Church World Service, one of the voluntary agencies that resettle refugees and now face severe budget cuts and office closures. Trump's reductions to the refugee program reportedly put him at odds with the National Security Council, the State Department and the Department of Defense. But it's not considered low enough for conservative anti-refugee groups that wanted the cap set at zero. \"Donald Trump missed a fabulous opportunity to suspend the entire refugee admissions program,\" activist Ann Corcoran complained to Breitbart News. Corcoran runs the Refugee Resettlement Watch website that regularly claims the resettlement program is corrupt and a health and security risk for communities that accept the newcomers. Ed Martin, president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a conservative interest group in St. Louis, gives Trump higher marks. \"The conversation is going in the right direction,\" he says. The president doesn't win every battle but Martin believes Trump is mostly winning on immigration. \"That's the one thing he can't do to his base is to betray them on immigration,\" he says. \"It will be a big deal\" \u2013 which, according to some right-wing groups, includes holding down the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. The final tally for refugee admissions in fiscal year 2018 is likely to be closer to 20,000 rather than the cap of 45,000, based on the recent pace of resettlements. \"We are on the precipice,\" says Quigley of Human Rights First. Critics accuse the Trump administration of \"slowly smothering\" the refugee program and point to a recent announcement that the State Department will shutter dozens of resettlement offices run by voluntary agencies across the country. The agencies are a convenient target, says Becca Heller with the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York. \"Taking down the [independent contractors] is a means to destroy the refugee program,\" she says. Heller's organization has been on the front lines of legal challenges to President Trump's immigration policies, including joining a lawsuit against a travel ban rolled out seven days after his inauguration that caused chaos at international airports. By early March, judges across the country had blocked the ban. \"We are in a pitched battle for the continued existence of the U.S. refugee resettlement program,\" says Heller. \"The numbers are going to be low for the next few years and it's our job to keep them as high as we can.\" The battles are increasingly being fought in the courts. The president's latest legal setback came on Dec. 23, when a Seattle district judge blocked restrictions on refugees from 11 countries, nine of which are Muslim-majority nations. The judge also blocked the Trump administration's suspension of the \"follow-on\" program that reunites family members with refugees already in the U.S. \"The pipeline is open again,\" says Smyers, with Church World Service. That pipeline includes more than 2,000 people who have been waiting for family reunification. Heller says there are limits to the president's powers to end the refugee resettlement program outright. Congress established the program's framework and would need to vote to eliminate it. \"I think [the refugee program is] under attack but I don't think it's over. For one thing, it's the law,\" says Heller, pointing to the 1980 Refugee Act that sets out the provisions for the admission of refugees \"of special humanitarian concern,\" and the 1965 immigration law that emphasizes family reunification. \"The president may be able to temporarily prevent refugees from coming in,\" Heller says. \"It's not going to successfully dismantle the program without Congress.\"",

The Trump administration has surprised and frustrated allies in areas including trade, security, human rights and the environment. Ted Piccone (@piccone_ted) is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. In 2018, the Trump administration made good on its promises to unwind long-standing U.S. commitments to guarantee global security and prosperity. These moves will further weaken U.S. standing and influence in the world and favor China's rise as a rival contender for international supremacy. Since taking office, President Trump consistently has argued for a brand of U.S. leadership in the world that seeks to maximize national sovereignty at the expense of international cooperation. Underscoring each country's unique history, Trump told the United Nations General Assembly in September that \"the United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.\" His current top lieutenants \u2014 John Bolton as national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as secretary of state \u2014 have promulgated this worldview with gusto. As Bolton declared in denouncing the International Criminal Court, \"no committee of foreign nations will tell us how to govern ourselves and defend our freedom.\" Two years into office, the Trump administration has followed through on these proclamations by abandoning international institutions and agreements it believes infringe on national sovereignty. From arms control to migration to postal services, this White House has chosen threats and unilateral withdrawal over principled engagement and negotiation. The effects, intended or otherwise, are coming into focus: growing disappointment and skepticism, even among our friends and allies, regarding U.S. leadership, and an opening for U.S. rivals like China and Russia to fill the vacuum. Here are five ways the United States retreated from the world stage in 2018. Iran nuclear deal Trump was highly critical of President Barack Obama's successful efforts to control Iran's nuclear weapons capacity in exchange, upon verification, for some sanctions relief. Despite a powerful pro-deal coalition that included China, Russia and the European Union, the Trump administration moved the goal posts by demanding additional commitments to contain Iran's hostile actions against its neighbors. After a tepid effort to set new terms, the White House decided to break away from the agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran starting this past summer. In response, Iran has held steady in fulfilling the terms of the nuclear accord while Europe tries to work around the U.S. sanctions. U.N. Human Rights Council The world's top body for addressing human rights violations in every country is, in the words of Secretary Pompeo, \"an exercise in shameless hypocrisy.\" While the United States is right to criticize its bias against Israel and its authoritarian members, the council continues to shine a bright light on severe abuses from Myanmar to North Korea. But when the council turned its attention to U.S. failures to uphold universal human rights norms on issues such as treatment of migrants and poverty, Washington cried foul and walked away. In response, a core group led by countries such as Egypt, Cuba and Saudi Arabia has redoubled efforts to weaken the body's agenda to scrutinize countries' human rights records and protect civil society. China, in particular, has begun going on offense to assert its own brand of state-led capitalism as the better path to human rights and development. Israel-Palestine relations After 70 years of bipartisan support to Palestinian refugees displaced by conflict with Israel, the Trump administration decided in August to stop funding the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. It also cut overall aid to the Palestinian Authority and ordered it to close its Washington office. Claiming to carry a disproportionate share of the burden of caring for an expanding number of Palestinian families, Trump's real intent was to pressure the Palestinians to reach an agreement on peace with Israel. \"The United States was paying them tremendous amounts of money. And I say, 'You'll get money, but we're not paying until you make a deal,'\" Trump told a group of American Jewish leaders. Efforts to close the gap are falling short: The World Food Programme says it will have to cut food aid next year to nearly 200,000 Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank due to U.S. budget cuts. Trump further isolated the United States when he went ahead with moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in May, after all other members of the U.N. Security Council voted to reject the action. Climate change As part of an overall rollback of Obama-era provisions aimed at reducing U.S. carbon emissions, President Trump in 2018 made good on his previous announcement to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, claiming climate change was a hoax promoted by China to hurt our economy. While the actual withdrawal does not take effect until just after the 2020 presidential elections, U.S. officials are quickly rewriting domestic rules to promote fossil fuels in contravention of international commitments. At the recent global session to negotiate a \"rulebook\" for implementing national commitments, a top U.S. delegate drew protests as he made pronouncements favoring \"clean coal\" and shale gas. Meanwhile, at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina in November, Trump was the only leader who did not reiterate a commitment to climate action, despite new reports by leading scientists that catastrophic warming will begin to hit in 12 years unless carbon emissions are dramatically cut. U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria U.S. soldiers gather for a briefing during a combined joint patrol rehearsal in Manbij, Syria.

Last week, President Trump said the Islamic State was defeated and that U.S. troops would withdraw, prompting criticism from allies who said the extremist group remains a threat and pulling out now would lead to its resurgence. The latest demonstration of President Trump's strong instincts to unload the burden of collective security on others (friends and foes) came on Dec. 19, when he declared victory over ISIS terrorists and ordered approximately 2,000 U.S. troops to cease action in Syria immediately and return home. The hasty decision directly contradicted public pronouncements by his most senior advisers that U.S. troops would stay and left close allies like the United Kingdom and France, which also have troops deployed in theater, dismayed and vulnerable. The result was, by most accounts, a win for U.S. rivals Russia and Iran, which now have a stronger hand in the region, as well as for Syria, ISIS and Turkey, and a loss for U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia. The decision has wider negative repercussions for U.S. reliability with its long-standing partners, prompting Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to resign. The Trump bluster to shake up the international order in the name of extracting better deals for the United States may yield some new agreements that further narrow national interests. But the costs to U.S. influence are already proving very high. U.S. friends are confused and frustrated with Trump's disrespect and unpredictability, and rivals are eagerly exploiting the opening to their advantage. The continued rise of Trump transactionalism in the name of \"America First\" means we may be entering an inexorable slide into geopolitical competition the likes of which we have never seen before.",

Two land border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea were reopened for the first time in nearly 20 years.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption National flags are seen along the road to Eritrea in Zalambessa, northern Ethiopia, in September before a border reopening ceremony. Two land border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea were reopened for the first time in nearly 20 years. About a mile from the Eritrean border in Zalambessa, Ethiopia, there's a small building made of corrugated metal. There's not much inside, except for some sleeping mats and clay pots for coffee. But dozens of Eritreans have made it into a home, while they wait for the Red Cross to take them to refugee camps. Over the past year, Ethiopia has stunned the world with its democratic reforms and warming relationship with neighboring Eritrea. The two countries have formally ended their 20-year conflict and reopened land crossings to allow people and goods to move freely between them. Now, a big question fills the air in the region: Will the dramatic transformation in Ethiopia spread to Eritrea, which is often referred to as the North Korea of Africa? Sirak, 17, came to Ethiopia from Eritrea more than a month after the border opened in September. He wants only his first name used because he is afraid Eritrean authorities could seek retribution for his actions or criticism. Now, he spends his time walking around Zalambessa, marveling at the lack of troops on the streets and the frankness of conversations. He says his family's home in Eritrea was demolished by the government, and police wanted to know why they had built the house without permission. \"The police were coming every day, so everyone was hiding in the bush,\" he said. Forced evictions and home demolitions have been a well-documented form of political retribution in Eritrea, whose government has never held an election and has been accused of brutal human rights abuses almost since its independence in 1993. Asked if he believes things can change in Eritrea, Sirak demurs. \"It's impossible,\" he says. \"It won't change.\" Agents of change Sirak appears meek and fearful compared with today's Ethiopians, who are celebrating their newfound freedoms with swagger. Long under authoritarian rule, now Ethiopians can gather in groups to talk freely. They can criticize their government without fear they'll be arrested. Many Ethiopians along the border say Eritrea has to change also. They say when Eritreans come to Ethiopia, they will experience a freer society and they will demand the same at home. \"It's not fair to make that comparison,\" says Salem Solomon, an Eritrean-American journalist who covers the two countries for Voice of America. Ethiopia and Eritrea have completely different political systems, she says. Salem lived in Eritrea until 2007; she went through military training and worked for the Information Ministry before she came to the United States. In Eritrea, says Salem, the government is omnipresent \u2014 the command economy and mandatory military service are just some of the ways it controls people's lives. Salem says the government stays in power by doling out unpredictable punishments. That creates an atmosphere of intense fear. A man holds national flags of Eritrea (left) and Ethiopia as he waits for the arrival of Eritrea's president at the airport in Gondar, nothern Ethiopia, in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Eduardo Soteras/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A man holds national flags of Eritrea (left) and Ethiopia as he waits for the arrival of Eritrea's president at the airport in Gondar, nothern Ethiopia, in November. \"Even those who feel like they are so loyal and [are] vocal [about their] support for the government,\" even they, she says, are not safe. Awet Weldemichael, who studies Eritrea at Queen's University in Canada, says another reason to be skeptical about any potential uprising is that Eritrea has been \"hemorrhaging\" youth. Eritreans have been leaving the country by the thousands since it gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Scholars estimate that a third of Eritreans live outside the country. And since the borders with Ethiopia reopened in September, about 10,000 Eritreans have sought asylum in Ethiopia. \"And so in light of that ... the agents of change are not there,\" says Awet. If change is to come, he says, it is unlikely to happen the way it did in Ethiopia, forced by years of protests. Instead, if change comes, it will most likely have to be pushed from the top. Awet does warn, however, that Eritrea is such a closed country, it's hard to make predictions. \"What I can tell you confidently,\" he says, \"is that the current course is unsustainable for Eritrea.\" In November, the United Nations lifted sanctions against Eritrea. But that's unlikely to help, because it was mostly a weapons ban. Eritrea remains one of the poorest countries on the continent. Most of its people live below the poverty line, and 80 percent are subsistence farmers in a land susceptible to droughts. Over the years, Awet says, the population has been decimated by migration and by mass incarceration, and many helpful institutions have been destroyed or have ceased to exist. A better life In Badme, a border town about 200 miles west of Zalambessa, the border crossing is not yet officially open. Eritrean officials have warned that the road into Ethiopia still contains land mines. But one Eritrean mother made her way across anyway. She was trying to hitch a ride back to Eritrea, so she sat right on the border, caressing the cheek of her 9-year-old boy. She's too afraid of the Eritrean government to share her name. Seven months ago, while she was cooking, her son ran away to Ethiopia with a friend. As soon as it became possible, she packed up her things and came to look for him. She found him at a refugee camp outside Badme. She says her boy was not the only kid fleeing Eritrea. She has seen many small children leave their homes and families behind. \"They're too young to know anything about the government or democracy,\" she says. \"But what they know is that there is a better life outside of Eritrea.\"",

That message came in a flurry of recent tweets in which the unpopular Maduro seeks to rally support from his long-suffering population for his latest remedy against total collapse: gold. For years, Venezuela largely depended on revenues from its vast oil reserves, but production has about halved since 2015, compelling Maduro to cast his eye toward his country's other natural riches in a desperate quest for revenue. He's engaged in a chaotic attempt to revive and expand mining within a huge sweep of tropical jungle called the Orinoco Mining Arc, prompting the U.S. government to impose sanctions that specifically target Venezuela's gold trade. Wildcat miners and other impoverished Venezuelans have flooded into the area in search of jobs and income. Battles for control over gold mines between criminal organizations, Colombian guerrillas and Venezuelan security forces have erupted, causing what the International Crisis Group calls \"a spate of mass killings.\" Local media have reported at least 10 people killed in the last two months alone. It's believed many more deaths go unreported because the location is remote, communications are poor, and people are fearful of reprisals. Venezuela's economy is in free fall. The International Monetary Fund estimates hyperinflation could hit 1 million percent this year. Much of the population lives in extreme poverty. There are dire shortages of food, medicine, electricity, water and \u2014 despite all those reserves \u2014 gasoline. Venezuelans are fleeing their homeland in droves, mostly to neighboring countries: 3 million have left since 2015, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Yet their nation is known to have some of the world's largest gold deposits, many of which are beneath the soil of the \"mining arc,\" along with diamonds, coltan, bauxite and other riches. Orinoco flow The arc is a wide band of rough forested land that runs south of the Orinoco River and stretches across the country's midriff, from Guyana to Colombia. It covers more than 43,000 square miles \u2014 slightly larger than Tennessee \u2014 and comprises about one-eighth of Venezuela's land area. In February 2016, Maduro created a \"strategic development zone\" within the arc and claimed that \"the projections of experts\" indicate the area could contain more than 7,000 metric tons of gold. When Maduro talks about Venezuela's gold mining, it sounds like a smooth-running world in which government and mining outfits operate joint ventures, in compliance with environmental and labor laws. The reality could hardly be more different. A miner looks for gold at La Culebra gold mine in El Callao, which sits in Venezuela's Orinoco Mining Arc.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Barreto/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A miner looks for gold at La Culebra gold mine in El Callao, which sits in Venezuela's Orinoco Mining Arc. \"These miners have no labor rights at all,\" says Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"They're not protected from any of the dangerous elements \u2014 for example, the mercury that's used in the mining.\" He adds that miners are \"also severely at risk of being shot dead: Mining communities have phenomenally high homicide rates, even by the extraordinary high levels that we see in the rest of Venezuela.\" Getting reliable information is difficult because the area is highly dangerous for outsiders and locals are often too frightened to talk. Yet media and human rights activists portray a chaotic scenario in which armed gangs, fighters from Colombia's National Liberation Army rebel group and elements of Venezuela's military vie with one another for the control of mines, and use extortion and violence to co-opt independent miners. \"It's the Wild West. I mean, it can't be overstated just how lawless a lot of the territory is in this Orinoco mining belt,\" says Geoff Ramsey, Venezuela specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy organization for human rights. Much of the gold is smuggled out of the country. Anxious to shore up loyalty \u2014 after several failed plots to overthrow him \u2014 Maduro has allowed commanders from Venezuela's military to get involved. \"In mining areas, we see the armed forces of Venezuela acting as a kind of gatekeeper,\" says Ramsey. \"They charge criminal groups for access to the mines.\" Members of a Venezuelan military agency that transports valuables put gold bars into an armored vehicle to be taken to Venezuela's Central Bank, at the Carlota military airport in Caracas, March 1.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariana Cubillos/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of a Venezuelan military agency that transports valuables put gold bars into an armored vehicle to be taken to Venezuela's Central Bank, at the Carlota military airport in Caracas, March 1. Environmental groups are deeply concerned. \"They don't observe any kind of environmental protection,\" says Gustavo Montes, a Venezuela-based ecologist and environmental studies consultant. He estimates that, in 2016 alone, some 84,000 acres within the Orinoco arc were lost to deforestation. Trump's sanctions Maduro's attempt to dig his way out of trouble has now run into opposition from the Trump administration, which considers him a socialist dictator and is pressing for his ouster. On Nov. 1, the United States announced sanctions targeting Venezuela's gold sector and banning U.S. entities and citizens from participating in it. One week earlier, Marshall Billingslea, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, provided insights into the administration's position on this. He told an audience at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C., that Maduro has \"turned to the wholesale, rampant destruction of the environment through strip mining on a massive scale of gold and other precious metals in the Orinoco Belt.\" Without the approval of Venezuela's opposition-led National Assembly (which Maduro has entirely sidelined) or local indigenous communities, the Venezuelan leader has \"promoted and promulgated a full-scale gold rush,\" said Billingslea. He continued: \"We need to express moral outrage over what's being done to the environment, what's being done to the indigenous populations, and the fact that this gold is being removed from the country without any of the customary safeguards on it that would ensure that the funds are accounted for and properly catalogued as belonging to the Venezuelan people.\" The Trump administration's move has been met with defiance by Maduro. The Venezuelan leader announced his government next year intends to generate $5 billion from the Orinoco gold mines. Industry analysts view this as wildly optimistic. \"I don't think that's possible,\" says Christopher Aaron, a former CIA counterterrorism officer who is now an analyst with Gold-Eagle, which researches international precious metal trades. \"The process of bringing a new mine from gold in the ground, to gold being sent to a vault somewhere is usually about 10 years. So, unless they were preparing for that in the previous decade, I think this is mostly talk,\" Aaron says. Simpatico with Turkey Maduro can take comfort from the fact that \u2014 however much gold his government eventually extracts \u2014 he has a likely buyer: Venezuela's new friend and ally, Turkey. Turkey has recently become one of the world's largest gold buyers. This year it acquired more than 23 tons of Venezuelan gold, worth an estimated $900 million. But it doesn't fix the decline in oil production, which is the country's real lifeblood. Benjamin Gedan, Wilson Center's Latin American Program This is further evidence of the warming relationship between Maduro and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan was among the first to congratulate Maduro when secured a new term in May, in an election condemned as fraudulent by much of the international community. But as Venezuelans struggle to survive day by day, two questions emerge. The first is, will U.S. sanctions on its gold make any difference? Opinions are divided. Some observers fear they will drive Venezuelan officials \u2014 including the military \u2014 to resort further to the black market, where they're already profiting from currency, food and other scams. Others say sanctions are already making an impact, citing a recent Reuters report saying that $550 million worth of Venezuelan gold bars are now stranded in the vaults of the Bank of England. And the other question: Even if Venezuela musters the annual $5 billion in gold its leader dreams of, what are the chances that can save his country from disaster? \"None,\" replies Benjamin Gedan, a senior adviser to the Wilson Center's Latin American Program. \"If the Venezuelans generate a few billion more from gold, and the U.S. is ineffective in stopping it, that'll maybe help them continue to service their debt for another quarter or two.\" \"But it doesn't fix the decline in oil production, which is the country's real lifeblood. The only thing that can save Venezuela is an extraordinary increase in oil prices, and a complete reversal in its production trend. \"Neither of those things are likely.\"",

After more than three months in jail and last-minute confusion over his release, Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi photojournalist and activist whose imprisonment drew international criticism, is a free man. A few days after Alam was granted bail by Bangladesh's High Court, he reportedly walked out of jail around 8:20 p.m. local time, after a \"daylong confusion\" involving authorities saying Alam's address did not match the one listed on jail documents, according to The Daily Star. The 63-year-old was arrested on Aug. 5 and charged with \"spreading propaganda and false information against the government\" after he publicly criticized Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government for its violent response to student protests that began over road safety. In an Al Jazeera TV interview prior to his arrest, Alam said the protests stemmed from a long-simmering anger over the government and a \"never-ending list\" of grievances, including gagging the media, extrajudicial killings and widespread corruption. He also said that Hasina had \"no credibility\" and that the current government would lose if free and fair elections were held. Anger over his arrest sparked international calls to \"Free Shahidul\" \u2014 including from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Committee to Protect Journalists and U.N. human rights experts.

He has also covered stories elsewhere in the region, including places rarely visited by journalists, such as the Maldives.\" \"A lot of the work that I do makes me unpopular with my government,\" the photographer told NPR in 2011.

The three politicians are vying to become Chancellor Angela Merkel's successor as CDU party chair in December. After 13 years as Germany's chancellor and 18 years as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Angela Merkel announced the end of her political career in October. She will step down as CDU leader next month, while remaining head of the government until 2021. Minutes after Merkel's Oct. 29 announcement, the fight \u2014 so far, a very polite one \u2014 over her succession began. The next CDU head will also likely become the party's next candidate for chancellor. The new leader will be chosen by delegates at the CDU party conference in Hamburg on Dec. 7. Until then, candidates are crisscrossing the country, trying to drum up as much support as possible. The party has planned a series of eight regional conferences, allowing the candidates to make their case. The most recent polls suggest a tight race between Friedrich Merz, a conservative businessman and former CDU politician, and Merkel loyalist Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, assigning better chances to Kramp-Karrenbauer. Jens Spahn, Merkel's health minister, is running a distant third. \"The fact that the members have a choice between three excellent candidates stimulates the party a lot,\" Paul Ziemiak, chairman of the CDU's youth wing, Junge Union, tells NPR. \"There is much discussion going on at the base and we benefit from that.\" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's favorite Nicknamed \"AKK\" \u2014 and \"Mini-Merkel\" by her critics \u2014 Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is considered the chancellor's favorite candidate to succeed her. A recent poll shows Kramp-Karrenbauer with a clear lead and support from the party base. A former prime minister of Germany's Saarland state, Kramp-Karrenbauer impressed Merkel by winning re-election in March 2017 from an almost hopeless position, defending her position and even gaining new votes when a change of government was widely expected. German Chancellor Angela Merkel chats with CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in Berlin last month. Kramp-Karrenbauer is among three leading candidates seeking to run the party next month.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption German Chancellor Angela Merkel chats with CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in Berlin last month. Kramp-Karrenbauer is among three leading candidates seeking to run the party next month. The 56-year-old became general secretary of the CDU in February and has garnered support among the party base in recent months during a national listening tour. She emphasizes social issues and equal opportunity, and recently referred to poverty in Germany as a \"social explosive device.\" Considered closest among the frontrunners to Merkel's politics, Kramp-Karrenbauer is now trying to differentiate herself from the chancellor, especially when it comes to Merkel's deeply unpopular refugee policies. \"The one big reservation about her is her having worked very closely with the chancellor \u2014 that's her drawback,\" says Werner Weidenfeld, a political scientist at the University of Munich. \"After the era of Merkel, people are longing for a new era.\" But J\u00fcrgen Falter, a political scientist at the University of Mainz, believes that Kramp-Karrenbauer has the best chance at winning the leadership race because of her strong support among party delegates, even though Merz may have broader CDU support. \"If all of the CDU members could vote, probably Friedrich Merz would have the best chances,\" he says. \"But among the delegates of the party congress, there may be more AKK supporters.\" A comeback for Friedrich Merz? Merz, a financial expert seen as upholding conservative and traditional values, is a familiar face on Germany's political stage. He quit active politics 10 years ago, after a power struggle with Merkel, who sidelined him in 2002 as parliamentary floor leader. Seven years later, he opted not to run for reelection. Merz, 62, has had a strained relationship with Merkel ever since. A strong proponent of economic liberalism, he turned to the business world and for the past decade has primarily worked as a corporate lawyer and chaired several supervisory boards. As chairman of BlackRock's German asset-management unit, he has been in the spotlight and under fire of late. German prosecutors are investigating the investment corporation for controversial tax transactions from 2007 to 2011, a period that precedes Merz's time there. \"He promises an end to the Merkel course, has a touch of charisma and promises neo-liberal business modernism with a firm anchorage in a traditional conservative Leitkultur [guiding culture],\" Wolfgang Merkel, a political scientist in Berlin (and no relation to Angela Merkel), tells NPR. \"He embodies the correction of the Merkel course of the recent years with most credibility.\" But Weidenfeld says Merz may face difficulty due to his association with BlackRock: \"His past in the business world, being chairman of the board at BlackRock, makes his candidacy unpredictable. In the end, the way the media covers his past of working in the economy, will determine his outcome. If this remains the top issue \u2014 even if he never got his hands dirty himself, he will not be able to win the race.\" From the U.S. perspective, Weidenfeld believes Merz could be the best candidate to succeed Angela Merkel: \"He is an expert on the transatlantic relationship, believes it to be the key link ... concerning world politics. He does everything to establish a reciprocity of perspectives and brings along many years of experience. It is likely that Merz would take a step toward the U.S. on many issues.\" Jens Spahn, the young conservative Spahn has distinguished himself as a conservative critic of Merkel, while serving in her government as health minister. The openly gay 38-year-old, who married last December, has polarized opinion, even within his own party, with his statements about refugee policies. He was among the first politicians to openly criticize Merkel's immigration policy and complained last year that \"too many people believe that every other culture is an enrichment per se.\" This may cause problems for his candidacy, analysts say, because anyone who wants to win the majority of the party congress must integrate all wings. Spahn has made a poor showing in polls so far. \"The reason for his bad showings in the opinion polls can be found in the role he had when Merkel was still in full power,\" Weidenfeld observes. \"He got known as somebody who openly dissociated himself from the chancellor and frequently criticized her. That momentum once made him big, but vanished with Merkel announcing the end of her career.\" A more conservative, isolationist CDU? No matter who succeeds the chancellor, political scientist Wolfgang Merkel foresees an increasingly conservative direction for the CDU. \"There will be no fundamental change of the general course, but a correction,\" he explains. \"More tradition, less liberal modernity, a more business-friendly policy. More isolationist policy against refugees and migrants. No new initiatives in European politics, less social democracy, more traditional conservatism.\" But when it comes to relations with the U.S., he expects no big changes: \"The U.S. will continue to be of crucial importance,\" he says. \"The transatlanticists could become even more dominant and leading in the German foreign policy. Merz or Spahn are more likely to deal more easily and impartially with an unpredictable U.S. President Trump than Angela Merkel did in the past, [with her] strained personal relationship with him.\"",

Wei Fenghe stand as the national anthems are played before their meeting at the Pentagon on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and China's Defense Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe stand as the national anthems are played before their meeting at the Pentagon on Friday. Two new reports on the U.S. military were released Wednesday, and they offered contradictory messages. One from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University calculated that the U.S. has spent, or is obligated to spend, $5.9 trillion for wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since 2001. The U.S. has fallen far short of its goals in these wars, and many of these costs are largely hidden because they don't fall directly under the Pentagon, the report added. The other report, by the National Defense Strategy Commission, a group of 12 former Republican, Democratic and national security officials, said U.S. security is \"at greater risk than at any time in decades.\" It urged a ramping up of military preparedness on multiple fronts. It warned that the U.S. could potentially lose a war with Russia or China. The Brown University report said that 480,000 people have been killed as a direct result of the wars in which the U.S. has been involved. More than 10 million civilians have been displaced in their home countries or become refugees abroad. The U.S. is now conducting counterterrorism operations in 76 countries, according to the report by Neta Crawford of Boston University, who is co-director of Brown's Cost of War Project. The institute has been making calculations on the costs of the wars since 2011. The Pentagon's figures on war expenditures are much lower, but these numbers cover only direct military spending. In March, the Pentagon put the figure at $1.8 trillion since 2001 \u2014 or about one-third of the number that Crawford calculated. She has included in her estimate counterterrorism spending domestically by the Department of Homeland Security; interest payments to cover the government's borrowing costs; and estimates of current and future medical care for wounded veterans. \"There is no strategy to end the wars other than more of the same, in the hope that one day Iraqi and Afghan security forces will be able to fend for themselves,\" she said. \"In addition, the U.S. has escalated its involvement with wars and counterterror operations in Africa and Yemen. Nor is there a strategy for responsibly paying for these wars,\" Crawford added. Calls for an upgrade Meanwhile, the National Defense Strategy Commission unveiled its report on what it sees as serious shortcomings in the U.S. military. The report said little about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the threat posed by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Instead, it focused on traditional big-power rivalries, concentrating on China and Russia. \"The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia,\" the report said. \"The United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.\" The commission was created by Congress to evaluate the Trump administration's defense strategy, which was released earlier this year. The report is supportive of the strategy and its focus on nation-versus-nation rivalries, rather than counterterrorism. The commission also issued more than 30 recommendations, and most or all would require increased spending. They include: \u2014 Congress should increase the defense budget by 3 to 5 percent per year, and the military should build a larger force than the one that exists today. \u2014  The U.S. should maintain \"favorable military balances\" against China in Asia and Russia in Europe. \u2014  The commission supports Trump's plan to modernize the country's nuclear arsenal. \u2014  It called for a high-level commission to review the U.S. military's cyber policy. Record military spending President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have given the Pentagon substantial budget increases, with the military authorized to spend a record $716 billion in the current fiscal year. Trump and many senior military officials say the hike was needed to recover from years of budget constraints that limited military spending. However, last week's midterm elections will put the Democrats in control of the House starting in January, and they're considered likely to limit military spending going forward. In addition, the White House has called on the Pentagon to trim spending as part of a governmentwide effort to gain control of a rapidly expanding budget deficit. U.S. military spending remains the highest in the world by a huge margin. The U.S. currently spends about three times what China spends annually, and more than 10 times what Russia spends.",

Barbra Streisand has two Oscars, eight Grammys and millions of album sales. She could probably read and record the stops along the route of the D train through the Bronx and get a No. 1. But with her latest release, she's done something different: Her new album, Walls, addresses songs \u2014 including some of her own originals \u2014 to the president of the United States. Hear her conversation with NPR's Scott Simon at the audio link, and read an edited transcript below. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Scott Simon: Why was it important to you to do this album? Barbra Streisand: Because I could express my thoughts and feelings at a time when I was feeling sad and heartbroken about what's happening to our country. And I'm so grateful that I have music in my life that gives me the chance to express my feelings through my work. I gather the song \"Don't Lie to Me\" is not about a busted love affair. No. I started off trying to create that so that more people could relate to it in a way \u2014 lovers who go through this all the time. But it's like that joke: A woman walks in and her husband is in bed with another woman. She gasps, and he says, \"Well, who are you going to believe: me or your lying eyes?\" I guess it's about lies: The lies that are coming out of this administration are very unpleasing, unsettling. Maybe that means so much to me because I was lied to as a child. I've based my whole career on telling the truth. Do you have any concern that people who love your singing might not like the message of this album? That's true, and they're entitled to do that. I made this album to express my heartbreak after this last election. I am for discussion, for agreeing to disagree, but in a civil discourse. You said you felt especially strongly about the truth because somebody lied to you when you were a child. What happened? One summer, I was sent away to a religious camp. I had left a home in Williamsburg, where we lived in an apartment with my mother's parents; I slept in the bed with my mother in another bedroom and my brother had a folding cot that came out at night. When my mother came to pick me up from that camp, she didn't tell me that this man in the car turned out to be my new stepfather \u2014 which I was never introduced to or told about \u2014 and we were taken to a different apartment, a project in Flatbush. That's the kind of story. I just think that the truth is so powerful \u2014 truth between people, truth in government. Tell us the truth. This album has a beautiful version of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" that works its way into Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World,\" that song written by George Douglas and George David Weiss. Why did you include these songs? Because I believe in hope. I believe in goodness, I believe in kindness. I believe that we can even manifest what we imagine. I did that as a young child: I imagined what life could be for myself, and it came true. I think imagination is so powerful, and this is one of the most beautiful songs. It's a great peace anthem. This has been an especially tough week and a half for the United States, with pipe bomb explosives in the mail, U.S. troops being sent to the border and then, of course, the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Oh gosh. That's why I'm so ... He gave my depression a depression. It's been a horrible week. Haven't a lot of American Jews believed that anti-Semitic attacks were only in the past for America? No, no. Anti-semitism is rising. It's so sad for our world to have to demonize a certain group of people. It's immigrants as well. Jews, every Friday night, believe in taking a stranger in and feeding the stranger. They believe in kindness, and they believe in helping the refugees, like they were helped when they came over to America. We're all immigrants, aren't we, except if you're a Native American. I mean, my grandparents came from Russia and from Austria. Where did your grandparents come from? On the Jewish side, Spain; on the Irish side, Belfast. That's right. If we just look at ourselves as all being immigrants, we can accept each other more easily, love each other.",

President Trump will visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday to show support for victims of the city's deadly synagogue shooting. A White House spokeswoman dismissed suggestions that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a hostile climate in the country. She said Trump won't shy away from drawing distinctions with Democrats in the final week before the midterm elections. \"The American people reject hatred, bigotry, prejudice and violence,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders declared, two days after a gunman shot and killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. \"We are a nation that believes in religious liberty, tolerance, and respect.\" In a voice breaking with emotion, Sanders noted that Trump's daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren are Jewish. \"Anti-Semitism is a plague to humanity,\" Sanders said. \"We all have a duty to confront anti-Semitism in all its forms and everywhere and anywhere it appears.\" Trump has drawn criticism in some quarters for his outspoken attacks on Democrats and a caravan of Central American migrants traveling toward the U.S. The suspect in the Pittsburgh shooting had complained on social media about an influx of refugees. Sanders rejected the suggestion that Trump's divisive language might have inspired the synagogue shooter, or a Florida man accused of sending homemade pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. \"The only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out,\" she said. Trump temporarily toned down his campaign rhetoric in response to the pipe-bomb investigation and the Pittsburgh shooting. But with just over a week before the votes are counted in the midterm elections, Sanders said the president would continue to push back vigorously against his political opponents. \"The president is going to continue to draw contrasts,\" Sanders said, noting that Democrats had been equally vocal in criticizing Trump. \"The president is going to continue to fight back.\" She also defended the president's attacks on the news media, which Trump has accused of fueling division in society, and insisted Trump has played an important, healing role in times of national tragedy. \"Every time our country has experienced the type of heartache and pain that we have over the last week, this is a president who has risen to that occasion,\" Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "Merkel had told her party she won't run for re-election as its chairwoman. Her decision comes after the CDU suffered heavy losses in regional elections. She's held the chancellor post for 18 years.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: In Germany, Angela Merkel has announced that she will not seek another term as chancellor and will also not seek re-election as head of her Christian Democratic Party. That is a post she has held for 18 years. And the decision to step aside signals the beginning of the end of Merkel's political career and tenure as the most powerful woman in European politics. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is one of our correspondents based in Europe. She has covered much of Merkel's political career and joins me now. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So a significant moment here. Merkel speaking to the nation about her decision. What is she saying? NELSON: She sounded very steady, and she looked a little sad. But she said that, as she said before, she was not born chancellor, that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as chancellor for the past 13 years and as head of her party for the last 18. But that it was time to move aside, to listen to what citizens had to say. And that is that they have a lack of faith in her government. And so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation. GREENE: Well, I feel like you and I have talked countless times about Merkel and some of the challenges and calling her at times embattled. I mean, she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in 2015, right? So why is - why have we arrived at this moment now? What's different? NELSON: Well, there's been a steady chipping away at her support basically on a national level but also in regional elections. This has really dogged her and her party and her allies, especially - the most recent ones we can talk about were last night's election - or yesterday's election, I should say, in Hesse, which is where Frankfurt is, the big financial center, and also two weeks before in Bavaria. Some serious losses where in last night's or - the count basically - her party barely is hanging onto power with a coalition of greens. And in Bavaria, they - I mean, it's also really shaken up the Bavarian allies of Mrs. Merkel, which are the Christian Social Union members - the Bavarian conservatives, if you will. GREENE: Soraya, I mean, she's been so central to European politics. It's hard to imagine European politics without her. I mean, what is the reaction so far to this decision? NELSON: Well, the stocks have gone down. I mean, this is something that's definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe. People are - they knew this was coming. But again, she had never announced it until today. So this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels, for example, to push through its plans to try and integrate the union more. This is probably not going to help the Brexit situation - those negotiations that are going on. I mean, she is the strongest leader there. And she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus. And she's in an incredibly weakened position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until 2021. You know, she's not going to seek re-election until - in 2021 and that she's basically going to remain in power until then. But she's a lame duck at this point. GREENE: Any talk of who her likely successor might be? NELSON: Well, even though she hasn't really said who she wants, what political insiders have told various media is her - the CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. She's a 56-year-old who's - someone who many would like to see take her place. But there are also other people like the health minister, who's much more conservative and actually a good friend of the U.S. ambassador to Berlin, and also a political opponent of her's, Friedrich Merz, who has not been into politics for a while now. So yeah. So they're - it's a big open question mark as to who's next. GREENE: All right. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson on this big announcement from Angela Merkel. Soraya, thanks as always.

In the wake of Saturday's murder of 11 Jewish worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, and after the recent wave of explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats, groups that promote tolerance are calling on politicians to tone down hyper-partisan rhetoric and ad hominem attacks they say are contributing to a national atmosphere of division, fear and even hatred. \"The reality is words have consequences,\" says George Selim, the Anti-Defamation League's senior vice president of programs. The ADL calls the killings at Tree of Life synagogue the single deadliest attack on American Jewry. The group has been sounding the alarm for months on what it says is a historic 60 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents from 2016 to 2017, the biggest single-year increase in reported anti-Jewish hate since they started tracking such data almost 40 years ago. The reality is words have consequences. George Selim, Anti-Defamation League \"When anti-Semitic rhetoric or dog whistling or rhetoric that's of an extreme nature is really allowed in our public square without condemnation \u2014 especially from the highest leaders who are public officials  \u2014 it really gives the green light to anti-Semites, bigots, xenophobes and Islamophobes to keep spouting it and acting on it,\" Selim says. \"And that's what we saw at two different occasions in this past last week both in Pittsburgh and with the pipe bombings in New York and elsewhere.\" Another recent ADL report shows that online attacks on Jews have continued unabated during this year's mid-term elections; what was once relatively rare online harassment is today commonplace. Part of the recent rise in anti-Semitism is grounded in hostility to the political rise of Barack Obama, the nation's first African-American president, says Emory University's Deborah Lipstadt. \"I never say that President Trump and those around him created this, they didn't. But they lit a fire under it\" the religion professor told NPR on tonight's All Things Considered. \"Now we're seeing that the online harassment can move further over to real danger,\" she says. Tacit wink to extremists Others say a viciously partisan political culture today, where personal attacks on character, motive and even background often supplant substantive policy debate, has given a tacit wink to extremist elements. \"I think it's important to remember that, while violent far-right ideology appears to live on the fringes, it is very informed by the mainstream acts of intolerance,\" says Tony McAleer, a former organizer for the White Aryan Resistance (WAR). McAleer co-founded of the group Life After Hate that works to reform racists. President Trump has called for unity and forcefully denounced both the synagogue murders and the recent mailing of explosive devices to prominent Democrats. A lot of the stuff was there before but now there's a boldness in it, people feel that they don't need to self-censor. It's like the mask has been pulled off. Tony McAleer, Life After Hate But the ADL and others have pointed out that public anti-Semitism and intolerance have gone up markedly in the wake of Trump's election win. At last year's infamous Unite the Right rally that turned violent in Charlottesville, Va., neo-Nazis paraded with torches chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" Afterwards the president famously took criticism for saying there was \"blame on both sides\" and \"good people\" on both sides. \"The president has been stoking the fires that have contributed to these violent white nationalist attacks, with his divisive statements and with his immigration policies,\" says Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy. \"He has a responsibility to undo the damage now, and so do other officials in his administration.\" George Soros Republicans, including the president, have recently accused Democratic party donor and philanthropist George Soros, who is Jewish, of backing, among other events, the caravan of Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border. There is no evidence behind these claims. Soros was one of the Trump critics targeted by mail bombs last week by an avid Trump supporter. Today Soros continues to be a target of a dizzying array of conspiracy theories as well as ongoing GOP midterm attack ads. Earlier this month Trump also alleged that the 88-year-old billionaire is paying people to attend his rallies. Several conservative groups, including the Republican House campaign committee, are running ads on Facebook that feature Soros as a nefarious master financing an array of Democratic efforts, according to data from the social media company and reported by the Washington Post. \"The slurs against George Soros that Republicans continue to invoke are dredged up from centuries of nauseating anti-Semitism,\" is how Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, put it in a recent statement. \"They must stop trying to divide America and help us lower the national temperature. For years now, Donald Trump has been calling for the jailing of his critics and has lauded violence against journalists. The revolting 'Lock Her Up' chants have stoked the flames of hate.\" No more self-censorship \"A lot of the stuff was there before but now there's a boldness in it, people feel that they don't need to self-censor,\" says Tony McAleer. \"It's like the mask has been pulled off,\" he says, adding, \"People are expressing themselves in ways that they never did before and the general political climate is getting more aggressive, more physical.\" McAleer says when he worked as a recruiter for hate groups, he ran a computer operated voice mail system that he notes, \"was primarily anti-Semitic. I was also a Holocaust denier,\" he says, \"I was very well-steeped in the ideology of the suspected shooter [in Pittsburgh].\" It was the birth of his children and empathy from a Jew that helped pull McAleer out of his bubble of hate and anger. \"A Jewish man helped me de-radicalize. It was the compassion from him that helped me get rid of the ideology,\" he says. Selim, who formerly headed up the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to counter violent extremism, left government just over a year ago, citing hyper-partisanship and divisions that he laments have only gotten deeper and more vitriolic since then. \"It's time for responsible leaders and individuals of all faiths, races and ideologies to speak out clearly and forcefully against the anti-Semitism that we've seen in the last week and the scapegoating and bigotry that's really been on the rise in this country in the last several years,\" Selim says.",

Journalist Eli Saslow says there's a \"straight line\" between the suspect charged with 29 counts related to the deaths of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and the views of the white nationalist movement. In the \"horrific hierarchy of white nationalist beliefs,\" Jews are considered the \"primary enemy,\" Saslow says. \"Throughout the history of the white nationalist movement, we've seen more attacks on synagogues, more bombing threats on Jewish schools than we have almost any other demographic group.\" Saslow's most recent book, Rising Out of Hatred, chronicles the life of Derek Black, a young man who was once a leading voice in the white nationalist movement but has since denounced his views. Saslow says that he spoke to Black after the synagogue shooting, and that Black feels \"heartbroken\" by the incident. \"Every time something like this happens, [Black] feels in small ways culpable,\" Saslow says. \"He wonders how much of the messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism plays into incidents like this.\" For his part, Saslow was saddened \u2014 but not surprised \u2014 by the attack. \"It seems like there's a certain kind of inevitability. ... I don't think that this will be the last one, and I think probably, like a lot of us, I sort of live in fear and with a sense of dread of when is when is the next horrible thing like this going to happen?,\" Saslow says.

Mexico's National Migration Institute says the Mexican government has processed more than 1,000 refugee claims in the past three days. But that's just a fraction of the caravan that continues to press on. Evaluations of the caravan's size have varied. But according to at least one estimate, upward of 7,000 migrants, including families with infants and the elderly, are now tramping north through the sweltering heat of Mexico's Chiapas state, just north of the Guatemalan border. A migrant in a caravan bound for the United States carries a baby in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A migrant in a caravan bound for the United States carries a baby in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on Monday. As the group has grown and grappled with the conditions, the migrants have been met with a confused response from Mexican officials. On Sunday, some 200 Mexican riot police arranged a blockade, seeking to block the caravan's path to the city of Tapachula, only to pack up and leave just a few minutes later. \"They just took this blockade away, all the police left and the caravan kept marching,\" journalist James Fredrick reported for NPR. Police are packing up and getting on buses now as #CaravanaDelMigrante nears. Asked what\u2019s going on, police say \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We were told to pack up and get on buses.\u201d pic.twitter.com/OM92wYCY5A Trump has made it quite clear he is unhappy about the situation, turning the specter of the caravan into a central element of his campaign stops ahead of next month's midterm elections. \"Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws!\" Trump tweeted Monday, not long before threatening foreign aid to the migrants' countries of origin. Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally. The U.S. has spent nearly $200 million in foreign aid this year for the three countries Trump listed in his tweet \u2014 Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The State Department says the money, which is spent in collaboration with programs run by the three countries, aims to promote economic growth, step up security and strengthen the rule of law. In Honduras alone, agricultural investments by the U.S. Agency for International Development \"have helped lift 68,000 people out of extreme poverty,\" according to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a group advocating for stronger international assistance.

But Trump has been skeptical of the value of this aid, which he has often used as a point of leverage against certain countries. He specifically called out Honduras and threatened the country during the approach of a similar caravan earlier this year. Last year, he also threatened to cut foreign aid to United Nations member states that voted to condemn the U.S. for moving its embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem. Honduras and Guatemala were among just nine countries to side with the U.S. in that U.N. General Assembly vote. Still, it remains unclear just how much power Trump actually has when it comes to cutting aid on his own. The BBC reported earlier this year that because Congress controls federal spending, it gets the final say on matters of foreign aid \u2014 though the president does have some leeway, depending on the program: \"Congress can approve or alter the administration's budgetary proposals and can also specify in substantial detail where it wants the aid to go - even if that's in opposition to what the president wants. \"However, in situations where Congress has not gone into specifics, an administration has a considerable amount of flexibility about how exactly it spends the allocated budget - although it has to notify Congress of its intentions.\" An official at the U.S. Agency for International Development, when contacted by NPR, deferred to the White House when asked for further information. \"The president has made clear that countries receiving assistance from the United States should support our interests,\" the official said. For the migrants themselves, however, such threats are secondary to more pressing matters \u2014 namely, the violence they're fleeing and the hunger they're suffering on the road. \"The kids are enduring heat. There's no food. We've only eaten because Guatemalans have been good to us,\" said a man named Samuel, who only gave his first name for fear of retribution at home. He told Fredrick that he was traveling with his wife and three sons \u2014 and dismissed claims from Trump and others that the caravan was organized by political actors. \"Come on,\" the man said, \"no one told us they'd give us money if we left. My wife and I made this decision.\" Multiple reporters who have been traveling with the caravan also disputed Trump's assertion \u2014 offered without evidence \u2014 that \"unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in\" with the group. Been reporting from the caravan for the last 3 days. Haven't seen anyone from the Middle East. Yet to see proof of criminals. Yet President Trump continues to push that line without producing evidence.What is true is that Mexico's police have not halted the caravan so far. https://t.co/1eZGAWnsPi Los Angeles Times reporter Kate Linthicum tweeted that she has not seen a single person who fits Trump's description. \"Have seen hundreds of women and children and babies, though.\" \"I have to do this for his future,\" one of those women told the Times while carrying her 18-month-old son.

The number, however, may be misconstrued since people have been joining and leaving the caravan daily. Migrants marched on through Mexico shouting slogans like \"S\u00ed se pudo!\" or \"Yes, we did it!\" Many of these migrants are fleeing poverty and violence. At the border, a woman named Maria tells James, \"It was our decision.\" \"We asked for people to give us rides, we sold the little we had to come,\" she added. \"I'm doing this for my daughters and granddaughters.\" James tells NPR that people at the border say they'll do whatever is asked of them, as long as they aren't sent back to Honduras. The decision to form a migrant caravan came after some migrants gave up trying to enter Mexico legally because the asylum application process was too slow and most consider their final destination to be the U.S., where Trump says he will close the border on them. \"They're not coming into this country,\" Trump said at the rally. Samuel, a 40-year-old Honduran traveling with his wife and three sons, tells James that he hopes Trump will change his mind. \"I believe Trump's heart may still be tender and one day he will feel peace and happiness and do good for us. He won't regret it,\" Samuel said.",

A small group of unlikely supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany  (AfD) \u2014 a party whose members have been accused of racism and downplaying the Nazis \u2014 has launched a new association. It's called \"Jews in the AfD.\" Just 19 members turned up to its launch event in the city of Wiesbaden last month, but the development has unsettled many in Germany's Jewish community. According to police statistics, anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise in Germany. One incident caught on camera late last year shows a German man shouting abuse at the owner of Feinberg's, a well-known Jewish restaurant in the Berlin borough of Charlottenburg. The man rants \"what do you want here? You belong in the gas chambers. Nobody wants you here with your stupid Jewish restaurants,\" until a police officer shows up. Mike Samuel Delberg, a restaurant regular and friend of the owner, posted the footage online to show others what he says he and other Jews have to put up with. Anti-Jewish aggression like this has become more brazen since the rise of the AfD, he says, so the very idea that fellow Jewish citizens would vote for the party is baffling. \"A lot of the people who are members of the party are anti-Semitic, are racist, and saying unbelievable things about minorities, about Jewish people, about Muslim people,\" Mike Samuel Delberg says. \"How can a Jewish group form itself within a party like that?\" Delberg is vice president of the Jewish Students Union of Germany, which recently organized a demonstration against the group Jews in the AfD. He warns that the AfD is exploiting what he sees as token Jewish members. \"The AfD tries to come over as very pro-Jewish, very pro-Israeli,\" Delberg says. \"It's not because they like the Jews, it's not because they like Israel very much. But because they hate the enemies of Israel so much that they think that they have a strong partner within the Jewish community to fight those people. But we don't let [them exploit us with] these tactics.\" Demonstrators hold posters and placards reading \"This alternative is not kosher,\" in a protest organized by the Jewish Students Union of Germany on Oct. 7 in Frankfurt against a newly launched Jewish faction of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank Rumpenhorst/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators hold posters and placards reading \"This alternative is not kosher,\" in a protest organized by the Jewish Students Union of Germany on Oct. 7 in Frankfurt against a newly launched Jewish faction of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Wolfgang Fuhl, 58, was an AfD candidate in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a state in southwest Germany, in last year's federal election. He is Jewish and a founding member of Jews in the AfD. He scoffs at the idea of being used by his own party. \"Believe me, I'm not being exploited by anybody,\" Fuhl says. \"I'm a conservative person and I'd like to continue to live in Germany. We're roughly 140,000 Jews in this country; it would only take a week for us all to leave. And we'd be leaving not because of the AfD or the right-wing extremists, but because of Islamic anti-Semitism.\" Police figures show that more than 90 percent of anti-Semitic hate crimes in Germany last year were committed by members of the far right. But Germany's anti-Semitism commissioner, Felix Klein, says the figures don't include incidents that weren't reported as other types of crimes. Delberg says he understands Fuhl's fear of anti-Jewish hatred from parts of Germany's much larger Muslim population. But \"choosing a party that is racist won't solve the problem,\" he says. Delberg adds that anti-Semitism is deeply rooted in the middle of German society among people of all faiths. Fuhl says a wide variety of issues motivate Jewish citizens to vote for the AfD and he believes it would be discriminatory to expect Jews to think and vote in any particular way. \"Merkel has divided this country and the political split runs through families and communities, including Jewish communities,\" Fuhl says. \"Why should Jewish citizens be any different from the rest of Germany?\" Fuhl claims the AfD has more Jewish members than any other party but is unable to give exact numbers because political parties don't collect data on their members' religious affiliation. He considers 19 members a good start and is optimistic more will join the association. Fuhl says the AfD is the only party willing to stand up to \"imported anti-Semitism,\" which, he says, has become an issue since the influx of mainly Muslim refugees in 2015. Melanie Amann, who reports on the AfD for the German magazine Der Spiegel, says that fear about reported anti-Jewish sentiment within the Muslim community may drive Jewish AfD membership. But she believes the party doesn't care one way or another about Germany's Jewish community. \"I believe that the organization Jews in the AfD is merely a tactical instrument to be used against the Islamic community in Germany,\" Amann says. She argues that, despite Holocaust revisionist rhetoric from some members, the AfD is first and foremost an anti-Islam party. Amann says she sees a lot of parallels between anti-Semitism in the Nazi era and the anti-Islam sentiment within the AfD today. \"From a lot of AfD leaders you hear derogatory, aggressive general accusations towards the Muslims that can be comparable to the way the Nazis treated the Jews, for example, [seeing] them as enemies of the German people.\" Amann adds AfD members have also used language comparing Muslims to \"animals\" or \"bacteria.\" Back at Feinberg's, Delberg sees the same parallels, but he doesn't agree that the AfD is ambivalent about the Jewish community. \"Maybe [the AfD] is standing by our side right now,\" says the Jewish Students Union member. \"But when they, let's say, 'solve' the first problem,\" Delberg continues, referring to how the AfD views Muslims, \"we are next.\" \"We just have to look back in our history to see what we are doing when we are supporting a party like that.\" Put simply, he adds, Jews in the AfD just aren't kosher.",

When German organizers pulled together a demonstration in Berlin to support \"an open and free society,\" they had some ambitious goals. They expected roughly 40,000 people to pack the span from Berlin's city center, from Alexanderplatz to the Victory Column, where they were holding their final rally of the day. As it turns out, those expectations didn't measure up to the real thing. More than 240,000 people showed up for the march and rallies Saturday, according to the organizers behind the #unteilbar event (#indivisible in English). Local police told the BBC that the demonstrators numbered \"in the low hundreds of thousands.\" Authorities shut down the 3-mile expanse where the demonstrators had gathered, and overhead photographs showed massive crowds on the tree-lined avenue. Protesters packed the 3-mile span from Alexanderplatz through the Brandenburg Gate to the Victory Column in Berlin.\n                \n                    \n                    Carsten Koall/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters packed the 3-mile span from Alexanderplatz through the Brandenburg Gate to the Victory Column in Berlin. \"A dramatic political shift is taking place: racism and discrimination are becoming socially acceptable. What yesterday was considered unthinkable and unutterable has today become a reality. Humanity and human rights, religious freedom, and the rule of law are being openly attacked. This is an attack on all of us,\" organizers wrote in their manifesto prior to the event. \"We will not allow the welfare state to be played off against asylum and migration,\" they wrote. \"We will stand in resistance when fundamental rights and freedoms are in danger of being further restricted.\" The march comes at a time when Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant political party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), is gaining ground across the country \u2014 particularly in Bavaria. As NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports, the 5-year-old party is expected to win seats in the Bavarian legislature for the first time on Sunday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her fellow conservatives are suffering from low approval ratings, partly because of anxieties surrounding immigration \u2014 and the AfD \"excels at stoking such fears,\" Nelson notes. The party argues that without a strict border policy that keeps the number of refugees to a bare minimum, Germany is at risk of losing its traditional national identity. That argument has resonated with many Germans. The AfD won enough seats in last year's elections to become the official opposition to Merkel's governing coalition. The party's positions represent the diametrical opposite of the ones voiced by Saturday's protesters. \"There are people here who want to show that they don't support what is going on in Germany, including from established politicians, all this hate, this whole debate about immigration,\" protester Rola Saleh told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Saleh said she hailed from the eastern city of Chemnitz, where far-right protesters held a rally in August. The protesters shouted chants of \"Close the borders!\" and delivered Hitler salutes before the scene descended into violence between them and counterprotesters. \"After the conflicts in Chemnitz, a lot of the refugees are afraid and uncertain about the situation,\" Saleh told Deutsche Welle. \"They feel like they've been abandoned ... or they're afraid they'll be provoked into criminal acts by a situation. If you feel like you live in a state where the police are not ready or able to help you, you start thinking about finding ways to protect yourself.\" 242.000 f\u00fcr eine offene, freie und solidarische Gesellschaft.

German support for Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservatives is at an all-time low, and in few places is that more evident than Bavaria. A booming economy and ever fewer migrants crossing the border into the wealthy alpine state haven't eased a populist backlash against the Christian Social Union (CSU), which is the closest ally of Merkel's party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). The CSU has governed Bavaria for all but three years since 1946, most of the time with an absolute majority. But its future is in doubt, with conservative Bavarian voters in the midst of a shift toward Alternative for Germany (AfD). Just 5 years old, the far-right party is currently the main opposition in the German parliament and is widely expected to win seats in the Bavarian legislature for the first time when regional elections are held on Sunday. One of the Bavarian cities where AfD is especially popular is Ingolstadt, which is hardly a typical stronghold for the far-right faction that traditionally plays to Germany's working class in the less affluent, formerly communist east. Luxury cars abound on Ingolstadt's cobblestone streets and the 137,000 residents of the medieval city, where carmaker Audi is headquartered, enjoy the highest per capita income in Germany. But as well off as people in Ingolstadt are, many there are nonetheless anxious about their future. Enter the AfD, which excels at stoking such fears. The party's candidate in Ingolstadt is Johannes Kraus von Sande, 48, who embraces the same campaign line the AfD used to win 13 percent of the vote in last October's national elections: Uncontrolled migration threatens the German identity, security and economy, and the mainstream political parties aren't doing anything about it. \"As our campaign posters say: The AfD fulfills the promises the CSU makes. The CSU's failure to keep promises has pretty much defined the whole history of that party,\" Kraus von Sande said in an interview with NPR. But what exactly the AfD plans to do to fulfill campaign promises \u2014 or to address the problems it raises \u2014 the candidate said is still being worked out. \"The city has changed a lot,\" Kraus von Sande said, recalling how when he went to high school in Ingolstadt, everyone knew everyone else by name. Now, the city and its lucrative job market is far bigger and more international. City officials in Ingolstadt, where the population has grown by more than a third in the past four decades, estimate at least two out of five residents are either immigrants or descended from immigrants. Many of those immigrants are Muslims, who until recently, thought of Ingolstadt as a welcoming place for adherents of their faith. Kraus von Sande said he doesn't have a problem with all Muslim immigrants: \"We have the Turks and I must say they are strongly integrated in German society and some of them are critical of Islam.\" But he said the migrants coming from the Middle East and Africa since 2015 \u2014 when war and poverty, coupled with Merkel's open-door refugee policy, led to well over a million new arrivals in Germany \u2014 are causing more problems. He said the earlier arrivals he speaks to don't want newcomers who don't or can't fit in or fail to contribute to the German economy. The law needs to change, and they are looking to AfD to help with that, Kraus von Sande said. \"That definitely needs to happen very fast.\" The 53-year-old CSU candidate for the Bavarian legislature from Ingolstadt \u2013 police chief Alfred Grob \u2013 also has concerns about more effectively managing asylum seekers who come to Germany and ensuring that newcomers integrate. He said it would be better for his city \u2013 and his political party \u2014 if the German government wasn't operating a large refugee processing center for asylum seekers on the edge of Ingolstadt. That center, which housed about 1,400 migrants last year, was transformed in August into an \"AnkER\" center \u2013 a blend of the German words for arrival, decision and repatriation \u2014 and houses new arrivals who aren't likely to qualify for asylum so they can be processed and deported more quickly. But Grob criticized the AfD for capitalizing on fears rather than facts. Even though crime is up 11 percent in Ingolstadt, \"the reality is that we have not had such a low crime rate for 20 years now,\" Grob told NPR. \"The other side is that refugees are proportionally over-represented in the crime statistics.\" He said that's easy to explain: Most asylum seekers are young men, and as a demographic, they \u2013 no matter what their racial background \u2013 are more likely to commit crimes. Grob said many of the crimes by asylum seekers are happening at the transit center. He added that German voter backlash against the CSU and other mainstream parties is about a lot more than asylum seekers or the AfD. He called it \"German angst.\" \"People are afraid of a societal decline,\" Grob explained. \"We're doing very well here. We feel so good that many think it can't get any better and that in fact, it's going to go down and maybe faster.\" A diesel emissions testing scandal and other problems at Audi have exacerbated such worries, he said. So have skyrocketing rents in the city. Older residents are also struggling with pensions that aren't keeping up with the rising cost of living in Ingolstadt. Another reason AfD is doing well in Ingolstadt is that it isn't a university town, says Luzia Grasser, an editor in the Ingolstadt office of the daily Augsburger Allgemeine. \"Ingolstadt has a relatively conservative voter class, so protest voters may not vote in the left milieu\" compared to what's happening in the rest of Germany, where the left-leaning, environmentally friendly Green Party has climbed to the number two spot in the latest opinion poll. Much of the support for AfD in Ingolstadt comes from a large community of ethnic Germans from Russia who after the collapse of communism, immigrated to the region in the late 80s and early 90s. The candidates here say those immigrants were less likely to vote in Ingolstadt in the past, but are now worried about their jobs, unemployment benefits and pensions being gobbled up by newer immigrants \u2014 fears that AfD has seized on. The far-right party has put up billboards around Ingolstadt warning of Muslim hordes stripping Bavaria of its Christian identity, pensions and benefits and fostering insecurity. One such billboard showing a white woman looking back in fear at two hooded men, and urging voters to cast their ballots for AfD to \"protect our women and children,\" stands across the street from a grocery store frequented by the many German Russians in the working class neighborhood of Piusviertel. The neighborhood, with its apartment buildings, pristine parks and playgrounds, is home to many of Ingolstadt's Turkish and Middle Eastern immigrants, who are reporting more harassment and abuse \u2014 especially of women wearing headscarves \u2014 since AfD began campaigning here. The community center there offers a wide range of programs to help residents seeking employment, integration into German society and culture and language. One of the volunteers is Yeser Saygili, who immigrated to Ingolstadt from Turkey a quarter century ago and speaks fluent German. \"I help a lot of immigrant women who are looking for jobs. One office looking for a cleaning woman recently asked me if the applicant wore a headscarf,\" Saygili said. \"I was, like, 'Hello, how far have we regressed?' In the end, she didn't get the job.\" Saygili says she fears a far-right win in Bavaria on Sunday will only make things harder for Muslims in Ingolstadt. Political observers say it could also lead to a reshuffling or worse of Merkel's cabinet, as her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, is co-leader of the CSU party and would feel pressured to resign following a poor election result.",

This week, the online group outed one of two Russian agents believed to have been involved in poisonings in the U.K.\n                \n                    \n                    Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Aric Toler isn't exactly sure what to call himself. \"Digital researcher, digital investigator, digital something probably works,\" Toler says. Toler, 30, is part of an Internet research organization known as Bellingcat. Formed in 2014, the group first got attention for its meticulous documentation of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Toler used posts to Russia's equivalent of Facebook, VK, to track Russian soldiers as they slipped in and out of eastern Ukraine \u2014 where they covertly aided local rebels. Since then, Toler and his colleagues have been up to a whole lot more. They've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases; watched security operations unfold on social media in Venezuela; and pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Now Toler and the nine other full-time members of Bellingcat's small, international staff are increasingly being drawn into some of the biggest news stories in the world. This week they unmasked one of two Russian agents believed to be behind a spate of poisonings in the U.K. (they exposed the other one last month). And they're collaborating with news outlets to help identify suspects in the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It's a rapid rise for what was, just a few years ago, a group of amateurs. Bellingcat was founded by Eliot Higgins, a British native whose previous jobs included helping the settlement of refugees in the U.K. and administrator in a women's lingerie factory. Chemical exposure Higgins' work began with the brutal civil wars in Syria and Libya. He was astonished by the amount of information about the conflict that was available online in social media postings and videos. \"I just asked myself, how can I prove this information was true?\" he said in a 2015 interview with NPR. He didn't speak or read Arabic, so he started looking at the one thing he could identify: the weapons and munitions being used by the combatants. He posted what he found on his personal blog. \"When I wrote about something, I'd say this is what I think and this is why I think it; I'd show my work,\" he said. The goal, he said, was to be \"very transparent\" about what he had discovered. Higgins was among the first to identify the munitions used in a grisly chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in August 2013. \"I'd actually seen them before because they'd been used in previous chemical attacks that hadn't been quite as large-scale,\" he said. His work linking the munitions to the Syrian military was meticulous and strong enough that it was later cited by organizations such as Human Rights Watch. In Bellingcat, Higgins has drawn together a troop of like-minded, newly professionalized researchers. They are scattered across the globe \u2014 Higgins lives in the U.K., Toler in Kansas City, Mo., others are in the Netherlands and elsewhere. They communicate via online messaging and Twitter, in a constant exchange of satellite imagery, social media postings and videos. \"It's like a game \u2014 you kind of find stuff and put it together,\" Toler says. Toler says the organization is funded half through grants from places like Google and the Open Society Foundations. The other half comes from training workshops, including one NPR recently visited in the Washington, D.C., area. \"We firmly believe it's so important that more people are aware of how to do these kinds of things,\" says Christiaan Triebert, a 27-year-old former Dutch journalist who is also on Bellingcat's staff. We firmly believe it's so important that more people are aware of how to do these kinds of things. Christiaan Triebert, Bellingcat In fact, the name Bellingcat comes from one of Aesop's fables \u2014 Belling the Cat \u2014 about a group of mice who decide to put a bell on a stealthy cat to expose its presence. Triebert says that's why the group sees training sessions as a key to its success: \"I hope the group of mice keeps growing, and I hope we can bell more cats.\" Bellingcat's identification of the two suspected Russian intelligence agents shows the benefits of knowing where to look. On March 4, a former Russian double agent, Sergey Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a bench in the English town of Salisbury. British authorities later determined a rare nerve agent had been used to poison the couple and that the poison was also responsible for the death of a U.K. citizen in July. In September, British police released photographs of two Russian suspects, along with the aliases they traveled under. Bellingcat took what little information they released and got to work. Leaky data \"Russia is extremely corrupt and everything leaks like a sieve, so you can find leaked databases of various types online,\" Toler says. \"Things like insurance databases, driver's licenses, voter databases, stuff like that. This stuff isn't 100 percent legal, but it's out there.\" Bellingcat tracked down a second man it believes to have been involved in the poisonings through searching databases online.\n                \n                    \n                    Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bellingcat tracked down a second man it believes to have been involved in the poisonings through searching databases online. Bellingcat teamed up with a Russian news site known as the Insider to mine the databases. They used some of the leaked databases to show that the passports for the two suspects in the Skripal case were issued in 2009, under aliases. Believing the two worked for Russia's military intelligence, known as the GRU, they began to work backward. Given their rough ages, the group figured one or both attended training at the Far Eastern Military Command Academy in Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border. Eventually they found a photo related to the academy with one of the suspects, identified as Col. Anatoly Chepiga. Subsequent searches of databases turned up numerous links between Chepiga and the GRU, including his photo on the wall of the military academy where he trained. We don't want to be co-opted. Aric Toler, Bellingcat The group exposed the man it believes is the the second suspect on Monday. Known as Alexander Mishkin, he was tracked down through a series of database searches that showed, among other things, that his car was registered to GRU headquarters. Toler says that the group, in partnership with Russian journalists, even managed to send someone to Mishkin's hometown, in the far north of the country. \"They had his picture, and were showing it around to people in the town,\" Toler says. Many villagers instantly recognized him. They said Mishkin's grandmother had a photo of him receiving a medal from Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"She'd show it to people, but you can't touch it \u2014 it's her most prized possession,\" Toler says.

Russian retaliation The Russians have noticed the group's work. After Bellingcat's initial reports, Russian state media released interviews with the two suspects, who said that they were sightseers. Russian media also attacked the Bellingcat group, stating it was funded by the U.S. government with the sole purpose of undermining Russia and other NATO adversaries. The group members bristle at such allegations. \"We've never cooperated or spoken to or had anything leaked to us by any security services,\" Toler says. The group does receive anonymous tips, he adds, but it tries to make sure any information it receives is independently verifiable so that \"we're not being taken for a ride by some spooks.\" Triebert also points out that they have investigated U.S. airstrikes in Syria. \"When we investigate the Pentagon, [Russian media] calls us independent investigators that show the Pentagon killed civilians,\" he says. But in the background, Triebert and Toler are also aware of the researchers and whistleblowers who have come before Bellingcat. Many have not succeeded in maintaining an impartial stance. The website WikiLeaks, for example, gained fame through leaking U.S. documents that many saw as shedding light on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But in recent years, the organization has also gained notoriety as a conduit for hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. It later emerged that Russian hackers had stolen those emails with the goal of swaying the 2016 election. Christiaan Triebert is a former Dutch journalist who now works with Bellingcat. The organization's members come from all over the world.\n                \n                    \n                    Meredith Rizzo/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christiaan Triebert is a former Dutch journalist who now works with Bellingcat.

This is what got me into this stuff,\" Triebert says. \"If I look at WikiLeaks nowadays, I'm disappointed by what it has become.\" \"Of course we think about that, because we don't want to be co-opted,\" Toler says. At the same time, he thinks their open approach provides a degree of protection. \"We've been doing this for years and years and years, and we can kind of sniff out when something's been planted.\" But Toler and Triebert also admit the challenges will only grow with the group's popularity. Looking to the future, Toler says that fake posts and doctored videos will only grow in sophistication. Triebert expects intel agencies may feed them leads to get classified findings into the public sphere. \"You could call it whitewashing of their information, right?\" he says. Neither knows what the future holds for the group, but both say they are ready. \"So I think yeah, interesting times ahead,\" Tiebert says.",

German parliamentary debates tend to be well-tempered, often dreary affairs. But a recent session showed just how tense the climate in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has become. Earlier this month, Alexander Gauland, a lawmaker with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the lower house of parliament, lambasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's migration policies. A verbal pile-on ensued. Senior Social Democratic politician Martin Schulz accused the AfD legislator of being a \"right-wing radical\" and using \"tactics of fascism.\" Eventually, the 94 AfD members of parliament walked out, saying that comparisons to the Nazis and other insults were \"unacceptable.\" Alexander Gauland, co-chairman of the Alternative for Germany party, in the German parliament in Berlin in late June.\n                \n                    \n                    Markus Schreiber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexander Gauland, co-chairman of the Alternative for Germany party, in the German parliament in Berlin in late June. In last September's elections, the AfD became the first far-right party to win seats in the Bundestag in more than half a century, becoming the official opposition to Merkel's ruling \"grand coalition\" of conservatives and social democrats. Although \u2014 or precisely because \u2014 the AfD is treated as a pariah in the legislature, its support is growing among German voters. The AfD was listed as the country's second most popular party in a recent poll, with 18 percent support, beating the mainstream Social Democratic Party into third place, albeit by just a single point. It is the latest sign that many citizens are drawn to a populist movement that is reshaping politics in Germany, a trend that's playing out in Europe and elsewhere. AfD politicians are regularly accused of extremism and don't shy from the type of nationalist rhetoric that mainstream German politicians largely have shunned since World War II. After launching in 2013, Alternative for Germany has grown powerful by focusing especially on the public's fears and frustrations over the country taking in record numbers of migrants and refugees in recent years. \"Political helplessness\" AfD's spokesman J\u00f6rg Meuthen believes his party is in touch with German society: \"On the crucial issues of our time, the views of the majority of the population coincide with ours. That drives these people to us,\" he tells NPR. Accusations that the party's members are right-wing radicals or a danger to democracy are \"an expression of political helplessness\" by mainstream politicians, he says. Meuthen, an economist who also serves as a German member of European Parliament, insists the party's leaders \"completely reject any form of right-wing radicalism.\" But various current and former AfD politicians have been criticized for anything from stoking prejudiced views of ethnic and religious minorities to trivializing the Holocaust. The party rejects such accusations. In recent protest rallies in the eastern city of Chemnitz, members of the AfD marched alongside leading figures of the anti-migrant group PEGIDA and neo-Nazi activists. Some of the protesters performed Nazi salutes \u2014 which are illegal in Germany \u2014 and shouted \"foreigners out!\" Most Germans reject it Many are alarmed by the far right's rise in Germany, a country that has fought to stamp out extremism and remnants of Nazi thinking. Some experts warn against drawing too much comparison to the 1930s Weimar period that led to Adolf Hitler's rise, but they recognize certain parallels. \"What is interesting is that the dominant right wing of the AfD tries to copy the agitation, the ideology, the rhetoric of the fascists of the Weimar Republic, but they encounter their limits,\" says Hajo Funke, a political scientist at Free University of Berlin. Earlier this month, a survey found that 79 percent of Germans believe right-wing extremism is a danger to democracy. \"And big majorities do want that Germany offers [a] place to war refugees,\" Funke adds, as another recent study shows. So, how has the AfD managed to garner so much support for its \"alternative\" for the country? According to Werner Weidenfeld, a political scientist at the University of Munich, the party appeals to a variety of sectors. \"The AfD supporters are not all right-wing radicals,\" he says. There is a range of backers, including \"disappointed middle-class\" citizens and \"some right-wing extremists.\" He thinks the AfD's success reflects people's longing for simple solutions to complex issues, like security and artificial intelligence. \"We live in an age of complexity,\" he says, \"while at the same time nobody explains the complex connections. So there is confusion, and people become incredibly insecure. They are frustrated, afraid and want a simple answer.\" Weidenfeld says Germany's mainstream parties do not provide these answers, so \"many of today's AfD voters stayed home on election days. Now they have found a way of expressing their fear and frustration \u2014 by voting for the AfD.\" \"Democracy is not threatened today, but it might be the day after tomorrow,\" Weidenfeld says. The traditional parties have to \"regain the trust of citizens.\" Media scientist Jo Grobel argues that AfD politicians are careful to remain vague on almost all other topics but the refugee issue. That attracts people with widely differing views, who feel unrepresented by established parties, around a single topic. A record of more than 1 million asylum-seekers came to Europe in 2015, largely from war-torn countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many conservatives in Germany, and outside the country, have criticized Merkel for letting so many migrants enter. \"So there is a valve for the frustration and anger over the prevailing political style,\" Grobel says. As long as the party focuses on migration without straying into other areas, it can harness Germans' \"shared anger.\" There is also a realization in Germany of bigger trends: Europe's establishment politicians still win elections, but right-wing populists have made considerable gains \u2014 with a laser focus on immigration \u2014 in countries like Italy and Sweden. That momentum has grabbed the attention of American white nationalist figures as well. \"There is no singular explanation for the strengthening of the extreme right \u2014 it is a worldwide phenomenon,\" says Konstantin von Notz, a German parliamentarian from the opposition Green Party. \"The far right and autocrats have an international network and see themselves as a movement. This threatens the Western-type democracies massively, whose freedoms we have taken for granted for decades.\" Facebook smart Another driver is the AfD's social media expertise. Political consultant Martin Fuchs says, unlike traditional parties, the populist right-wing party was founded in the age of Facebook. \"It consequently built its party structures along the network and uses it better than any other party,\" he says, \"both in terms of connecting [supporters] to the party, as well as the implementation [of its political agenda] with emotional content, escalating scandals, focusing on one topic and managing its community.\" Fuchs says the party uses the online social network so successfully, it no longer needs the mainstream media to reach and mobilize supporters. The government is aware it needs to improve its appeal to citizens. \"The public perception of the government needs a lot of improvement,\" says Johannes Kahrs, a member of parliament for the Social Democrats, a partner in the ruling coalition. \"Trust calms, a lack of trust gives a boost to the extremists.\" He says to combat the appeal of the AfD, traditional parties \"need [to offer] guidance and we need to solve problems.\" But he insists politicians should not adopt far-right positions: \"There should be no attempt to overtake the far right on the right.\" There has to be a clear limit to what is acceptable in German politics and society, Kahrs says.",

In a sign of growing xenophobia in Germany, thousands of far-right protesters descended on the city of Chemnitz on Saturday, one week after the stabbing death of a 35-year-old German carpenter that has been blamed on two Middle Eastern asylum seekers. Hundreds of heavily armed police officers \u2013 including many on horseback \u2013 were brought in from around Germany to control the crowds, while most residents stayed away from downtown. Many of them watched from their balconies as far-right groups silently marched past, carrying white and yellow roses, German flags and posters featuring German victims of crimes blamed on asylum seekers. The police stopped the march only 45 minutes after it started after counter-protesters from the anti-fascist, or \"antifa\" movement, managed to infiltrate the march and tried provoking clashes. Nevertheless, the demonstrations on Saturday were much less violent than those that took place in Chemnitz earlier this week. Police in the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz is located, later tweeted: \"The overwhelming majority are behaving peacefully. For those looking for trouble, we say that we remain heavily deployed in the city and we repeat our request: Stay peaceful!\" But neither police nor the local and German federal officials who organized a more sparsely attended \"Heart instead of Hounding\" counter-demonstration in a nearby park failed to ease the tensions that have overwhelmed Chemnitz and left the German federal government in Berlin reeling. German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week condemned the \"hate on the street.\" The far-right has long held sway in this region \u2014 once a part of the former communist, East Germany. The populist Alternative for Germany, which is the main opposition party in the German parliament, had its strongest showing in Saxony during last fall's national elections. But what is worrying officials this time is how the extremists were able to whip up widespread xenophobia and quickly call up large protests only hours after the death of German carpenter Daniel Hillig. Chemnitz Mayor Barbara Ludwig told reporters on Saturday that the far right \"may be stirring things up, but I'm convinced forces will continue to mobilize \u2013 like we clearly see here today \u2013 who won't allow the right, or their thoughts or a far-right state to take hold.\" Nearby, at the Karl Marx Monument, where far-right protesters gathered, Martin Kohlmann, who leads a nationalist citizens movement called \"Pro Chemnitz,\" told the crowd they are not vigilantes as Ludwig and other opponents claim, but are acting in self-defense. \"The Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper recently misquoted me \u2013 but it did make the point: 'Take the knives away from the migrants, otherwise we will take away your ministries,'\" Kohlmann said. Police have yet to say what prompted the knife fight that led to Hillig's death. Nor have they said much about the suspects, identified by authorities as asylum seekers Yousif A., 22, of Iraq \u2013 who had been ordered deported two years earlier \u2014 and Alaa S., 23, of Syria. They are charged with manslaughter. A prison officer leaked the Iraqi's arrest warrant, which ended up on far-right websites and helped spur the anti-immigrant rallies in Chemnitz during the past week. The officer was suspended and may face criminal charges. Several German media, including the newspaper Tagesspiegel, report Hillig, whose father was Cuban, was pro-immigrant and would have abhorred the far right using him to further their cause. Kohlmann on Saturday unfurled a Cuban flag he claimed was given to him by Hillig's life partner, claiming she had asked that he and others who were marching to carry it because Hillig identified as both German and Cuban. \"We aren't against foreigners like we are accused of,\" he said to applause. Another speaker later said Kohlmann was mistaken about the flag, saying it merely came from an acquaintance of the murdered man. More protests are expected on Sunday.",

He was 80. \"Kofi Annan was a global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world. During his distinguished career and leadership of the United Nations, he was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law,\" the Kofi Annan Foundation and Annan family said in a statement. The foundation said he died \"peacefully\" after a \"short illness,\" adding, \"His wife Nane and their children Ama, Kojo and Nina were by his side during his last days.\" Born on April 8, 1938, in what is now Kumasi, Ghana, Annan took his first job with the U.N. system in 1962, as a budget officer with the World Health Organization, according to the Kofi Annan Foundation. He began working with the U.N. refugee office in 1980, before advancing to higher positions there in the 1980s and 1990s. As the head of peacekeeping operations starting in 1993, Annan would \"be sorely tested by devastating wars in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia,\" NPR noted in 2012. Annan was the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, serving between 1997 and 2006. He was the first career staffer in the U.N. and the first black African to rise to the organization's most prominent job. He served for two terms. He was awarded the the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the United Nations in 2001 \"for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world.\" The Nobel Committee \"also recognized his commitment to the struggle to contain the spreading of the HIV virus in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism,\" according to the Nobel Foundation. In Oslo, Norway, in 2001, Annan spoke of having \"three key priorities\" for the future of the U.N. in the 21st century: \"eradicating poverty, preventing conflict, and promoting democracy. Only in a world that is rid of poverty can all men and women make the most of their abilities. Only where individual rights are respected can differences be channeled politically and resolved peacefully. Only in a democratic environment, based on respect for diversity and dialogue, can individual self-expression and self-government be secured, and freedom of association be upheld.\" Annan left the U.N. in 2006, establishing the Kofi Annan Foundation the next year \"with the aim of mobilising political will to overcome threats to peace, development and human rights.\" He went on to serve in various peace and development advocacy groups, including the Africa Progress Panel, a panel appointed by the African Union after violence marred Kenya's 2007 election and The Elders,  a group of global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. Annan was appointed as a joint U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria in 2012 after the outbreak of war there. He quit that post in frustration, blaming the Syrian \"government and its intransigence,\" along with diplomatic maneuvering by Russia and China and the U.N. Security Council. \"I felt undercut, and I also felt that perhaps I was seeing the problem differently than they were, because honestly I don't see a military solution in the Syrian crisis,\" Annan told NPR in 2012. Diplomats around the world reacted quickly to his death. The current U.N. secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called Annan \"a guiding force for good. ...  In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,\" he said in a statement. The president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, tweeted his condolences to Annan's family, adding that Ghana's flag will fly half-staff around the world for one week starting on Monday. Annan, the first secretary-general of the United Nations from sub-Saharan Africa, \"brought considerable renown to our country by this position and through his conduct and comportment in the global arena,\" Akufo-Addo wrote. \"Deeply saddened by the passing away of Kofi Annan. One of the true global leaders of our age. A man of courage, wisdom and friendship. I'm honored to have had the privilege of working for him,\" Carl Bildt of the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote on Twitter. \"Kofi was humanity's best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace.

Updated at 11:03 p.m. ET Venezuelan officials say that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has escaped an assassination attempt unharmed. Maduro was giving a live televised speech in the capital city of Caracas on Saturday when, a government spokesman said, explosive-carrying drones went off near the president. Communications Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez called the incident an \"attack\" on the leader, reports The Associated Press, and said seven National Guard soldiers were injured. Maduro had been addressing the national troops about the country's economy during an event the government says was meant to mark the 81st anniversary of the country's National Guard. \"At exactly 5:41 p.m. in the afternoon several explosions were heard,\" Rodriguez said, according to the AP translation, in a national address immediately following the incident. \"The investigation clearly reveals they came from drone-like devices that carried explosives.\" But, the wire service adds, firefighters at the site of the explosion are disputing the government's account of what it called an \"attack.\" Footage posted on Twitter by Venezuela channel NTN24 TV shows the moment the scene descended into chaos before the broadcast was cut off. Maduro is seen looking toward the sky in confusion. What looks to be hundreds of soldiers break formation before scattering. #URGENTE #VIDEO Aparente explosi\u00f3n en acto donde estaba el presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro genera confusi\u00f3n pic.twitter.com/NYi21vok7T Maduro blamed the alleged attack on far-right factions in Venezuela, in addition to the U.S. and Colombian governments, freelance reporter John Otis tells NPR. \"This was an assassination attempt, they tried to assassinate me,\" Maduro said in a televised address, later Saturday evening. Maduro named Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as being behind the attack, according to \"initial investigations,\" without elaborating. Reuters cites a Colombian government source as saying Maduro's allegation was \"absurd\" and that Santos was celebrating his granddaughter's baptism on Saturday. \"He is not thinking of anything else, least of all bringing down foreign governments,\" the source said. Reuters adds: A little-known group called the \"National Movement of Soldiers in T-shirts\" claimed responsibility for the attack. In a series of posts on social media, the group said it had planned to fly two drones but that snipers shot them down. \"We demonstrated that they are vulnerable. We didn't have success today, but it's just a question of time,\" said the group, which says it was founded in 2014 to bring together all of Venezuela's \"groups of resistance.\" Meanwhile, some opposition supporters condemned the attack, The New York Times reports. \"This is not the way out of the Venezuelan crisis,\" Nicmer Evans, a political scientist aligned with the opposition, tells the paper. \"No one wants the exit to be the death of someone to resolve this country's situation.\" Saturday's alleged attack comes less than three months after Maduro won a second term as president in an election that his main rivals and independent observers say was marred by fraud. Maduro, 55, succeeded Hugo Chavez when the longtime Venezuelan socialist died of cancer in 2013. Since taking power, Maduro has presided over a collapsing economy, hyperinflation, widespread hunger and a mass exodus of refugees seeking to escape dire conditions inside Venezuela. Maduro's government was the target of an assault last June, when \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, a rogue pilot dropped grenades from a helicopter on the Venezuelan Supreme Court and fired on the Interior Ministry. One of Venezuela's most wanted men,  P\u00e9rez died in January after government forces launched an attack on an alleged terrorist cell. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.",

Updated at 3:24 p.m ET President Trump again threatened a government shutdown unless Congress funds his border wall. At a joint news conference at the White House Monday, along with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the president said \"If we don't get border security after many, many years of talk within the United States I would have no problem doing a shutdown.\" Trump renewed his demand for border wall funding as well as changes to U.S. immigration law in a tweet Sunday, saying \"I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security.\" Republicans, who hold majorities in both the House and Senate, have not been able to pass the immigration changes the president wants. And GOP leaders in Congress are reluctant to see a government shutdown this fall, just weeks ahead of the midterm elections. I would be willing to \u201cshut down\u201d government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country! Trump said he had no \"red line\" in so far as the amount he wants Congress to approve, and that he will \"always leave room for negotiation.\" Trump also said he would be willing to meet with Iran's leaders \"anytime they want, no preconditions.\" But he warned that Iran must \"never be allowed\" to possess nuclear weapons. In May, the Trump administration withdrew from an international, multilateral nuclear weapons deal the Obama administration had entered into with Iran and other key Western allies. At the time, Trump said the deal was \"defective at its core.\" Earlier this month in an all-caps tweet, Trump warned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to \"Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.\" Monday's news conference follows a White House meeting that Trump held with the Italian prime minister. Conte shares Trump's populist tendencies as well as his skepticism about immigration. \"Italy has taken a very firm stance on the border, a stance few countries have taken,\" Trump said during a brief photo op in the Oval Office before the joint news conference. \"Frankly, you're doing the right thing in my opinion.\" Credit:  AP Conte was the only G-7 leader to embrace Trump's call to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the diplomatic club \u2014 an idea that was quickly quashed by other G-7 countries. While Trump and Conte are potential allies, Italy has failed to boost its defense spending to levels the president wants. Last year, Italy devoted an estimated 1.13 percent of its overall economy to defense, less than Germany. \"We have a lot to talk about having to do with trade, having to do with our military,\" Trump said at the news conference. \"The United States has a very large deficit, as usual, with Italy \u2014 about $31 billion. And I'm sure we'll straighten that out pretty quickly.\" The president, as is his habit, cited the trade deficit in goods only. Counting services, the U.S. has a slightly larger trade deficit with Italy \u2014 nearly $35 billion. Although he was expected to, Trump did not use the news conference to tout some positive economic news. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent between April and June. That's the fastest pace in almost four years, though it's not clear whether that signals the beginning of a sustained acceleration in growth or just a temporary \"sugar high\" from tax cuts and increased government spending.",

As soon as the sun comes up, Nhia Lee starts working in the garden. Lee tends a half-acre plot overflowing with fresh herbs near her home in Chepachet, R.I. She spends mornings weeding, watering and harvesting fresh lemongrass, lemon balm, lemon verbena and several varieties of mint before heading to a local warehouse to work the 3:30 to 11:30 p.m. shift. Lee, who came to the United States in 1989 as a refugee from Laos, insists that she doesn't mind the long hours, explaining, \"Immigrant people like me want opportunities to reach our goals of having a better life here.\" One of those opportunities came last spring, when Lee started selling herbs to Sanctuary Herbs of Providence. She called it \"a chance to step out of the box and do something new.\" For co-founders Eliza Sutton and Christina Dedora, launching Sanctuary Herbs of Providence was about more than just starting a new business. They founded the start-up after the 2016 election to showcase the important contributions of farmers from around the world who make their homes in the U.S. The herbs for Sanctuary Herbs of Providence's teas are grown by first-generation immigrants.\n                \n                    \n                    Cyndee Fand @ The Creative Counter\n                    \n                \nhide caption The herbs for Sanctuary Herbs of Providence's teas are grown by first-generation immigrants. \"We were so concerned about the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee attitudes in the current political climate and we felt like we needed to do something,\" Sutton recalls. For Sutton, a food access activist, and Dedora, a farmer, bringing people together around food was a natural fit. The pair, who had been involved in various farm and social justice enterprises in Providence, R.I., had connections with both immigrant and refugee farmers and nonprofit organizations working with populations of first-generation Americans. After doing some outreach to identify potential partner growers, the company acquired contracts to purchase locally grown herbs in the summer of 2017. Herbs such as mint, lavender and chamomile are staple ingredients in herbal teas. Sanctuary Herbs of Providence opted to focus on tea because of its international origins. Once fresh herbs are dried, blended and packaged into teas, no refrigeration is required and tea has a longer shelf life than other fresh, locally grown products. The company, which launched with 11 tea blends, is also the sole farm-to-teacup business in Rhode Island. Its top sellers are Cloud 9, a blend of spearmint, tulsi and lavender, and Glitter, made with lemon verbena, lemongrass, ginger and peppermint. Sutton and Dedora sign contracts with the growers, purchasing fresh herbs at market rates. Growers come together at the beginning of the season to talk about planned crops, ensure that the quantities will meet the demand and discuss potential new tea blends and the herbs needed to produce them. The tea, which retails for $7.50 per ounce, is sold at local farmers markets and via the company's online store and served in several local coffee shops and restaurants. The greater the demand, the more income Sanctuary Herbs of Providence generates for its growers. \"We hope that we're improving the lives of these individual farmers by providing income and creating community,\" Sutton says. \"In this time of uncertainty, every little bit helps.\" The community thinks so, too. The tea has gained a cult following. \"I hear people tell me, 'I'm addicted to the tea,' \" Lee says. Last year, Sanctuary Herbs of Providence worked with eight farmers. Thanks to demand for the tea, the number of farmers supplying herbs to the company has doubled. Sutton hopes to continue increasing the number of partner farms as business grows. A recent partnership with the African Alliance, a nonprofit that works with refugees from Africa, has helped expand their local grower network. \"We're really committed to these farmers, to doing what we can in this very dire time to make a difference,\" she explains. The 16 farmers growing fresh herbs include Manny Costa, a retired millworker who emigrated from Portugal in 1973. He grows several varieties of herbs, including spearmint, peppermint, chocolate mint, lemon balm, basil and turmeric for the tea company. Sutton and Dedora buy all of the herbs the farmers can grow. Costa appreciates the additional income Sanctuary Herbs of Providence provides and the pro-immigrant message steeped in its mission. \"Some people make fun of me for growing herbs but I ignore them; those people are closed-minded,\" he says. \"I joined [as a grower] because I like working in the garden [and] I thought it was a good idea.\" Other farmers include Chang Xiong, who started farming in Cranston, R.I., after arriving in the U.S. from Laos, and Liberian immigrant Garmai Mawalo, who grows African basil, rosemary and lemongrass. As the brand gains recognition, several farmers who are not immigrants and some refugee farmers have reached out about selling herbs to the startup. For now, Sutton says, they'll stick with the original intent to boost the profiles of first-generation Americans. Costa attends regular grower meetings and appreciates opportunities to interact with farmers from other cultures and contribute ideas for what herbs to grow in upcoming plantings. The community, he says, is one of the best things about being involved with Sanctuary Herbs of Providence. For Lee, the business represents a chance to chart her own path to success \u2014something she's dreamed of doing since landing in the U.S. when she was just 11. After a successful year of selling herbs, she tripled production this spring and hopes to rent additional land to grow even more herbs next spring. She brought in partners, recruiting her mom and two friends to help turn Lee Family Farms into a thriving family business. \"It makes me feel good that I have someone that needs me to provide produce for them,\" she says. \"We're starting small, but who knows where it will take us?\"",

            "article_content": "Turkey's incumbent president won re-election in snap elections that he had called for more than a year ahead of schedule. Critics say it's part of a blatant power grab.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won another five years in power. That's according to unofficial results from yesterday's election. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports Erdogan's ruling party and its ally will run Turkey's Parliament as well. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: As was the pattern in previous votes, the early returns were heavily in Erdogan's favor, and that lead was slowly chipped away during the night as Turkey's larger urban centers weighed in. But Erdogan's margin never fell below 50 percent in these unofficial returns, giving him a first-round win. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Through interpreter) Our nation has given me the duty of presidency and the executive, and also given a majority to the People's Alliance in the Parliament. Security during the election and the freedom to cast votes is the symbol of the maturity of Turkish democracy. KENYON: The second-place vote-getter, Muharrem Ince of the secular People's Republican Party (ph), energized voters and raised hopes of an upset. But the opposition said the playing field was tilted against it from the beginning. Erdogan moved the elections up by more than a year, and the largely pro-government media gave the lion's share of coverage to Erdogan and the ruling party. Outside one Istanbul polling place, Ilhan and Aynur Aslan's family revealed the kind of splits that mark today's Turkey. Some were Erdogan supporters, others firmly opposed to granting him another term. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Turkish). KENYON: Ilhan and Aynur pointed to their youngest son, just turned 18 and casting his first vote. One of their daughters said no matter who wins, things have to change in Turkey. Her brother agreed, saying he definitely believes people's rights are being violated when they have to worry about being arrested for posting an opinion on social media. But as the results came in, it became clear that voters had opted for stability rather than change. In his victory speech in the early hours of the morning, Erdogan chose to focus on challenges still facing the country - the threat of terrorism from Kurdish militants and those Erdogan blames for a failed coup in 2016, as well as the conflict next door in Syria that has left millions of refugees in Turkey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERDOGAN: (Through interpreter) Turkey made its decision in favor of fighting decisively against all terrorist organizations. At the same time, these results show we will continue to liberate Syrian lands and open the way for our guests in our country to return home safely. KENYON: Faced with such tough rhetoric, some voters are wondering if Erdogan intends to fulfill one of his campaign promises - to lift the state of emergency he's been governing under since 2016.

For many migrants, the train is the next step in their journey north. This converted schoolhouse still chirps with the sound of children. A volunteer teacher points at her eye and elicits the English word: \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice 'ojo'?\" she asks the group of 6- to 10-year-olds. They hesitate and look at one another until one of them gets it, and they join in a collective scream: \"Eye!\" It feels like a bit of normalcy for this group of Central American children who fled their home countries and are temporarily living in a family shelter in Mexico City. A young Honduran woman, who asked NPR not to use her name because she has been threatened back home and in Mexico, watches her two children buzz around the classroom. \"We had no other option but to leave,\" she says. She is one of thousands of Hondurans escaping one of the world's most violent peacetime countries, which has been ripped apart by bloody gang conflict. She brought her two children along Mexico's terrifying migrant trail by herself, months into her third pregnancy. She is due in August. But this tremendous risk was worth it because all her attempts to find safety in Honduras failed. \"My ex would beat me,\" she says. \"He was jailed after I reported it. But from that moment on, he's been threatening me.\" In Honduras, she moved to a new house. He was released from jail and found her there. She moved again. He found her again, even angrier that time around. He threatened to kill and mutilate her, and her pleas for protection for the children fell on deaf ears. He said he would kill her in front of them. She set out from Honduras with a plan: to reunite with extended family in the United States and request asylum. If she could get there quickly enough, she could be around her family to give birth. But those plans were shattered. \"Now I'm really thinking through what to do since the president is taking kids from mothers,\" she said of the Trump administration's family separation policy, which the president has now overturned through an executive order. \"I've been doing everything to protect my kids, and if they were to take them from me, that would be the worst possible thing.\" Selvin arrives at La Sagrada Familia, as part of his journey from Honduras.

He is one of thousands of Hondurans escaping one of the world's most violent peacetime countries. Confusion over U.S. rules After an intense public outcry, on Wednesday, President Trump replaced the policy of separating children from their parents after catching them crossing the border illegally with a policy of detaining the whole family together. The new plan raises questions about whether or when the children already separated will be reunited with their families. Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to narrow the grounds for asylum, putting in doubt whether the Honduran woman in this Mexico City shelter would be eligible under the new rules. Many migrants are wrestling with the administration's changing immigration policies, says Sister Magdalena Silva, who runs the migrant shelter. \"They're waiting to see how Trump reacts and what he decides to do from day to day,\" she says. \"In some way, they're trying to measure what the impact of his policies could be for them.\" As migrants and asylum-seekers decide whether to risk the effects of the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy to prosecute all adults caught crossing the border illegally, Mexico's role as a possible destination country for Central Americans becomes more important. The number of people seeking asylum in Mexico in 2017 was almost seven times higher than the total in 2014, according to government data. This year is on track for even more. Central American migrants rest in a shared room for men only at the migrant and refugee center.\n                \n                    \n                    Alejandro Cegarra for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Central American migrants rest in a shared room for men only at the migrant and refugee center.

The Mexican government's refugee assistance agency has a 2018 budget of just $1.3 million and only has 15 protection agents in the entire country responsible for making decisions on more than 7,000 pending asylum claims, she says. Silva says there are never enough resources for Central Americans fleeing violence. \"We officially have space for 30 to 35 people, but there are 80 in here right now,\" says Silva of her nonprofit shelter, which is funded primarily by the Catholic Church, the United Nations Refugee Agency and civil society groups. It does not receive funds from the federal government. It's one of the few full-service shelters in Mexico at which Central Americans can stay indefinitely. While it has tight security, it's an open-door shelter; families can come and go. It has an informal school for the youngsters and gives some vocational training to adults. It offers free legal and mental health services. \"Mexico is a destination country for some people, but it can't be permanent for many because organized crime also travels with them and can find them here in Mexico,\" says Silva. This was the case for the pregnant Honduran mother of two at another shelter in southern Mexico. \"Someone called my mom [back in Honduras] and told her they had figured out where I was and that my ex was coming to chop me into pieces,\" she says. Risking it all on \"The Beast\" Two Central American migrants rest on the railway through which La Bestia crosses near the Sagrada Familia shelter.

Experts estimate that 400,000 Central Americans enter Mexico as migrants or refugees each year. Two hours east of the capital, in Apizaco, Tlaxcala state, a group of migrants runs to jump on the freight train known as La Bestia (\"The Beast\") to continue their journey north. A woman, scared to jump on herself, gets on a man's back, and he tries to run both of them up to speed for the train. As he grabs a ladder on one of the cars, he gets pulled down by the momentum of the train. He and the woman go tumbling, their limbs just inches from train grinding the tracks. They're scraped and bruised. \"People do it because they're fleeing poverty and have to make this journey with practically no money,\" says Sergio Luna, the director of the Sagrada Familia migrant shelter two hours east of Mexico City. He says there are more than 100 nonprofit migrant shelters like it across Mexico. \"A trip by train is tremendously difficult and dangerous; migrants are abused in southern Mexico primarily by criminal groups,\" he says. Sexual assault, theft and kidnapping are a regular part of the migrant route. And it has become even more treacherous as Mexico's enforcement has clamped down, deploying local, state and federal police plus the army and marines to support immigration officials in stopping migrants. Luna and other migration experts estimate that 400,000 Central Americans enter Mexico as migrants or refugees each year and that as many as half of them are detained by Mexican authorities. As the number of people seeking asylum in Mexico has increased, so have deportations. Mexico deported more than 78,300 Central Americans to their home countries in 2017, according to the government's immigration department. From January to April 2018, Mexico's deportations of Central Americans have increased more than 50 percent, to almost 35,000, compared with the same period last year. Mexico has been a loyal collaborator with the United States on immigration, stopping hundreds of thousands of Central Americans en route to the U.S. But that hasn't eased U.S.-Mexico tensions over immigration. \"What Mexico was doing on immigration never seemed to be enough for the Trump administration,\" a former senior U.S. official with knowledge of Mexico told NPR, asking not to be identified to be able to speak candidly.

He plans to change the way Mexico enforces immigration policies. \"After the victory of our movement, we will defend all migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,\" he said in a speech on Tuesday. \"Military and police force will not be used to repress the [migrant] population,\" says Alfonso Durazo, L\u00f3pez Obrador's public security adviser. \"We will primarily use diplomatic channels with the origin countries of these migrants to reach some kind of agreement.\" As furor over Trump's zero tolerance policy hits Mexico \u2014 as illustrated by a June 21 protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City \u2014 the next president may feel pressure to act. \"Trump's immigration policies could force L\u00f3pez Obrador into a corner,\" the former senior U.S. official told NPR. The new government may \"take their foot off the gas\" on migration enforcement, leading to even more tense relations between the countries. What's clear is that migrants and asylum-seekers will not stop coming, says Sister Magdalena Silva from the Mexico City refugee shelter. \"The numbers will keep increasing,\" she says. \"It's not only the situation of violence and poverty [in Central America], political crises in places like Nicaragua and Venezuela mean that even more will keep coming.\" Selvin holds a Bible, which he says is the only thing that hasn't been stolen from him.

Hardliners in her conservative bloc want to bar asylum-seekers from entering Germany if they've already applied or registered for asylum in other European countries. Updated at 1:54 p.m. ET Thursday In her fourth term as German chancellor, Angela Merkel is going through her biggest political crisis. A struggle over migration policy has threatened her government. The political opponent undermining Merkel's political line comes from her own coalition \u2014 from Germany's interior minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). More than 1 million migrants came to Germany in 2015 and 2016, following Merkel's 2015 decision to leave German borders open for them. According to Seehofer's so-called asylum \"master plan,\" Germany should start turning back migrants at the border who previously applied for asylum or registered as asylum-seekers in other European countries. Merkel is strictly against this change, saying such a unilateral move by Germany could threaten the very unity of Europe. \"We think that turning people back without consultation at our borders, as a country at the heart of Europe, could lead to negative domino effects that could also hurt Germany and ultimately lead to the questioning of European unity,\" she said at a press conference on Monday, after a meeting with her party's leadership. With neither leader budging, the conflict escalated over the weekend, leading to fears that the government would collapse. But both parties agreed Monday to postpone a final decision. Seehofer has given Merkel a two-week deadline, until July 1, to make deals on migrants with other European countries. Merkel will meet with other EU leaders at a summit late next week. \"Seehofer has the majority of the people behind his position, as well as big sections of Merkel's CDU and all of his CSU,\" observes political scientist Heinrich Oberreuter. \"Those are all very interested in security and legal force. Merkel's argument for Europe is substantial \u2014 but not popular.\" President Trump also weighed in, tweeting Monday: \"The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!\" Crime in Germany has in fact dropped, according to government figures and a statement by Seehofer released May 8: \"At roughly 5.76 million, the number of criminal offenses committed in Germany is the lowest since 1992,\" Seehofer said. The backdrop of Bavarian elections Merkel and Seehofer both argue that the law is on their side. \"Seehofer's version is all about restoring law and order at the border. Pushing back refugees who have already been registered in another EU member state would be against EU rules,\" says Franz Mayer, an expert on European law. In opposing Merkel on immigration, the CSU may have a bigger aim, Mayer warns: \"Arguably, their real motivation is to push Chancellor Merkel out of her office. The whole development must be seen against the background of upcoming elections in Bavaria, the homeland of the CSU, in fall.\" The CSU fears that without a tougher migration policy, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party \"will become stronger in Bavaria at the expense of the CSU,\" says J\u00fcrgen Falter, a political scientist and expert on Germany's far right. \"After all, the current debate is kind of a reaction to the politics and polemics of the AfD. \" In elections last September, the AfD became the first far-right party to win seats in the German Bundestag in half a century, mainly due to its populist, anti-immigrant agenda. There are claims that Merkel's politics created the political space for the AfD. \"The AfD is a product of the refugee crisis and the corresponding consequences people are feeling today,\" says Falter. \"By now, the AfD has established itself as a protest party. They are the only party represented in the German parliament being strictly against the German asylum and migration policy.\" By taking a hard line on migration, CSU hopes to position itself as a strong alternative to the AfD in Bavaria's elections. Merkel's prospects If Merkel can't reach a comprehensive solution with EU countries in the next two weeks, the situation could quickly escalate, experts warn, possibly leading to a collapse of her coalition. One possible scenario: In Bavaria, Seehofer could order Germany's border police to close the international borders to refugees. If that were to happen, Mayer says, Merkel would have the authority to fire Seehofer. That in turn could mean the CSU would leave the government \u2014 which could lead to fresh elections, which might benefit the AfD. While Merkel is determined to reach a European solution, Falter argues that she could eventually compromise to save her government. But, he emphasizes: \"Merkel does not want to be the gravedigger of Europe.\" Editor's note: This story has been updated to note President Trump's inaccurate claim in a tweet about migration that Germany's crime rate was \"way up.\"",

She acknowledged that the Trump administration changed the way it is enforcing immigration law, resulting in separation of thousands of children from parents entering the country illegally.\n                \n                    \n                    Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen takes questions from reporters at the White House on Monday. She acknowledged that the Trump administration changed the way it is enforcing immigration law, resulting in separation of thousands of children from parents entering the country illegally. Updated at 7:55 p.m. ET Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is continuing to defend the Trump administration's controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that results in separating children from their parents who enter the U.S. illegally. Nielsen appeared at the White House press briefing on Monday, falsely blaming Democrats for the current crisis and arguing that the impetus is on Congress to pass a law to close legal loopholes. \"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\" Nielsen said at one point, even while making a contradictory claim that the administration has not changed its policy and is simply enforcing the current law. \"Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law,\" Nielsen asserted. As many fact-checkers have found, there is no such law requiring children to be separated from their parents if they illegally cross the border. And Republicans control Congress, not Democrats. As to why Trump himself won't immediately reverse the policy \u2014 which she continued to deny changed \u2014 Nielsen said that the president wants \"a long-term fix.\" However, later in the briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders wouldn't say whether any legislation Congress may pass to rectify the situation would have to include full funding for the border wall Trump wants. Nielsen also said it was \"cowardly\" of Democrats to claim that children were being used as leverage for the wall. \"The children are not being used as a pawn,\" Nielsen said, arguing that it was \"smugglers and traffickers\" who were using them to try to get into the country illegally. \"We are trying to protect the children, which is why I'm asking Congress to act.\" \"We are a country of compassion. We are a country of heart,\" she added. \"We must fix the system so that those who truly need asylum can in fact receive it.\" And when asked if the stringent policy was being enforced to send a message of deterrence for others who may consider trying to cross the border illegally, Nielsen said she found such a suggestion \"offensive.\" But White House chief of staff John Kelly, who previously led DHS, told NPR's John Burnett in an interview last month that family separation \"would be a tough deterrent.\" \"They're not bad people. They're coming here for a reason. And I sympathize with the reason. But the laws are the laws. But a big name of the game is deterrence,\" Kelly told NPR. Nielsen had previously defended the policy in a series of tweets on Sunday night; earlier in the weekend, her agency said it had separated nearly 2,000 children from adults over the course of six weeks at the U.S. Southern border. This misreporting by Members, press & advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive. As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry. \"The United States will not be a migrant camp, and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\" President Trump said midday on Monday, after blaming Democrats for current U.S. immigration policy. He added, \"Not on my watch.\" \"Immigration is the fault \u2014 and all of the problems that we're having \u2014  because we cannot get them to sign legislation, we cannot get them even to the negotiating table. And I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault,\" Trump said. \"They're obstruction. They're really obstructionist, and they are obstructing.\" Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have struggled to figure out how to discuss the separation policy that many say they oppose. Several Senate Republicans pushed back on the White House policy, but most stopped short of directly criticizing Trump. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday that he agrees with Nielsen that it is up to Congress to pass a long-term legislative fix to keep families together at the border. \"I think that's true,\" Cornyn said. \"The only thing the White House changed was their enforcement policy. They said we're going to enforce the law against everybody who comes into the country illegally.\" Cornyn was one of a number of Republicans who said the choice comes down to a decision between enforcing laws separating children from parents who are charged with crimes and ignoring those laws. Cornyn said there are other laws that require children to be taken care of separately from parents who violate laws. He said he thinks the solution should be to keep families together while they await an expedited hearing before an immigration judge. Cornyn said he plans to introduce legislation to keep children with their parents, but he would not commit to timing. But many Republicans, like Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, disagree. Hatch was among those to denounce the policy on Twitter early in the day. HATCH on the child separation policy:\"A policy that leads to separating children from their families is wrong.\" #utpol pic.twitter.com/yUU2YiRwkC He went further Monday night, telling reporters that he believes the White House can stop families from being separated and that removing children from parents is not the right way to deter people from attempting to cross the border illegally. \"I think the White House can fix it if they want to,\" Hatch said. \"I don't think there's any question about that.\" Hatch said a legislative fix is an option, and Congress should lead but the current situation should not be allowed to continue. \"The way it's being handled right now isn't acceptable,\" Hatch said. \"I think we've got to try and keep families together and do whatever it takes to keep them together.\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was the 2008 GOP nominee for president, tweeted his disgust with the current policy, calling it \"an affront to the decency of the American people\" and saying the Trump administration should rescind it immediately. The administration\u2019s current family separation policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and contrary to principles and values upon which our nation was founded. The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do so now. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said Monday night on Twitter that \"The time is now for the White House to end the cruel, tragic separations of families. ... To blame the previous administrations for a wrong committed today is not acceptable. The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security should make the call today.\" Democrats were forceful in pushing back at the administration's claims, with several, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, calling on Nielsen to resign. I\u2019m calling on Kirstjen Nielsen to resign as Secretary of Homeland Security. Under her watch, our government has committed human rights abuses by breaking up families along the southern border. And she has \u200bfailed to be accountable to and transparent with the American people. Nevertheless, throughout the day on Monday, Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the president's policy of splitting children from the adults who brought them into the U.S. \"We do not want to separate children from their parents, you can be sure of that,\" Sessions said. \"If we build the wall, we pass some legislation, we close some loopholes, we won't face these terrible choices.\" Nielsen said the separations are warranted in cases where the parents have broken U.S. law by entering the country illegally \u2014 and that her agency is treating them no differently from the way the government treats parents who break any other laws. But the Trump administration is being accused of handling the cases in a way no other presidency has. \"This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,\" former first lady Laura Bush said in remarks published Sunday night. Bush wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post in which she compared the DHS actions to the U.S. policy of incarcerating Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II. First lady Melania Trump also weighed in over the weekend, with her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, sending a statement to CNN. \"Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\" the statement read, concluding, \"She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\" The DHS policy triggered a lawsuit in February; nearly a year earlier, members of the Trump administration had floated the idea of separating families as a potential deterrent. A number of high-profile Trump officials have spoken in favor of the policy. Last month, Sessions said, \"If you don't want your child to be separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally. It's not our fault that somebody does that.\" Sessions spoke on Monday at the National Sheriffs' Association conference in New Orleans, where he received a lifetime achievement award. In his speech, the attorney general said the U.S. is having \"an important conversation\" over whether it will be \"a country of laws\" or \"a country without borders.\" One reason people voted for President Trump was \"to end the lawlessness at our Southern border,\" Sessions said, adding, \"It's within our grasp. We can do it.\" Sessions said that a loophole in U.S. policy had encouraged people to bring children to the U.S., under the belief that they would not be prosecuted. That resulted in a spike in illegal crossings, he said. \"We do not want to separate children from their parents,\" Sessions said. \"We do not want adults to bring children into this country unlawfully, either, placing those children at risk.\" Nielsen also spoke at the conference, before returning to Washington where she spoke to reporters at the delayed White House briefing. Describing how the DHS and Health and Human Services agencies handle those children, Sessions said, \"They're not put in jail, of course \u2014 they're taken care of. They remain in the country, even though they don't have a lawful process to be here.\" Sessions added, \"That's an enormous cost that's being incurred by our government.\" The backlash against the Trump administration's tactic grew into a protest march on Sunday, with hundreds of people heading to a tent city in the town of Tornillo, near El Paso, Texas, where children have been detained. The Father's Day march was organized by Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for his seat. Cruz introduced a bill to prohibit family separations on Monday. Overall, more than 10,000 children are currently in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has published a guide for families who have been separated after parents or guardians were charged with illegal entry, noting that children who are taken into government custody are transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, \"where your child will be held in a temporary child shelter or hosted by a foster family.\" The guide sheet adds, \"DHS and HHS can take steps to facilitate reunification with your child(ren).\" Last month, Nielsen told NPR that her agency is merely enforcing existing laws, and that criticism of the zero tolerance policy \"is inappropriate and unacceptable.\" That has not stopped what has now become a wave of criticism for the DHS policy of applying the law. Religious leaders are speaking out against the policy, with Archbishop of Miami Thomas Wenski saying on NPR's Weekend Edition that the practice effectively \"weaponizes\" children. Franklin Graham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and a prominent Trump supporter, told the Christian Broadcasting Network on Tuesday, \"It's disgraceful and it's terrible to see families ripped apart, and I don't support that one bit.\" In her tweets Sunday night, Nielsen accused others of distorting reality, saying, \"This misreporting by Members, press & advocacy groups must stop.\" The DHS secretary added, \"if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry.\" The Obama administration also came under fire for its immigration and detention policies, with lawsuits over the practice of holding families in detention centers as well as the conditions at such facilities. By embracing a more hard-line policy, the Trump administration has set off speculation that it's using the threat of separating families as both a deterrent to immigrants and a political tool in the hopes of reshaping U.S. laws. \"You have many people in the Trump administration denying that they're using this as some sort of political leverage,\" NPR's Scott Detrow reports. \"But President Trump is leaning into that pretty hard.\" On Sunday, Trump tweeted, \"The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security & Safety. Don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose!\" On Monday, the president added, \"Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws?\" In Congress, House Republicans have introduced a bill to end the practice of separating families, but it would also require Democrats to agree to federal funds for a border wall. As that argument plays out, others are urging a new attempt to address the root causes of mass migration from people who want to flee troubled or impoverished conditions in countries such as El Salvador and Honduras. Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas tells NPR's Steve Inskeep: \"There's different elements of the government that don't understand what's really going on. Kids are being separated from their parents. In the last two months, there's been about 2,000. The previous year, it was almost 700. And 100 of those kids were under the age of 4.\" Hurd added, \"This is just absolutely unacceptable. Taking kids from their mothers is not preventing terrorists or drugs from coming into this country. And so why we would even think that this is a tool that is needed to defend our borders is insane to me.\" NPR's Danny Nett and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Germany's government is in danger of being brought down over immigration \u2014 the same issue that almost cost Angela Merkel the chancellorship during last fall's elections.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, is in political trouble. Her political coalition is in danger of falling apart over immigration. A more conservative party in her coalition wants Germany to unilaterally exclude certain groups of migrants. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson joins us from Berlin. Hi there, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning again, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess we should remember that Merkel herself is conservative. But there's a more conservative party than hers that's part of this coalition. What is it exactly that they want? NELSON: Yes. Those particular conservatives are in Bavaria. And what they're seeking is to basically stop migrants or asylum-seekers who already have fingerprints in the system or who have been otherwise barred from coming to Germany from entering the border. Right now they are allowed to come in and have their cases heard. And so they say they're going to do this whether or not the - whether the chancellor goes along with it or not. Part of the reason for this is because there is concern about a threat to this party from the far-right Alternative to Germany. They're gaining a lot of... INSKEEP: Oh, even more conservative, even more rightist people are pushing them to go... NELSON: Exactly. Yeah, these far-right people are - in fact will rob them of their absolute majority if surveys are to be believed. The other issue is that there have been some notable crimes committed by a few refugees, which of course are being extended to all refugees. You know, we don't want criminals in this country is the message. So it's creating a real crisis for Chancellor Merkel. INSKEEP: I don't understand this fingerprint thing. So these are people who've already been in some other European country on their way to Germany. And the German idea, at least of the more conservative people, is they just ought to stay in that other country? Is that right? NELSON: Exactly, except that they have to have permission from those countries to be able to be sent back there. And that's something that's lacking. And it's something that Merkel will have to provide in the next two weeks or her coalition partners in Bavaria say they will go ahead with unilateral border enforcement. INSKEEP: Which could lead to any number of consequences. What is Merkel saying about all this as her governing coalition is at the edge of collapse? NELSON: She's very concerned. She looked very grim today when she spoke. But she was also quite defensive and quite firm about the fact that this has to be a European solution. She hasn't mentioned this, but in fact very few migrants or asylum-seekers are actually coming into Germany this year. If we talk about 140,000 crossing into Bavaria back in October 2015 compared to 150 at one of the main crossings now, 150 a month, you know, it's the - things have already changed significantly. But what hasn't changed is that there isn't a cohesive European policy when it comes to immigration. INSKEEP: So Merkel is holding her ground. What about the party that's threatening to blow up her coalition? NELSON: They're holding theirs as well. It seems that at some point the interior minister or the chancellor is going to have to go. The interior minister says he has no choice. It's his responsibility. He calls it scandalous that people are being allowed into Germany who clearly don't belong here whether they've already applied for asylum in other EU countries or whether they've actually been given deportation orders from Germany. INSKEEP: One other thing - President Trump here in the United States has weighed in on this on Twitter this morning and said it was a big mistake all over Europe in allowing, quote, \"millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture.\" Is that what this is really about, fear of cultural change in Europe? NELSON: That certainly is what the populists and far-right parties not only in Germany but elsewhere in Europe are saying. This is their mantra, if you will. And it's what a lot of Europeans are buying into. But I don't know that it's necessarily a majority position, and I guess we'll see what the Europeans come with - come away with at the summit in two weeks from now. INSKEEP: So fear that people with different backgrounds or a different religion, Muslims, might not be able to fit into a democracy, essentially that said. NELSON: That's exactly right. INSKEEP: Soraya, thanks very much as always. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the country, wrapped up its annual meeting Wednesday on a partisan tone. The featured speaker was Vice President Pence, who spoke of the day he accepted Jesus Christ as his savior and of the importance of prayer, but mostly delivered a speech fit for a campaign rally. \"Let me begin by bringing greetings from a good friend of mine who just got back to the White House this morning \u2014 a man who, I can tell you, has been delivering every day to protect faith and restore freedom across this country,\" Pence said. \"I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump!\" Evangelical Christians have been dogged in their support for the administration, polls have shown, and the Southern Baptist Convention reaction was generally enthusiastic. Pence got his biggest standing ovation when he highlighted Trump moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. But for some meeting attendees, Pence's speech was a little too political. J.D. Greear, the group's newly elected president, tweeted minutes later that it \"sent a terribly mixed signal ... commissioned missionaries, not political platforms, are what we do.\" I know that sent a terribly mixed signal. We are grateful for civic leaders who want to speak to our ... https://t.co/BT1SgUXWgj One could call the somewhat mixed reaction foreordained: On Tuesday, a resolution calling to replace Pence as speaker in the interests of showing a more nonpartisan face was defeated, but 3 in 10 attendees favored it. Greear in particular had urged the denomination to step back from politics, including this passage in his speech to the meeting on Monday, prior to his election: \"We believe that Jesus is the lord of the whole earth. He is the king of kings and he is the lord of lords. We believe that he, not any version of Caesar, is the Messiah. He is the Christ, the son of the living God, that salvation is found in him, not in the Republican platform or the Democratic platform, and that salvation did not come riding in on the wings of Air Force One. It came cradled in a manger.\" In general the meeting showed moderates within the denomination in ascendancy, particularly on immigration issues. Resolutions were passed that called for more acceptance of immigrants, criticized the separation of families at the border and urged more generous treatment of refugees. Pence's speech helped bring to a close a gathering that was convened Monday under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told NPR's Michel Martin the day before that the volume of allegations coming out was overwhelming. \"We're a fairly loose confederation of churches. And it just didn't seem likely that there could be the same kind of conspiracy of silence,\" Mohler said. \"What we've learned is that this kind of silence can be just as dangerous if unorganized. ... Things have not come to light that should have long ago come to light.\" That has included the firing and ejection of a prominent seminary's president after it was alleged that he'd been dismissive of harassment and encouraged spousal abuse and rape victims to pray and forgive rather than report crimes to the police.",

There are an estimated 27 million Facebook accounts in Myanmar.\n                \n                    \n                    Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Facebook logo is seen on an advertisement by a local telecom company in Yangon. \"People think that Facebook is the Internet. It comes pre-installed on the phones that they buy,\" says a Yangon-based digital activist. There are an estimated 27 million Facebook accounts in Myanmar. Facebook has apologized in recent months for becoming a tool of foreign interference in elections, disinformation and hate speech in some of the world's most mature democracies. But critics are concerned that there's potential for even greater chaos elsewhere, especially in places where Facebook is the dominant social media platform. That's the situation in Myanmar, where civil war has festered for decades and the end of military rule has unleashed virulent nationalism and intolerance toward minorities. U.N. investigators and human rights groups allege that Facebook has fanned the flames of a conflict that U.N. officials have said amount to ethnic cleansing and bear the hallmarks of genocide. Fighting between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rakhine Muslims, insurgent attacks and military anti-insurgent operations have sent Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh. More than 900,000 Rohingya refugees now live in Bangladeshi camps. U.N. agencies and aid groups have called it one of the world's most serious humanitarian crises. Hate speech reportedly spiked on Facebook after Rohingya insurgents launched coordinated attacks against Myanmar military and police bases in Rakhine State last August. Civil rights groups and digital rights activists in Myanmar are taking action and demanding that Facebook beef up its moderation of Burmese-language content to curb hate speech. They are also trying to educate Internet users about creating a safer, more civil space for online discussions. \"The risk of Facebook content sparking open violence is arguably nowhere higher right now than in Myanmar,\" six Myanmar organizations wrote in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April. In the letter, they warned, \"Our community continues to be exposed to virulent hate speech and vicious rumors, which Facebook is still not adequately addressing.\" Myanmar activists meet with visiting U.S. officials at Phandeeyar, a Yangon-based tech hub and one of several groups that have pressed Facebook to moderate its Burmese-language content to prevent hate speech.\n                \n                    \n                    Anthony Kuhn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Myanmar activists meet with visiting U.S. officials at Phandeeyar, a Yangon-based tech hub and one of several groups that have pressed Facebook to moderate its Burmese-language content to prevent hate speech. Zuckerberg responded to the letter, saying Facebook was trying to do more to address the issues in Myanmar, including increasing \"the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues\" and employing a \"special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe.\" But activists say it's not enough. \"Unfortunately, we've seen very, very little by way of reaction or allocation of resources from Facebook to effectively mitigate and create solutions for these important problems,\" said Jes Petersen, the CEO of Phandeeyar, a Yangon-based tech hub and one of the groups that signed the letter. One factor is the explosive growth of Facebook and the Internet in Myanmar, one of Asia's poorest countries. Most of the country has gained access to the Internet only in the last decade, mostly through mobile phones. \"People think that Facebook is the Internet. It comes pre-installed on the phones that they buy,\" says Yangon-based digital activist Thant Sin. He says that Myanmar, a nation of about 53 million people, has about 27 million Facebook accounts. (Some users have multiple accounts). \"We're falling behind on digital literacy,\" he observes. Thant Sin says efforts to promote digital literacy in Myanmar include teaching people how to protect their personal information, how to control what information they see online and how to keep online discussions free of hate speech. At a Senate hearing in April, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg acknowledged Facebook's problems in Myanmar and promised to hire dozens of Burmese-language moderators. According to Facebook's job ads, some of these positions are apparently based in Dublin, where the company's international headquarters is located. Petersen notes that in Germany, where the government strictly regulates content to prevent hate speech, Facebook has around 1,200 moderators. \"If they were to have the same user-to-moderator ratio for Myanmar,\" he argues, \"they would need to have 700 people.\" And all would have to speak and read the local language, Burmese. Facebook also uses artificial intelligence to identify hate speech, but activists say it often doesn't work. Petersen says Phandeeyar is also pressing Facebook to be more transparent about its operations. \"How much bad content are you removing? How many reports are you getting? How many accounts are you closing down?\" he asks. \"We're not necessarily asking them to disclose sensitive information. We'd just really like to see some numbers.\" Jes Petersen, CEO of Phandeeyar, a Yangon-based tech hub, speaks to visiting U.S. government officials and civil society activists.

Phandeeyar is one of several groups that have pressed Facebook to moderate its Burmese-language content to prevent hate speech. Facebook said nobody was available to answer questions for this report. Speaking Monday at the New America Foundation, the organization's head of global policy management acknowledged that in Myanmar, \"it is a complicated landscape, and there is a lot more we can do there.\" Zuckerberg has pledged to work with civic groups to identify those who disseminate hate speech, in order to shut down their accounts. Last week, Facebook blacklisted a group of Buddhist hardliners in Myanmar. But some monks vowed to keep using the platform to spread their messages, even if they're banned. \"We will keep using Facebook with different names and accounts to tell the truth to people,\" one told Reuters. Earlier this year, Facebook confirmed it had closed the account of a prominent monk named U Wirathu, the leader of a Buddhist nationalist movement. He was jailed more than a decade ago for inciting riots against Muslims. He has since been released and has been accused of using Facebook posts to incite similar violence in recent years. Buddhist nationalists in countries including Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka believe that Muslims intend to replace Buddhism, the majority religion in these countries, with Islam. This is what they believe happened many centuries ago in Afghanistan and Indonesia. Myanmar activists say Facebook should have taken action against U Wirathu and his numerous followers years ago. \"Facebook is making zillions of dollars from [the] Myanmar community,\" says Hla Hla Win, an Internet entrepreneur. \"They can do a lot better than that. Be more responsible about it.\" The activists caution that they're not trying to kick Facebook out of Myanmar. They just want it to solve its problems and realize its potential as a force for good.",

The rescue ship was stranded this weekend after Italy and Malta refused to allow it to dock. A rescue ship carrying more than 600 migrants will be allowed to enter the Spanish port of Valencia, after it was turned away from ports in Italy and Malta. The ship Aquarius rescued 629 people in the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday, \"including 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 other children and seven pregnant women,\" Reuters reports. The ship was left stranded at sea over the weekend after it was denied access to the Italian and Maltese ports. Italy, which has a new, anti-immigration government, suggested that Malta take in the migrants. Malta objected, saying that it had been Italian authorities who coordinated the rescue to begin with, The Associated Press writes. Aid workers aboard said that food would run out by the end of the day on Monday, The Associated Press reports, and they reported injuries ranging from burns to hypothermia. The U.N. refugee agency said Monday that there was \"an urgent humanitarian imperative\" to act, calling on governments to accept the distressed migrants now and resolve \"broader issues\" later. Spain answered the call, opening the port of Valencia to the vessel, Lucia Benavides reports for NPR from Barcelona. But AP notes that \"it wasn't immediately clear if such a voyage was feasible given the distances involved \u2014 the ship is now more than 1,400 kilometers (over 750 nautical miles) from Valencia.\" The number of migrants arriving in Spain has been on the rise, Benavides reports, while the number of sea arrivals in Italy \"has dropped 77 percent compared to this time last year, following controversial deals with the Libyan Coast Guard and investigations into NGO search-and-rescues.\" Italy's government is led by two populist parties tied together, in part, by hostility toward migrants and a desire for a tougher stance on immigration. A little more than a week ago, Italy's new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, told a crowd that \"Italy and Sicily cannot be Europe's refugee camp\" and \"the good times for illegals are over,\" Deutsche Welle reports. Closing Italy's ports to Aquarius represented the first test of the populist government's rhetoric, and Italy stood firm, despite outcry from the European Union and the U.N. The BBC writes that the treatment of rescue ships is governed by international law: \"The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. \"It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. \"It also clearly states that the relevant government \"shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable\". \"Given that the migrants were rescued off the coast of Libya, the closest ports are likely to be either Sicily in Italy or Malta.\" Italy has long protested that sending migrants to the nearest port has distributed Europe's burden unequally, hitting Italy particularly hard. It's an argument that human rights advocates also have supported. Italy's new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, pointed to Malta's refusal to help as evidence of \"Malta's and Europe's unwillingness to intervene in an emergency,\" NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome: \"Matteo Salvini, interior minister and leader of the anti-immigrant party the league, posted [on Twitter] under the hashtag 'ports closed' 'Italy too says no to human trafficking.' \"It's the only way, he said, to make ourselves heard in Brussels. \"Many commentators attribute the populists election success to the European Union's failure to assist Italy in handling the migrant crisis.\" Spain, which announced Monday that it would accept the ship, is also led by a brand-new government, after a no-confidence vote in the former prime minister put the Socialists in power on June 1. The new prime minister said Spain was welcoming the Aquarius out of the \"duty to avoid a humanitarian disaster,\" the AP reports.",

Last weekend, Gauland caused outrage in Germany when he called the Nazi era \"just a speck of bird s*** in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.\" Alexander Gauland, the head of Germany's far-right, nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, provoked widespread public outrage and dismay last weekend when he called the Nazi era \"just a speck of bird s*** in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.\" \"We have a glorious history,\" he told the AfD's youth organization last Saturday, \"and it, dear friends, lasted longer than those damn 12 years. Only if we acknowledge that history do we have the power to shape the future. Yes, we plead guilty to our responsibility for those 12 years. But, my dear friends: Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird s*** in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.\" In elections last September, the AfD became the first far-right party to win seats in the Bundestag in more than half a century, raising concerns among mainstream politicians about the effect the party, with its populist, anti-immigrant agenda, could have on German politics. As opposition leader, the AfD chairs the parliamentary budget committee. As the biggest opposition party, it also has the right to respond first to any statement issued by the government, ensuring publicity and a national platform for its messages. \"The AfD is trying to split society,\" the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung recently warned. \"And there is a crack in the Bundestag.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel called Gauland's statement \"shameful\" coming from a member of the German parliament. She was not alone. Public reaction was overwhelmingly negative. The host of one of Germany's best known political talk shows announced that he would no longer invite Gauland on the show. And Gauland's comments were rebuked by all parties in the Bundestag \u2014 including his own. It was the first time that voices within the AfD firmly criticized their leader, even though this was not the 77-year-old ultra-conservative's first verbal affront. (There was no criticism last year, for example, when he said the government's Turkish-German migration commissioner Aydan \u00d6zoguz should be \"disposed of\" in the Turkish region of Anatolia). Uwe Witt, head of the Alternative Center, a working group of the AfD, was one of the critical voices this time. \"As a politician of the AfD, I apologize to all fellow Jewish citizens, as well as the victims of the Nazi regime and their families, for this unbelievable trivialization by our chairman,\" he said on Twitter. The \"bird s***\" remark could cause legal trouble for Gauland. A complaint filed against him accuses him of inciting hatred. According to the German criminal code, the punishment could be a prison sentence or a fine, but it is unlikely that Gauland will be convicted. Following an AfD leadership crisis summit, Gauland said he regretted the effect his statement had had. He claimed he had been misunderstood: \"Nothing could have been further from my intention\" than to trivialize Nazism, Gauland said. Strategy of \"classical brinkmanship\" Konstantin von Notz, a member of parliament from the opposition Green Party, calls Gauland's remarks \"a serious attack on democracy, diversity, equal rights and the rule of law.\" With the AfD's arrival in parliament, Germany \"now faces a development that had already reached many other countries in recent years,\" he says. The AfD leader's remarks are a textbook example of the party's strategy, says German-Israeli historian Michael Wolffsohn \u2014 a way to provoke and keep opponents off balance.

By a hair's breadth at the far-right margin, but still on the edge. Legal prosecution can be avoided, yet at the same time, there is a reaction of maximum attention caused by provocation. The opponents of the AfD fall for this strategy. Their reaction makes [the AfD] even stronger.\" Hajo Funke, Germany's leading expert on the German far right, tells NPR that Gauland's statement reflects \"a new degree of radicalization\" and clashes with decades of understanding within Germany. \"It is about the rejection of the lessons and consequences Germany learned through the time of the Nazi era,\" Funke explains. \"This is directly connected with the [AfD's] racist exclusion and devaluation of ethnic and religious minorities such as German-Turks, Muslims or refugees. Below the surface, there is also a great extent of anti-Semitism.\" The far right \"radicalizes more and more by the hour\" For the Green Party's von Notz, Gauland's remarks are a sign of ever-increasing radicalization: \"The AfD seems to radicalize more and more by the hour,\" he tells NPR. \"We will see where this might end, but we know from our historic experience this development is more than dangerous.\" Funke warns of \"polarization,\" but the public outrage following Gauland's statement, he says, shows that \"almost 80 percent of the German society demonstrate a united front against this radical party.\" Still, he warns, the AfD poses a \"danger for the liberal order and the rule of law .... If ever in power, they would destroy that very order. The majority of their activists demand national revolution.\" The AfD is speaking to public discontent, he says. But can this party govern? \"The ordinary citizen has to consider whether any of his interests will be preserved, other than unleashing their fury on the established parties,\" Funke says. \"Most decisive for the future development is the extent to which democratic parties successfully address the social and economic fears of the citizens on both the national and local levels. They must also govern competently regarding Europe and the many crises of the world.\"",

The monsoon season is almost upon some of the world's largest refugee camps in Bangladesh. Heavy rains threaten to inundate and cause landslides on denuded hillsides in southeast Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, which the U.N. estimates is now home to more than 900,000 ethnic Rohingya refugees. Many of them fled sectarian violence and military anti-insurgent operations \u2014 described by the U.S. and U.N. as ethnic cleansing \u2014 last year in western Myanmar's Rakhine State. The military operations followed insurgent attacks on police and army posts. It is widely acknowledged as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. And Myanmar holds the key to resolving it, humanitarian assistance groups and officials believe. Myanmar's government says it is willing and ready to take the Rohingya back. But to many observers, conditions to make those returns \"safe, voluntary and dignified,\" as aid workers advocate, appear to be a distant goal. Even in Myanmar itself, thousands of Rohingya remain confined in internment camps. They are a stateless people. Myanmar considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, but many of them have lived in Myanmar for generations.

In most cases, he notes, refugees prefer to return to their original homes. Storella was part of a delegation of U.S. officials that visited Myanmar and Bangladesh this month, in part to assess the feasibility of the Rohingya returning to Myanmar. The delegation was granted access to the northern part of Rakhine State, from which many of the Rohingya have fled, and where entire Rohingya villages were razed. Myanmar authorities did not permit international journalists covering the delegation's trip, including from NPR, to accompany the delegation to the northern part of Rakhine state. But authorities allowed journalists to visit the Thet Kae Pyin internment camp for Rohingya outside Sittwe, the state capital.

The camp, home to some 6,000 Rohingya, is fenced in and patrolled by soldiers. Residents live in bamboo and plastic huts, some with metal roofs. The delegation, led by U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green, spoke with residents and camp leaders. \"So much of what I've seen is, quite frankly, just deeply disturbing,\" a visibly emotional Green told reporters. \"Here, for example, we're looking at all those very young children running around and it suddenly dawned on me: They were all born here. This is the only reality that they know.\" In the past couple of years, the U.S. has provided nearly $300 million in humanitarian assistance to people affected by conflict in Rakhine State and other parts of Myanmar. \"The most important thing that the government can do in the weeks and months ahead is to take concrete steps, to show its seriousness of purpose,\" said Green. Experts say Myanmar's government has not yet done enough to prepare for the refugees' return. But the government points to several areas where it claims it is making progress on the Rohingya crisis. It has built some dwellings for Rohingya outside the internment camps, which are more permanent than those inside, most of which were designed to last a couple of years.

It claims to have housed dozens of Rohingya in transit camps, pending resettlement, after they returned voluntarily from Bangladesh. And it has issued \"National Verification Cards\" to some Rohingya, which it considers a path to citizenship. But it is not clear where the Rohingya will go after the temporary homes and camps. There are fears among Rohingya, experts and aid groups that those shelters could become permanent. Some observers, including Amnesty International, warn that the military is trying to grab land left by the refugees, making it impossible for them to return where they previously lived. Many Rohingya worry that the National Verification ID cards will relegate them to second-class citizenship, arguing that such IDs are for foreigners entering Myanmar. They also say the cards are being issued to children of Rohingya with citizenship papers, thereby downgrading their families' status. They also find it insulting that to get the cards, they must admit to being \"Bengalis\" \u2014 implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Asked if basic services have improved after six years in the camp, since ethnic conflict broke out in 2012, former lawyer and camp leader Kyaw Hla Aung emphatically states: \"No. Also, they decrease. From education, from health care, and [on] every side. And economically, there's no improvement.\" Nor does he see any progress in Rohingya political or legal rights. \"I stand for parliament member in 1990 election,\" he explains. \"Now we cannot vote. So where is law and order?\" A nominally civilian government stripped the Rohingya of voting rights before general elections in 2015. Kyaw Hla Aung warns that a culture of dependency is evolving in the camps, as young Rohingya become accustomed to unemployment and getting their food from international donors. Last year, an official commission headed by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended that Myanmar close the internment camps and give citizenship to all eligible Rohingya. But the repatriation of refugees from Bangladesh appears stalled, with both sides blaming each other for the delays. \"We've heard that [Myanmar authorities] support the Kofi Annan recommendations,\" says Green. \"Implement them!\" The conflict in Rakhine State is only one of several in Myanmar, where ethnic insurgencies have simmered in its border regions since its independence from Great Britain in 1948.

So for now, we're going it alone, without the NLD.\" In January, the ANP's former leader Aye Maung was charged with high treason and jailed for his role in a protest marking the Burmese conquest of the independent kingdom of Rakhine in 1784, a date that Rakhine nationalists never forget. Tun Aung Kyaw insists that Rohingya are illegal immigrants and refers to them as Bengalis. But he says they're human beings who deserve basic rights. \"If they're legally qualified, give them citizenship,\" he says. \"Don't confine them to Rakhine State.

The Rakhine crisis seems to have turned Myanmar in on itself, making many in the country feel that foreigners are unfairly criticizing them. Myanmar's military has denied allegations that it committed atrocities against the Rohingya. The crisis threatens to slow Myanmar's economy by dampening the enthusiasm of foreign investors and tourists. Green warns that the crisis also jeopardizes Myanmar's transition to democracy. He contrasts the current situation with that in 2015, when Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi's party swept to victory in the freest elections in half a century. Green was an election observer, and he recalls watching as citizens celebrated in the streets of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. \"They were expressing a wide-open enthusiasm for a bright future,\" he says. \"And I think what we're all saying is, that future isn't bright unless this challenge is addressed.\"",

President Trump has signed new economic sanctions against Venezuela a day after the country's socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, won elections that have been widely condemned as fraudulent. The U.S. order would clamp down on the South American country's ability to liquidate assets, but the Trump administration fell short of imposing threatened new oil sanctions. Trump said the executive order would prevent Venezuela's government from conducting \"fire sales\" of its assets. \"[This] money belongs to the Venezuelan people,\" he said. Also on Monday, 14 nations from throughout the Americas, including heavyweights such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, pledged to scale back diplomatic relations with Venezuela following elections over the weekend that renewed Maduro's grip on power with a comfortable margin of victory, even though the country's most popular leaders have been barred from running and the opposition boycotted the vote. \"We call for the Maduro regime to restore democracy, hold free and fair elections, release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally, and end the repression and economic deprivation of the Venezuelan people,\" Trump said in a statement. Maduro, 55, replaced long-time socialist ruler Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer in 2013. Since then, Maduro has presided over an economy in freefall, which has spawned hyperinflation, widespread hunger and an exodus of economic refugees. Trump also called for Venezuela to release all political prisoners, a likely reference to the case of Joshua Holt, 26-year-old Utah man who has been imprisoned without charge since he was arrested in Caracas two years ago. The Associated Press notes that Venezuelan opposition leaders \"said the Venezuelan people had delivered a silent by powerful message by largely abstaining from Sunday's vote. The election drew the lowest participation on record for a presidential contest in decades.\"",

Michael Williams's \"Deportation Bus\" that reads \"Fill this bus with illegals.\" She has been a resident of Clarkston, Ga. for nine years and is a refugee from Somalia. Wednesday was the first day of Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams's \"deportation bus\" tour. The Republican candidate for governor is a long-shot in next week's primary election. Williams began his bus tour in a few metro Atlanta cities that have a reputation for being more sympathetic to immigrants than others in the state. About 300 protestors met him at a strip mall in Clarkston, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, which is sometimes called the South's Ellis Island. Emblazoned on the side of the gray school bus are the words \"Fill this bus with illegals.\" The back reads,\"Danger! Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, child molesters, and others on board.\" And, \"Follow me to Mexico.\" The side of the bus features a seal resembling the more familiar one from U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This one, though, reads, \"Michael Williams Deportation Bus.\" Williams has labeled the stops on his tour \"sanctuary cities,\" though they officially aren't. In 2009, state legislators passed a law banning sanctuary cities in Georgia. The \"deportation bus\" tour is set to make 27 stops around Georgia until the day before the primary on May 22. Protesters gather outside state senator and gubernatorial candidate Michael Williams's \"Deportation Bus\" in Clarkston, Ga.\n                \n                    \n                    Dustin Chambers/WABE\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters gather outside state senator and gubernatorial candidate Michael Williams's \"Deportation Bus\" in Clarkston, Ga. In Clarkson, protestors surrounded the door of William's RV as the candidate did private interviews with the news media. The crowd chanted \"No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here.\" Alex Tsegaye, who came to the U.S. from Ethiopia 31 years ago, owns a restaurant at the strip mall where the bus stopped. Even though the message seems to be directed at unauthorized immigrants from Mexico, Tsegaye said he felt targeted. \"Right now, you feel unsecured a little bit,\" Tsegaye said. \"You don't know what's going to happen, even though I'm a citizen.\" Williams spoke briefly to the crowd for less than five minutes, before getting back in the RV and following the bus to its next stop. Polls in the GOP primary for governor in Georgia consistently rank Williams last, drawing just a few percentage points. Williams contends the message on his bus isn't racist, and that it's about law and order. He says his campaign won't actually detain any unauthorized immigrants and drive them to the Mexican border. Although a campaign video featuring the bus seems to imply otherwise. \"We don't want vigilantes out there, we don't want people to take the law into their own hands,\" Williams said in an interview. \"We have no plans at all to put anybody on that bus other than our own campaign staff.\" Other candidates in the race for Georgia's next governor, including the front-runners, have fought over who's strongest against illegal immigration. While home to a large immigrant population, metro Atlanta is known for tough immigration enforcement. Local law enforcement in at least six Georgia counties have official agreements with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help apprehend, investigate, detain, and transport residents facing deportation. Lt. Governor Casey Cagle, the leading candidate in the race, has repeatedly attacked the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, claiming it's a \"sanctuary city,\" and says it's violating state law. Police there recently put a policy into writing that prohibits arresting, detaining, or transporting individuals based solely on a request from ICE. Decatur officials said they're a welcoming city, not a sanctuary city. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, another GOP candidate for governor, recently released an ad with a similar message to the \"deportation bus.\" \"I got a big truck,\" Kemp says in the ad. \"Just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself. Yup, I just said that.\" Unauthorized immigrants in the state are worried this kind of rhetoric may incite actions against them, and the Latino community, said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials. \"They're encouraging people to take matters into their own hands,\" Gonzalez said. \"That's not the way the rule of law works particularly when it comes to immigration. I think it's a dangerous thing that they're doing.\"",

Billionaire George Soros' pro-democracy Open Society Foundations will pull out of Hungary following growing pressure from the right-wing government there. Citing \"an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\" in Hungary, the OSF said in a statement that its decision to quit the country comes amid a crackdown on non-governmental organizations launched by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who won re-election to his fourth term in a landslide victory last month. Orb\u00e1n \u2014 who once received a $10,000 scholarship from the Soros Foundation to study political science at Oxford \u2014 has been locked in an escalating dispute with Soros. Orb\u00e1n accuses Soros \u2014 a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 who survived Nazi-occupied Hungary and later made his fortune in America \u2014 of trying to wrest control of their native country from those elected to office. The OSF calls the campaign against it and its founder a \"hate campaign [that] has included propaganda posters and billboards, invoking anti-Semitic imagery from World War II.\" \"The government of Hungary has denigrated and misrepresented our work and repressed civil society for the sake of political gain, using tactics unprecedented in the history of the European Union,\" said Patrick Gaspard, president of the Open Society Foundations. The exit from Hungary means that the organization's staff there will relocate to Germany. Orb\u00e1n's government recently introduced a bill in parliament to tighten restrictions on NGOs, dubbed the \"Stop Soros\" law. In a speech Thursday after taking his oath, Orb\u00e1n \u2014 who has been in office since 2010 \u2013 criticized liberal democracies, saying they are incapable of \"upholding Christian culture.\" Orb\u00e1n, speaking to his right-wing Fidesz Party in November, accused Soros of promoting Muslim immigration to dilute Hungary's  Christian identity and \"sweep away governments which represent national interests, including ours.\" The OSF (which has been a financial supporter of NPR) says its mission is \"to build vibrant and tolerant societies whose governments are accountable and open to the participation of all people,\" according to its website. \"We seek to strengthen the rule of law; respect for human rights, minorities, and a diversity of opinions; democratically elected governments; and a civil society that helps keep government power in check.\" The exit of OSF from Hungary is seen as a bellwether indicating the country's likelihood of descending deeper into authoritarian rule. The crackdown on the Soros organization is already placing pressure on other organizations that profess a similar mission. As The Washington Post reports, \"A human rights group expects to be banned from assisting or even speaking about refugees. A progressive university is planning a possible retreat into exile. And the country's foremost advocate for a liberal alternative to Orb\u00e1n's self-proclaimed \"illiberal democracy\" is all but conceding defeat.\" Although the Soros-founded Central European University has been rumored to be next on the list of departures, it issued a statement on Tuesday \"reaffirming\" its \"determination to stay in Budapest and to fulfill [our] teaching and research mission in the city that has been our home for the past 26 years.\"",

            "article_content": "On the same day that the U.S. opened its embassy in Jerusalem, more than 50 people were killed when Israeli troops fired on protesters in Gaza. And, primary elections will be held Tuesday in 4 states.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: In Gaza, today is what Palestinians call nakba day, when they mark the loss of land to Israel. But today is also a day for burying the dead. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yesterday was the deadliest day in Gaza since 2014 when a war broke out in the region. Throughout the day yesterday, thousands of Palestinians approached a border fence that's guarded by Israel. Israeli troops opened fire, and more than 50 people were killed. Health officials in Gaza said last night that they had counted more than a thousand people with gunshot wounds. GREENE: Our colleague Steve Inskeep has been reporting from Gaza, and he joins us from there now. Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Hey there, David. GREENE: So wow, all the violence yesterday, the embassy move to Jerusalem - I mean, so much happening. What does Gaza feel like today? INSKEEP: Well, it is a bit of a quieter day as people recover from the violence of yesterday. But we still do see protesters, not far from where we're sitting here, heading down toward the Israeli border fence. And we hear scattered gunshots, which we presume is the Israeli army, firing back. People are not done with this protest. And one question is how much farther Hamas, the biggest power here in Gaza, wants to take this protest. But it's come at a tremendous cost. We stopped by the main hospital in Gaza City this morning and visited, and it was extremely crowded with patients, people with gunshot wounds. It's so many of them, so overwhelming the system that we met one young man who had been waiting 24 hours to be seen at all. GREENE: Wow. Which raises another question - that is, what is driving such intense protests at this moment? INSKEEP: Well, if you talk with Israeli officials or their supporters, they will say - hey, it's Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and is going after Israel. And that is true enough. But residents here - Palestinians will say terrible conditions, which is also true. Many people here are refugees - classed as refugees. Their parents or grandparents were driven off the land at the creation of Israel. They now live in terrible economic conditions and can't really get out of here very easily because it is walled off and fenced off. One of the people we've met while reporting here is a young man named Ahmad Abu Artema. He was an instigator of these protests. He went after this idea of marching toward the fence years before it was picked up by Hamas. He's 33. And he says he's only been able to leave a couple of times from Gaza since he was very small. It is so bad that when he finally did get to Cairo, Egypt, the next country over, he felt like he was still in a battle zone. Let's listen to some of that. AHMAD ABU ARTEMA: What happened with me in Cairo, it was the first time to hear the sound of the civil planes. INSKEEP: Civilian airplanes? ABU ARTEMA: Yes. Here in Gaza, usually I hear the planes, F-16... INSKEEP: The F-16s. ABU ARTEMA: ...Then bombs. INSKEEP: He's reminded of Israeli airplanes, a Pavlovian reaction, he said. It's like he's back in a battle zone just when he goes by a civilian airport. GREENE: Yeah, that's incredible. Steve, is anyone talking about peace right now? INSKEEP: People talk about it, but they don't necessarily mean the same thing. When we talk with Hamas officials, it's clear that they still do not recognize Israel as legitimate at all. Israelis say they're willing to talk about peace, but the political situation in Israel has moved more and more away from a willingness to grant Palestinians their own state. So they say they want peace. They don't mean the same thing. GREENE: Steve Inskeep reporting from Gaza. Steve, thanks a lot. INSKEEP: Glad to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK, politics now. Today is a big primary election day. And it could have an impact on the battle for control of Congress. MARTIN: Yeah, voters in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Idaho and Oregon are going to choose their candidates for the fall. Nationally, Democrats are really focused on the state of Pennsylvania. The party needs to pick up 23 seats to take over the House, and Pennsylvania alone has five seats Democrats think they can flip. GREENE: Yeah. And let's bring in NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow who's in the studio. And Scott, I never mind when the spotlight is on my home state of Pennsylvania. But explain to me why it is at this point, from a political perspective. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: And I'm always happy to talk about Pennsylvania politics, too... GREENE: You are. DETROW: ...As we know. You know, this was already a key battleground state for Democrats because of the focus on the suburbs. They were really eyeing the Philadelphia suburbs to begin with, the seats they could flip, then two things happened to make it way more of a Democratic priority. First is that we've been talking all year about Republican retirements. You had five Republican members of Pennsylvania's congressional delegation leaving. And that included several of these suburban seats in Philadelphia. And then, even more, the state supreme court, a couple of months ago, threw out the existing congressional map as unconstitutional. They said it unfairly favored Republicans. The court drew a new map. These new lines really do favor Democrats, make a lot more races competitive for Democrats. And as a result, Democrats very optimistic - so much so that in one of these Philadelphia suburb seats that's empty, you have 10 Democrats running today. GREENE: For one seat? DETROW: To be one seat - yup. GREENE: My goodness. DETROW: They're feeling the opportunity. GREENE: That's a crowded field. So which races should we keep an eye on today - I mean, not just in Pennsylvania but around the country? DETROW: In Pennsylvania, I'd say the most interesting House primary is the Democratic side of the 7th Congressional District. This is a seat in the Lehigh Valley vacated by moderate Republican Charlie Dent. It's a real Democratic proxy war in a crowded field. You have a conservative candidate, a candidate backed by Bernie Sanders, several others. More broadly, there's been an interesting trend of House Republicans trying to move up to statewide races not doing too well. Voters don't seem to be impressed with Congress this year. So you've got Lou Barletta running for Senate in Pennsylvania. And then in Idaho, you've got Raul Labrador, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, trying to run for governor. He's running in a field against the lieutenant governor Brad Little and Tommy Ahlquist, who's a former doctor saying he's an outsider like Trump - so watching that. If the outsiders win again - if members of Congress aren't doing well, that could be a trend story. GREENE: Wow. Proxy war, so many candidates - I mean, it makes your head spin. DETROW: (Laughter). GREENE: But for political correspondents, kind of a good day. Before I let you go, Scott, I do want to ask about the first lady, Melania Trump. She was hospitalized yesterday. What do we know about her situation? DETROW: Yeah. She underwent a procedure to treat a kidney condition. And the first lady's office says she'll likely remain hospitalized for the duration of the week. This is actually the most serious procedure a first lady has undergone since Nancy Reagan. But President Trump says she's doing well. And the things we've been hearing have been optimistic since the procedure. GREENE: OK. Well, that's good news. NPR's Scott Detrow. Thanks so much for talking to us, Scott. We appreciate it as always. DETROW: Sure thing. (SOUNDBITE OF BON IVER'S \"____45_____\") GREENE: OK. In Brussels today, a key test for America's closest allies in Europe and whether they can stand up to President Trump when they think it's necessary. MARTIN: Yeah, an important meeting happening today - the European Union's chief diplomat is going to host the Iranian foreign minister and his French, British and German counterparts. It is a Hail Mary attempt to try and save the Iran nuclear deal that the U.S. pulled out of last week. GREENE: All right, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: OK. So Rachel says Hail Mary - the odds not great to save this Iran nuclear deal without the U.S. So what are both sides here, the Iranians and the Europeans, hoping to get out of this meeting at best? NELSON: Well, for the Europeans, it's - I mean, a lot of it has to do with protecting European companies that are doing business in Iran, whether it's through financing, like extending financing and other guarantees for European investment there, or, you know, opening up other channels. And we're talking about a lot of money. I mean, in the case of Germany, it's $3.5 billion last year in business deals with Tehran alone. GREENE: That's a lot of money to just stop - to just put an end to. NELSON: And then they also want to get Iran to guarantee that it will continue with what's required of it under the agreement. From the Iranian side, though, they want a little bit more than rhetoric. They really want some kind of commitment because, as you mentioned, it's a Hail Mary pass. GREENE: Well, I mean, we say Hail Mary, but the Europeans seem to suggest at least that there might be some way of carrying on with this deal without the United States. Is that just talk, or is there a potential path here? NELSON: Well, that's the key question. I mean, the Europeans were emboldened by China and Russia signaling that they will continue with the deal as long as Iran fulfills its obligations. But the problem is that as much as the Europeans are doing business with Iran, they do a lot more business with the U.S. And there are a lot of things that are on the table right now, I mean, including these penalizing trade tariffs on aluminum and steel, which still have to be decided later this month. So they need to tread carefully unless, you know - because they don't want to draw the ire or even further alienate themselves from the Trump administration as much as they are frustrated by the president's decision here with regard to the Iranian nuclear deal. GREENE: Anything we're hearing from President Trump or the White House or the administration about the Europeans and their efforts to save this deal? NELSON: Well, we're hearing some conflicting messages. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Sunday that he would like to work with European leaders to come up with a broader agreement to replace the Iranian nuclear deal. But then you had national security adviser John Bolton saying - you know, a much more hard-line approach, if you will - that European firms should be reminded that they will be punished for not adhering to the sanctions. And the ambassador here in Germany certainly hasn't made things easier to interpret. In tweets, he's talked about Germans - you know, basically trying to tell Germans not to do further business with Iran and saying that companies should stand up here and announce themselves if they want to make deals with the, quote, \"mullahs.\" GREENE: Countries always like being lectured by... (LAUGHTER) GREENE: ...Diplomats from other countries. NELSON: For sure. GREENE: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. We appreciate it, Soraya. NELSON: You're welcome.

John McCain speaks at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania during the 2008 presidential campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    William Thomas Cain/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arizona Sen. John McCain speaks at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania during the 2008 presidential campaign. Anyone who has followed the saga of Sen. John McCain or ever reacted with emotion to his words or actions will recognize the man speaking in this valedictory volume. The voice and manner are familiar enough that we can almost hear and see him on every page. It recalls his previous literary efforts (he has written seven books with longtime collaborator Mark Salter), but it also ventures deeper into our collective memories of McCain and his world \u2014 as we prepare to part with both. The Restless Wave is a plain-spoken and often painful personal accounting; a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a contentious career and a defense of controversial political decisions. It may inspire or enrage. But it is less an effort to provoke such conflicting responses than a paean to McCain's idea of America. McCain wants to celebrate the America he knew \u2014 or perhaps only imagined \u2014 in the full flower of its global pre-eminence. Call it heritage or call it myth, it is a concept of America that McCain clearly feels he personifies, and one he senses is passing even as he reaches the end of his own life. At 81, he is battling the same kind of brain cancer that claimed his Senate friend and frequent antagonist Ted Kennedy. McCain knows the odds and even notes that he may not live to see this book published. Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations by John McCain and Mark Salter Hardcover, 288 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? This is a man who should have leave to speak his mind. He has served more than 30 years in the U.S. Senate, after serving almost as long in the U.S. Navy. He suffered more than five years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, ran twice for president as a Republican, once as his party's nominee. Through it all, he has been stubbornly individual, at times cantankerous and even exasperating to friend and foe alike, relishing his political persona as \"The Maverick.\" There are flashes of that McCain in The Restless Wave. He lashes out at conservative talk show hosts and at those who use the Internet \"to spread conspiracy theories and calumnies about candidates to people with an appetite for that sort of thing or an inability to discern what could be true from something spawned in the fever dreams of people who should probably seek psychiatric help.\" The Maverick moniker figured prominently in both of McCain's bids for president, in 2000 and 2008. But in this memoir, McCain picks up the narrative with the latter. He recalls his campaign's near collapse in the previous summer, then revels in recalling how he climbed back to win the New Hampshire primary. He attributes his capture of the Republican nomination to his emphasis on the improving battlefield situation in Iraq. But McCain's march to the White House was blocked that fall by the Barack Obama phenomenon and two major distractions. One was the mortgage-backed-securities crisis that tanked Wall Street and prompted an unpopular bailout for financial institutions and a deep recession for the U.S. economy. McCain bore no special responsibility for that campaign catastrophe, but he does own up to choosing Sarah Palin, his ill-fated running mate. McCain recounts fighting with his campaign staff over his first pick, the Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who had been Al Gore's running mate in 2000. Relenting, McCain looks around as the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., looms. Desperate for a way to reframe the election, McCain goes with the upstart, populist governor of Alaska. \"She was a popular, energetic and accomplished reformer as mayor, governor and as a campaigner,\" McCain writes. He also thought she would appeal to Democrats who had preferred Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama in that year's primaries. McCain notes her knockout speech at the party convention, but he admits it was downhill thereafter. \"She stumbled in some interviews,\" McCain relates, \"and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight. Those missteps too are on me. She didn't put herself on the ticket. I did.\" The bulk of the book strives to re-litigate the major issues of the past dozen years, both before and after the 2008 campaign. We revisit the Iraq War, the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (which the administration of George W. Bush insisted on calling EITs and McCain calls torture), the surge that stabilized the situation, and the later battles over how long the U.S. should stay. McCain also devotes a chapter to his repeated efforts at comprehensive immigration reform, an issue that united him with both Bush and Kennedy but put him at odds with much of his own party \u2014 including in his own state of Arizona. He also devotes substantial space to the struggle he now sees defining U.S. foreign policy, which is the struggle against Russia \u2014 particularly against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He reminds us of his personal duels with Putin, who once said McCain had been driven mad by his years as a captive \"kept in a pit\" in Vietnam. Here is where McCain finally gets serious about talking about the current U.S. president, who rates only passing mentions in the first 270 pages (there are roughly twice as many mentions of Putin). But what thoughts he does give to Donald Trump are troubled. \"I'm not sure what to make of President Trump's convictions,\" he writes, adding later, \"He threatened to deliberately kill the spouses and children of terrorists, implying that an atrocity of that magnitude would show the world America's toughness.\" He also has no use for the Trump stance on refugees. \"The way he speaks about them is appalling, as though welfare or terrorism were the only purposes they could have in coming to our country.\" And: \"His reaction to unflattering news stories, calling them 'fake news' whether they're credible or not, is copied by autocrats who want to discredit and control a free press.\" Most of all, he is disturbed at what he sees as Trump's tolerance of Putin, implying moral equivalence when Trump said, \"We have a lot of killers too.\" McCain responds: \"It was a shameful thing to say, and so unaware of reality.\" McCain also makes repeated reference to Putin's attacks on American democracy through the Internet, which he calls Putin's revenge on Hillary Clinton for supporting popular protests against the regime in Russia: \"[Putin] would seek revenge ... by ordering his trolls and hackers and subcontractors at WikiLeaks to help defeat her.\" Another foreign policy issue especially salient for McCain regards torture and its use by the U.S. in the war on terrorism. He examines the efforts of Vice President Dick Cheney and others in the administration of President George W. Bush to overcome McCain's opposition to anti-terrorism tactics he regarded as torture. Drawing on his hellish experiences in Vietnam as a torture victim, McCain explains why torture is likely to produce misleading or faulty intelligence. But his real point is that torture betrays the American ideals for which he and countless others have risked or sacrificed their lives. At one point, McCain quotes a letter he received from an Army captain who was disturbed at reports of the U.S. using torture on suspected terrorists. The captain writes, \"I would rather die fighting than give up the smallest part of the idea that is America.\" And McCain adds, \"If there is a finer declaration of an American duty and sense of honor, I haven't heard it.\" The Restless Wave constitutes McCain's own declaration. It is framed by a deep commitment to the military and to the traditions of McCain's own family. Descendants of a man who settled in the Mississippi Delta in the mid-19th century, the 20th century McCains produced two Navy admirals (the senator's father and grandfather). The latter stood on the deck of the USS Missouri at the surrender ceremony that ended World War II. He witnessed the beginning of an American era unlike any before it. His grandson has written a tribute to that era, to his own place in it and to his hopes for its future. Those hopes include McCain's long-standing special causes. He cares about the military. He cares about the way our political campaigns are now conducted. He cares about the frayed traditions of Congress and mourns its loss of bipartisanship. McCain also renews his crusade to rein in the campaign finance excesses of the 1990s and beyond, a surge in political spending that beggars the imagination and threatens to upend the electoral system entirely. And he writes at length about the thought process and emotional struggle that led to his vote against his own party's signature legislation in 2017, the repeal of Obamacare. At its best, the prose in The Restless Wave has some of the terse effectiveness we associate with the 20th century writer Ernest Hemingway. And on his final page, McCain returns to the model of the Hemingway character he calls his hero, Robert Jordan of For Whom the Bell Tolls. That novel ends with Jordan lying wounded on open ground, armed to fight one last battle that he knows will end with his death. \"The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for,\" Jordan says to himself, \"and I hate very much to leave it.\" To this, McCain adds his own response: \"And I do too. I hate to leave it. But I don't have a complaint. Not one. It's been quite a ride. ... I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times.\"",

Hundreds of immigrants, the remnants of a caravan of Central Americans that began almost a month ago, set out on the last leg of their journey north in Mexico.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Central American asylum-seekers ride a bus to Tijuana on Wednesday, while passing through San Luis Rio Colorado along the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds of immigrants, the remnants of a caravan of Central Americans that began almost a month ago, set out on the last leg of their journey north in Mexico. Central American migrants are gathering near the U.S. border and say they plan to request asylum from the U.S. government on Sunday. The asylum-seekers have been traveling north through Mexico for weeks. The caravan is an annual event, but this year's gathering has received unusual attention because of sharp criticism from President Trump. The caravan was stalled in southern Mexico earlier this month, and many participants chose to seek asylum in Mexico instead of continuing. But remnants of the caravan traveled on toward the U.S. border, The Associated Press reports, and busloads began arriving in Tijuana late Tuesday. Jean Guerrero of NPR member station KPBS, reporting from Tijuana, says more than 200 people have arrived in the border town. In the U.S., some supporters of the caravan have been marching south toward San Diego to meet up with the migrants and welcome them at the border. At least one group opposed to the caravan has said it has undefined plans to protest this weekend in the San Diego area. What happens next? The Department of Homeland Security says it is monitoring the caravan, promising to enforce U.S. immigration laws and accusing the migrants of having \"the apparent intention of entering the United States illegally.\" That is not what the caravan participants say they plan to do. They say that on Sunday, they will seek asylum, following the legal process for asking for safe harbor from persecution in their home countries. KPBS's Guerrero spoke to Jeimy Pastora Castro in Tijuana, outside the port of entry. Castro, who is from Honduras, was holding her 2-year-old daughter. \"I didn't come here to cross illegally,\" Castro said. \"I came here for help, for the president to have a heart \u2014 since he's a human like us ... and was also created by God.\" \"Both U.S. law and a U.N. treaty on the rights of refugees require that asylum-seekers get a fair hearing,\" Guerrero notes. \"Most of the people in this caravan come from Honduras, where a divisive presidential election has led to killings in the streets.\" DHS says that in anticipation of asylum claims, extra immigration judges and attorneys are being sent to the Southern U.S. border. \"For those seeking asylum, all individuals may be detained while their claims are adjudicated efficiently and expeditiously, and those found not to have a claim will be promptly removed from the United States,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen says. The U.S. offers asylum to those with a \"well-founded fear of persecution\" in their home country, on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a certain social group. Central Americans fleeing violence have found it difficult to receive asylum based on gang violence waiting for them at home, as NPR's Eyder Peralta reported in 2016. The U.S. has tended to identify those people as fleeing crime, which is not grounds for asylum, rather than individual persecution. And the Trump administration has been working to limit asylum further, as NPR's Joel Rose reported last month. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has criticized \"vague, insubstantial and subjective\" asylum claims, is using his power to overturn judicial decisions in immigration court to reshape how those courts work. But to qualify for asylum, or be rejected, a migrant must first be processed at the border. As NPR's John Burnett reported last year, would-be asylum-seekers at the Southern border have described being turned away or threatened with deportation or told by officials that there is no such thing as asylum. Turning away someone seeking asylum without considering his claim violates national and international law. U.S. Customs and Border Protection denies that asylum-seekers are being turned away.",

And then there was the English class assignment involving a Fox News opinion piece that linked Islam, her religion as a whole to a horrific stoning in Afghanistan. The article was accompanied by a picture of a young woman in a headscarf \u2014 a lot like the one that Sana chooses to wear as a Muslim. \"One guy ... like saw the picture and saw me and was like 'it's the same thing,' \" she said. He was linking her to this terrible act in a country she had never been to and knew little about. \"It was bad, horrible,\" she said. As she retells the story months later, she trails off and starts to cry. Going from middle school to high school is always hard, figuring out who to sit with, making friends, etc. But doing it as a Muslim kid of color who covers her hair is even harder. Teaching tolerance More than 42 percent of Muslims in the U.S. report bullying among their school-age kids, according to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a think tank that researches issues that affect American Muslims. And in California, it's more than half, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. And with the rising anti-Muslim hostility, the Islamic Networks Group, an advocacy organization that counters religious bigotry with education, says bullying is becoming almost the norm for Muslim kids. The Afzal family says they are facing that anti-Muslim sentiment in many parts of their lives: at the daughters' schools and in the efforts to build a mosque where the community can pray. But they're dealing with it by telling their own stories through educating administrators, classmates and neighbors. \"It was tough. You know, in our days, it was \u2014 you get slapped with 'kick me' signs,\" Sana's mother, Noshaba Afzal, said. \"But it wasn't a safety issue.\" A lot of what we believe is that religious-based bullying is based on ignorance and miseducation. Ishaq Pathan of the Islamic Networks Group Noshaba worried about her daughter's safety especially after incidents like one in Portland, Ore., in 2017, when two men were killed protecting a Muslim girl from an attacker. So Noshaba helped her daughter figure out how to respond to the bullies. They chose education. The Afzal family contacted the school and two advocacy organizations, including the Islamic Networks Group or ING. \"They deal with situations where they are being targeted or called terrorists. In some situations, this actually comes from the administrators and teachers,\" said Ishaq Pathan, who runs the youth programs at ING. He worked with the school to create a presentation about inclusion and understanding people's differences, including Muslims. Now it's a model that ING pulls out when other schools ask for help \u2014 a half-dozen times so far. \"The main thing that we're focusing on is religious-based bullying,\" Pathan says. \"And a lot of what we believe is that religious-based bullying is based on ignorance and miseducation.\" This year, the school says, it has pulled the offending article from the English class. And Sana says things are better. Her battle is mostly over, but her family's and her community's is not. Seeking a place to pray The family of six prays in a remodeled barn in nearby San Martin with the South Valley Islamic Community. The community has been trying to build a mosque with a community center and cemetery for years, but the project has been a lightning rod. Noshaba remembers the first land-use meeting at the City of Santa Clara Planning Commission in 2012. \"Person after person got up and just blasted,\" she said, \" 'we don't want them here. They're bringing Sharia law. You guys are terrorists.' \" The rhetoric was shocking, she says, interspersed with concerns about the building's environmental impact \u2014 an issue often raised to block mosque construction. Since then, it has been six years of legal back-and-forth. Noshaba says you have to make a choice at moments like these: Accept it, or say: \"No, this is not the America we want it to be. And we know America can be what we want, where it's inclusion and it's our rights. And we just want to practice.\" The opposition has been led by the People's Coalition for Government Accountability and the Gilroy-Morgan Hill Patriots. But Georgine Scott-Codiga, who speaks for the Patriots, says it's not about Islam. \"The bottom line is these people came and bullied themselves into the neighborhood,\" says Scott-Codiga. \"All the traffic, all the cars, the noise. We want to protect that land.\" And, she adds, she understands why people are worried about Muslims changing \"the way of life.\" The Patriots post anti-Muslim rhetoric on its Facebook page and have invited an anti-Muslim speaker, Peter Friedman, to present on his views that Islam is a threat to America. In 2012, the planning board approved the permit for the Islamic center \u2014 and then was sued. The South Valley Islamic Community voluntarily gave up the permits and started the process again, this time with pro bono legal help. The group says the wider community is supportive, but the opposition is loud and trying to bankrupt it before the mosque can be built. Teachable moments Meanwhile, Noshaba's eldest daughter, Maimona Afzal Berta, is a 23-year-old special education teacher in San Jose, Calif., who also wears a headscarf. She says the bullying and problems started for her in fall 2016. \"I'd hear someone shout from outside my classroom, you know, say, 'You're working with ISIS or you're a terrorist,' \" she says, recounting the bullying this spring. Others would bang on her windows and doors, and some would say \"shoot her\" and motion like they were firing a machine gun. She talked to the administrators, and Maimona helped them put together a program to teach kids about inclusion and celebrating diversity. \"So at the end of that school year, it was like, 'wow, like, we made some progress,' \" she said. And so last fall, she was excited to start teaching again. She showed up early to her classroom at Fischer Middle School on Sept. 11 to prepare for a lesson. But as she turned the corner to her classroom, she saw hate. I'm not the issue here. It's not even these students. It's the fact that we haven't done a good enough job of educating our students. Maimona Afzal Berta \"And I find the windows and doors vandalized with words associating me with terrorism,\" she says, stopping to gather herself, crying as she recalls the vandalism. \"You know, 'ISIS,' just like very hateful words \u2014 profanities. And I was just like shocked.\" Maimona went to the school again. She says an administrator asked whether she wanted to change schools. \"Your solution is essentially to get rid of me?\" she said. \"I'm not the issue here. It's not even these students. It's the fact that we haven't done a good enough job of educating our students.\" Imee Almazan, the principal where Maimona teaches, says Maimona turned her trauma into teachable moments for the kids. \"She has such great courage to speak up against the injustice that she had experienced specifically here at our school,\" she said. \"And school is, you know, school is supposed to be a safe place for everybody, right?\" She says children mimic what they see around them, and she believes it's no coincidence that this started happening at a time that Donald Trump started professing not only anti-Muslim sentiment but also rhetoric against immigrants and other minority communities. Maimona says she realized that if this was happening in her school, a place with a majority student body of color, then it was happening other places, too. So when a seat on her neighborhood school board opened up, she applied. In front of an all-male board, she made her case. \"I am the granddaughter of a refugee and an orphan who fulfilled his dreams in this country through an educational experience,\" she told them. She was up against five other candidates all vying for a seat vacated by a board member on the Franklin-McKinley School District board who had been accused of corruption. At first, it was a tie between the two female candidates. And then Maimona was chosen. She went to the podium and was sworn in. And the men on the board all welcomed her, telling her they were excited to have a woman of color among them. She did this, she says, not only to change things for herself but also for her younger sister, for other Muslim families and for any child who feels like an outsider. \"I'm just honestly in shock,\" she said after being sworn in just over a week ago. \"I mean. I've never seen a board member who looks like me. It seems like a dream right now.\" NPR's Leila Fadel traveled across the country to meet young Muslims expressing themselves in new ways.

Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has lost a confidence vote, effectively forcing him out of his post and plunging Sweden's politics into uncertainty. National elections earlier this month resulted in a hung parliament after a far-right party made significant gains. Now, the parliament's speaker will tap another leader to try to form a government, but the shape of any future alliance is far from clear. Lofven, who heads the center-left Social Democrats, has been prime minister in Sweden since 2014. Two hundred four parliamentarians voted against him, 142 voted for him, and three abstained. There are a number of political parties jockeying for power in Sweden. In this month's election, the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats surged with 17.5 percent of the vote. Lofven's Social Democrats took 28.3 percent, and the center-right Moderate Party took 19.8 percent, The Associated Press reported. The ascent of the Sweden Democrats has left the more centrist parties with difficult choices \u2014 ones that other European politicians are also facing. As Reuters puts it: \"The rise of the far right across Europe has forced many traditional parties into an uncomfortable choice of sharing power with populist forces or reaching out to long-standing opponents to keep them out.\" Andreas Norlen of the Moderate Party, who was elected speaker of parliament this week, will start talks with various parties about selecting a possible prime minister. According to multiple news reports, Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson is likely to get the nod. But forming a new government won't be easy. Kristersson's Moderates are \"the largest member of the four-party centre-right Alliance,\" The Guardian reports. Beyond those allies, the Moderates have few options. According to the newspaper, \"The Sweden Democrats have been shunned by all other Swedish political parties since entering parliament in 2010 because of their roots in the neo-Nazi movement.\" And on Tuesday, Lofven ruled out partnering with the Alliance to form a government, The Local Sweden reported \u2014 though the news site stated that a compromise might be possible on several major policy issues. If no government is agreed upon after four attempts, Swedes will have to return to the polls. According to the BBC, that's never happened before. And it appears likely that another election would result in similar deadlock. Lofven may yet remain at the helm. After the vote, he was quoted by the BBC as saying, \"I see good opportunities to continue as prime minister.\" Until another government is formed, he'll stay on as a caretaker prime minister. In the recent election, as NPR's Emma Bowman reported, \"much of the vote has hinged on voter attitudes on the issue of immigration.\" Reporter Sidsel Overgaard has traced the origins of this issue: \"Sweden began opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers after the last election, in 2014. Since then,\u00a0well over 300,000\u00a0people have applied for asylum, mostly from Syria, as well as from countries including\u00a0Iraq and Iran. \"Nationalists point to a rising crime rate and incidents of gang violence as evidence of the need for closed borders. Those on the left point to Sweden's strong economic growth, low unemployment rate and overall relative well-being as a sign that more countries could be following the lead of this self-described humanitarian superpower.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump says it's time for U.S. forces to leave Syria. Roughly 2,200 U.S. troops have been fighting ISIS in Syria. And, another federal court decision blocks Trump's immigration crackdown.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. President Trump says that U.S. troops are going to be leaving Syria. NOEL KING, HOST: That's right. The president has been saying that he wants to withdraw from Syria since he ran for office. And then here he is back in March. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, we're knocking the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Very soon - very soon we're coming out. KING: Then yesterday he tweeted, quote, \"we have defeated ISIS in Syria.\" That caught a lot of people in Washington by surprise, as did the announcement that more than 2,000 American troops are going to be coming home. GREENE: OK, let's start here with NPR national security correspondent David Welna. And David, you were actually at the Capitol as this news about Syria was breaking, right? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: I was, indeed. GREENE: And so what was the reaction? WELNA: Well, you know, it was not great. Even though Congress never actually declared war in Syria against ISIS, lawmakers have been funding military action there for the past four years. And they feel that they should be consulted about things like pulling more than 2,000 U.S. troops out of the - of Syria. But, you know, Trump's decision to do that really blindsided members of Congress. Not even Jim Inhofe, the Republican who's the new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was told about the president's withdrawal plans beforehand. I talked with Inhofe at the Capitol. And here's what he told me. JIM INHOFE: I was somewhat at a disadvantage because I do chair the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I was not aware that it's happening. I think that we should have been aware of it. And this is - apparently it was a decision by the president. And I want to find out from him what led to that decision 'cause I don't know. WELNA: And that's what a lot of other Republican senators told Vice President Mike Pence as well when he went to the Capitol yesterday to have lunch with them. They - some of them were saying if President Obama had done something like this, they'd all be up in arms about it. Some - some senators did express support for President Trump, saying that if we don't need to have American troops on the ground in Syria, well, they shouldn't be there. But generally, I think the sentiment was pretty shocked up on the Hill. GREENE: David, can I just ask you about this announcement because isn't announcing a troop withdrawal exactly what President Trump said he would never do? Like, he criticized his predecessors for, you know, sending signals to the enemy on the ground as he would talk about. WELNA: Yes, it is. But of course, pulling troops out of Syria was also a campaign promise that - that Trump made, much like President Obama made a promise to pull troops out of Iraq. And I think that the concern on the Hill is that by pulling U.S. forces out of Syria, it's going to leave some of the United States allies there sort of high and dry, especially the Kurds. I heard this yesterday in some detail from Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina. This is what he told me. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it's incredibly dangerous. People celebrate when troops come home, including me. But they've got to be under the right conditions. I was in Syria just a few months ago. The 2,200 American soldiers, they're an insurance policy against the rise of ISIS. They're not defeated. They've been hurt. But the biggest loser are our Kurdish allies. Now they're subject to being overrun by Assad, Iran, Turkey. WELNA: Yeah, Turkey says that it's going to send troops into Syria. And the presence of American troops there has pretty much kept them from doing that. And now the Kurds I think are very worried that the Turks are going to come if the Americans leave. GREENE: And maybe target the Kurds, if the Turks do come there. WELNA: Exactly. GREENE: How soon do we think this might happen, David? Did the president give any hint? WELNA: No hint. There's talk that this might happen in 30 days. But the White House is not saying what the details are. They're saying talk to the Pentagon. The Pentagon says talk to the White House. GREENE: Everyone says talk to someone else. NPR's David Welna. David, thanks for this. We really appreciate it. WELNA: You're welcome, David. GREENE: OK, so let's talk about what this actually means on the ground. What will be the effect of this pullout of U.S. troops from Syria? KING: Yeah, it's a big question. Around 2,200 U.S. troops have been fighting ISIS in Syria alongside local Arab and Kurdish fighters. And even in the past couple of days, high-ranking administration officials were saying the U.S. troops were needed there to defeat ISIS. So critics of this move worry that the withdrawal is going to send the message that the U.S. doesn't stick by its allies. And they are also very worried about a power vacuum. GREENE: OK, so some mixed signals with the administration saying U.S. troops are needed now that U.S. troops are leaving. NPR's Ruth Sherlock is in Beirut, and she monitors what happens in Syria for us all the time. And Ruth, what's the reaction on the ground in Syria to this announcement? RUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Well, shock - I mean, the main thing that the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S.'s Kurdish ally there, is saying is, look, ISIS is not defeated. There's still a heated front line in the northeastern town of Hajin, for example. And so they say - they just put out a statement saying the U.S. decision to withdraw from Syria will damage that fight. That statement - I think it's notable that the statement only came through this morning. In the first hours after the announcement there was kind of silence. People - some say privately that they were reeling in shock. And there's a deep anger and sense of abandonment here. You know, these - this militia have been loyal allies. They've lost hundreds, maybe thousands of people as the U.S. backed ground force to fight ISIS. And so they feel abandoned. Civilians there are in panic too. We reached Ahmed (ph). He's 20, and he's studying to be an electrician. He lives in a part of Raqqa, the Syrian city that was destroyed in the war against ISIS. And I asked him how people feel about this decision. AHMED: (Foreign language spoken). SHERLOCK: So here he's saying, look, this is all anyone's talking about here. And now there's a deep fear about who's going to take control of Raqqa after the U.S. leaves. They don't know, for example, if the Syrian regime is going to move in. Or perhaps Turkey might want to take this area - or maybe no one. And he's worried that within this vacuum of power, extremists will take hold in the same way that they did in Iraq after the U.S. pulled out of the Iraq War there. GREENE: And Ruth, I mean, you've been in Syria not so long ago and hearing from people - like, talk more about what's at stake here for Syrians with this decision from Trump. SHERLOCK: Well, there's various aspects to this. And one of those is that it's not just U.S. military troops that are leaving. There are State Department officials and other American actors that have been working to - on the humanitarian situation there. So prior to this White House decision, they all said, look, it's really important to stabilize these parts of Syria, to stop ISIS from coming back. As I mentioned, Raqqa was almost totally destroyed in the war. So there's hundreds - tens of thousands of people without homes. And the State Department's been sponsoring programs to help - restarting schools and funding a central emergency services. Now, the U.S. says some funds remain until the next year, but ultimately that too is winding down. So it's leaving people in a desperate humanitarian situation. GREENE: And David Welna brought up Kurdish allies, I mean, who've been fighting alongside the United States. Could this now leave a vacuum, if the U.S. leaves, that might allow Turkey to come in and put Kurdish forces in danger? SHERLOCK: Yeah, well, with the U.S. leaving, many believe the Turks' may - very little stands in the way for the Turks to try to move into this part of Syria. The Turkish defense minister is reported as saying that Turkey plans to bury the Kurdish militias in the ditches they've dug to defend themselves when the time comes. GREENE: All right, NPR's Ruth Sherlock talking to us about the situation in Syria from her post in Beirut. Ruth, thank you. SHERLOCK: Thank you very much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, there were two new court rulings that have dealt setbacks to the Trump administration's crackdown on asylum seekers. KING: Yeah, that's right. A judge in San Francisco ruled yesterday that immigrants can apply for asylum regardless of how they enter the country. And then a judge in Washington, D.C., said it is Congress - not the White House - that sets the standard for who's granted asylum. GREENE: And one person who's been following this is Lily Jamali from our member station KQED in San Francisco. She's a cohost of The California Report. Lily, welcome. LILY JAMALI, BYLINE: It's good to be with you both. GREENE: Well, let's tick through these two court decisions. First one came down in a San Francisco courtroom, right? JAMALI: Right. So President Trump issued that proclamation just after the midterm election, back when the most recent migrant caravan hadn't yet reached the U.S.-Mexico border. And the argument is there's a crisis. People with no basis for being here are flooding the border. And so the rule the president issued tried to make it so that migrants crossing into the U.S. between official points of entry would no longer be allowed to apply for asylum. The ACLU, an immigrant rights group, said, hold on a second. This is not unchartered legal territory. Congress has specifically looked at this. It's enshrined in the law, the right for people to apply for asylum no matter how they got here. And federal Judge Jon Tigar here in San Francisco agreed with that argument in a ruling last month. The temporary restraining order he issued then was set to expire overnight. And this most recent ruling from yesterday puts a longer-term halt, an injunction, on this policy as the case works its way through the courts. GREENE: OK, so for now, still in place the idea that no matter where you cross, how you come into the country, you can still apply for asylum. So that's one issue. There was a separate issue that was dealt with by a judge in a courtroom in Washington, D.C. What was that? JAMALI: That's right. And that one, it was once against again the ACLU among those filing suit against the administration in response to a policy from back in June, one that came from Jeff Sessions, who was the attorney general at the time. He said claiming to be fleeing domestic abuse or gang violence doesn't make someone eligible for asylum. Well, yesterday a federal judge in Washington ruled that there was no legal basis for that order, that it is up to Congress and not the executive branch to decide who gets asylum. GREENE: OK, so the Trump administration, Lily, has been - I mean, this has been part of their larger argument, that there are too many people who are crossing the border and coming into the United States illegally. What impact, practically, might this have on President Trump and his policies? JAMALI: Well, without a doubt these are setbacks for the administration's approach on immigration. We are now up to at least four federal court decisions blocking the president's immigration crackdown. And the argument that seems to be working for the plaintiffs here isn't so much a humanitarian appeal as it is an argument about the separation of powers among the branches of our government. The courts have been a key check on the administration's attempts to remake immigration law as we know it by executive decree. And both of these judges are saying this turf belongs to Congress. It is up to the Congress to make these laws. And if the president wants different laws, he's got to go through Congress. GREENE: And briefly, I mean, can the administration appeal in these cases? JAMALI: They can. So far, the White House press secretary has issued a statement calling that ruling out of Washington reckless, the one about asylum seekers fleeing gangs and domestic violence. The language in that statement makes it very clear they're going to keep on fighting on the case here in San Francisco. The administration had already asked the Supreme Court to look at Judge Tigar's first order, that temporary restraining order, which an appeals court here has backed. GREENE: All right, Lily Jamali in San Francisco, thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF STAN FOREBEE'S \"INTROSPECTION\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Trump administration announced new measures Thursday to deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally. On Friday, the administration will announce which countries are affected.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump followed through on one of his last-minute campaign promises - not the promise of a 10 percent middle-class tax cut, which was supposed to materialize just before the election, but a promise to crack down on immigrants, which is going ahead. The administration published an executive action against asylum seekers. It says when people cross the border from Mexico and apply for asylum, they must apply only at a legal port of entry. Now, this morning, the president addressed this rules change before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's very important. We need Democrat support on new immigration laws to bring us up to date. The laws are obsolete, and they're incompetent. They are the worst laws any country has anywhere in the world. INSKEEP: So let's discuss this with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What people are we talking about here that'd be affected? HORSLEY: This rule is really aimed at the large influx of families and children who have been coming to the U.S. border from Central America. If you look at the overall number of people crossing the border illegally, it's way down from its peak a generation ago. But the makeup of that population has changed. We're not talking so much now about single adults from Mexico, who are easy to expel, but families and children from Central America who, for legal reasons, wind up staying in the U.S., are harder for the government to deal with. And so that's who they're trying to address with this new rule. INSKEEP: Well, this new rule sounds on the surface, Scott, pretty straightforward. You know, if you want to apply for asylum, there's got to be a process. There are legal border crossings, and the rule says, go to the legal border crossing because if you don't, we're going to throw you out of the country. What's wrong with that? HORSLEY: You're exactly right. The administration says what they're trying to do is funnel people to the border crossings where they have the resources to process their asylum claims. But this runs into a competing law which says, if you make it to U.S. soil, even if you've crossed the border illegally, you're eligible to apply for asylum. And so that's the sort of competing laws here that the federal courts are probably going to have to sort out. INSKEEP: Can I just understand the rationale there? Is the rationale that if you're sincerely applying for asylum, you may be desperate, and who knows how you get into the country, but the point is to get here and see if you have legal status to stay? HORSLEY: I think that's the underpinning of that long-standing law. Now, the White House is relying on a different law which gives the president broad authority to deny entry to any immigrant or class of immigrants that he thinks might be detrimental to the interest of the United States. That's the same authority that the White House relied on for that travel ban that the president issued in his first week in office, directed at would-be visitors from a number of majority-Muslim countries. That ban, you'll recall, was initially blocked by the federal courts. But after it went through a couple of rewrites, it was ultimately upheld this past summer by the U.S. Supreme Court. INSKEEP: Well, that's an interesting example, Scott, because with the travel ban, also, there were arguably competing laws. And if you read one, it was obviously wrong. And if you read another, you might find a way that it was right or correct. Can we anticipate, then, lawsuits over this rule change involving asylum-seekers? HORSLEY: Yes, the immigrant advocate activists have been bracing for this. And I'm sure they are figuratively lined up at the courthouse door, ready to challenge the administration's move as soon as they have a test case. INSKEEP: And very briefly, does this fit into the administration's broader immigration policy? HORSLEY: Yes. I mean, Donald Trump has been campaigning against immigration, both legal and illegal, since he launched his White House bid. The administration has sharply reduced the number of refugees that it's allowing into the United States. And the president has also tried to curtail the number of immigrants who are admitted to the U.S. legally. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks for the update, as always. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "The Trump administration issued a rule to attempt to restrict migrants' asylum rights. Also, the latest on the Thousand Oaks shooting and potential election recounts in Florida and Georgia.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Trump administration says it is changing a U.S. asylum rule. A big question is whether that rule change is within the law. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Here's how it works. The administration is targeting people who crossed the border from Mexico and apply for asylum. In a newly published rule, the administration says it will refuse to let many people apply for asylum if they crossed the border illegally. It's pushing people to apply only at official ports of entry, which sounds simple enough, except immigration experts point out there is a law providing a process for people who ask for asylum. So is it legal to shove that aside and simply turn aside people who say they're seeking shelter from violence in Central America? MARTIN: Let's ask NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley, who is with us this morning. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What more can you tell us about this rule change? I mean, this is something President Trump had said he was going to do, right? HORSLEY: The administration says its goal here is to funnel asylum seekers to those official ports of entry, where it says it has the resources to process asylum claims efficiently. But, you know, that funnel has a narrow opening. And so this also has the potential of sort of choking off the number of asylum-seekers in the hopes that many will simply lose patience and stop trying to cross the border. The administration insists many of the asylum seekers are ultimately denied, in any case. MARTIN: We should just point out the rules right now say wherever you are - you don't have to come through an official port of entry - wherever you are in the United States when you appear, you can file that claim. And this would change that. HORSLEY: That's right. And so you have sort of competing laws here. On the one hand, federal law gives the president broad power to turn away any migrant or class of migrants he deems detrimental to the United States. But you have this longstanding asylum law which says if you get to U.S. soil, even if you cross the border illegally, you are eligible to apply for asylum. So those competing provisions will probably have to be sorted out by the federal courts. The administration is relying on the same broad authority the president used when he issued his ban on visitors from a number of largely Muslim countries in the first week of his administration. You'll recall, Rachel, that travel ban was initially blocked by the federal courts, but after a series of revisions, was upheld this past summer by the U.S. Supreme Court. MARTIN: So they're expecting legal challenges to this law then - or to this rule change. HORSLEY: Absolutely. MARTIN: Is this going to be temporary? I mean, the president keeps saying he sees it as a crisis at the border. Is this something they want to pass that would address what they view as a temporary crisis or is this a permanent change? HORSLEY: It's being implemented on an emergency basis, but there's no obvious expiration date to this. Keep in mind, President Trump has been campaigning against illegal immigration since he launched his White House bid more than three years ago. Last year, he tried to end the Obama-era program that gave temporary reprieve from deportation to young migrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. That move was blocked by a federal judge. And just yesterday, an appeals court in California said the administration has to continue issuing DACA extensions. The president's also been mobilizing the military to back up the Border Patrol. There was the ill-fated family separation policy that was scrapped this summer after a vigorous public backlash. And the administration has also pushed for new limits on legal immigration. INSKEEP: And I guess we should note that this move against asylum-seekers is very similar to the family separation policy in that there also the administration said, we're going to separate you unless you come to a designated port of entry to apply. There were questions about whether even those people were separated. But that's what the administration said. Here again, with this new rules change, the administration is trying to push people only to those limited locations. HORSLEY: That's right. The administration insists that a lot of the migrants who are coming from Central America are essentially gaming the asylum system. MARTIN: All right. NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley for us this morning. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Here's the central question that we ask on this day - what really drove a man to open fire in a crowded California bar? INSKEEP: To some extent, that question is not really answerable, but Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean has to try. It's his job. He presumes that there is some reason the man chose the location in Thousand Oaks where he killed 12 people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEOFF DEAN: I don't think it was random. I mean, as you know, he's a resident of this area. And I would have to - common sense would speculate that there's some reason he went here. He probably knew about it. But I don't think it was just something like he was driving down the freeway and decided, I'm going to get off here. INSKEEP: The sheriff spoke as authorities were identifying victims. MARTIN: NPR's Nate Rott has been in Thousand Oaks covering this tragedy and joins us this morning. Hey, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: What can you tell us about the victims of the shooting? ROTT: We know most of their identities at this point, but we're going to hold some of them back until they've been identified by authorities here. But from those that we do know, we know that their ages range from 18 to their 30s for patrons of the bar. It's an 18-and-up bar, so tragically, some of the victims were very young. One young woman had just started her freshman year at college. She was 18. Another was a veteran of the Marine Corps who had served in Afghanistan. And another was a deputy with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department who we've heard quite a bit about. He ran into the bar shortly after the shooting began to engage the gunman. He died of gunshot wounds that he suffered from that at the hospital shortly after. But he's being recognized as a hero who saved many lives. MARTIN: I mean, we grieve with the friends and family over each and every life. But there is this added level of - irony is not the right word, but there was a man in that bar who was shot and killed who actually lived through the Las Vegas shooting last year. What can you tell us about him? ROTT: Yeah. Well, so he was one of apparently many people who had sort of used the Borderline Bar and Grill as a refuge in, you know, the year-plus since the Las Vegas shooting. That shooting in Vegas was it a country music festival. The Borderline is a western-themed bar. A bunch people described to me a big cowboy hat that's lit up above its dance floor. And so apparently a lot of people had gone there and enjoyed it. The man you're referring to, his name was Telemachus Orfanos. We actually heard from his mom, Susan Orfanos. She talked to ABC7. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUSAN ORFANOS: My son was in Las Vegas with a lot of his friends, and he came home. He didn't come home last night. And I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control. And I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers. ROTT: It's really hard to listen to. One of our colleagues actually talked to his father too. He said that his son, that Telemachus was a veteran. He had served in the Navy. He preferred to go by his nickname Tel (ph). And he also said that he loved line dancing, which is why he was at the bar. MARTIN: That is hard to hear. What else have you been hearing from the community there, Nate? How are they dealing? ROTT: You know, I think people are still just in shock. There were a number of vigils last night honoring the victims. There was one at a community center, another at a college. And there was a really touching procession for the sheriff's deputy that - when they moved his body from the hospital to a funeral home. MARTIN: NPR's Nate Rott for us in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Thank you so much, Nate. ROTT: Yeah, thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. There is more counting underway from Tuesday's election, and it could be shifting our understanding of what those elections actually mean. INSKEEP: Yeah. The seemingly narrow Democratic capture of the House of Representatives is growing larger and larger as more races are called. Republicans celebrated their gains in the Senate. But let's discuss that part next because some of the Republican gains are now in doubt. Counting ballots in Arizona has put the Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema in the lead for now. That would be a gain of a seat for Democrats. And then there is Florida, where ballots are still being counted, and it's close enough for an eventual mandatory recount. And Republican Rick Scott is not happy about this. He is suing election supervisors as they count ballots. He says he won the Senate race against the incumbent Democrat, Bill Nelson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The people of Florida deserve fairness and transparency, and the supervisors are failing to give it to us. Every Floridian should be concerned there may be a rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties. MARTIN: All right. We've got miles parks for us who covers voting for NPR. Hey, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: Election controversy in Florida, what? That's crazy. PARKS: I know. Who's really surprised here? MARTIN: Let's start in Florida. PARKS: Yeah, absolutely. So the Senate race at this point is within this quarter-point margin that would automatically trigger a manual recount of ballots. Bill Nelson, the Democratic nominee for Senate, says that he thinks Bill Nelson is going to win this election ultimately because a lot of the ballots that still have yet to be counted are in places that Democrats usually turn out well. Rick Scott, on the other hand, the Republican nominee, is not taking this super well. MARTIN: No, he sued. PARKS: Exactly. He sued. And he says a lot of these votes are not legitimate without providing any evidence of that claim. INSKEEP: He's essentially saying, stop counting now because I'm ahead. MARTIN: Right. And the governor's race there also very close. PARKS: Yes, it is - not as close as the Senate race, but also in this margin that is going to necessitate a mandatory recount. What's interesting here is that the Democratic nominee for governor, Andrew Gillum, has already conceded. He conceded Tuesday night. MARTIN: Right. Can you do take-backs? PARKS: Right, exactly. Well, it's legally required that a recount is put into place. These votes have just been counted - drip, drip, drip - all this week, which now has forced this recount in a position when Gillum has already conceded on Tuesday. MARTIN: Wow. OK. Let's shift over to Georgia because there's a lot of drama there too. The secretary of state, Brian Kemp, who was the Republican nominee for governor, actually resigned his post as the secretary of state assuming that he had won the election and also because he didn't want there to be a perceived conflict of interest because he's the guy who would have to certify the result. But he never cared about the optics before. I mean, this was the whole rub in Georgia. PARKS: And what's really interesting is Kemp has resigned his post as secretary of state but has taken a very similar approach to this as Rick Scott has in Florida, which is going on the offensive. His communications director yesterday put out a statement saying, again, without evidence, that Stacey Abrams is trying to, quote, \"create new votes because they know it's their only remaining hope.\" The Abrams team, on the other hand, is saying, we just want all of the ballots to be counted before we concede. MARTIN: And meanwhile, Arizona. What can you tell us there? PARKS: In Arizona, there does seem to have been a lead change as votes continue to come in where Martha McSally, the Republican, was in the lead, and now it looks to be Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. I want to make it very clear that votes being counted late like this, a lot of people are coming out and saying that this is surprising or wrong. This is not uncommon at all. Millions of votes still have yet to be counted. In California... MARTIN: Right. It's no recount there. They're just still counting. PARKS: They're just still counting. And they're still counting in places all over the country. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Miles Parks for us. We appreciate it, Miles. Thank you. PARKS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "A prosperous area of Bavaria has become a stronghold for the far-right AfD. If the party does well in Sunday's regional elections, it could knock Chancellor Merkel's closest political ally from power.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government is bracing for another political blow this weekend. The anti-immigrant AfD party, which already forms the official opposition in Germany's national parliament, could achieve similar success in Bavaria's state elections this Sunday. That would come at the expense of Merkel's political allies. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson takes us to one of the strongholds of the AfD in Bavaria. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Ingolstadt isn't a typical stronghold for the AfD, which traditionally plays to Germany's working class in the less affluent, formerly communist east. In this Bavarian medieval city, luxury cars abound on the cobblestone streets. The 137,000 residents of Ingolstadt, where carmaker Audi is headquartered, are said to enjoy the highest per capita income in Germany. But as well-off as the people in Ingolstadt are, many here are rather anxious about their future. Enter the AfD, which excels at stoking such fears. The far-right faction in recent years has siphoned off a steady stream of voters from Merkel's key Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, which for the most part has run Ingolstadt and the rest of the Alpine state since 1946. So why are CSU voters flocking to the AfD? Johannes Kraus von Sande, its local candidate for the state elections, offers this explanation. JOHANNES KRAUS VON SANDE: (Through interpreter) The AfD fulfills the promises the CSU makes. The CSU's failure to keep promises has pretty much defined the whole history of that party. NELSON: The CSU candidate from Ingolstadt is police Chief Alfred Grob. And he rejects the AfD claim. Grob instead blames the CSU's current problems on a protest vote against Merkel for failing to deal with the more than 1 million asylum seekers who've come to Germany since 2015. ALFRED GROB: (Through interpreter) We see this phenomenon not just with the CSU. It's just as bad for the SPD. NELSON: He is referring to the center-left Social Democrats. Grob says there are other factors contributing to voters' fears. The diesel emissions scandal and other problems at Audi have residents wondering whether their booming economy will be short-lived. And the large community of German Russians, who immigrated here after the collapse of communism in 1989, has been flocking to the AfD over fears the asylum seekers will take away their jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Applauding). NELSON: At a CSU campaign rally this week in Ingolstadt, Bavarian premier Markus Soeder tried to cheer up the party faithful by dismissing their far-right rival as anti-Semitic and on the political fringe. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) MARKUS SOEDER: (Speaking German). NELSON: Soeder warned the AfD it would incur God's wrath and had no business being in the Bavarian state legislature. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Applauding). NELSON: AfD officials, meanwhile, are spreading their own message. They've put up billboards around Ingolstadt warning of Muslim hordes stripping Bavaria of its Christian identity, decimating German pensions and committing crimes. The campaign has increased discrimination against asylum-seekers here as well as the abuse of Muslim women who wear headscarves, like Yeser Saygili. YESER SAYGILI: (Through interpreter) I help a lot of immigrant women who are looking for jobs. One office manager looking for a cleaning woman recently asked me if the applicant wore a headscarf. I was like, hello, how far have we regressed? In the end, she didn't get the job because she wore a headscarf. (Speaking German). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Speaking German). SAYGILI: (Speaking German). NELSON: The Turkish woman moved to Ingolstadt a quarter century ago and teaches German to immigrant children, like this 2-year-old boy, in the same neighborhood dominated by AfD's German-Russian base. Saygili says she fears a far-right win in Bavaria on Sunday will only make things harder for Muslims in Ingolstadt. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Ingolstadt. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "Hundreds of asylum seekers are in Tijuana, Mexico, hoping to cross the border into San Diego. This is despite President Trump's order to Department of Homeland Security to \"stop the caravan.\"  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now to the U.S.-Mexico border, where hundreds of people from Central America have gathered in hopes of crossing into the U.S. Many say they are fleeing from violence in Honduras and El Salvador and hope to present themselves to U.S. officials to ask for asylum. The so-called migrant caravan has attracted much media attention and the hostility of President Trump. U.S. officials say they will prosecute anybody who makes a false claim. NPR's Carrie Kahn is in Tijuana, Mexico, and she's with us now. Carrie, thanks so much for joining us. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Thanks. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So Carrie, you're there with the caravan. We understand that U.S. officials are saying that the main San Diego border crossing can't accept any more asylum-seekers tonight. What does that mean? And what do you see? KAHN: I am standing on the Mexican side right in front of the U.S. border crossing in Tijuana, and a group of about 40 migrants from the caravan walked into the U.S. port of entry. They were told that they could not be accepted. That's what we heard from American officials. But they went on their own into the building, and they entered in there, so we'll see what happens. But that is the word from the Customs and Border Protection, that they can - they're at full capacity, that they can no longer accept people presenting themselves at the port of entry without legal authorization to enter the United States. MARTIN: So what happens now? Are these people expected to turn around? Are they going to try again tomorrow? What happens now? KAHN: Well, a lot of the people that are here said that they - their intention is to stay in Mexico. There is a line of about 200 migrants now that say that they want to go and ask for political asylum, but there's many more that are going to stay in Mexico. But it's going to take a while. I remember back last year when there was a influx of Haitian refugees that were going into the United States, and the port officials here at the U.S. side of the port said that they could only accept 30 - 20 to 30 a day. And so the Haitians waited here months in Tijuana, Mexico, and many of them ultimately decided to stay here. So that seems to be what's happening right now. There's just a limited capacity at this port of entry of how many people that they can take that are seeking political asylum. MARTIN: Now, you've been there all day. What are some of the people that you have spoken with told you about why they're seeking asylum? KAHN: You hear a whole lot of different stories. There's a couple hundred people here. And so a lot of the people are from Honduras. Many of those people from Honduras say that what is happening in the country right now is political instability ever since the presidential elections in November of last year, which were resoundingly decried as fraudulent. And they say since then, there has been a lot of political instability in the country and increasing violence. The people from El Salvador are facing a equally violent situation. They talk about horrific stories just of being extorted by gangs, being threatened for their lives and just leaving the country with what they have carried - the clothes on their backs and what they have been able to carry with them. MARTIN: And what are U.S. officials saying about this group of migrants seeking asylum? The Trump administration has been following the movements of the caravan. They've made that very clear. And they've said that anybody making a false claim or entering the U.S. illegally will be prosecuted. Has that message been received? And has that done anything to deter people wanting to come in? KAHN: Yeah, they've heard that message loud and clear. The Department of Homeland Security secretary said that they will prosecute anybody who tries to enter illegally or makes a false asylum claim. There were U.S. lawyers, volunteer lawyers that were down here the last couple days counseling the immigrants and telling them about what their rights are under the asylum laws and what they need to prove their asylum cases. A lot of people said, you know, maybe they'll just stay in Mexico and try and get refugee or asylum claims here in Mexico. But a lot of people - still, I can see there are 200 people right here at the port of entry lining up, and they feel like they have credible asylum claims. One woman told me that she - there's no reason for her to lie. The lawyer told her that she must tell the truth, and she feels like she has a credible claim. She came from El Salvador, fleeing the gangs there, where she was threatened, and she's going to try and cross. MARTIN: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn in Tijuana. Carrie, thank you. KAHN: You're welcome.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Hungarians are voting today in national elections. The populist prime minister and his party are widely expected to win. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Budapest on a race that centers on fears over Muslim migration to Hungary even though there actually isn't any. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: A steady stream of Hungarian voters are showing up at this and other polling stations here. But some election observers say it may be mail-in ballots from new citizens who live outside Hungary that decide whether incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party win. GABOR GYORSI: There's a genuine attachment between the cross-border communities and the Hungarian government. SARHADDI NELSON: Gabor Gyorsi is a senior analyst at a progressive think tank called Policy Solutions. GYORSI: These people will overwhelmingly vote for the government - also because the government has invested a lot of money and effort and energy in cultivating this voting base, starting with the fact that it was this government that gave them dual citizenship. SARHADDI NELSON: Another Orban campaign tactic has been to stoke xenophobic fears over Muslim migration even though his government only allows two asylum seekers into Hungary each day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: (Speaking in Hungarian). SARHADDI NELSON: Recently, the Prime Minister again accused his favorite target, American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, of wanting to tear down border fences to boost Muslim immigration. Soros and his foundations, which are involved in democracy building here, vehemently deny such claims. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs defends Orban's focus on Muslim migration... ZOLTAN KOVACS: Because that's what matter for the moment, that's what are going to decide about the fate of Hungary and the European Union for generations. If he make bad decisions, that can be - you know, ruin the future of a nation and the continent. SARHADDI NELSON: But opposition candidates accuse the Hungarian government of diverting attention away from the real issues, like inadequate education and healthcare or corruption. Surveys here show the Hungarian opposition with little chance of winning although if they were to join forces, they could prevent Orban and Fidesz from forming a new majority government.

            "article_content": "Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to win in his country's elections this month. But critics say his success comes from his having adopted similar policies to the far right.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In Hungary, two of the biggest political parties are going through a dramatic change. The current prime minister and his one-time Centrist Party are embracing the rhetoric that once belonged to their main rival. That far-right faction, in turn, is taking a more mainstream approach. So which party's message will get through to voters? That will become more clear after this Sunday, when Hungarians vote in national elections. Here's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: So far, Hungarian opinion polls show Viktor Orban and his Fidesz Party in the lead. It likely has something to do with them embracing policies championed by the far-right Jobbik Party. PETER KREKO: There is definitely a demand for radicalism in Hungary, and it's pretty big. SARHADDI NELSON: Peter Kreko is a political scientist and co-author of \"The Hungarian Far Right.\" KREKO: Fidesz took out the wind from the sails of Jobbik. And they practically grabbed almost all the elements of Jobbik's ideology and policy proposals. SARHADDI NELSON: Like establishing a memorial day to mark a century-old treaty that cost Hungary 2/3 of its territory, or building a heavily fortified fence along the Hungarian border with Serbia to stop asylum seekers. Jobbik foreign policy spokesman Marton Gyongyosi says, in some ways, there's great satisfaction in watching the Orban government adopting positions shared by Jobbik. MARTON GYONGYOSI: Nonetheless, I think the government has created the hysteria in this country out of the migration issue. SARHADDI NELSON: He also accuses Orban of going too far with his anti-EU stance. GYONGYOSI: If we unite, we can put such issues on the European agenda and we can maybe influence the course which the European Union is taking at the moment. And now Viktor Orban, at this moment, he's basically slamming the door and he moves out of the European debate. I think this is completely irresponsible. SARHADDI NELSON: He admits such statements are vastly different than what Jobbik has said in the past. GYONGYOSI: It's very different to be a movement being outside Parliament and being within Parliament. It is very different to be a radical party which is basically speaking and talking to a subcultural political community. SARHADDI NELSON: But the analyst, Peter Kreko, says Jobbik's attempts to be more politically relevant are backfiring. Polls show the party has less support than during the last elections in 2014. KREKO: The problem with Jobbik, as I mentioned, is that they became a boring centrist party. And I think if they want to mobilize their core electorate, they have to go back to this hardcore, classical, nationalist topics. Otherwise, their voters will be lazy to turn up at the ballot boxes on election day. SARHADDI NELSON: Jobbik's new approach has also failed to persuade other opposition parties to join with it to try and defeat Fidesz. Meanwhile, Fidesz denies coopting anyone's platform, let alone Jobbik's, says the governing party spokesman Balazs Hidveghi. BALAZS HIDVEGHI: In many respects, they, it seems to me, have betrayed their own voters. And in a larger sense, they've betrayed issues that are critical to Hungary's safety and security. SARHADDI NELSON: Earlier this year, the government-controlled State Audit Office fined Jobbik the equivalent of $1.3 million over an antigovernment billboard campaign funded by a wealthy adversary of Orban. Jobbik stands accused of running an ad campaign at below market prices, which the party denies. Auditors eventually agreed to delay the case until after the election.

            "article_content": "Advocates say Hungary is only allowing two asylum seekers in each day. They say that violates international law, and is causing panic among the thousands  waiting to cross from Serbia.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hungary appears to have closed its borders to nearly all asylum-seekers. It's allowing in only two each day. That's according to human rights advocates who say the move violates international law. It's also causing panic among the thousands of asylum-seekers waiting to cross from Serbia. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from the Hungarian-Serbian border. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Things have dramatically changed on the border between Serbia and Hungary over the past three years. Back then asylum-seekers only had to walk through woods or cross a field to leave Serbia and enter Hungary. Other than a few sleepy border stations, it was hard to tell where one country ended and the other began. But these days you can't miss the border, where Hungarians have erected a double fence with razor wire and video surveillance. Armed patrols appear at the first sign of any breach. SHEERALI REZAIE: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: The only way to get into Hungary now if you are an asylum-seeker, like Sheerali Rezaie, is to put your name on a list and wait to be called. The Afghan farmer says he now fears that moment may never come. REZAIE: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: He tells me he, his wife and two sons, and some 90 other people living at a Serbian dog shelter turned refugee camp, which NPR visited, are afraid. \"We worry they'll close the gates forever and say, goodbye, take off.\" Rezaie and the other asylum-seekers I interview say they were informed two weeks ago that Hungarian immigration authorities had started allowing only a single person per day to enter each of the two transit zones. The razor wire-enclosed areas, which the U.N. and human rights groups liken to detention centers, are the only place asylum-seekers are allowed to be in Hungary until their claims are processed. Timea Kovacs, an independent Hungarian lawyer who works with asylum-seekers in the transit zones, confirmed the near closure of the border. TIMEA KOVACS: We received many texts and many messages that the asylum-seekers in Serbia really worry about what's happening with them. Some of them were waiting there more than one year. NELSON: She says the transit zones are emptier than usual, but the head of the Hungarian prime minister's office, Janos Lazar, denied there was any new limit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANOS LAZAR: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: He told reporters last Friday there are fewer asylum-seekers entering the transit zones because fewer are showing up at the border. That claim seems unlikely, given the U.N. reports there are nearly 4,000 migrants and refugees in Serbia trying to get into Hungary at the moment. Critics of Hungarian refugee policy say what's likely happening is that the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has a staunch anti-migrant platform, is trying to boost its approval ratings before April's parliamentary elections. Marta Pardavi is the co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a prominent refugee group based in Budapest. MARTA PARDAVI: We have seen a gradual but very clear decline in the number of people who've been allowed to seek asylum in the Hungarian transit zones at the border. So now where we hear that there's only one person allowed in, it basically means that only unaccompanied minors or single men can get in, no families whatsoever. NELSON: That worries another Afghan asylum-seeker I see walking with his 2-and-a-half year-old daughter outside of the Serbian town of Subotica. He asked that we not identify him or his family after a Serbian police officer harassed him for speaking to NPR. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: The man says he is so upset about the new limits, he wants to scream. He says he doesn't know now if he, his daughter or 12-year-old son will ever get to Frankfurt. That's where his wife applied for asylum and has been waiting for them for two years. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, at the Hungarian-Serbian border. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Updated at 7:33 p.m. ET Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a darling of Europe's far right, has tightened his grip on power in ways that have shocked the European Union. His ultranationalist Fidesz party has gamed the electoral system, shut down most independent media, forced out an American university and even created new administrative courts that will be directly controlled by the government. But none of these measures have generated the type of outrage in Hungary that has greeted a new law that allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours of overtime per year. Employers can delay these overtime payments for up to three years. Critics call it the \"slave law.\" Thousands have protested every night outside parliament in Budapest since Fidesz lawmakers approved the measure on Wednesday. About 10,000 protesters marched to parliament on Sunday, waving Hungarian and European Union flags, and holding up hand-made banners. One read: \"All I want for Xmas is democracy.\" One group of protesters also demonstrated outside the state-run TV headquarters. Media loyal to the government have largely ignored the protests. \"It's the first time I've seen signs that there's a united opposition building against Orb\u00e1n,\" says G\u00e1bor Gyori, a senior analyst at the Budapest-based Policy Solutions think tank. \"He did something that has upset a large segment of the population, even his own supporters.\" A new poll by the Republikon Institute, a liberal think tank, shows that 63 percent of Orb\u00e1n supporters disapprove of the new overtime law. More than 95 percent of his critics also disapprove. Labor union leaders point out that Hungarians are already upset about low wages and poor workplace conditions. \"And now to give employers, especially multinational companies who want even lower wages, so much more power over workers, it's very unfair,\" says L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kord\u00e1s, head of the Hungarian Trade Union Confederation. Just before parliament voted on the overtime law on Dec. 12, Orb\u00e1n told lawmakers that it will help remove \"bureaucratic rules\" for workers who want to put in more hours and \"earn more.\" The law allows employers to make individual contracts with workers, bypassing unions. Hungary's unemployment rate is low, about 3.7 percent, partly because of an exodus of its skilled workers to other EU member states such as Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom, where wages are higher. Other countries with labor shortages often turn to immigrants, but Gyori says Orb\u00e1n has been so vitriolic against immigration that \"he's painted himself into a corner.\" \"Our population is shrinking,\" Gyori says. \"This labor shortage will only get worse.\" Kord\u00e1s says Orb\u00e1n and others in his party are clueless about working conditions for most Hungarians because most are \"professional politicians who have never worked real jobs in the real world. They have no idea what actual working people have to go through.\" The protests have gained steam partly because labor unions have joined forces with student activists at Central European University, which is leaving Hungary next year under pressure from Orb\u00e1n, who has demonized its founder, billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a Holocaust survivor and Hungarian-born Jew. (Soros' Open Society Foundations has contributed financially to NPR in the past.) Orb\u00e1n claims Soros was behind a conspiracy to \"flood\" Europe with Muslim asylum-seekers. The prime minister's allies are also blaming Soros for organizing the protests against the overtime law. Gergely Guly\u00e1s, Orb\u00e1n's chief of staff, declared that the protesters display \"open anti-Christian hatred.\" Viktor Mak, a 26-year-old Hungarian-American student at CEU, says authorities are also claiming the protesters are dangerous. \"They are sending police to tear-gas us and they claim we're the ones who are violent,\" he says. \"Everyone hates this law. Who wants to work overtime and not get paid for it for three years?\" One government minister, J\u00e1nos S\u00fcl, quoted in the Hungarian website Pakspress.hu, said the young protesters have \"never worked a day in their lives.\" A spokesman for Guly\u00e1s, the prime minister's chief of staff, said in an email to NPR that Orb\u00e1n's critics are spreading lies about the law and that \"any overtime permitted by the law can only be performed with voluntary employee consent.\" Kord\u00e1s, the union leader, rolls his eyes at the comment. \"It's hard to make that argument when employers have all the leverage over their workers,\" he says. Gyori, the political analyst, adds that there's also anger that Orb\u00e1n's lawmakers rammed the law through parliament without consulting unions or the political opposition. Fidesz altered election rules so that the party controls two-thirds of parliament, even though it received only 49 percent of the popular vote in last spring's election. As a result, opposition lawmakers are virtually powerless. They were reduced to blowing whistles and sirens and singing the Hungarian national anthem in an attempt to delay the vote on the overtime vote last week. The measure passed Hungary's parliament by a vote of 130 to 52 with one abstention. \"The problem with Orb\u00e1n is that he fears the uncertainty that comes with democracy, so he stifles opposition to avoid the fallout of unpopular decisions,\" Gyori says. \"He will do anything to avoid that uncertainty.\" But some die-hard Orb\u00e1n supporters say it's the protesters who are sowing uncertainty. Kalman Molnar, a 93-year-old eye doctor, says he's never seen a Hungarian leader \"as great as Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" As night fell, Molnar bundled himself in a greatcoat, pulled on his black beret, and shuffled toward the protests \"out of curiosity.\" \"Even if 100,000 of them turned out, it wouldn't matter,\" he said, over the chants of the crowd. \"They will always be the minority.\" Freelance journalist Mate Halmos contributed reporting from Budapest.",

In an emotional farewell for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Christian Democratic Union party delegates gathered to elect a successor in Hamburg, the city where Merkel was born. Merkel, 64, will pass the baton to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the 56-year-old general secretary of the CDU and strong supporter of the chancellor. \"AKK,\" as some Germans affectionately call her to avoid stumbling over her name, was Merkel's preferred candidate, at least according to many German media and analysts because the chancellor never publicly endorsed anyone. Kramp-Karrenbauer narrowly defeated fellow party member, Friedrich Merz \u2014 Merkel's staunch rival and the former leader of the party's parliamentary group. Ahead of the vote, Merkel looked somewhat tired and uncharacteristically stumbled over her words during her 30-minute speech before the vote. Nevertheless, Merkel kept her message simple and straightforward as she has over 18 years as leader of the Christian Democrats. She even took a moment to poke fun at herself for being no-nonsense and \"bone dry.\" During her speech, Merkel urged the party to join together and show Germans it can lead their country through turbulent times of growing polarization and crises like war, terror attacks and climate change. Merkel said the CDU is well-suited to do so if it sticks to its core values, but at the same time remains open to change and looks to the future instead of the past. \"Now it's time to open a new chapter,\" and bring in new leadership, Merkel said. \"At this moment, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude. It was a great pleasure for me, it was an honor for me.\" The delegates rose and delivered a lengthy ovation to their long-time leader, with some holding up signs that simply said: \"Thanks, boss.\" Merkel went back out on stage to acknowledge the crowd several times with nods, smiles and waves. She eventually returned to the microphone and reminded the delegates they still had \"a lot of work to do.\" And that they did, as the three-way race for Merkel's successor was a heated one. In the initial round of voting Friday, Kramp-Karrenbauer came in first receiving 450 delegate ballots, but she didn't get a majority. So a run-off was held between her and second highest vote-getter Merz. The 63-year-old Merz advocates a more conservative, harsher approach to the party than Merkel, and in recent weeks, had advocated for a more combative approach to silencing those in the CDU center. Kramp-Karrenbauer narrowly defeated Merz in the run-off winning with 517 ballots to his 482. After the results were announced, a tearful Kramp-Karrenbauer hugged Merkel and gave her a peck on the cheek. Merkel, a mentor to the newly elected successor, smiled broadly and looked happier than she has in months, as she now faces a less politically turbulent transition when she hands over the reins of government at the end of her term as chancellor in 2021. Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was formerly the premier of the small German state of Saarland and fairly new on the national political stage, is pretty much assured to be the CDU's successor candidate for chancellor in that national German election. But the mother of three also inherits the difficult task of ending the CDU's lackluster showing over the past three years in local, regional and national elections, as well as winning back hundreds of thousands of voters. Most of them defected to the far-right Alternative for Germany over Merkel's controversial decision to openly welcome asylum seekers back in 2015 when hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and others came to Germany and other European Union countries to escape war and poverty. After her win, Kramp-Karrenbauer immediately extended an olive branch to Merz and her other key opponent, German health minister Jens Spahn. \"There's a place for both in this party,\" Kramp-Karrenbauer said, adding the renewed confidence their party elections raised in Germans \"must continue and must be connected with the goal that unites us all, to preserve and shape our great people's party.\" Some German observers predict that even if her CDU party unites behind her over the next few years, Kramp-Karrenbauer has a long road ahead to persuade German voters and the greater European Union that she can be as stabilizing and powerful a chancellor as Merkel.",

Newly elected Democratic mayor Arturo Garino was busy with Election Day when the Army arrived in Nogales and started erecting coils of glistening razor wire along the tops of the border wall that separates his small U.S. town from its sister in Mexico. \"Razor wire, concertina wire is not what you want to see on a fence with two countries that have been friends and traded forever,\" he said. Operation Secure Line President Donald Trump announced a little more than a week ago that he was sending troops to the border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \"And now here we have a wire, you know, downtown, el puro downtown,\" Garino said. Arizona immigration officials say troops are necessary to support CBP and ensure orderly crossings, especially as a large caravan of mostly Central American migrants approach the border. But some residents and local officials say say they're not needed. The military action is called Operation Secure Line; the original monicker, Operation Faithful Patriot, was dropped shortly after the troops' arrival to the Southwest border. Col. Larry Dewey, commander of the 16th Military Police Brigade from Fort Bragg, N.C., and his counterparts in CBP explained Friday that the main reason for the military buildup was the caravan of migrants making its way to the border from Mexico. \"Our mission is not to stop the caravan of migrants, rather we are here to support CBP personnel so they can continue to serve in a law enforcement capacity and encourage and enable the lawful and peaceful immigration,\" he said. Rodolfo Karisch, chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, says that \"over the last few years, we have seen significant increases in the number of Central American families and unaccompanied children who have been arriving at our border. It's been dramatic increases for us,\" he said. At some points on the border, he said illegal crossings have doubled. \"The status quo is not sustainable. We're all seeing huge increases of people arriving, and we haven't even started to talk about the caravan,\" he said. Worries about migrants rushing the border The migrants reportedly intend to seek asylum further west in Tijuana. By Friday, CBP had brought in pallets of children's cereal, animal crackers, baby wipes and diapers to prepare for the migrants should they come to Nogales. And they have coordinated with northern Mexico officials and charities in the U.S. to help care for them. But officials worry migrants will try to storm the border. Petra Horne is acting director of CBP's Tucson field office. \"Our goal is, if individuals are here to seek asylum, they need to do so in an orderly fashion,\" she said. Horne said this caravan could pose a different risk than the caravan that arrived last April, which sparked tweets from President Trump and the mobilization of National Guard troops to the border. Despite concerns, 93 percent of the migrants on that caravan passed a credible-fear interview with CBP and were allowed into the country to continue the asylum process. When asked why the deployment is happening now, Horne said, \"Well, I can tell you that in Nogales where we sit today, we have had multiple groups trying to run through our vehicular lanes so it is already happening. We're wanting to get the message out in advance to warn these individuals not to do that.\" 'A nervous psychosis' A CBP spokesperson said last week six families all attempted to run into the U.S. through vehicle lanes within 24 hours. Pedestrian lanes are carefully gated and can easily be controlled whereas open vehicle lanes are wide open. Standing on a street corner in downtown Nogales, Vicente Valdez was talking about the buildup with a friend. He is a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico. \"The U.S. has the right to secure its border,\" he said in Spanish, \"but it's turning that into a nervous psychosis.\" At the Santa Cruz County building in Nogales, Supervisor Bruce Bracker said the military presence is a classic symptom of Washington, D.C. not working with local officials. \"If they'd come down and asked people on the southern border what is it that you need, we would tell them. we need personnel for customs and we need personnel for Border Patrol.\" At the port, carrying two heavy shopping bags, Mexico resident Alicia Romero prepared to cross back to her home. \"Crossing the border can take two, three hours,\" she said. Like Bracker, she'd prefer the U.S. spend its resources speeding up border crossings for visitors like her.",

Covering those patterns has proven challenging for all newsrooms, including NPR's, and listeners from both sides of the aisle have raised concerns and voiced frustrations about the coverage. Listeners aren't just imagining the sheer volume of the rally sound bites. Clips of the president's most incendiary remarks at the rallies have been ubiquitous on NPR, particularly in the hourly newscasts, but also in reports on Morning Edition, All Things Considered and the other newsmagazine shows. Partly that's because the president \u2014 any president \u2014 has a bully pulpit. And NPR covers the president \u2014 any president \u2014 whether it's official presidential business or in service of other political candidates. NPR also covered President Obama's 2014 appearances for midterm candidates. Those reports were fewer, however, since Obama did less campaigning. Trump is a much more aggressive campaigner, and makes provocative statements almost every time. \"One of things that is troubling for people is that he is omnipresent,\" said Robert Garcia, NPR's executive producer of newscasts. \"He never stops tweeting, he never goes on vacation or goes away. It's part and parcel of who he is, that he is always present.\" Garcia added, \"I suspect that people are not getting a respite from this and they're weary. And for those who have a visceral reaction to him it is extremely troubling to be in a constant state of outrage.\" The ethical questions for me are: Has NPR gone beyond stenography, merely reporting his words without any context or explanation? In other words, has it treated comments that clearly are not true or not actionable as such? Has the coverage unfairly given an advantage to whomever the president is stumping for? Were  some of his comments covered but didn't need to be because they were gratuitous or weren't newsworthy in any way? I shared the many emails my office has received, expressing a wide variety of concerns, with Edith Chapin, NPR's executive editor. She responded: \"We don't cover the rallies live. [Reporting] some excerpts in pieces and newscasts feels like the responsible way to reflect the President's approach to the midterm campaign season.\" That's an important point: NPR is playing excerpts from the rallies after evaluating their news value. It is not passing along the content wholesale as it happens, like some other news outlets have done. But for some listeners it feels like too much, too often. I do think some of the disconnect has to do with the fact that it's radio and the news comes at you unless you turn off the radio (whereas you can skip over something you don't like in a newspaper or online). Some of the reaction also has to do with listening patterns. If you're a listener who has the radio on all day and you hear newscast after newscast with a short clip from a rally, then yes, you might think it's excessive. If you're the average NPR listener who hears just a few minutes per day, you might hear only one such clip. Garcia's view is that \"he's the president of the United States and we have to cover him. We have to cover him truthfully, though.\" The challenge he sees is that NPR has to be fair \u2014 \"we serve the public and the public is made up of all kinds of folks\" \u2014 but also truthful, and careful to avoid false equivalency. That means going beyond stenography, of simply repeating what the president says even if it is not true. In most cases I've heard, NPR has done that. The overwhelming number of newscasts I hear are clear to correct any misinformation. That said, they don't always follow contemporary best practices, what is known as a \"truth sandwich.\" Essentially, that means that reporters should note first that the information they are about to hear is inaccurate or misleading, then play the clip in question, and then offer evidence as to why it is inaccurate. That last part \u2014 share the evidence \u2014 is also key. My office is getting more emails from listeners who feel NPR is biased against the president because they hear statements like \"the President said, with no evidence, that...\" In each case I've investigated, the reporting has borne out; the president was making claims that could not be supported by the facts. An example is Trump's unsupported claim that Middle Easterners (the implication being terrorists) are using the Central American migrant caravan as a cover to potentially slip into the United States. Reporters had been (and continue to be) on the scene investigating who exactly the caravan members are: migrants from several Central American countries, some of whom say they intend to seek political asylum if and when they reach the border and others who say they are coming for economic reasons. But some listeners who are predisposed to mistrust the media \u2014 perhaps because the president keeps telling them the media can't be trusted \u2014 hear \"with no evidence\" as simple bias against him. Yes, it takes precious seconds of air time, which radio reporters always feel are too few, but it's my view that journalists should explain why Trump's statements are false whenever possible. What about listener concerns that the predominance of Trump gives an unfair advantage to Republicans in the local races (or to the president's own re-election aspirations)? In general, Garcia said, the newsroom tries to be \"even-handed in terms of time given to both parties.\" The newscasts have indeed carried clips from Democratic rallies, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent, stumping for Democratic candidates (newscasts aren't archived online so there's no link to share). The newsmagazines, too. And of course, some of the presidential clips played from local rallies are really about the president himself; he often talks more about himself and his own policies than about the candidate he is supporting. I want to push back on the notion I've heard from some listeners that the coverage will potentially play a major influence in getting Republican candidates elected. All states have local public radio stations. The vast majority of them have local reporters covering the state races in great depth (or they have access to reports produced through statewide collaborations). NPR's political reporting, on the other hand, is focused on helping listeners understand the general trends taking place nationwide. As a result, NPR's coverage of the races where the president has dropped in represents only a fraction of the information voters are getting about those races. Finally, during his campaign appearances, the president often uses his bully pulpit as a bullying pulpit, letting fly derogatory nicknames for candidates he's campaigning against \u2014 and, of course, continuing his disparagement of the news media. NPR has played many of those clips, including at noon today, when a newscast report included Trump's claim from a Wednesday night rally that \"the far left media once again used tragedy to sow anger and division\" and then highlighted chants of \"CNN sucks.\" There's a fine line between informing listeners of what exactly is said at the rallies and merely carrying his message without context. I'm not sure where that line is, in this or numerous other cases. A listener complained that this report was missing the context that two would-be pipe bombs were recently sent to CNN's newsroom. That's true, but has any listener actually forgotten that news from just a week ago? Probably not. On the other hand, one personal insult made it into a recent Saturday newscast report previewing the president's stump for Nevada incumbent Sen. Dean Heller. It concluded: \"Heller is facing a challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Jacky Rosen. In a previous visit to the state, the president criticized Rosen, referring to her as 'Wacky Jacky.'\" Listener Joel Gottfried of Wyndmoor, Pa., wrote: \"How in the world is repeating this absurd name calling 'news'\"? I asked Paul Boger, a reporter for KUNR Public Radio, in Reno, Nev., about the report, which he filed for NPR. He wrote in an email, \"I feel deeply that 'absurd name calling' has no place in civil discourse.\" His case for why it was nonetheless newsworthy centered on the speaker \u2014 the president of the United States \u2014 \"talking about a sitting Congresswoman.\" Heller, he said, \"has embraced the president and his agenda. Therefore, in my professional opinion, Heller has tacitly endorsed the moniker.\" Moreover, the Senate race has been particularly negative, with both sides calling names. But, in retrospect, he said, the comment might better have been left for a longer piece where those nuances could be explored. He said he would likely not include it again in a short newscast piece. I agree that including the insult felt gratuitous, at least in the context of a newscast (and would be totally valid in a longer piece). It's been a tough election season for us all, those who produce the news and those who consume it. I don't think it's pulling punches or leaving listeners with a misleading impression to skip some of the offhand insults. Summing up: This is a president who has upended the notions of how a president behaves. Newsrooms are scrambling to keep up, and that involves not only reporting the news, but also making some sense of it. Not every decision is right \u2014 or obvious. Want to hear more perspective? Last week's It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders had a good debate about the challenges. It's worth a listen.",

            "article_content": "Sweden holds a general election on Sunday and the country's usually calm political landscape could be disrupted by strong support for a populist, anti-immigrant party.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Sweden holds national elections tomorrow for the first time since the country opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers fleeing violence in and around Syria. There's been a backlash to that wave of immigration, and now close to 1 in 5 Swedes say they'll vote for the nationalistic Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement. Sidsel Overgaard reports. SIDSEL OVERGAARD, BYLINE: It's noon on a weekday in the Swedish city of Malmo. JIMMIE AKESSON: (Speaking Swedish). OVERGAARD: The leader of the Sweden Democrats is addressing a crowd surrounded by flags sprouting blue-petaled daisies, the party's logo. Standing quietly to the side, first-time voter Leif Akeberg says he's not impressed by what he's hearing. LEIF AKEBERG: This is the Swedish Trump. OVERGAARD: He does not mean that kindly. AKEBERG: If you're clever enough, you'd understand that it's just [expletive] he's talking about. But not everyone is. OVERGAARD: Akeberg says the Sweden Democrats' policies are rooted in racism, plain and simple. And it's true that despite the party's long-running efforts to clean up its image, members are still regularly ousted for various racist offenses. But Giedra Andersson says that's not what it's about. GIEDRA ANDERSSON: It's not the time to scream that, oh, you are racist, and you will exclude everyone, and we'll be just blue-eyed, blond people in Sweden. It's not about that. It's about being reasonable, being smart and using resources. OVERGAARD: Like many of the other Sweden Democrat voters here, Andersson believes that Sweden's new arrivals are putting a strain on the country's generous welfare state, and people like her are paying the price. ANDERSSON: If you are sick and you are going to the emergency room, you have to wait for six, eight hours just to meet the doctor. And that's the reality. OVERGAARD: The Swedish government says the usual wait is more like an hour, though that's still longer than most Europeans are used to. But the issue that comes up more often than any other in this crowd is crime. Few people here seem to have been personally affected by violence, but many describe feeling unsafe. ANDERSSON: If something happens, you call to the police, you don't have a chance to - that police coming. And if you are robbed or you're attacked or you are raped, it's not safe in big cities. So I am happy that I live on the countryside. OVERGAARD: Crime statistics are tricky. Sweden, by almost any measure, is an extremely safe country. But the overall rate of crime has been slowly rising for more than 20 years. Gang violence is a real problem in some neighborhoods. And there's been a recent increase in cases of sexual assault, though that may be partly due to changes in reporting. But Sweden does not track the ethnicity of perpetrators, so making a connection between immigration and crime is a largely speculative exercise. But as political scientist Mikael Sundstrom from Lund University says, it doesn't matter. MIKAEL SUNDSTROM: You don't need solid data to sell the idea, from the Sweden Democrats' point of view, that immigrants are linked to crime. But you just need to make sure that it stays in the public mind that this or that crime was committed by an immigrant. OVERGAARD: And in that, he says they have succeeded. They've also succeeded in forcing Sweden's other leading parties to take a harder stance on immigration, a scenario that's been playing out in neighboring countries for years. Patrik Jonsson, who leads the Sweden Democrats in the Skane region, points to his counterparts in the Danish People's Party as a model for the future. PATRIK JONSSON: The whole social democracy must change direction. And if you see in Denmark, Dansk Folkeparti often support from the Social Democrats. And I think that's a direction the Swedes will see. OVERGAARD: Denmark is considered to have among the most restrictive immigration policies in Europe. Should Jonsson's dream come true, it would be a major blow to the Swedish national identity, which is firmly grounded in ideas of tolerance and inclusion. So far, mainstream parties on the right and left still say they will not negotiate with the Sweden Democrats. But if they do as well as polls are forecasting, how will either side form a functioning government without them? SUNDSTROM: (Laughter) The $10,000 question. OVERGAARD: Mikael Sundstrom says it's anybody's guess until after the vote on Sunday. For NPR News, I'm Sidsel Overgaard in Malmo, Sweden. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hundreds of right-wing demonstrators took to the streets in the eastern German city of Chemnitz to demand that foreigners leave the country following the arrest of two migrants in a fatal stabbing incident. The protesters \u2014 some masked and thrusting Hitler salutes \u2014 chanted \"Close the borders!\" and carried signs that read \"Stop the asylum flood.\" \"This is our city!\" they also chanted. Left-wing counterprotesters demanded \"Nazis out!\" The dueling sides hurled pyrotechnics and other objects at each other Monday night, causing several injuries, as a police tried to keep them separated, according to Deutsche Welle. Police and media reports estimated that there were about 1,000 anti-immigrant protesters and about an equal number of counterprotesters. The protest followed a slightly smaller gathering of right-wing protesters in the city on Sunday. On Sunday, police reported \"a series of injuries including a Bulgarian man who was threatened, two Afghan teenagers who were attacked and another person who was followed,\" Handelsblatt Global reports. The incident that triggered the protests stems from the arrest on Sunday of two apparent migrants, a 23-year-old Syrian man and a 22-year-old Iraq, in the death of a 35-year-old carpenter identified as Daniel H., who succumbed to multiple stab wounds following the attack. Two other men were reportedly seriously injured. Police said the knife attack involved \"several people of different nationalities,\" and occurred on the sidelines of the city's annual street festival. The suspects stabbed the victim several times \"with no justifiable reason,\" prosecutors said, according to Deutsche Welle. The Associated Press notes that in Chemnitz, a city of 246,000 that is situated in the former East Germany, \"almost a quarter of the voters supported the far-right Alternative for Germany party\" during last year's elections. Deutsche Welle reports that Monday night's protests \"began calmly enough, as a heavy police presence kept the two sides apart and the groups confined themselves to jeering at each other beneath the gaze of Chemnitz's colossal Karl Marx monument. But by around 9 p.m., when the demonstrations began to move, six people were injured by fireworks and rocks thrown by members of both camps who were wearing the customary black hooded tops, gloves, face coverings and dark glasses.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose fragile coalition government nearly came apart last month over the issue of asylum-seekers, responded to the violence as well as to video posted to social media that showed some protesters who appeared to target individuals due to their ethnicity. Merkel's office issued a statement condemning violence after the initial attack and protest on Sunday. \"What was seen yesterday in parts of Chemnitz and what was recorded on video has no place in our country,\" spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin. \"People ganging up, chasing people who look different from them or who come from elsewhere ... is something we won't tolerate,\" he said. \"This has no place in our cities, and I can say for the German government that we condemn this in the sharpest possible manner.\" The AP reports that Germany's Central Council of Jews also condemned the violence, saying it is a \"civic duty to stand against the right-mob.\"",

Updated at 2:51 a.m. ET Speaking to the country for the first time since being elected by party members as Australia's 30th prime minister Friday, Scott Morrison said his priority in the coming days will be to address a drought that has struck the state of New South Wales. Morrison said he would review drought response plans with officials. New South Wales is Australia's most populous state and the drought is the most severe in recent memory. He also said he would work to bring Australia's main conservative party, the Liberals, back together after it had been \"bruised and battered this week.\" Morrison's tenure marks the the sixth prime minister change in Australia in about 11 years, continuing a trend of instability that has marked the country's politics in recent years. Australia's ruling conservative Liberal Party chose Morrison, the treasurer, to replace Malcolm Turnbull as the country's next prime minister. Morrison said Turnbull has \"been a dear friend\" and said he had \"been proud to serve with him.\" Turnbull was forced out after an internal power struggle within the Liberal Party. Morrison was the \"candidate best able to gather votes from across the ideological divide,\" according to The Guardian, which notes that Morrison \"was also expected to win support from moderates who once would have viewed him with suspicion.\" The newspaper also calls Morrison the \"architect\" of the country's hardline immigration policies. Australia sends many asylum-seekers coming by boat to detention centers outside of the country. Party members voted 45-40 in favor of Morrison over Peter Dutton, a former Cabinet minister who mounted an unsuccessful challenge against Turnbull's leadership earlier this week. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop ran as well but did not advance to a final vote Friday. It was Dutton's backers who forced Turnbull to hold the leadership vote on Friday. Turnbull did not stand for election in the vote and said he will resign from Parliament \"not before too long.\" His resignation \"means the new government will face a by-election for his Sydney seat that could see it lose its one-seat majority,\" according to Reuters. Turnbull faced opposition from conservative members of his party over low poll numbers as the country approaches a general election in May 2019. Turnbull told reporters Friday there was \"a determined insurgency from a number of people both in the party room and backed by voices, powerful voices, in the media\" to \"bring down my prime ministership.\" His loss to a member of his own party continues a trend of prime ministers failing to finish their full term \u2014 Turnbull himself came to power in 2015 in what Reuters calls a \"party-room coup,\" defeating Tony Abbott. Turnbull is a \"social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker,\" who the wire service says \"has struggled to appeal to conservative voters and only narrowly won a general election in 2016.\" The Associated Press reports that the \"revolving door\" of prime ministers is \"universally hated by Australians.\"",

And the Trump administration has narrowed the grounds for who can be granted asylum in the U.S.; most people seeking asylum because of gang and domestic violence are no longer eligible. Most of the people here will very likely have their asylum claims rejected and be sent back to the countries from which they came. According to federal data, immigration judges are granting appeals from asylum-seekers half as much as they did a year ago. The other side of the Rio Grande Across the bridge from Brownsville, in the Mexican city of Matamoros, migrants await an opportunity to cross into the U.S. Some plot when they can go to a legal port of entry to claim asylum. Others will try to sneak across. A shelter called La Casa del Migrante is a stopping point for people headed to the U.S. It's also where many people who have just been deported from the U.S. seek respite as they chart their next move. This shelter is a safe haven in an otherwise violent city. For asylum-seekers turned away at the bridge, staying too long in Matamoros can be dangerous.

Vargas says people headed north are increasingly hidden in stash houses, instead of shelters like this one. He says that is because migrants now have to rely more heavily on the cartels to smuggle them to the border. But we do meet a few people headed north.

The last thing Washington needs right now is another blockbuster news story. But here it comes anyway, President Trump's latest choice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. At a minimum, that person will be the center of attention in Washington through much of the summer and fall, through Senate hearings and deliberations \u2014 after which the nominee is highly likely to be confirmed and to serve on the nation's highest court for decades. When it comes to Washington news stories, it doesn't get much bigger than that. But when it comes to news environments, this one was already overrich. The flow of news has swollen like a river that threatens to escape its banks. Set aside for the moment the drama that has the whole world transfixed: the improbable and dramatic rescue of a dozen young boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand. Set aside the global obsession with the final rounds of the World Cup and the early matches at Wimbledon. Speaking strictly of Washington government and politics, we already have more news than we can handle. It matters, because important stories are getting less attention, coverage and prominence than they should \u2014 a state of affairs likely to worsen in the weeks and months ahead. What sorts of stories are we talking about? There are so many, any catalog is likely to omit a few. But let's throw out a random sample of continuing events that have to compete these days for the front page \u2013 or for even a mention on the evening news. Demonstrators protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Trump administration's immigration policies at Daley Plaza in Chicago on June 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Trump administration's immigration policies at Daley Plaza in Chicago on June 30. Separated families: The latest news has federal officials promising to reunite children and parents separated by the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy at the border for asylum-seekers as well as other arrivals from other countries. But thousands of children remain in custody apart from their families with no clear timetable for reunion. This has been a big story for weeks now, but it begins to recede as other stories arise. North Korean meltdown: Over the weekend, North Korea lashed out at the U.S. and at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying demands for a permanent end to that country's nuclear program were \"gangsterlike\" and destructive of the attitude of cooperation previously presumed to have followed the summit meaning in Singapore. Pompeo had said the talks had been \"productive,\" but on Sunday he fired back, rejecting the North Korean criticism. The rapid deterioration in what was supposed to be a new era of negotiation and rapprochement undermined Trump's recent claims that the threat from North Korea was in the past. Putin sitdown: Trump plans to go from his summit meeting with NATO allies next week to a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. NATO leaders and Putin regard each other as nemeses in world affairs, and Trump's highly public warming toward the Russian autocrat is viewed with alarm in Europe. Trump has rejected the idea that Putin still represents the old Soviet mindset of the KGB, which he once headed. At a rally last week he said: \"Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine.\" The president has said repeatedly that the Russians deny interfering in U.S. electoral campaigns, despite the official reports to the contrary from the U.S. intelligence community and the U.S. Senate. He has also said he wants at least part of his meeting with his Russian counterpart to include only the two of them and the interpreters \u2014 no staff, no witnesses, no recording. NATO blowup: Even apart from the Putin issue, Trump has riled relations with historic U.S. allies in Europe by sending a pre-meeting letter chastising them for what he calls inadequate defense spending. He has said he considers the NATO countries to be free riders on U.S. military capability and demanded that they do more for themselves. This comes on the heels of a barrage of tariffs on goods from the European Union, which consists largely of NATO countries. Trade wars: Beyond the trade and defense contretemps with European allies and partners, the Trump administration has imposed hefty tariffs on an array of Chinese goods entering the U.S., prompting Beijing to retaliate with an equivalent round of duties. The extent and duration of this confrontation are hard to predict, but indications are it will broaden and persist while each side's stamina is tested. Wall Street seems unfazed, but soybean farmers and many manufacturers are more than worried. Mueller wars: In Washington, more people are predicting some kind of major development before summer is over in special prosecutor Robert Mueller's  probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election (see above). Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is in jail awaiting trial, denied bail because he allegedly tried to contact and influence potential witnesses in his case (which includes charges of money laundering and foreign influence peddling). Meanwhile, Trump's lawyers are saying Mueller must meet various conditions before he can seek testimony from the president. Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer for and confidant to President Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cohen crackup: Back home in Manhattan, former Trump attorney and ally Michael Cohen is facing a battery of possible charges as court-appointed attorneys sift through voluminous records seized from his home and hotel. Cohen has hired new attorneys to replace those with whom he had a mutual defense arrangement with Trump. This is the latest in a series of signals that Cohen might cooperate with prosecutors if he is not given a pardon by the president. On Sunday, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani told NBC's Meet the Press \"it would be great\" if Cohen cooperated with the government because there was nothing Cohen could tell that would be a problem \u2014 \"so long as he tells the truth.\" Pruitt exit: The contraction \"Pruxit\" never had a chance to catch on, but the most widely predicted departure yet from the Trump Cabinet finally happened on Thursday. Trump accepted the resignation of embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, saying the former attorney general of Oklahoma feared \"becoming a distraction.\" Pruitt was already the subject of more than a dozen investigations into his official and personal business since coming to Washington early in 2017. A headline on Friday, the story was so long anticipated that it already seemed \"old news.\" Affordable Care Act payments: The Trump administration has decided to hold up the next round of \"risk adjustment\" payments to health insurers under the ACA. Even a temporary interruption in the billions of dollars involved will expose the insurers to big losses, meaning they are likely to charge higher premiums or cease offering the policies this fall. The administration says it is awaiting greater clarity from the courts, which have issued somewhat different rulings regarding the payments. Congress returns: After their Independence Day recess, the House and Senate come back to find their competing farm bills and defense bills still unresolved. Fights with the president loom over his handling of trade, foreign relations in general and the funding for his wall on the Southern border. In this sort of environment, potential stories that could have a wide audience in more typical times simply go by with relatively little reaction. So a Trump rally speech in Montana on Thursday that included remarkably aggressive attacks on various adversaries barely stayed in the public eye beyond the length of its live coverage on cable TV. And a head-turning tale of U.S. officials objecting to a World Health Assembly proposal to boost the benefits of breastfeeding was likewise an also-ran for most news consumers. Ecuador had proposed the resolution backing the most traditional form of nursing babies, with new scientific support. But U.S. officials at the U.N.-affiliated conference threatened Ecuador with trade consequences if the resolution were to be approved. One can only wonder how many other remarkable stories are out there, or will be out there, going unnoticed and unremarked upon in the welter of other news.",

Since taking office on June 2, he has already put in motion a new, more liberal course after almost eight years of conservative leadership. In a matter of a few days, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the 46-year-old leader of Spain's Socialist party, has gone from unpopular-at-the-polls lawmaker to prime minister of the fourth-largest economy in the eurozone. He was sworn in on June 2, after leading a no-confidence vote in parliament on May 31 that pushed out former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, as corruption allegations badly tainted the administration's center-right Popular Party. Now, with little more than a month in office, S\u00e1nchez has wasted no time in trying to put the country on a new, more liberal course following 6 1/2 years under conservative Rajoy. His agenda, so far, has included immigration and gender issues, as well as addressing a painful chapter under Gen. Francisco Franco's 1939-1975 dictatorship \u2014 which are \"symbolic\" themes for Spaniards, said Sandra Le\u00f3n, an expert on Spanish politics at the University of York in England. \"These areas may be good because they are likely to gather public support and do not represent a budgetary liability,\" Le\u00f3n said. S\u00e1nchez's fast rise to the top of government came as a surprise to many in Spain. In 2016, he led the center-left Socialists to their worst election results in recent memory. He resigned as party leader not long after, only to be re-elected to the post by the party in May 2017. Thank you! I look forward to cooperating with you for the progress of our two countries. We must keep working for that day to arrive as soon as possible. https://t.co/5qQTcfOgOq Dubbed \"Mr. Handsome\" \u2014 by the English press, according to Spanish media, or by the Spanish themselves, according to some English papers \u2014 S\u00e1nchez brings a modern image to government. Rajoy was notoriously media-phobic and critics mocked his poor English skills. S\u00e1nchez, on the other hand, speaks the language fluently and has already been engaging in English-language pleasantries with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Twitter. When Trudeau congratulated him on becoming prime minister, S\u00e1nchez replied in English. But S\u00e1nchez's position as prime minister is fragile. The Socialists have just 84 of the 350 seats in the lower parliament. He only managed to replace Rajoy with the help of smaller parties, including the leftist Podemos and Basque and Catalan nationalist groups. S\u00e1nchez will need to keep them on his team to get legislation passed. The now-opposition Popular Party, or PP, has 134 seats. \"S\u00e1nchez has engaged in a strong signaling game, trying to show he has the statesmanship qualities and also a progressive agenda that, despite the lack of parliamentary numbers to implement it, he will try to implement after the next elections,\" said V\u00edctor Lapuente, a senior lecturer in political science at Sweden's Gothenburg University and frequent commentator in Spanish media.

On day five in office, S\u00e1nchez made history by appointing Spain's first government comprising more women than men. Eleven out of 17 cabinet posts, including at key ministries such as defense, finance, economy and the interior, are now held by women. That's the highest share of women in any cabinet in the world, according to a UN Women report. \"It's a powerful message of gender equality sent to citizens and institutions,\" Emanuela Lombardo, a senior lecturer in political science with a focus on gender at Madrid's Complutense University, told NPR. She praises the strides the new government has already made \u2014 including re-establishing the Ministry of Equality and appointing a feminist sociologist, Soledad Murillo, as secretary of state for equality. But, Lombardo says, \"the fact that the government is working with the budget approved by the former PP government,\" the party that holds a majority in the Senate, \"will create hurdles\" for further reforms. On the European Union's southwestern frontier, the Spanish coast is an arrival point for thousands of migrants each year, making risky journeys to seek refuge in mainland Europe. S\u00e1nchez is taking a principled stand on migration, in stark contrast to Europe's anti-migrant politicians, including new Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini. In June, when Italy and Malta refused permission for a rescue ship carrying 629 migrants to dock, S\u00e1nchez stepped in and said the Aquarius was welcome in Spain. The Spanish leader has been eager to work on a European-wide policies on migration. His first EU summit, held late last month, was a marathon. EU leaders managed to come to an agreement in the early hours of June 29. The deal involves opening new centers in member countries that will be used to house and process asylum-seekers \u2014 a plan that was championed by both S\u00e1nchez and French President Emmanuel Macron. The centers will be opened on a voluntary basis but will be run and funded collectively by the EU. #EUCO late night drafting #MigrationEU with @sanchezcastejon pic.twitter.com/KL69SWScCV \"The EU is beginning to move in the right direction: to give a European perspective to a European challenge like migration,\" S\u00e1nchez tweeted. While not comprehensive, the deal served as a compromise between \"front-line\" states like Spain and northern countries such as Germany. Spain's southern coast is just 8 nautical miles from Morocco and thousands of migrants have been making the perilous journey across the Strait of Gibraltar in often barely seaworthy boats. In June, over 6,000 migrants reached Spain's southern coast by sea, which is more than the number of migrants who arrived in Italy and Greece combined, according to the International Organization for Migration. The issue of Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, became the biggest political crisis to hit Spain since its return to democracy in 1978. In October 2017, Catalonia's government went ahead with a referendum on independence from Spain, which the central government in Madrid had deemed illegal. Spanish police cracked down forcefully on voters. The Rajoy administration ended up taking over the regional government and imprisoning Catalan officials aligned with the independence movement. The Catalan regional president at the time, Carles Puigdemont, fled Spain for exile in Brussels. More than seven months of Madrid's direct rule over the region ended on June 2 \u2014 the same day S\u00e1nchez took office. Catalonia's new government was sworn in under a new president, Quim Torra, a Catalan independence-minded leader with close ties to former President Puigdemont. Last week, S\u00e1nchez moved jailed Catalan politicians from prisons near Madrid to ones in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, so they could be closer to their families and lawyers. And on Monday, he met with new Catalan President Torra. Rajoy had refused to negotiate directly with Puigdemont. Una crisi pol\u00edtica requereix una soluci\u00f3 pol\u00edtica. Aquesta reuni\u00f3 \u00e9s un punt d'arrencada constructiu per a la normalitzaci\u00f3 de les relacions. pic.twitter.com/l60yTYPjVr S\u00e1nchez tweeted an upbeat message \u2014 in the Catalan language \u2014 saying \"a political crisis requires a political solution. This meeting is a constructive start toward normalizing relations.\" Many Spanish citizens are concerned by Catalonia's independence movement, but a poll in April for Barcelona's El Peri\u00f3dico newspaper found 47 percent of Spaniards support a referendum on independence as a way to ease tensions around the issue. For many analysts, how S\u00e1nchez deals with the Catalan crisis could make or break him. \"I think it will be the most divisive issue, if not in the day-to-day news cycle, then in the long term,\" said sociologist Jorge Galindo, who writes regularly on politics in the Spanish media. \"It is possible that immigration will become a politically divisive issue in Spain, something that has not happened so far. But I think S\u00e1nchez's decisions regarding the Catalan conflict are more likely to deepen the already existing divisions among citizens,\" he added. Moving the prisoners and meeting with Torra are steps toward reversing some of the previous government's actions toward Catalonia, suggesting S\u00e1nchez is more open to dialogue and compromise than Rajoy. But the prime minister has made clear that when it comes to Catalonia, there is no quick fix. \"The Catalan crisis is not going to be solved in one, two or even six years,\" S\u00e1nchez told El Pa\u00eds newspaper.

Francisco Franco's tomb at the Valley of the Fallen, near Madrid. S\u00e1nchez has committed to removing the remains of Spanish dictator Franco from the Valley of the Fallen, a macabre monument to those killed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) that many instead view as a monument to fascism. The Socialist government wants to remove Franco and turn the Valley of the Fallen, a cavernous basilica outside Madrid under which lie nearly 34,000 civil war dead from both sides of the conflict, into a place of reconciliation. The dictator's bones could be removed as soon as this month. Franco's family and far-right supporters want to block the move. The Popular Party has opposed attempts to exhume the remains of the generalissimo. \"I think that Spaniards have other priorities in their daily lives. We're seeing a government that is limiting itself to gestures and sensationalism,\" said Mar\u00eda Dolores de Cospedal, one of the candidates to succeed Rajoy as head of the PP. With the anniversary of the start of the Spanish Civil War on July 17, S\u00e1nchez could win a big publicity coup, and again hit international headlines, by exhuming Franco on that date.

S\u00e1nchez has quickly sought to ally himself with France's government, led by a fellow center-left, pro-EU moderate, and position Spain as an important European power. \"S\u00e1nchez has already made it clear that Spain's role in Europe is changing,\" sociologist Galindo told NPR. \"From a discreet position, S\u00e1nchez is leading the country to be an important part of continental decisions in what is probably the most contentious issue of today: immigration.\" Ahead of his first European summit, S\u00e1nchez made his first official visit abroad, meeting France's Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris on June 23 to discuss immigration. Macron provided support during the Aquarius crisis, offering migrants the chance to claim asylum in France if they wished. S\u00e1nchez has also shown early signs of not being easily swayed by the United States. Spain, like other NATO members, received a letter from President Trump in June urging it to increase defense spending to at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product. But in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Madrid on July 3, S\u00e1nchez said Spain's contribution should not be measured solely on spending percentages but also on its \"availability of military capacity\" and \"the willingness to use it,\" El Pa\u00eds reported. Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell added that, although Spain budgeted to spend 0.92 percent of its GDP on defense this year, it has been an active participant in NATO missions. Analysts say to expect more \"symbolic\" policymaking from S\u00e1nchez in the coming months, as he attempts to cement his power and drum up support among legislators and voters. \"He will put an emphasis on highly visible gestures and will try to avoid any major scandals,\" said political scientist Lapuente. A survey conducted by Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser following the no-confidence vote showed Spaniards have more confidence in the S\u00e1nchez administration than in the Rajoy government. The survey, published after S\u00e1nchez's first week in office, also said 41.3 percent of Spaniards believe S\u00e1nchez's government is more capable of solving the Catalan crisis, compared with just 16.5 percent who thought the same of his predecessor. The Socialist party's popularity has also risen. Two polls published in right-leaning newspapers ABC and La Raz\u00f3n in June said that the party would win considerably more seats if elections were held. Spanish elections are held every four years, so the next vote must be held before July 26, 2020. But a prime minister has the right to call a snap election at any time, something many thought S\u00e1nchez may do. But S\u00e1nchez has said he will not call elections until 2020, a canny decision, according to Lapuente. \"Time is his best ally,\" Lapuente said. \"The longer he stays in office, the longer he looks like a viable PM and the higher his chances are of winning the next elections.\"",

            "article_content": "Chancellor Angela Merkel's interior minister threatened to resign from the cabinet rather than back down on his demand that a hard line be adopted on migrants who come to Germany seeking asylum.  NOEL KING, HOST: In Germany, the political crisis over migration escalated overnight. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's interior minister offered to resign from her cabinet. He says he is not going to back down on a demand that she adopt his hard line on migrants who come to Germany seeking asylum. Now, if he quits, his Bavarian-only party may follow suit, and that would break up Merkel's conservative faction. This is something that has not happened in 42 years, and it would likely end her political career. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin following all of this. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: All right. So tell us about this interior minister and why he is willing to bring the German government down over migration at a time when the number of migrants coming to Germany is way down. NELSON: Well, his name is Horst Seehofer. He's the leader of the Christian Social Union since 2008, and this is the party that's in Bavaria. It's basically the conservative faction that's only in Bavaria and is part of the larger conservative faction that Angela Merkel heads. I mean, she heads the CDU, or the Christian Democrats. And so Seehofer has never been a fan of Merkel, and he's been particularly critical of her refugee policy. He blames her for what happened during national elections last fall where their faction lost a lot of power. He's also facing - and I should say his party is facing - a threat by the far-right Alternative for Germany in Bavaria. And he feels like if he doesn't stick to his word about addressing migration aggressively by closing the borders that this is going to come back to haunt him. So he's really ready, it seems, to defy Merkel in a way that could bring down the government. KING: Well, Seehofer had said that he would give Merkel a chance to go to Brussels last week and to meet with the European Union and bring back a deal on asylum-seekers before taking any drastic steps like closing the borders. She then did that. We had you on talking about it. Why wasn't that enough? NELSON: Well, he's very concerned about this being more about intentions rather than actions since the EU does - I mean, there are differences within the EU about how to deal with migration. So he's like, OK, this isn't really going to solve anything because there's no actions. Also, the extra deals that she managed to get, for example, with Spain and Greece to take back some asylum-seekers who show up in Germany but actually belong there in exchange for family reunification being sped up, where you would bring relatives who are in Spain and Greece to Germany, he just feels that that's just going to end up creating more migration towards Germany. But, then again, many in her governing coalition say this isn't about migration at all. It's a power play, and Seehofer just wants Merkel gone. KING: All right. So he's offered to resign. Has Merkel responded? NELSON: She has not, nor has her party. But his party, the CSU, balked and apparently persuaded him not to quit the cabinet or his post as head of their party, at least for now. Seehofer spoke briefly to reporters as he left party headquarters in Munich early this morning... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HORST SEEHOFER: (Speaking German). NELSON: ...And he said his decision to meet with Merkel and the CDU is a final attempt to try and find common ground. But again, many German politicians and pundits here expect he's just going to formally resign later today. KING: And, just briefly, what happens if he does resign? NELSON: Well, the best-case scenario - he leaves and the party or his party stays in the government and Merkel continues governing, albeit with a weakened coalition. The worst-case scenario is that the governing coalition dissolves, and she ends up being kicked out, and there are new elections. But nobody wants that because it would benefit the far-right party. KING: A lot at stake. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Thanks, Soraya. NELSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Earlier in the day she delivered a speech to a restive German parliament, deeply divided over matters of migration. Tempers are flaring at the highest political levels in Europe \u2014 to the point that even the typically stoic German chancellor, Angela Merkel, appears on edge. A clear sign surfaced Thursday morning, when Merkel tried briefing the German parliament about the European Union summit now underway in Brussels. Hecklers kept interrupting her as she spoke about the need for improved border security and keeping migrants who apply for asylum elsewhere from then doing the same in Germany. Finally, after long stretches of heckling, she stopped speaking, took a deep breath and exclaimed in German: \"My God, really?\" The issue motivating the hecklers \u2014 who are part of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD \u2014 is the same one that's causing disputes between Merkel and her EU counterparts behind doors: migration to the 28-member bloc from the Balkans, Africa or the Middle East. The number of migrants entering the EU is down significantly from where it stood three years ago. Germany, for instance, saw a 70 percent drop in asylum applications last year, according to EU regulators. Aufgrund vieler Nachfragen: Wie viele Asylsuchende kommen nach Deutschland? Ein Blick auf die aktuellen, weiter r\u00fcckl\u00e4ufigen Zahlen. pic.twitter.com/2QaYRPMtJR At the same time, more member countries are demanding that migrants who don't have visas be barred from entry. Proponents of the border closure say whether people are fleeing war, oppression or poverty shouldn't matter. They insist the problem needs to be addressed in the countries those people come from, and claim that the roughly 1.4 million mostly Muslim migrants who have come since 2015 are threatening Europe's cultural and religious identity. They often cite a terror attack by a Tunisian asylum seeker at a Christmas market in Berlin in 2016, as well as the murder of a 14-year-old German girl near Wiesbaden last month by an Iraqi asylum seeker who then fled to his homeland. (He was extradited back to Germany to face charges.) Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been especially aggressive with that narrative, referring to the migrants time and again as an \"invasion.\" Never mind that Hungary for months has only allowed two asylum seekers in per day through its heavily fortified and guarded border fences. \"I think in order to restore the European democracy we have to move in that direction,\" he told reporters at the summit, speaking in English, which he rarely does publicly. \"Finally we will you do what the people really request.\" He and other leaders in the EU also don't agree on who ought to be responsible for the newcomers: the border states where most migrants enter the bloc, the richer countries such as Germany, or a larger group of member states in order to lessen the burden on the EU border states that carry the brunt now. Merkel and her backers, including French President Emmanuel Macron and EU Council President Donald Tusk, say ultimatums and unilateral actions will only weaken the European Union and not solve the problem. Instead, they say their counterparts should focus on what they do agree upon \u2014 like the need for more secure external borders for the bloc and more control over migration to the EU. They suggest creating bilateral or trilateral deals to enforce points they agree on. \"The alternative to this solution would be a chaotically advancing closure of borders ... as well as growing conflicts among EU member states,\" Tusk said. \"Some may think I am too tough in my proposals on migrations, but trust me, if we don't agree on them, you will see some really tough proposals from some really tough guys.\" Horst Seehofer, German interior minister and CSU party leader, looks on at a weekly cabinet meeting in Berlin on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Adam Berry/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Horst Seehofer, German interior minister and CSU party leader, looks on at a weekly cabinet meeting in Berlin on Wednesday. Merkel was equally dire in her speech to the German parliament, saying the EU's fate depends on whether member states stick to or abandon their core values when dealing with migration. If bloc countries unilaterally close borders or fail to address the reasons why migrants are coming to the EU in the first place, \"no one will believe anymore in the our value system that made us so strong.\" Her own fate hangs in the balance, as well. Fearing a challenge by the AfD in state elections in October, her Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union, are threatening to quit her government over migration. And Horst Seehofer, the party's leader and Merkel's interior minister, has laid down an ultimatum to the chancellor: Either return from the EU summit with an acceptable migration deal in hand, or he will use his authority to unilaterally close Germany's border to many migrants as early as July 1. Such a confrontation would likely end in his ouster \u2014 which, in turn, would could prompt the rest of his party to quit. But it's a confrontation Seehofer says he'd prefer not to have. He told a German broadcaster Wednesday that no one in his party wants \"to jeopardize the government in Berlin, dissolve the parliamentary alliance ... or unseat the chancellor\" \u2014 though he added that her administration must demonstrate to the country that it \"had everything under control.\" Merkel's conundrum cannot be solved by something so simple as placating the CSU on her right flank \u2014 for her other major party in the governing coalition, the center-left Social Democrats, would object to many of Seehofer's more hard-line proposals. The party, known by the initials SPD, was reluctant to join the coalition in the first place \u2014 so reluctant that it took months of political wrangling, and some pretty hefty incentives, to bring them into the fold. And the SPD remains much more open to admitting asylum seekers and immigrants more broadly than their right-wing counterparts in the coalition. All this to say: Her two days in Brussels promise to have an outsize impact on the weeks to come in Berlin \u2014 a notion she emphasized during her speech to parliament Thursday. \"Europe has many challenges,\" she said, \"but migration could end up determining Europe's fate.\"",

            "article_content": "Roughly 200 people traveling from Central America arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border Sunday seeking political asylum. Immigration officials announced the San Diego County port of entry was at capacity.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Early this month, President Trump wrote on Twitter about a so-called caravan of roughly 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the United States. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, their progress toward the north has been tracked by the media, and yesterday, about 200 finally arrived at the U.S. border near San Diego. U.S. Customs officials told them to wait. They said that their facility was at capacity and could not immediately accept more asylum-seekers. INSKEEP: NPR's Carrie Kahn joins us from Mexico to talk through this story. Hey there, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. INSKEEP: So we said there were a thousand at the beginning, less now, so let's work through this. Who started out from Central America, exactly? KAHN: They are almost all Central American, mostly from El Salvador and Honduras. And they say they're seeking refuge in the United States because of the lawlessness and violence in those countries at the hands of vicious gangs, and they tell stories of extortion, violence and death threats from the gangs there. Then many of the people from Honduras on top of that say they're also facing political repression from the controversial presidential elections there last November that were widely condemned as being fraudulent. And then there's also about two dozen transgender people traveling with the caravan from all over the region, including Mexico, and they say they're facing intense persecution due to their gender identity. INSKEEP: OK, so different kinds of people, just about all from Central America, but only a couple hundred are trying to get into the United States. Who are they? And what happened to the rest of them? KAHN: Well, at one point, the caravan was well over a thousand people. I think you and I talked when they were in Oaxaca and there was that many people. Many just decided to stay in Mexico and try and receive a refugee or asylum status here. That's also not an easy path. And they've begun criticizing Mexican officials who pledged to issue such humanitarian visas to them, which organizers of the caravan say have not been granted yet. INSKEEP: OK. So some people are at least trying to stay in Mexico, but finding a challenge. Some people get to the border there just south of San Diego, and they're told, sorry, we're full. What does that actually mean - they'll never get in, or just not for a day or two? KAHN: Well, we don't know. But they are - they told them yesterday that they couldn't get in, and so a lot of them spent the night right in front of the gate there at the check - at the border station, hoping to be first in line today. They said they're not going to be deterred. INSKEEP: So the - what happens now? They just wait? KAHN: Yes, that's what happens. The asylum process can take years to go through, and if U.S. officials deem that the migrants' claims aren't credible, they'll be deported back home. But that's their biggest fear many say they're facing - that they're facing by turning themselves in at the border station - that and being separated from their children. A large number of the 200 that are here in Tijuana waiting to ask for asylum are mothers with small children. But they say they're going to come back today and insist that U.S. officials there hear their claims. INSKEEP: Carrie, this case has gotten so much attention. But very briefly, what is the actual broad flow of migrants toward the United States like these days? Is there an increase or decrease or what of people heading toward the U.S.? KAHN: Definitely, it's on the rise. It dropped significantly - arrests at the Southwest border - after President Trump was inaugurated in January of 2017. But, you know, that number has been slowly on the rise again, and we're seeing what people are calling another crisis at the border. INSKEEP: Carrie, thanks very much. KAHN: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right, last week ended with a summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. The two leaders agreed in general terms to work toward a formal end to their country's war and to remove nuclear weapons from the peninsula that they share. GREENE: Yeah, this weekend, President Trump was talking about the summit to a crowd at a campaign rally in Michigan. He said that South Korean president Moon Jae-in was insisting that the U.S. deserves the credit for this meeting's success. INSKEEP: And fans of President Trump also would say that he deserves credit, so let's talk that through with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Does President Trump deserve much credit for the developments so far? LIASSON: Sure. And as you mentioned, his supporters certainly think he does. That crowd in Michigan was chanting, Nobel, Nobel - as in, the Nobel Peace Prize. But he has been ambitious and audacious. He threatened to destroy North Korea. He put a new set of tough sanctions on North Korea, and that certainly helped get Kim to the negotiating table. But we don't know if that was a bigger motivator for North Korea than the fact that they had completed a nuclear weapon that could hit the U.S. and got closer to their goal of being accepted as a nuclear power and decided that they were in a stronger position to get relief from sanctions. So we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. INSKEEP: Yeah, I guess we should remember what North Korea wants is to get out from under sanctions. What the United States wants is for them to give up nuclear weapons, and we haven't heard a public statement. We've heard about private statements, but we haven't heard a public statement from the North Koreans that they're willing to go there, right? LIASSON: No, and they haven't been in the past. And the new national security adviser, John Bolton, said that the president would insist that the North give up all its nuclear weapons, all its nuclear fuel and all its ballistic missiles before the U.S. makes any concessions. And anyone who's had experience with North Korea in the past say that's unlikely because President Trump, as soon as the North and South start talking about a treaty to end the war, he loses some leverage. He can't credibly threaten to destroy North Korea if they're making peace with South Korea. And those tough sanctions depend a lot on Chinese participation, and the Chinese might lose some enthusiasm for the sanctions if North Korea is behaving better. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Does... LIASSON: So maybe Kim Jong Un has his own \"Art Of The Deal\" here. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. So we don't know exactly what North Korea is doing, but you're saying it could be that North Korea is trying to act nice to get away with not giving up nuclear weapons. LIASSON: Yes, and acting - and not just acting nice, actually maybe behaving better. You know, if you get a treaty that ends the Korean War, maybe they loosen some sanctions and they still get to keep their nuclear program. That seems to be their goal. INSKEEP: Mara, thanks, as always. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Mara Liasson this morning. Now, before becoming secretary of state, Mike Pompeo secretly met with North Korea's leader in preparation for that expected possible Trump-Kim summit. GREENE: Yeah, now that Pompeo has taken on his new role, his first trip is actually to the Middle East, and he's gone to Saudi Arabia. He's going to Israel and now to Jordan. INSKEEP: And NPR's Jane Arraf has been following the trip from Cairo. She joins us now. Hi there, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: So an active start for the new secretary of state - what's he saying as he travels? ARRAF: Well, he's really focused on one major theme, and it's the idea that Iran is a major threat. In fact, destabilizing and malign is how he described its activities. And we've got to remember that's very much in line with President Trump's position that there should be new sanctions against Iran if they don't cooperate on a new nuclear deal. And here's Pompeo during the press conference with Israel's prime minister on just that subject. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) MIKE POMPEO: President Trump's been pretty clear. This deal is very flawed. He's directed the administration to try and fix it. And if we can't fix it, he's going to withdraw from the deal. INSKEEP: Referring to this nuclear deal. Right. ARRAF: Absolutely. So that's great news, of course, with - for Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of his stops, and to a limited extent, to Jordan, as well. INSKEEP: And I suppose there's also a difference in tone here - isn't there, right? - just simply the fact that Rex Tillerson, his predecessor, even though he did travel, was seen as being rather quiet, rather below-the-radar, didn't talk a lot in public, and Pompeo has been talking a lot these first few days. ARRAF: That's absolutely right. He's also making clear that he is not his predecessor. So Rex Tillerson, of course, was a former oil executive, and Pompeo, as you mentioned - former CIA director and a former congressman. One of the Saudi papers called him decisive and bold, so he is signaling this is a new State Department, as far as he's concerned. INSKEEP: Well, Jane, let me ask, when you stand with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, you of course have to think about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is reaching a rather dramatic moment, isn't it? ARRAF: It absolutely is. Dramatic would be pretty much an understatement. And that's one of the things that hasn't really come to the front of this. It's a bit overshadowed by Iran. But, of course, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is that other main driver of instability in the region over years - decades, in fact. INSKEEP: And let's figure this out here. ARRAF: So the U.S., of course, is... INSKEEP: The U.S. is moving its embassy - right? - to Jerusalem. ARRAF: Yup, coming up in about two weeks. And the major problem with that in terms of some of the U.S. allies, primarily Jordan, is that pretty much blows up the traditional U.S. role as mediator. INSKEEP: The traditional U.S. role as mediator... ARRAF: So Pompeo visited Israel, but he... INSKEEP: Oh, we've got a little bit of a delay on the line. Sorry for the confusion here. But let me just ask you very briefly - Pompeo has been saying, well, OK, we're moving the embassy, but that doesn't actually settle who gets what part of Jerusalem; we can still be an honest broker and try to bring Israelis and Palestinians to the table. That's what Pompeo has said on this trip. Does it feel true from where you sit? ARRAF: It certainly doesn't feel true in Jordan, and it doesn't feel true in Baghdad. And one of the things Pompeo also said this morning is - he was asked about Israel killing protesters at the border with Gaza, 42 of them. He said that the U.S. defends Israel's right to self-defense. So you take that with the embassy move, and there's going to be quite a lot of unrest over those statements. INSKEEP: Jane, thanks very much, as always. ARRAF: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Jane Arraf in Cairo. (SOUNDBITE OF THRUPENCE'S \"FOREST ON THE SUN\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Updated 9:57 p.m. ET A group of roughly 200 people traveling from Central America, arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border Sunday seeking political asylum and were greeted by supporters across a border fence in the U.S. holding welcome signs. But upon the group's arrival, U.S. immigration officials announced that the port of entry in San Diego County had reached capacity. Officials had warned that the crossing might fill up as its capacity is just around 300 people, according to The Associated Press. \"At this time, we have reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry for CBP officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing,\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement. \"Those individuals may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities.\" Despite the news that the crossing was full NPR's Carrie Kahn reports that members of the caravan were not immediately deterred \u2014 still forming lines and hoping to march toward the crossing. If migrants approach the crossing and are turned away they would have to stay in Mexico \u2014 a decision that others had already made. The migrants are facing an uncertain future wherever they land. Many have decided not to seek to asylum in the U.S. after speaking with volunteer immigration lawyers, who have advised the migrants to be prepared for separation. The weeks-long trek by this so-called caravan is an annual, organized trip. Most of the people are from Honduras and are fleeing the violence that erupted after the highly contested presidential elections in November. Many people are also from Guatemala and El Salvador, where gang violence is prolific. Supporters of #migrant #caravan from both sides of the border have converged at fence between #Tijuana and #San Diego. pic.twitter.com/amWB8aAaTW This year's journey, however has been the target of harsh political rhetoric and ire from President Trump. He points to the group of migrants as justification for increased security, namely a border wall. Trump has also called on the Mexican government to stop the caravan before it reaches the border. The demands come amid increased tension between the two countries as they seek to hammer out a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has gone as far as to threaten NAFTA, calling it Mexico's \"cash cow,\" if the country did not act to slow traveling migrants. A number of migrants seeking asylum Sunday decided to change course along their journey, so much so that it momentarily stalled the trip. Central Americans face an uphill battle when seeking asylum in the U.S. NPR's Eyder Peralta reported that in 2010, 9 out of 10 Hondurans and Salvadorans were denied asylum, as well as 8 out of 10 Guatemalans. The Department of Homeland Security says it is monitoring the situation, and encourages the migrants to seek shelter from violence in the first safe country they encounter, including Mexico. In a statement, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said: \"If members of the 'caravan' enter the country illegally, they will be referred for prosecution for illegal entry in accordance with existing law. For those seeking asylum, all individuals may be detained while their claims are adjudicated efficiently and expeditiously, and those found not to have a claim will be promptly removed from the United States.\" Among the people planning to apply for asylum Sunday are many women and children. The U.S. has been reportedly been separating children and families to deter illegal immigration practices. Migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. are often detained, then released while their asylum claims is processed. This procedure has been dubbed by critics of immigration as \"catch and release.\" If members of the caravan are detained and released, some activists across the country are offering a place to stay while the migrants await a decision on their asylum. This includes Grace Aheron, with the network Showing Up For Racial Justice, which is organizing hosts. She shares a house with four other SURJ members in Charlottesville, Va., and they felt compelled to help. \"Many of us have connections to immigration,\" Aheron told NPR's Camila Domonoske. \"It felt like the least we could do ... to give these people that are coming from such incredibly intense and violent situations a soft place to land in the U.S.\"",

German lawmakers have officially elected Chancellor Angela Merkel to continue leading the country for a fourth term after months of grueling coalition talks that left the country in limbo following elections in September. Members of Germany's Bundestag voted 364 in favor, 315 opposed and nine abstentions. \"I accept the vote,\" Merkel told parliamentarians. Her fourth term ends more than five months of political wrangling and uncertainty that weakened Merkel's governing coalition. Last week, party leaders of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) announced that party members had endorsed a deal to form a new governing coalition with Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats. \"The fact Merkel only received nine votes more than the 355 she needed to be re-elected also shows the level of political opposition she faces in what will be her last and likely toughest term,\" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson says. The grand coalition accounts for 399 votes in the Bundestag. Percentage-wise, Merkel's previous government coalition held 80 percent of seats; that's now just 56 percent, The Local Germany reports. \"It is a good start for Germany to have a stable government ... after so many months, there is now a big incentive to get down to work with energy,\" Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said, according to Reuters. As The Associated Press notes, Merkel faces the simultaneous challenges of managing a potential trade war with the U.S., finding \"common ground with France and others on shaping the European Union's future,\" all while juggling the competing demands of a \"fragile\" coalition government. The same coalition has governed since 2013. But the Christian Democrats \"only turned to the SPD to prolong the 'grand coalition' ... out of desperation, after talks on a three-way alliance with two smaller parties collapsed last November,\" as Reuters describes. As part of the deal, the SPD now gains more influence over policy than before. The deal includes handing the SPD control of Germany's finance ministry. The SPD \"is likely to relax the strict fiscal discipline that prevailed\" under the previous finance minister, who \"enforced the austerity imposed on crisis countries like Greece and Portugal in return for eurozone aid,\" The New York Times says. The far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which saw the biggest gains in September's elections, will now be the country's biggest opposition party. \"To answer the new right-wing threat, designated interior minister Horst Seehofer has pledged a 'zero tolerance' law\" and \"faster deportations of failed asylum-seekers,\" The Local says.",

A human rights report criticizes Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya Muslims. But in presenting the findings, Amnesty officials called Bangladesh's acceptance of the Rohingya refugees, a rare bright light in a year of worsening human rights violations. Amnesty International released its annual report Thursday, highlighting a worsening of human rights worldwide. The report covering 159 countries claims that increasingly world leaders are \"undermining the rights of millions,\" either by turning a blind eye to violations of human rights or by perpetrating them. Amnesty cites Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte whose anti-drug campaign has left thousands of people dead; Russian President Vladimir Putin whose government has tried anti-corruption protestors on \"politically motivated charges;\" and President Xi Jinping of China where Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody, Internet controls were strengthened, and \"repression\" conducted under 'counter-terrorism' campaigns remained \"particularly severe\" against the Uighur minority and Tibetans. Amnesty decried a lack of leadership on human rights, pointing to the \"feeble response\" to war crimes and crimes against humanity from Syria to South Sudan. It warned that the U.S. had taken \"a step backward,\" saying that the Trump administration's early attempts in 2017 to ban all citizens of several Muslim majority countries was \"transparently hateful,\" and \"set a dangerous precedent\" for other governments to follow. Amnesty Senior Director for Global Operations Minar Pimple, however, noted that populism and the \"politics of demonization\" is a trend that began before Trump took office. Brexit and Turkey's crackdown on dissent preceded the 2016 U.S. election. Across Europe, countries saw a gathering storm against refugees, migrants, and religious minorities and the use of counterterrorism measures \"disproportionately restricting\" rights in the name of security. 2017 saw France clamp down on protests. Poland threatened the independence of the judiciary. Hungry \"reached a new low\" automatically detaining asylum seekers, in breach of EU law. Germany, grappling with an influx of refugees from the Middle East and Afghanistan, reported more than 1,000 criminal offenses against refugees and asylum seekers. But the epicenter of human tragedy this past year has been Myanmar in South East Asia. A society was \"encouraged to hate, scapegoat and fear minorities,\" culminating in the military \"ethnic cleansing\" of Rohingya Muslims, according to the report. Rohingya fled the state of Rakhine, and streamed into Bangladesh in what was the \"fastest growing crisis of 2017.\" Estimates of the number of people displaced range from 655,000 to more than 800,000. Across the globe, Amnesty said the past year showed what happens when the \"politics of demonization become mainstream.\" In India, Amnesty notes that religious minorities, especially Muslims faced \"increasing demonization by hardline Hindu groups, pro-government media, and some state officials.\" Mob violence by cow vigilantes intensified. Amnesty said India, considered a \"beacon\" of democracy in the region, saw the space for its civil society continue to shrink, as authorities used repressive laws to stifle dissent, and press freedoms came under increasing attack. Journalist Gauri Lankesh, a vocal critic of Hindu nationalism, was shot dead outside her home. Freedom of expression on college campuses \"remained under threat.\" The report states that India made efforts to expel an estimated 40,000 Rohingya refugees and send them back to Myanmar. Bangladesh, however, was called a hopeful sign in a year when the global human rights record deteriorated. The tiny, impoverished South Asian nation welcomed the great mass of Rohingya refugees into the country. However, the report also says many of the refugees lived in squalid conditions, malnutrition was rife, and inadequate protection exposed woman and girls to heightened risk of sexual violence and human trafficking. The crisis continues: new satellite images show that Myanmar authorities are bulldozing \"scores of depopulated Rohingya villages,\" according to Human Rights Watch, and it calls on the country's donors to demand it stop. HRW says the areas must be preserved, in order that investigators can \"properly evaluate the evidence\" to help identify those responsible for the \"atrocities.\" Amnesty's Regional Director for South Asia Biraj Patnaik says India \"has lost the moral high ground,\" and that China has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by India's retreat on human rights. For example, he says it was China that ultimately helped Myanmar and Bangladesh negotiate an agreement under which the Rohingya would be repatriated. But China has said that there is no one-size-fits-all standard for human rights, that countries are free to follow their own standards. \"Countries can find their own models of human rights protection in light of their national conditions and people's needs,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently said. Accordingly, Patnaik sharply criticized the Beijing-brokered accord for failing to adequately safeguard the Rohingya in line with human rights principles: \"It does not guarantee safe, dignified, voluntary, or sustainable returns. It does not guarantee that the Rohingya would not be sent back to the same conditions that they fled from.\" Amnesty points out that China has managed to head off criticism inside the U.N. of its own crackdown on lawyers and activists. In June, Greece, a recipient of Chinese investment, blocked an EU statement critical of China's rights record, calling it \"unconstructive.\" As the report documents the \"bitter fruit\" of deteriorating worldwide human rights, the year was not without human rights victories. Amnesty says the #MeToo has elevated the issue of harassment and discrimination against women into a global phenomenon. Young people have showcased the growing influence of social movements, be it raising their voices against attacks on minorities in India or marching against gun violence in the United States. Secretary General of Amnesty International Salil Shetty said, \"There is a palpable sense that protest movements are on the rise globally.\"",

He's seen here with members of his Cabinet after they were sworn in in 2016. Australia's government is holding \"an urgent investigation\" into how hundreds of classified documents about the interior workings of several recent administrations found their way to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The ABC says the thousands of pages of documents had been left in two filing cabinets, which the government then sold off at a secondhand shop. The cabinets were bought cheap, the network says, because they were locked and the keys had been lost. Inside the cabinets were records of five separate governments that spanned nearly 10 years; some of them refer to current members of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Cabinet. The ABC began publishing parts of the files this week, revealing the embarrassing inner workings of government \u2014 and, today, reporting that the trove of documents also include references to at least two other previously unknown breaches, in which hundreds more secret and sensitive documents were either lost or left unsupervised. Dubbing the documents the Cabinet Files, the network calls it \"one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history,\" adding that \"the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing.\" Among the revelations from the files: When ABC began publishing some of the news from the documents this week, it triggered speculation about a possible leak in the current government that Turnbull has led since 2015. But the network says there was no leak and that no one broke the law \u2014 instead, someone finally got around to drilling out the locks on the two heavy cabinets that had been sold without any matching keys. \"The documents were in two locked filing cabinets sold at an ex-government sale in Canberra,\" the ABC says. \"A nifty person drilled the locks and uncovered the trove of documents inside.\" The cabinets and their contents were bought \"for small change\" in a sale that could have been made to anyone, the network says. It adds, \"The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade. Nearly all the files are classified, some as 'top secret' or 'AUSTEO,' which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only.\" The ABC isn't releasing any names or details about who bought the old, information-rich cabinets, or how it learned about them. Citing confidential sources, the network says it will \"protect their privacy at all costs.\" After news of the massive security breach broke, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provided no more details, releasing a statement saying only that it's looking into \"the circumstances around the disposal of two Commonwealth Government filing cabinets that allegedly contained classified material.\" Under Australian law, the Cabinet records would have become public only after at least 20 years had passed. But thanks to those other, more common cabinets, they're being scrutinized now.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Mara Liasson discusses the week in politics with host Sacha Pfeiffer - including President Trump's latest reported effort to change the US asylum system.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: President Trump has threatened again to close the southern border to migrants traveling through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S. His latest threat came last night on Twitter. He also tweeted, all will stay in Mexico until their claims are individually approved in court. His comments come on the heels of a Washington Post story about a White House effort to overhaul longstanding asylum rules. To talk about this and other political news is NPR's Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. PFEIFFER: Mara, the Post report said that the Trump administration had reached a deal with Mexico's incoming government that asylum-seekers would potentially wait in Mexico while their claims are being considered. Now, that information was attributed to senior members of the transition team for Mexico's president-elect. But after the story came out, Mexico's incoming government denied there was agreement and said talks are ongoing. So what do we know? And if this does happen, how big a deal would it be? LIASSON: I think it would be a big deal for Donald Trump because it would change the asylum rules at least in the short term. Right now, as you said, asylum-seekers can wait in the U.S. for their cases to be heard. But if this plan succeeds, Donald Trump can say he ended the system that he calls catch and release because they'd have to remain in Mexico. That's actually the name of this plan - remain in Mexico. What this would not do is address the reasons - violence, crime, poverty - that the migrants flee their Central American countries in the first place. PFEIFFER: Another effort by the White House to change asylum rules was blocked by a federal judge early last week, and that led to, let's call it, some testy back-and-forth between President Trump and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts over the independence of the judiciary. LIASSON: Yes, it did. Now, this is not the first time that Donald Trump has attacked a judge - an individual judge or an entire circuit. This time, he called that judge, who ruled against him, a quote, \"Obama judge.\" But for the first time, Chief Justice Roberts pushed back. He issued a statement to The Associated Press. He said there are no Obama judges. The judiciary is independent. Trump tweeted back sorry, Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do have Obama judges. Roberts doesn't want the Supreme Court to become another partisan institution where people see justices as just another group that vote with their tribe, you know, without legal logic or reasoning. That might be a losing battle because President Trump and, certainly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell don't view the judiciary that way. But if Donald Trump is a kind of stress test on democratic institutions, sometimes, they submit, like the Republican majority in Congress. But, sometimes, they push back and are resilient. And that's what I think you saw with Justice Roberts last week. PFEIFFER: And finally, Mara, Trump is scheduled to be in Mississippi tomorrow to campaign in that - in the still-unresolved Senate race of 2018. He'll be there for Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. She's in a runoff election with Democrat Mike Espy. Hyde-Smith, as we have reported, got a lot of negative press for publicly joking that if she were invited by one of her supporters to a public hanging, she would, in her words, be in the front row. LIASSON: That's right. And many people thought that was racially charged language. Mississippi had a record number of lynchings. She also made some other jokes that people thought had racial overtones. This is the last act of the midterm. It does not affect the balance of power in the Senate. The Republicans will either have 52 or 53 seats. But Mississippi is an extremely red state. And it's going to be hard but not impossible for Mike Espy to win. He's African-American. He'd need huge turnout among African-American voters and a pretty decent chunk of the white vote to win. And just one other thing I want to point out - there's another race we're watching - on December 4, a runoff in Georgia for the secretary of state's race to replace Brian Kemp, who's now the governor-elect. This is a big race for voting rights because the secretary of state oversees the state's ballot process. PFEIFFER: That's NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. Thank you.

DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right. This morning, meet the new German government. It is the same as the old German government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, her conservatives and center-left allies ended a 15-week-long political crisis and struck a deal to form a government. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has more on this from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Merkel looked exhausted after a marathon 24-hour final session to clench the deal for a new governing coalition. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: She said she wasn't sure until the very end that the deal would happen and lauded the negotiators for persevering. Without a deal, Germany would've faced new elections. But no one, not even the negotiators, is thrilled about having the same governing coalition that ended up costing its members the worst election showing in history last fall. Horst Seehofer of the conservative CSU party in Bavaria says he and the other coalition partners now get what the German public wants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HORST SEEHOFER: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: He promised sweeping changes that will create more opportunities and benefits for all Germans. A 28-page deal is also set to cap asylum seekers coming to Germany for the first time at no more than 220,000 per year, which is something the conservatives have been demanding. The new governing coalition still has to be approved by members of each of the three parties. Details of the new government, including who gets what cabinet posts, still need to be hammered out. That means the new German government isn't likely to take office before April. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin.

Scott Morrison is the new prime minister.  NOEL KING, HOST: All right, some interesting news out of Australia this morning. For the sixth time in 10 years, Australia has a new prime minister. This comes after a week of partisan feuding. And the man who finds himself in the top job is a complete surprise. Louisa Lim is reporting for NPR News from Melbourne. LOUISA LIM, BYLINE: It's been a head-spinning week in Australian politics and has produced a new prime minister, who until two days ago swore he didn't want the job. Former Treasurer Scott Morrison won the post in a surprise twist during an internal leadership contest in the ruling Liberal Party. ScoMo, as he's known here, is a conservative famed for his tough stance on asylum-seekers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER SCOTT MORRISON: My plan for this country is for an even stronger Australia, to keep our economy strong, to guarantee the essentials that Australians rely on, to keep Australians safe from terrorism. LIM: His boss, Malcolm Turnbull, the millionaire politician, is now out. Turnbull's remembered for his testy relationship with President Trump, who reportedly hung up on him in their first phone call. But Turnbull's critics opposed him over a plan to cut emissions. This week, he was challenged by his own immigration minister, who in the end couldn't muster enough votes to win the ballot. In his final speech, Turnbull blasted what he called an insurgency inside his own party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MALCOLM TURNBULL: Australians will be just dumbstruck and so appalled by the conduct of the last week. LIM: That was pretty much the mood in one Melbourne pub. Andrew Mackenzie and Adrian Branigan were spluttering into their pints. ANDREW MACKENZIE: It really is a debacle. I\u2019ve lost trust in the whole political system. ADRIAN BRANIGAN: The last four prime ministers we've had haven\u2019t served out their term, so we are becoming a joke. LIM: The ruling party is left in tatters, destroyed by its own power play. And many are calling for an early election to return politics to the people. For NPR News, I'm Louisa Lim in Melbourne. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Italy goes to the polls Sunday following one of the country's nastiest campaigns. We look at the implications for Italy and the EU.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Italians are going to the polls today to elect a new Parliament. This follows one of the nastiest and most violent political campaigns in decades. Italy's European partners are anxiously waiting for the result, fearful that a possible success of populist parties would have far-reaching, negative impacts on the European Union. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli joins us on the line from Rome. Good morning. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, as I've just said, it was a very acrimonious political campaign. What is the root of all this anger? POGGIOLI: Well, the campaign has been dominated by fear mongering over the arrival of more than 600,000 mostly African migrants in the last four years. The pivotal moment came in early February when a right-wing extremist in the town of Macerata shot and wounded six African migrants. He was arrested and claimed he acted in revenge for the murder of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose suspected killers are two Nigerians. That incident inspired several right-wing politicians to use racist language that had not been heard in decades, like calls for the mass deportation of migrants and blaming the outgoing center-left government for the influx of asylum-seekers, saying it has blood on its hands. After that, several left-wing activists were beaten up while putting up posters. A politician for a fascist party was beaten up on the street. And there have been clashes between anti-fascists and fascists in many cities. MONTAGNE: Well, you know, when you talk about fascists, one would think that that movement and the fascism of Mussolini - its ideas might have been buried a long time ago in Italy. POGGIOLI: Yeah, well, theoretically, in 1945 when the dictatorship fell. But, you know, Italy was never made to come to terms with its fascist past. There were no Nuremberg trials. And many fascist bigwigs just blended back into society. Italy had a large communist movement that had been the backbone of the partisan battle against fascism. So with the start of the Cold War, the allies feared communists would take over and did not push for a defascistization (ph) of society. So today, there are several openly fascist parties running in this election. They probably won't overcome the 3-percent threshold to get into Parliament. But they're very visible. They were very loud. And they've, you know, reawakened the political ghosts of the past. They've emboldened other populist parties to use language and make proposals that, until recently, mainstream politics would have really considered unacceptable. MONTAGNE: What happened to the moderates, though? I mean, why hasn't the outgoing ruling party, which is center-left, been able to showcase some real achievements that it's had? POGGIOLI: Well, some of their problems - they're doing very badly in the polls - is due to the personality of the Democratic Party leader, Matteo Renzi. He has a very sharp Tuscan wit, which, to non-Tuscans, makes him sound like an obnoxious smart aleck. And he's deeply disliked within his own party. Several members of the leftist old guard accused Renzi of being too centrist. They broke away, and that strongly weakened the party. Under the party leadership, Italy's economy came out of a very devastating recession. And it has grown in the last five years, not as fast as its European partners. But it's done much better. And the party also passed a landmark civil rights legislation with a civil unions law for same-sex couples, despite the strong influence of the Catholic Church in politics. But, you know, the party's push for structural reforms was strongly resisted by both the right and the left. Italians are essentially conservative. They don't like change. But the populists are really pushing a vision of the past. And they're strongly skeptical of the European Union. And if they came to power, that could further destabilize the EU at a time when the bloc is already dealing with Britain's exit and growing authoritarianism in member states like Poland and Hungary.

            "article_content": "European Union leaders have met at a time of deep division because of migration to the continent. At stake is the fate of the EU's border-free travel zone.  NOEL KING, HOST: Leaders of the European Union were up all night in Brussels in a combative meeting to hammer out a deal on migration. Now, this is an agreement that affects not only the future of people trying to escape war and oppression and poverty. It affects the future of the EU itself. What happens there will also help determine whether Angela Merkel remains the chancellor of Germany. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Brussels covering this summit. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Hello. KING: All right. So let's start with Angela Merkel. She has a lot riding on what happens at this two-day summit. Remind us, what's going on with her in Germany? NELSON: Well, back in Germany, she has a very rebellious interior minister who belongs to her conservative Bavarian party, and they're facing a challenge from the far-right Alternative for Germany. So what they've done is made migration a key issue. And what this interior minister is now threatening to do is, on Sunday, close the borders of Germany sort of in rebellion. I mean, you know, without her permission, against - or, I should say, to migrants, or most migrants who are trying to get to Germany. So that's a real problem, and it would force her to fire him, which in turn could make the government collapse, which would lead to new elections and end her career. KING: So did this plan that they came up with in Brussels last night put an end to her political woes? Did it solve her problems? NELSON: Well, we'll have to see. The conversation she's going to be having with that interior minister and the Bavarian party doesn't take place until Sunday. But, certainly, the fact that the EU is taking a harder line now, at least vocally, about migration should play in her favor. And, certainly, Merkel sounded a lot happier than she did yesterday when she was in the German parliament and snapped at her hecklers who oppose her humanitarian stance on refugees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: She says that here in Brussels, after this deal was struck, that she's optimistic and that she and other EU leaders will continue to bridge their differences, but that they have an awful lot of work to do. And they actually do. KING: All right. Well, this session last night lasted more than nine hours, which is quite the marathon. What did they actually - what did the leaders actually decide on? NELSON: Well, it was more about intention and expressing solidarity rather than any kind of firm actions, but they did talk about the need for screening centers on European soil for migrants who come by boat so that the pressure is eased on Italy and Greece and Spain and other countries where these migrants get to when they go by boat. But the thing is, it's a voluntary thing and, so far, no countries are at least expressing an interest in hosting these centers. Another key thing was that they talked about needing to reaffirm their commitment with Turkey, which has been taking a lot of refugees and asylum-seekers and migrants, and also potentially setting up centers for asylum-seekers in Africa. So basically, they would file their claims for the European Union in centers there. But again, a lot of we should do this, we're thinking about doing is, we agree on doing this, but not really any details. KING: And, just briefly, you know, you mentioned Italy. Italy was threatening to scuttle this entire summit if it didn't get its concerns about migration addressed. Is Italy calmed down for the moment? NELSON: Certainly, they've calmed down. But if they were looking for some exact relief - which they do need. They do receive a lot of refugees that are coming across the sea - they didn't get it. And so, you know, but, the fact that there is actually an EU agreement, that certainly is something that Italy welcomes. KING: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. Thanks, Soraya. NELSON: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Children are being taken from parents who have crossed illegally into the U.S. Republicans introduced a bill that would end the practice, but it would require Democrats to agree to fund a border wall.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This is a valuable moment to recall the Trump administration's public embrace of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. It's valuable to recall it because the policy has come under so much criticism that the administration has begun to deny the policy exists. It is, however, all on the record, much of it broadcast on this program, as we will discuss with NPR's Scott Detrow, who's in our studio. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So let's listen. Who first described this zero-tolerance policy of arresting everybody who crossed the border illegally, which meant in many cases taking children away? DETROW: Let's start with the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an immigration hard-liner. Here he is speaking on May 7. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF SESSIONS: If you're smuggling a child, then we're going to prosecute you. And that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law. If you don't want your child to be separated, then don't bring him across the border illegally. INSKEEP: So they're very clear. Although it is clear also that that's not necessarily required by law. Previous administrations did something different. But they're making it clear they're going to separate the children. Who else has talked about this? DETROW: Well, John Kelly, the chief of staff, said in an interview with NPR's John Burnett that the administration sees it as a deterrent. This is a long clip, but it's worth taking a listen to. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JOHN KELLY: But a big name of the game is deterrence. If your... JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: And so family separation stands as a pretty tough deterrent. KELLY: Could be a tough deterrent, would be a tough deterrent, a much faster turnaround on asylum-seekers. BURNETT: Even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children. KELLY: Yeah. I think cruel and heartless - I wouldn't put it quite that way. The children will be taken care of. BURNETT: Yeah. KELLY: They're put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States. And this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long. INSKEEP: So a deterrent to children put into foster care or whatever, in Kelly's words. Has the administration continued to push this policy? DETROW: They have. Just Friday on MORNING EDITION, Ryan Patrick, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) RYAN PATRICK: We are following the law. I mean, there's many people who... INSKEEP: But let's remember also you can follow the law in a different way. Previous administrations have. This is a policy choice. PATRICK: Well, it is a policy choice by the president and by the attorney general. INSKEEP: Policy choice by the president and the attorney general. But over the weekend, the criticism became so fierce that Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security whose people are largely responsible for implementing this policy, sends out a tweet. Quote, \"we do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\" It's clear they do have a policy. So when she falsely denies it, what's happening here? DETROW: Well, you've seen the administration come under blunt, intense criticism from people who are usually Trump allies or people who don't weigh in on politics at all. Just in the last few days, former first lady Laura Bush called this cruel and immoral. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who's the most high-profile American conservative voice in the Catholic Church, he said this is unjust, un-American and unbiblical. Even evangelical leaders like Franklin Graham have criticized this in similar language. INSKEEP: President Trump, I guess we should mention, keeps insisting that Democrats are to blame for this policy, which is also false. It seems this is a policy choice by the administration. But what is the president up to? He is insisting that there ought to be a change in the law in some way. DETROW: Well, it's interesting. You have the - many people in the Trump administration denying that they're using this as some sort of political leverage in the broader conversation about an immigration bill, but President Trump is leaning into that pretty hard. Here's a couple tweets from this weekend. This is one - the Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something on border security and safety. Don't wait until after the election because you're going to lose. He also wrote, Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with Republicans on new legislation. INSKEEP: Oh, which is essentially saying, make me do this by changing the law in some way but as part of a broader bill that includes things like funding for a wall that I want. So what is Congress actually going to do here, if anything? DETROW: This was already going to be a big week for immigration. The House is going to hold votes on a couple different immigration bills aimed at dealing with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, creating some sort of permanent protection, and also increasing border security. The issue is that for months now Congress has not been able to find a way to satisfy people who want a fix for DACA and people who want hard-line immigration changes. It's hard to do both. They haven't had the votes to do both yet. They're going to try again this week. INSKEEP: And now one bill would in some way ban family separation, although it would allow the zero-tolerance policy of arresting everybody to continue. DETROW: The short summary is that children would be kept with their parents but within ICE detention facilities. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks very much. DETROW: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Detrow.

            "article_content": "Many considered Brett Kavanaugh the front-runner to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, even before Kennedy announced his retirement. Despite his credentials, Kavanaugh still met resistance within Trump world.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many considered Brett Kavanaugh the front-runner to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, even before Kennedy announced his retirement. Despite his credentials, Kavanaugh still met resistance within Trump world. In the end, after days of highly dramatized deliberation, President Trump had to choose. He had to choose not only between several possible nominees for the Supreme Court, but also between categories of advisers. In this case, he chose to listen to his lawyers rather than his talk show hosts. And he did not seem overly concerned about the warning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had issued over the weekend about which prospective nominees would be easiest to get confirmed. The man the president finally summoned to the stage in the East Room of the White House on Monday night was Brett Kavanaugh, whom many considered the front-runner to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy even before Kennedy had announced his retirement. Kavanaugh was once a clerk for Kennedy, overlapping briefly with Neil Gorsuch, the man President Trump made his first choice for the Supreme Court last year. This time around, Kavanaugh was the lead horse, the candidate with the glittering resume and the inside track. As a double Yalie, he would keep intact the current domination of the court by just two law schools: Harvard and Yale (Gorsuch went to Harvard). He also has the longest and most distinguished record of service as a federal appellate judge among the four finalists announced by the White House. Kavanaugh has written a lot of important decisions, because he serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often called \"the Little Supreme Court\" for its docket of administrative and constitutional cases and its history of sending its alumni to the high court across the street from the Capitol. All this mattered to the man who has run the vetting process for Trump's judicial nominees, White House Counsel Don McGahn, who was joined by other prominent legal minds within the GOP. They led the president to follow once again the conventional script for appointing conservative Republicans to the Supreme Court, finding the name on his famous list of 25 that pleased him while checking off the maximum number of boxes. The list, of course, came from the Federalist Society and its leader, Leonard Leo, with input from other conservative organizations. It played an enormous role in Trump's 2016 election, reassuring a whole category of religious conservatives that Trump would appoint a court that would overturn Roe v. Wade and do it \"automatically,\" as he promised in his third presidential debate against Hillary Clinton. Yet in Kavanaugh, Trump chose someone who might well have been chosen by President George W. Bush (for whom Kavanaugh worked as staff secretary in the White House, helping to choose his Supreme Court nominees) or by the elder President Bush, or Ronald Reagan. Trump even paid homage to Reagan in his introductory remarks, saluting the Gipper for putting Kennedy on the court three decades ago. With all these credentials, Kavanaugh still met resistance within Trump world. Longtime association with the Bush family is not generally a plus in the president's realm, nor is the sense that Kavanaugh might surprise once he has reached the ultimate level of independence on the court. Critics have complained that the hundreds of thousands of pages and emails and everything else Kavanaugh has produced will slow the confirmation process and perhaps complicate the vote. Besides, Kavanaugh was not the exciting, breakout, populist, anti-establishment pick some on the right had wanted and expected. When presented with a chance to vote against Obamacare from his perch on the appeals court a few years ago Kavanaugh chose an \"off-ramp\" to avoid a strong opinion. When he was a prosecutor working for independent counsel Ken Starr in the late 1990s, he concluded that former White House counsel Vince Foster had not been murdered (as countless conspiracy theorists maintained). And there are surely other jurists out there who have worked harder to establish their bona fides with the far right. Moreover, there were boomlets in the last few days for other prospective nominees. Thomas Hardiman of the Pennsylvania Circuit, the runner-up to Gorsuch, was still presumed the favorite of his former colleague Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister. And Raymond Kethledge of Michigan was, with Hardiman, one of the two prospects McConnell thought it would be easiest to confirm. So there was uncertainty right up until curtain time at the White House on Monday night, the culmination of the latest production by Trump the Showman. Given a rather predictable nominee to present, Trump managed through days of interviewing and sending mixed signals to create an atmosphere of suspense. Remarkably, the usually leaky White House operation managed to preserve The Secret right up to the moment of The Big Reveal at 9 p.m., allowing speculation and campaigning and contesting of the nomination throughout the final day. That meant cable TV and Twitter were teeming with such prominent and influential talk show personalities as radio host Steve Deace in Iowa and Sean Hannity on Fox News, voicing their fervent support for Amy Coney Barrett, an Indianan serving on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Conservative media stars such as Erick Erickson, former CEO of RedState.com, were rhapsodizing about what a Barrett pick would mean to them. Erickson, who has been hot and cold on Trump, said he'd vote for him in 2020 \"despite the tariffs\" and other disagreements if the president opted for the former Notre Dame law professor, who has become something of a Joan of Arc for social and religious conservatives. Hannity, who communicates with the president daily and seems at times his alter ego, also made no secret of his preference for Barrett. So he may have been giving a little bit away when he appeared on Fox's The Five on Monday evening. Hannity told Fox viewers to close their eyes just before Trump revealed his choice so they could imagine who the new justice might be if Hillary Clinton were president. In other words, anyone on the Trump short list would be great by comparison to any Clinton pick. It sounded as though Hannity wasn't really expecting his own first choice to win. Of course, by the time Kavanaugh was official and the reactions were pouring in, the Barrett fans were mostly climbing on board \u2014 despite their earlier reservations. They really had little choice. The atmosphere in the East Room of the White House on Monday night was celebratory and relieved. Trump himself delivered a brief tribute to Justice Kennedy, and well he might. For by retiring just now, Kennedy has given the president the ultimate political gift \u2014 the chance to change the subject, reprise his Greatest Hit (the Gorsuch nomination) and shape the political debate in the months leading into the November midterm elections. Not so long ago, Trump and the GOP had hoped to ride their tax bill to popularity this year. But the public has remained largely indifferent (or even hostile) to their signature legislation. Trump's get-tough tariff regime has induced anxiety among farmers and manufacturers and may soon worry workers as well. The \"zero tolerance\" policy at the southern border has produced heart-rending visuals and a genuine crisis over families of asylum seekers separated and imprisoned. The crown jewel of a peace process with North Korea seems to be falling apart before actually achieving anything for the U.S. And the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election continues apace, with 19 indictments so far and Trump's former campaign manager sitting in jail awaiting trial. Yet now, with the Kavanaugh confirmation process underway, Trump can hearken back to Gorsuch. No other action Trump has taken to date has so consistently pleased his base, the party and the broader conservative movement. As to resistance from the other side of the political aisle, the objections from Democrats and their constituency groups arrived at least as fast as the praise from the right. But in the end, having some of the talk show hosts and other firebrands a little disappointed by the pick may help Trump and McConnell prevail. Having chosen a candidate who will unite nearly all conservatives, Trump and McConnell can now focus on winning over a few Democrats. And Kavanaugh is not a naturally divisive personality, but a rather personable and presentable fellow with many friends, a charming family and a lifelong active church life. (Like the other three finalists, he is a Catholic.) Some Democrats will still see Kavanaugh as they did a decade or so ago, as a combatant in some of the worst moments of partisan warfare in recent decades. He was a lawyer in the Bush v. Gore case that decided the 2000 election, and before that, a lawyer with the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. When Bush first appointed Kavanaugh to the federal bench, the Democrats held up his nomination for years. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said naming Kavanaugh to the bench wasn't just \"throwing salt in the wound, it was throwing in the whole shaker.\" Kavanaugh was re-appointed in 2006 and confirmed. In those days, we should note, the minority party could filibuster or threaten to filibuster a presidential nominee. That ended when the Democrats, as the majority, decided to eliminate the filibuster on presidential nominees for all but the Supreme Court. In 2017, McConnell killed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations as well. Thus Gorsuch was confirmed with 54 votes, and Kavanaugh can be confirmed with as few as 50. Schumer has said he will again oppose Kavanaugh \"with everything I have.\" But he does not seem to have much at this point, barring a defection from the GOP side. Kavanaugh has not said or written anything showing \"hostility\" to Roe v. Wade, which was the line drawn in the sand by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of two Senate Republicans to have defended abortion rights. But as a name on the list of 25 from the Federalist Society touted by Trump in 2016, he would have to have impressed some experts as a jurist who might well overturn Roe. Kavanaugh will also have to survive the kind of high-stakes grilling meted out in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he has not faced in a number of years. On the other hand, Kavanaugh will probably have some appeal to at least a few of the 10 Democrats running for Senate re-election this fall in states that voted for Trump. That, and a united Republican Party, should ease his way to the bench in time for the next term to begin Oct. 1.",

            "article_content": "A Honduran mother of two, who is pregnant with a third, remains in a Mexico City shelter after hearing of the U.S. family separation policy.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: At a migrant shelter in Mexico City, it's time for English class. The children are sitting behind a wooden table. They're mischievously running up to the teacher or giggling with their classmates. UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: Es eye. Eye. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Eye. UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: And when they get too rowdy, the teacher makes them focus with a song. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: (Singing in Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: The children, who are anywhere from 6 to 10 years old, practice words like hair and ear and eye. There is one word they all know, though. UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: Hi. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hi. GARCIA-NAVARRO: They say hi and greet me with big smiles. And then one little girl with long, tangled, brown hair, jumps up and throws herself into my arms for a hug, and she doesn't want to let go. The little girl's mother is from Honduras. And the family, which includes another little boy, has been here at this shelter for about a month. We aren't using any names for the family's protection. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: The young mother is in her mid-20s, petite with a dimple and big, bright eyes. She left her home behind because of threats from the father of her two children. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"He would hit me,\" she says. \"He would threaten me and the children. I sent him to prison, but he's out now, and he's psychotic,\" she says. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"And even though I moved from home to get away from him, he would always discover where I was.\" UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: He was involved in the gang, she says, with bad people that can do a lot of damage. When he found out that she was with another man and pregnant, he went crazy, she said. And that's when she decided she had to leave, taking the long road north, hoping to get to America in safety. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: But she's heard about President Trump's new zero-tolerance policies. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also made it harder for victims of domestic violence to get asylum in the United States. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: So she decided to wait here for now, unsure what to do next in the midst of the Trump administration's shifting policies. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"It's very difficult that they're doing this,\" she says. \"Our children are our lives. I don't know what to do. It's just unimaginable that they would take my children away. Everything I've done has been in order to protect them and stay with them.\" UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"But I can't go back to Honduras, and I can't stay in Mexico either.\" She says her husband tracked her down to another Mexican migrant shelter and then called her mother. She says, \"He told my mother he would find me and send me and my children home in pieces.\" UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: So she's staying put for now. But other migrants are still traveling north. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN MOVING) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Our next stop is in the town of Apizaco, about two and a half hours from Mexico City. I'm standing on the side of the train tracks. The migrants are perched on top of these trains. They're carrying backpacks. They're - it's chilly. They're wearing woolen hats as the train rumbles north. Some jump off while the train is moving and make their way to the Sagrada Familia migrant shelter right next to the tracks. It offers them a safe place to sleep, some hot food before they grab the next train to the border. Inside, the migrants pass the time sitting in the concrete courtyard or kicking a ball around. Sergio Luna is the shelter director. SERGIO LUNA: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's a dangerous journey, he says. Some will be attacked, raped or lose limbs making their way north. In fact, while we're there, we see a couple try and jump onto the train and miss, almost getting pulled under the grinding wheels. And on top of these dangers, Luna says, now migrants have heard they might be separated from their kids in the U.S. or be put in detention. LUNA: (Through interpreter) They are telling us they don't want to lose their children. At the same time, they don't want to stay here in Mexico. They are trapped here because many of these families are fleeing for their lives from violence. (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: He says Mexico isn't safe for these migrants, as criminal groups also target them here. But Mexico is now forced to accommodate them because of U.S. immigration policy. LUNA: (Through interpreter) Mexican government, as well as UNICEF, the United Nations and other groups that deal with this are simply not prepared to help and protect these migrants. At the moment, it's temporary shelters like these that are the frontlines of helping these stranded migrants. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN HORN) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Before I leave, Luna tells me he worries that the Trump administration will use immigration as a currency to be bartered. Trump often links the issue of immigration to negotiations on trade with Mexico. Adding to all this volatility is the direction Mexico itself is headed. On July 1, there will be a presidential election. And if the polls are to be believed, front-runner and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could win. The former American ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, says he will have to confront the issue of immigration head on. ROBERTA JACOBSON: I think one of the things that's most interesting that he will discover is that Mexico has become, in some ways - and I don't want to overstate this - more and more like the United States in the migration issue in that it is not just a transit country anymore. It is, in fact, a receiving country. There are people from all over the world, but in particular from Central America, who are coming to Mexico and staying. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Since 2014, the number of people seeking asylum in Mexico has increased 683 percent to nearly 15,000 asylum-seekers. This year, there will be even more. Human rights groups say helping Central American migrants is not Mexico's priority. Instead, despite the claims of President Trump, the country has been upping its enforcement and cooperation with the U.S. by deporting Central Americans here illegally. Migration experts estimate that 400,000 Central American migrants enter Mexico every year, and Roberta Jacobson says Mexico has been a vital partner in U.S. immigration strategy. JACOBSON: Mexico has returned as many as half the number of people who in total attempted to get to the United States, so it does make a difference to the United States whether or not Mexico is cooperating. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That cooperation between the incoming government and the Trump administration is not a given anymore. All three main candidates have come out and condemned Trump's immigration policies. And while the election here is not about Donald Trump, he is deeply unpopular and questions are being asked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: On an afternoon talk show, this was the exchange between the anchor and guest in reaction to Trump's zero-tolerance policies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GUEST: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: The anchor says, according to Mr. Trump, Mexico does nothing. But a terrorist has never crossed into the U.S. via the southern border - never. The guest responds, at this moment, the question is this - Mexico has had a historic collaboration on migration, and what has that gotten us? We shouldn't get angry, but we should rethink our policies in regards to the United States. And Mexico's next potential president could do just that. We spoke with Lopez Obrador's top security adviser Alfonso Durazo, who suggested in our interview that immigration enforcement would no longer be a priority. ALFONSO DURAZO: (Through interpreter) Military and police force will not be used to repress the migrant population. We'll primarily use diplomatic channels with the origin countries of these migrants to reach some kind of agreement. GARCIA-NAVARRO: A former Trump administration official with knowledge of Mexico told me that some at the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. are worried about what Lopez Obrador could do. Trump's immigration policies could force Lopez Obrador into a corner, the official said. And the new government may take their foot off the gas on migration enforcement. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Que paso? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Back at the shelter in Mexico City, the young mother holds her daughter close. (Speaking Spanish). The little girl who hugged me says, while shyly smiling, that she wants to be a doctor when she grows up. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Doctora. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Doctora, wow. For now their fate is unclear. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: The young mother says, \"We're human beings with feelings. My family in the U.S. keeps telling me to be patient and that God will open the door.\" Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Opposition to the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the southern border grows. There was a protest Sunday at a facility near El Paso, Texas, where some migrant boys are held.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We begin about 40 miles outside El Paso, Texas, where the federal government is holding around 100 detained migrant boys in a desert tent encampment. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah, some of the boys were detained after they arrived alone at the southern border. Others were separated from their families after they were taken into custody. These boys represent just a small fraction of the more than 10,000 immigrant children and adolescents who are held by the U.S. government. That number has dramatically expanded under President Trump because of his administration's policy to separate families and a similar policy - related policy having to do with aggressive criminal prosecution of border crossers. INSKEEP: John Sepulvado of our member station KQED was at a Father's Day protest outside this facility that's outside El Paso. Hey there, John. JOHN SEPULVADO, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So from what you were allowed to see, what is this facility like? SEPULVADO: So there is a very long singular white tent that's industrial-grade that just kind of rises up to the middle of the desert. And you can see it from about 200 yards away or so. And it is - essentially it looks like something you would see after a hurricane or other type of natural disaster. Or if you've ever watched, like, \"Contagion\" or some type of sci-fi thriller movie that - where... INSKEEP: OK, emergency facility, got it. SEPULVADO: Exactly. Exactly. And it's run by the same people who would do that as far as the contract. And on the American side, it's behind two double-barreled fences. It's behind two double-barreled fences, and it's behind a mound of dirt. So you basically - you can't see anything. Now, on the Mexican side it is completely open. And I've been told that that was done on purpose. They don't want people from the American side to be able to see in. They do want people - because this is right against the border on the Mexican side - to be able to see in because this tent is essentially a deterrent letting people know that this is a place they can end up if they illegally cross into the United States. INSKEEP: Your kids will end up behind barbed wire in this tent, in effect. And just to be clear, these are people - at least some of them - who were separated from their parents, right? SEPULVADO: Yeah. We've confirmed that - KQED confirmed that these were not unaccompanied minors, as Health and Human Services, which says - which is running the camp says it was. These are folks who have been separated by federal authorities. INSKEEP: OK, so there was a protest there. I want to note that. People marched on Sunday. You saw that. It was led by a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, Beto O'Rourke. And he had some information about this facility. What's he saying? SEPULVADO: Well, he confirmed our reporting. So we had heard from several sources that there was up to 4,000 people, 4,000 - I shouldn't say people - teenagers who are going to be brought to this facility. The congressman confirmed that. He confirmed the unaccompanied minors detail. And he confirmed that much of this has not been done with any community input. In fact, there's a lot of secrecy behind this, just as there's that dirt berm I was telling you about, Steve. Nobody's talking to the community about that. So there's a lot of concern about how many people would be there. This would essentially triple the town of Tornillo where it's located. INSKEEP: Oh, triple the population. John, thanks very much. SEPULVADO: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's John Sepulvado. Maybe nobody is talking there about the facility, but people are talking elsewhere in a big way. And NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow has been following the congressional response to the president's immigration action. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so we've heard Democrats are protesting. A Democratic congressman and Senate candidate is actually protesting at that tent in Texas. What about Republicans? DETROW: You know, this has been an interesting development here. We've heard increasingly blunt criticism from people who are usually either Trump allies or who do not weigh in on politics that much. Former first lady Laura Bush wrote an op-ed calling this policy immoral. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, probably the most high-profile American conservative voice in the Catholic Church, he said this is unjust, un-American and unbiblical. Even Franklin Graham, usually a pretty staunch ally of President Trump and other Republicans, has criticized this in blunt terms. The president has continued to insist that Democrats in Congress are to blame for this policy, but that is not true. This is a choice made by the Trump administration earlier this year to take this approach. INSKEEP: And we have noted that there is actually a wide range of evangelical groups, other religious groups - Timothy Dolan is by no means the only one who's spoken out about this. And lawmakers have said they're going to do something about it. But what is it they're going to do? DETROW: Yeah, this is going to be part of a big week where immigration had been already the focus on Capitol Hill this week. This puts even more pressure on House Republicans moving forward with two different bills. One is very conservative. The other is being framed as a compromise bill, but it's still a compromise on Republican terms. It's made to get moderate Republicans on board, not Democrats. It has a permanent path for people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a lot of border security. There is language to address this in the bill. But it does not keep children from being detained. Essentially what it does is says if parents are detained, as they have been, to be prosecuted... INSKEEP: Yeah. DETROW: ...That children would be allowed to be with them but still within ICE detention facilities. INSKEEP: So let's be really clear about this. This is a zero-tolerance policy, meaning that people are prosecuted, adults are prosecuted regardless of whether children would be harmed in the effect of the parents being held. They're not going to change that. But they've got this language that would say, you can - your kid can be clapped in jail with you or something to that effect in detention, in ICE detention. DETROW: Right. The parents and children would not be separated, but there would still be detention going on. MARTIN: You know, it's interesting. You talk about the number of people who are outside politics, but - Republicans who are speaking out on this. But there are some lawmakers, Republicans in Congress, allies of President Trump - Lindsey Graham for one speaking out, saying - making it clear that even though there might be these efforts in Congress, he says, quote, \"President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call.\" So even people in his own party clearly saying, listen, President Trump; if you don't want this to happen, you could stop it. DETROW: And there are several meetings in the next few days between President Trump and Republican lawmakers. This is certainly going to come up. INSKEEP: Is it clear to you, Scott, that this is being used as leverage by the president? The president is OK with this chaos because he wants it to be solved as part of a larger immigration bill that includes things he wants like funding for the wall. DETROW: Well, other members of the Trump administration are trying not to frame it that way. President Trump is repeatedly framing it exactly that way. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks very much. DETROW: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Scott Detrow. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, different story but the same topic in a way. Germany's government is in danger this week of being brought down over immigration. MARTIN: Right. This is the same issue that almost cost Angela Merkel her job, the chancellorship, during last fall's elections. The political fight in the moment centers on whether or not Germany should close its borders. This could lead to a breakup of Merkel's conservative alliance, the first since 1976, and leave her without a majority in Parliament. INSKEEP: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin and covering this story. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So how much trouble is she in, Merkel? NELSON: This is pretty much up there. I mean, we have to remember that she has faced a number of crises over her policies. But this time it's very serious because we're talking about members within her own conservative alliance who are talking about breaking up, splitting up if you will, and - which would in effect - or which would probably lead to the government collapsing pretty quickly. INSKEEP: Oh, because it was already a rather weak coalition. And let's remember the dynamics here. There was a very right-wing party that gained a lot in the recent elections. There's a fairly right-wing party - correct? - that is with Merkel. But they don't want to be outflanked, so they're trying to be really tough on immigrants. NELSON: Yes. In fact, these Bavarian conservatives who are a little - I mean, they share a lot of conservative policies, but - except in the social area. But they've become a lot more far-right because they are facing such strong opposition from Alternative for Germany, which is the far-right party that is now the main opposition in the German Parliament. They're running against them in local elections in Bavaria this fall. And they stand - they being Merkel's Christian conservative allies in Bavaria - stand to lose their absolute majority. So they've shifted quite a bit to the right and taken her on in her refugee policy. And now they basically are saying, forget the EU; forget whatever. We want to close the borders now to asylum-seekers whose fingerprints are in the database, who in other words have come in through other EU countries or who've been rejected for asylum. They should no longer be allowed to come into Germany. INSKEEP: Well, let's remember the broader background here. There was a time when Merkel was much more open and Germany was much more open to refugees from the Middle East, from North Africa and took in something - more than a million people. But there's been all of this political response and resistance. Has Merkel already changed her policies even if she manages to keep her job? NELSON: She has certainly changed position. She's not in that much disagreement with the CSU over what they want to do. She just wants the European Union to come on board and create a joint policy. She doesn't want to see what's happening in other countries where you have Hungary or Austria making their own decisions about what should happen with borders. She feels and a majority of Germans agree that there should be a European response, problem being of course that she hasn't been able to garner that cohesive European response. And that's not looking too likely either when the European Union meets at a summit in a couple weeks. INSKEEP: So how soon will she know if she keeps her job? NELSON: Well, I think at least a couple weeks. It seems like the conservatives in Bavaria are going to give her at least that long. INSKEEP: Soraya, thanks very much as always, pleasure talking with you. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin.

Ted Cruz on Oct. 22,. During the rally, he described himself as a \"nationalist,\" and encouraged his supporters to use the word. President Trump has a penchant for breathing new life into expressions with troubled pasts, like \"America first\" and \"enemy of the people.\" It's not likely his uses of those phrases will survive his presidency. But he may have altered the political lexicon more enduringly at a Houston rally two weeks before the elections, when he proclaimed himself a \"nationalist\" and urged his supporters to use the word. Given Trump's policies on immigration, trade and foreign relations, future historians may very well label him a nationalist, like a number of presidents before him. But no sitting president before now has ever described himself with that term. After he left office, Theodore Roosevelt did campaign briefly for strengthening the national government under what he called \"the New Nationalism,\" with an eight-hour workday, an inheritance tax and a ban on the sale of public lands. But over the following century, \"nationalism\" was indelibly tainted by the wars provoked by militant nationalist regimes in Europe and Asia. You can still use the word in a neutral way to refer to the aspirational nationalisms in the post-colonial world or secessionist movements in places like Catalonia and Scotland \u2014 peoples who are wishing for a nation, not exalting the one they already have. But when \"nationalism\" surfaces in developed states, it calls up images of militarism and xenophobia, jackboots and barbed wire, bombast and belligerence. It's all summed up by the disparaging adjective \"nationalistic,\" which is typically followed by words like \"propaganda\" and \"fanatic.\" The word's been rare in modern American politics. There were the black nationalists of the '60s and '70s, but theirs was an aspirational nationalism modeled on the wars of liberation in the developing world. The term \"white nationalism\" can sound aspirational, too \u2014 it conjures up separatist reveries of a nation reserved for persons of pallor. But it can slide into glorifying America itself as a white nation. The phrase has been simmering for decades on the fringes, but it's become ubiquitous in the last few years -- when you see a media story that mentions nationalism in America these days, odds are the word will be preceded by \"white.\" So it wasn't surprising a lot of people heard Trump's avowal of nationalism as a shoutout to the white nationalists in his base, including a number of the white nationalists themselves. David Duke tweeted that his nationalism and Trump's were fundamentally the same thing. Trump denied that he had any such connection in mind. When PBS's White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, who is African-American, asked him at his post-election press conference if his use of \"nationalism\" was emboldening white nationalists, he called the question itself racist. It's hard to know what Trump meant by that \u2014 maybe that Alcindor was one of those people who see race everywhere? But then to hear Trump tell it, nationalism is just an ardent kind of patriotism, and nothing anyone who loves their country should object to. As he explained to Fox News' Laura Ingraham, \"I'm proud of this country, and I call that nationalism. ... I don't see any other connotation than that.\" That's the kind of generic definition you get from a dictionary. It can be useful when you want to suppress the historical associations of a word \u2014 you pluck it out of its context and pretend not to notice the dirt that's clinging to its roots. 'Nationalism' seems just another of the words whose dark histories Trump has casually cast aside. Geoff Nunberg \"Nationalism\" seems just another of the words whose dark histories Trump has casually cast aside. He has to know by now that \"enemy of the people\" evokes an all-star lineup of murderous despots like Joseph Stalin \u2014 that connection's been mentioned more than a dozen times on Fox News alone. And he's aware that \"America First\" is steeped in anti-Semitism \u2014 when Pat Buchanan used that slogan in his 1999 presidential campaign, Trump described him as a \"Hitler lover\" who was appealing to the \"wacko vote.\" But Trump insists that he's using those phrases in a brand-new way. It may infuriate some of his critics, but presumably most of his supporters either don't know the words' history or don't care about it. Trump's aware of the connotations of \"nationalist,\" too, which is why he's made a point of noting that \"we're not supposed to use that word.\" But unlike those other expressions, \"nationalism\" is haunted by multiple specters, all of them very present to the public's mind. The word evokes echoes of white nationalism, which Trump's indignant denials don't manage to dispel. It evokes vivid memories of the genocidal wars caused by the strident nationalisms of the past. And it allies him with the anti-democratic and xenophobic regimes that have arisen in Russia, Hungary, Poland, Italy and now Brazil. At the ceremonies in Paris marking the centenary of the end of World War I, in Trump's presence, French President Emmanuel Macron said that nationalism was a betrayal of patriotism and warned that old demons were resurfacing, ready to wreak chaos and death. That's a lot of baggage for a word to bear, and it hasn't been lost on Trump's adversaries. Columnists and prominent Democrats have been throwing the word back at him. It's become a Twitter meme to describe the Republicans as the Nationalist Party, which is something we've never had before. If that catches on, Trump will have managed to make \"nationalist\" a key word in the American political vocabulary for the first time in history. That might or might not be to his advantage. But it's reason enough to make \"nationalist\" the word of the year.",

            "article_content": "Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian presidential candidate for the Social Liberal Party, has led the polls throughout the campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian presidential candidate for the Social Liberal Party, has led the polls throughout the campaign. For those who track the rise of extreme populist nationalism worldwide, this Sunday's election in Brazil represents an important test of how far to the right voters in Latin America's largest nation are prepared to turn. Amid a race widely regarded as the country's most divisive general election in decades, attention is focused on Jair Bolsonaro, a veteran congressman and retired army captain from the far right. Bolsonaro not only has led the polls throughout the campaign but has managed to expand his lead in the race's closing days. Corruption, rampant crime and a stagnant economy have corroded the public's faith in establishment politicians, leading many Brazilians to turn to Bolsonaro as their champion \u2014 viewing him as an outsider despite his more than 25 years in Congress. His rise is often compared to that of President Trump, whom he admires. To win outright on Sunday, Bolsonaro must secure more than 50 percent of the vote \u2014 a prospect considered unthinkable by Brazil's mainstream political observers only a few weeks ago but which some now believe conceivable, although unlikely. Otherwise the top two candidates proceed to a second round on Oct. 28. The possibility that Bolsonaro, 63, will emerge from these elections as president arouses anger and fear among his opponents, partly because of his record for misogynistic, racist and homophobic remarks, but also because of his close military ties and his admiration for Brazil's oppressive dictatorship between 1964 and 1985. Last Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians \u2014 many of them women \u2014 held demonstrations nationwide, convened by online women's movements whose hashtag \u2014 #EleNao, or Not Him \u2014 went viral. Vast crowds gathered in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, including many black, LGBT and indigenous Brazilians \u2014 all groups denigrated by Bolsonaro over the years. In Rio, the crowd included Fernanda Moreira, 34, a black woman who teaches young teenagers in one of the city's favelas \u2014 low-income neighborhoods blighted by violence between the police and criminal drug organizations. Moreira is especially concerned about Bolsonaro's hard-line views about curbing violent crime in Brazil, which last year saw nearly 64,000 homicides. He favors arming the public with guns and has heaped praise on the police's routine use of lethal force. Last year he remarked that \"a policeman who doesn't kill isn't a policeman.\" \"I look to the future, and it isn't good,\" Moreira remarked. \"When I look at Bolsonaro, and when I look at my students, I'm thinking: 'What will a man like him do to those children?' \" she added. The day after those mass demonstrations, the Bolsonaro campaign countered by holding major rallies of its own, including a procession of thousands of cars that jammed the streets of Bras\u00edlia, the country's capital. Many of his supporters wore the bright yellow shirt of Brazil's celebrated soccer team and flourished the national flag, shouting \"Yes! Him!\" The dueling protests underscored the deep divisions caused by these elections: Families, work colleagues and friends find themselves at opposite poles of a bruising political battle in which debate revolves around the future of democracy in Brazil. \"Families are divided. Old friends from school are not speaking,\" said Christian Dunker, a professor of psychology at S\u00e3o Paulo University. \"This is a kind of new phase in the conscious[ness] of the country, because our own image of being a kind of friendly people, being cordial to each other, [has] collapsed.\" The election is all the more unusual because its two chief adversaries have both been confined to quarters. Bolsonaro spent more than three weeks of the campaign in the hospital after being stabbed in the stomach at a September rally in the southeastern city of Juiz de Fora. His primary opponent, former two-term president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, is locked up in a prison cell, where he is serving 12 years for corruption. Polls have consistently showed Lula \u2014 as he is universally known \u2014 to be by far the most popular politician in Brazil, but on Aug. 31 an electoral court disqualified him from the race because of his criminal convictions. The man chosen as Lula's stand-in is Fernando Haddad, 55, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo. Haddad is an urbane political science professor with little of Lula's turbocharged charisma, and he has struggled to gain nationwide recognition: At first, some of the cadres from his leftist Workers' Party weren't even sure how to pronounce his name, which is of Lebanese origin. His campaign slogan, \"Haddad is Lula!\" is intended to appeal to working-class Brazilians who fondly remember Lula's government for introducing social programs that helped raise their living standards. Brazil's presidential candidate for the leftist Workers' Party, Fernando Haddad, waves during a campaign rally in Rio de Janeiro on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brazil's presidential candidate for the leftist Workers' Party, Fernando Haddad, waves during a campaign rally in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. Yet this also exposes Haddad to claims that he is Lula's \"puppet,\" a useful weapon in the hands of the Bolsonaro camp, which portrays the governments of Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff, as the free-spending authors in chief of Brazil's worst-ever recession and chief culprits in the massive Car Wash corruption kickbacks-for-contracts scandal. A survey by the polling company Ibope, taken Wednesday, showed Haddad with 23 percent, trailing Bolsonaro by 9 points. Of the 13 candidates in Brazil's presidential race, he is in second place and is widely expected to get through to the second round to face Bolsonaro in a showdown between the left and the far right. The same poll showed, in that final round, the two men are tied. If it plays out that way, the second round is sure to be a ferocious battle, much of it waged amid highly charged emotions and a tsunami of fake news. Bolsonaro enters the fight with some weighty supporters \u2014 from army generals to Brazil's highly influential evangelical and agricultural lobbies. His opponents are likely to continue to highlight his most controversial and offensive behavior, which includes telling a congresswoman in 2003: \"I would never rape you because you don't deserve it.\" Whether this works is a moot point. Bolsonaro is markedly less popular among women than men. Yet polls this week showed a significant rise in female support to around 26 percent \u2014 after the \"Not Him\" protests. Many Brazilians appear willing to accept Bolsonaro's claims that his comments were either taken out of context or are fake news and his insistence that he is on a mission to unify all Brazilians. Others view them as insignificant given the scale of the crisis facing Brazil. \"I believe he is a male chauvinist and homophobic, like other politicians,\" said Amanda Lemos, 21, a psychology student from Rio, during a recent pro-Bolsonaro rally on Copacabana Beach. \"But he's the only candidate who seems to have a strong plan to begin to lead Brazil out of chaos.\" No one in Brazil seems to dispute that this election is a defining moment for the country amid an uncertain time. The issue of who will be president will soon be settled. But, says Dunker, the psychoanalyst, the painful divisions that this process has exposed within Brazilian society will continue, whatever the outcome. \"I am afraid we will never recover,\" he says.",

On Sunday, the once-derided party claimed 12 seats Andalusia's regional elections. Updated at 7 a.m. ET Spain's right-wing anti-Muslim party claimed a dozen seats in one of the country's regional parliaments in elections Sunday \u2014 outpacing expectations in what is being described as a major blow to the new socialist prime minister. The surprising gains for the Vox Party mark the latest in a wave of right-wing sentiment that has swept across Europe in recent months. Political polls had predicted Vox might win as many as five seats in the southern region of Andalusia. However, as of Sunday night, with 99 percent of votes counted, the once-derided party had snagged more than twice that number \u2014 12 seats in the 109-member parliament, The Associated Press reported. \"Now is the moment to say loud and clear who we are and that we have come to stay,\" Vox candidate Francisco Serrano told a crowd of supporters who chanted \"Spain! Spain! Spain!\" Spain, Andalusia regional elections (99% counted)PSOE-S&D: 28.0% (-7.4)PP-EPP: 20.8% (-5.9)Cs-ALDE: 18.3% (+9)AA-LEFT: 16.2% (-5.6)VOX-ECR/ENF: 11% (+10.5)PACMA-LEFT: 1.9% (+1.1)AxSi-*: 0.6% (+0.6)More: https://t.co/qKfblsdXF8#EleccionesAndaluc\u00eda #AndaluciaL6 #Spain pic.twitter.com/cc3ihsUA9E \"We put on the table the need to control our borders and end illegal immigration, end abusive levels of taxation and the need to put an end to ideological laws relating to gender,\" said the party's secretary general, Javier Ortega, according to The Telegraph. The party opposes Catalan independence and abortion. It favors harsher penalties for ETA, the violent Basque separatist movement, rolling back domestic violence laws, reducing or eliminating taxes and more centralized power. Critics call it a throwback to values espoused by the country's former dictator, Francisco Franco. Spain's southern coast is where many Arab and African migrants land when they journey by boat across the Mediterranean to Europe. As NPR reported in September, \"Spain is now receiving twice as many migrants as Greece and six times as many as Italy.\" The region \u2014 the most populous of the country \u2014 also has high unemployment rates. The emergence of Vox means the PSOE Socialist Party has lost its grip on power throughout Andalusia, where it had dominated since 1982. And it could mean the party might lose its grip at the national level as well. Although Socialists took a majority of seats in Sunday's election, overall support for the party plummeted to 33 seats from 47 \u2014 falling far short of the 55 seats needed to take control of the chamber. As a result, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government remains extremely vulnerable even if it aligns itself with the left's Forward Andalusia, which picked up only 17 seats and includes Podemos. Meanwhile, Vox could help establish a majority conservative coalition with the Popular Party (PP), which also lost ground in the election, and the center-right Citizens (Ciudadanos), which gained seats on Sunday. \"Despite winning the election it is a sad night for the Socialist Party,\" Socialist regional leader Susana Diaz said. \"There has been a real loss of ground for the Left. But the worst thing is that the extreme right, a phenomenon that has appeared in the rest of Europe, has arrived here.\" \"Each party must decide if they are against the extreme right or if they will rely on their support to enter into government. I call on all the other political parties who consider themselves defenders of our democratic constitution to break the extreme right,\" she said. As NPR's Lauren Frayer reported, Vox was on the fringes for most Spaniards since it was founded four years ago. And, as recently as March 2017, Spanish social scientists argued that the nativist party was unlikely to gain a foothold in the country, even as similar political movements had taken root across much of the continent. The BBC reports nationalist movements \u2014 fueled by anger toward political elites and mistrust of immigration \u2014 make up more than 20 percent of the electorate in Denmark, Switzerland and Austria. Hungary, Finland, Sweden and Italy are not far behind. Meanwhile, an increasing number of voters in France, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Cyprus are also embracing populist candidates and ideologies.",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Well, like the 2016 elections, last night's midterm results have again exposed divides in American society. For example, in suburban House races across the country, voters rejected the Republican Party. But in Senate races in more conservative states, it was the Republican Party that prevailed. Well, to probe these divides and what they mean, we have invited NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving to stop by the studio. Hi, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Hello, Mary Louise. KELLY: I've got to say, you look remarkably well-rested for a guy who was up till 3 a.m... (LAUGHTER) KELLY: ...Probing the polls and results. Congratulations. ELVING: It's an illusion. KELLY: Speaking of illusions, we are used to looking at election results on these maps, you know, the big red and blue illuminated across the country. But you've got a theory, I gather, that these color divisions are not quite what they seem. Explain. ELVING: Not because they are whole states, great big boxes of red or blue as though everyone in that state thought the same way. It would make more sense if we're going to do this kind of mapping to get a little more granule and look at metropolitan areas, the urban inner city and the suburban populations together and contrast that to the outer rims of the exurbs and to the rural and small-town parts of each state. That's really where the red-blue divide is more visible. If you will, it's the 21st-century update of the classic urban versus rural divide that's been part of our national life since the very beginning. KELLY: All right, so keep the map metaphor going. I mean, if we're not a divided red-and-blue country in quite the same way that that map would seem to indicate, where are the fault lines? ELVING: It's not so much even the traditional partisanship of Republicans and Democrats, although that's where our red-and-blue scheme comes from. It's not even a simple pro-Trump and anti-Trump divide. It's more complicated polarization. Some are calling it tribalism. We're organized now by some old categories of political loyalty and by geography conflict that I've mentioned but also by all of our contemporary issues of identity. KELLY: Sure, race, whether you're an immigrant, whether you are - what age you are, whether you're LGBTQ - all of these things. ELVING: That's right. Race is as important as ever. Gender is more of a divide than ever in our voting. We have income inequality, educational inequality, opportunity inequality. All of these elements of our identities as groups and as individuals add up to what some people call diversity. And the pushback to valuing diversity is sometimes summed up in the word nationalism. KELLY: You're making me think of this moment in the press conference that the president just held today, actually. There was this flashpoint. He was asked a question by a reporter for PBS, Yamiche Alcindor. I can actually play you a little bit of that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YAMICHE ALCINDOR: On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying that the... PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question. ALCINDOR: There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric. TRUMP: Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that. ALCINDOR: What do you make of that? TRUMP: I don't believe that. I just - well, I don't know. Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African-Americans? KELLY: Ron, what did you make of that as you were listening? ELVING: Good question by the president there. The president took the question as an accusation, as though he had been called a racist and threw it back at the reporter, saying it had to be a racist question to even raise this question. And, of course, throughout his campaign in a number of the states that tilted slightly to the Republicans in statewide races in places he had won in 2016, he had some success bringing out his characteristic rallies and really stoking the crowd with a number of dog whistles - if you want to call them that or even car horns if you want to call them that - that many people regarded as emphasizing his opposition to the diversity issues I was just mentioning. KELLY: I mean, the question this leaves me with is there's tribalism, there are divides no question, but what does all that mean when it comes to governing, particularly now that we're in a Washington which is no longer under the control of a single party? ELVING: Indeed. Those things can be a challenge to the kind of leaders who want to bridge them or, if you will, compose them. And they can also be an opportunity for political figures who see them as a means to power. KELLY: Ron Elving, NPR senior editor and correspondent, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Mary Louise.

We are about to have a national conversation about the word nationalist. A word in more or less everyone's vocabulary has suddenly become a flashpoint because, well, because it was claimed by President Trump during a stump speech in Texas on Monday.  That alone means people are likely to argue about it. But the president said Tuesday he was a \"proud\" nationalist, and he used it to contrast himself with previous presidents who negotiated trade deals, arms agreements and immigration laws \u2014 all of which involve the interests of other nations in addition to our own. Trump has made it his business to repudiate all of the above.  He often recounts how he has complimented leaders of Japan and China and other world powers on their pursuit of their national interest.  We should be more assertive about serving our own, he says. \"I love our country,\" he said, explaining his remarks Monday night in Houston, \"and our country has taken second fiddle.\" Other countries, rich as well as poor, are taking advantage of the U.S., Trump said. They got the better of trade and paid less for the common defense, he said. \"All I want is for our country is to be treated well, to be treated with respect, so in that sense I'm absolutely a nationalist, and I'm proud of it,\" Trump said. There is nothing new in any of this. \"America First\" has been a Trump mantra for years.  The suggestion that the U.S. has been fleeced by foreign partners and competitors alike has been central to his appeal to all those who find talk of \"globalism\" unsettling or even threatening. But there is something here to be discussed, because Trump is highlighting this word at this moment, with the midterm elections less than two weeks away.  And he is spotlighting the word as he presses for his wall on the southern border and provokes fears of foreign invasion by villainizing the caravan of migrants making its way across Mexico. In one sense, it shouldn't be controversial for a president to call himself a nationalist. The leader of the nation would more or less be expected to believe in its identity, its values and its inherent worth. The word has plenty of seemingly neutral uses. Baseball has a National League.  The major leagues of football, basketball and hockey have the word in their names. We go to national parks. There used to be something called National Public Radio, now known simply as NPR. But the word nationalist has connotations other than simply embracing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It has too often been associated with far more divisive attitudes. Trump was asked in the Oval Office on Tuesday about the meaning of white nationalism. He claimed never to have heard of that usage. Apparently, no one asked if he had heard of black nationalism, which has also been a thing. White nationalism is generally regarded as the attitude that only Caucasians should be considered part of the American nation, that the racial and even ethnic roots of the Colonial settlers and 19th-century immigrants define the proper meaning of the nation. That idea has long been part of the American mix, personified by the Ku Klux Klan and American Nazis but also embraced by other groups both organized and unorganized. Certainly in many other countries, nationalism is closely associated with one language, one culture, even one ethnic group or one religion. That simply has not been the American story. Even in the early 1600s, the people within the Colonial borders were multiracial, with hundreds of thousands of Africans among the earliest to cross the Atlantic \u2014 nearly all of them as slaves. So using the word nationalist can be taken to refer to the distinctly American idea of a melting pot of races, ethnicities and faiths. But to some, it is too close to the more racist or ethnocentric usage to be comfortable. Much depends on how a particular speaker uses the word. Is it meant to express inclusion or to imply the opposite? Supporters cheer as President Trump takes the stage for a rally in support of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday in Houston.\n                \n                    \n                    Loren Elliott/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters cheer as President Trump takes the stage for a rally in support of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday in Houston. Scholars have tried to trace the roots of nationalism as a word and found it in printed form as far back as 1798. For generations the word was used interchangeably with patriotism, which is to value and love one's country and feel loyalty to it. But patriotism, at least in the dictionary, does not imply a belief that one's own country is superior to others. Those who believe in their country's superiority are sometimes called chauvinists, a name that may have originated with the story of a French soldier named Chauvin who was so blindly loyal to Napoleon that he went on defending \"The Emperor\" long after his downfall. The word in our time is more often used to refer to attitudes of gender superiority among men (\"male chauvinism\"). And then there are those who carry their nationalism a step further, believing that their country's superiority implies a need to impose their national will on others through military coercion. A popular term for that is jingoism, derived from a British music hall song in the 1870s. The lyrics said the Brits didn't want to fight anybody (the Turks at the time) but if they had to \"by jingo we will.\" The word jingo was perhaps a mild form of an oath, the equivalent of the way Americans say \"jeez.\" Thereafter, the word was often used to refer to overeager militarists and the \"ism\" followed after that. Jingoism has had periodic revivals in American usage during debates over military action, as in the Cold War era and more recently in the war on terrorism and the incursions into Iraq and Afghanistan. In any event, these more derogatory ways of describing extreme nationalism have served to keep ordinary nationalism relatively benign \u2014 at least in general use. All kinds of people can say they are nationalists, that they value the U.S. (or their own home country) and wish to promote its success in the world. However, when the word is attached to other attitudes, impugning the motives of other countries by contrast or proclaiming a sense of victimhood, then nationalism raises warning flags. It becomes an attitudinal pretext for a more aggressive foreign policy. Or, at least, that has been the experience of Europe and Asia, where wars have pitted one nation against another since nation-states first emerged. How much of this might have been on the president's mind Monday and Tuesday is unclear. But he surely understands how associating himself with national pride and the defense of American interests has appeal for voters. And the president probably knows the inevitable blowback from his detractors is only likely to heighten that appeal.",

As the son of a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Derek Black was once the heir apparent of the white nationalist movement. Growing up, he made speeches, hosted a radio show and started the website KidsStormfront \u2014 which acted as a companion to Stormfront, the white nationalist website his father, Don Black, created. \"The fundamental belief that drove my dad, drove my parents and my family, over decades, was that race was the defining feature of humanity ... and that people were only happy if they could live in a society that was only this one biologically defined racial group,\" Black says. It was only after he began attending New College of Florida that Black began to question his own point of view. Previously, he had been home-schooled, but suddenly he was was exposed to people who didn't share his views, including a few Jewish students who became friends. Black's new friends invited him over for Shabbat dinner week after week. Gradually, he began to rethink his views. After much soul-searching, a 22-year-old Black wrote an article, published by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2013, renouncing white nationalism. Derek Black's \"awakening\" is the subject of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Eli Saslow's new book, Rising Out Of Hatred. Saslow also interviewed Black's father and other leaders in the white nationalist movement. The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist by Eli Saslow Hardcover, 288 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On the \"rebranding\" of white supremacy, led in part by Derek's father, Don Black Derek Black: My dad popularized the term \"white nationalism\" ... when he founded Stormfront and called it a white nationalist community, and he saw the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy as being one that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else \u2014 he just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces, and that that was not about superiority, it was just about the well-being of everybody. ... Looking back on it, that is totally irrational. How exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy? Eli Saslow: They believed America was founded as a white supremacist country. ... Their job was just to give people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit, proud, confident way. ... White nationalism, I think, effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing an end cause of separating races into different homelands. White supremacy, unfortunately, is something that's much more endemic, and much more structured into what the country is. On Black's usage of white nationalist talking points in a campaign for the West Palm Beach County Republican Committee Black: I knew from the time that I was a child that white nationalism, as long as it was not necessarily calling itself white nationalism, could win campaigns. So I did things like run little Republican county elections [to] demonstrate that I could win with the majority of the vote [using] white nationalist talking points in a very normal South Florida neighborhood. I ran training sessions on how people could hone their message to try to get that audience, not freak people out and just tap into things like, \"Don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway are making everything worse? And don't you think political correctness is just not letting you talk about things that are real?\" And getting people to agree on that would be the way forward. On how President Obama's election motivated white nationalists Saslow: I think a lot of white nationalists saw President Obama's election as a huge opportunity for their movement. Because what white nationalists have done, with dangerous effect, is play to this factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists, unfortunately, in large parts of white America. Polls consistently show that 30 to 40 percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than Jews, which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have. ... By feeding that sense of grievance and by playing to these ideas of your country is being taken away, [that] things are changing ... it's what got Derek elected [he was unable to serve in office], and it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well. On the responsibility Black feels for racially motivated violence that was inspired by the white nationalist beliefs he once espoused I said things that tried to energize racist ideas and get people to be more explicit about it. And then people who listened to that and who believed it, some of them committed horrible, violent acts. ... That is a moral weight that is very difficult to reconcile. Derek Black Black: I spent so many years rationalizing that that was not us. We were not responsible for that. We were not advocating violence, so therefore when people committed violent acts who had all the same beliefs as us, that that was not us. That was the media portraying us in a way that attracted psychopaths, and that we were somehow not responsible for that because it was not clear how to tangibly connect what I was saying and what I was promoting to the actions that those people took. And now I look back on it and I said things that tried to energize racist ideas and get people to be more explicit about it. And then people who listened to that and who believed it, some of them committed horrible, violent acts. And what is my culpability and responsibility for how these things went out into the world and they continue to bounce around in the world, and I can't take them back? That is a moral weight that is very difficult to reconcile. On how the actions of various students Black met at college helped him move away from his white nationalist beliefs Saslow: In addition to being the story of Derek's transformation, the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect profound change. And they did that in a lot of different ways. There was civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the school shutdown, and shut down the school, and sort of cast Derek out, and made it clear to him how awful, and how hateful, and how hurtful this ideology was. And it was also students like Allison, eventually his girlfriend, who won his trust, built a relationship, but [who] also armored herself with the facts, and sort of like point by point went through and showed how this ideology is built on total misinformation. And then there were also [Jewish] students like Matthew [Stevenson] and Moshe [Ash] who, in a remarkable act, invited Derek over week after week after week, not to build the case against him but to build their relationship, hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing past the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity. ... I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly, and that they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derek had said.

Updated at 12:05 p.m. ET. Former President Barack Obama celebrated Nelson Mandela's life and legacy in South Africa on Tuesday with a speech that focused not only on the freedom Mandela came to symbolize, but the long walk it took to get there. \"We have to follow Madiba's example of persistence and hope,\" Obama said, using Mandela's clan name. \"It's tempting right now to give in to cynicism. To believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back. That the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the '90s, now you're hearing people talk about the end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strong man. We have to resist that cynicism, because we've been through darker times.\" It was one of Obama's most high-profile appearances since leaving the White House 18 months ago and a preview of what could be an active campaign schedule for the former president before the midterm elections this fall. Obama spoke to a crowd of about 15,000 in a Johannesburg cricket stadium on the eve of what would have been Mandela's 100th birthday. He remarked on the progress that swept the globe during Mandela's lifetime \u2014 with greater prosperity and opportunity \u2014 but also that backlash that followed in recent years, in the wake of inequality and insecurity. \"A politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear and that kind of politics is now on the move,\" Obama said. \"It is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business.\" Obama argued that progressives need to push back against those trends by emphasizing more inclusive opportunity and international cooperation. \"We have a better story to tell,\" he said. \"But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear.\" Obama has generally kept a low profile since leaving office and has avoided criticizing his successor directly. But on rare occasions, the former president has spoken up in defense of inclusive democratic values. Last year, Obama told a large crowd near the Brandenburg Gate in Germany that in a modern, interconnected world, \"We can't isolate ourselves. We can't hide behind a wall.\" It was an implicit rebuke of President Trump's \"America First\" policies, delivered at a moment when Trump was scolding NATO allies for what he saw as inadequate defense spending \u2014 something Trump did again last week. Obama also defended the global economic order, saying it had delivered unparalleled peace and prosperity. But he acknowledged that order was under attack. \"It has to be continually renewed, because there is a competing narrative of fear and xenophobia and nationalism and intolerance,\" Obama said. \"We have to push back against those trends.\" Last week, Trump told reporters in the U.K. that immigration is changing the culture of Europe in a negative way. \"I know it's politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I'll say it and I'll say it loud,\" Trump said. Obama's critiques of Trump and his party are likely to grow more frequent this fall, when the former president is expected to campaign actively for Democratic House and Senate candidates. When he traveled as president, Obama often made it a point to meet with young people who might form the next generation of leaders, and he'll do so again this week in South Africa. He's hosting a town hall in Johannesburg on Wednesday for 200 rising African leaders. But Obama is also looking beyond the United States and the next election. \"Mandela said, 'Young people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,\" Obama recalled. \"Now's a good time to be aroused.\"",

He's an admirer of Donald Trump, and his rise to power has created \u2014 and reflected \u2014 deep divisions among Brazilians.\n                \n                    \n                    Buda Mendes/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On New Year's Day, Jair Bolsonaro will be sworn in as president of Brazil. He's an admirer of Donald Trump, and his rise to power has created \u2014 and reflected \u2014 deep divisions among Brazilians. The global advance of populist nationalism will reach another milestone on New Year's Day, when Jair Bolsonaro is sworn in as president of Latin America's largest nation, Brazil. Officials predict that up to 500,000 people will flood the streets of the capital, Bras\u00edlia, to celebrate his inauguration, which will take place inside the chamber of the national Congress. Bolsonaro's ascent to power is a pivotal moment in South America. It marks another reversal of the \"pink tide\" that swept leftist leaders into office across much of the map in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and a major tilt toward Washington in a region that often views the U.S. with suspicion: Bolsonaro is an avid admirer of Donald Trump. A retired army captain and veteran congressman from the far right, Bolsonaro assumes office after winning an election runoff in October with a margin of about 10 million votes over his rival from the leftist Workers' Party. He did so despite spending most of his campaign in the hospital, after being stabbed at a campaign rally in September. His huge victory delivered a humiliating riposte to political pundits who, for much of his campaign, portrayed Bolsonaro as a showboating maverick who was about as likely to become president as he was to play in Brazil's star-studded soccer team. Bolsonaro, 63, takes charge amid a wave of optimism about his presidency among Brazilians who yearn for a solution to the country's chronic epidemic of crime and corruption. They warm to his promise of restoring traditional Christian family values and are profoundly disillusioned by the leftist politicians who have governed Brazil in recent years. The public's hopes appear to have been lifted by the appointment of Judge S\u00e9rgio Moro as justice minister. He is a celebrated anticorruption campaigner who spearheaded the \"Car Wash\" investigation that unearthed massive graft in the highest levels of Brazil's government and industry. Judge S\u00e9rgio Moro, appointed by Bolsonaro as justice minister, speaks to journalists at the transitional government's headquarters in Bras\u00edlia in December.\n                \n                    \n                    Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Judge S\u00e9rgio Moro, appointed by Bolsonaro as justice minister, speaks to journalists at the transitional government's headquarters in Bras\u00edlia in December. That multi-pronged inquiry led to the jailing of some of Brazil's most powerful executives and politicians, including Bolsonaro's main rival, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a two-term former president and leftist who sees Moro's appointment to government as evidence of a plot to bar him from a third term. A recent survey by Ibope found that Bolsonaro's popularity ratings have reached 75 percent in the run-up to his inauguration. A separate survey, by Datafolha, found nearly two-thirds believe that, in the coming months, his government will revive Brazil's economy, which continues to struggle to recover from the country's worst-ever recession. Yet many Brazilians view Bolsonaro as a profoundly divisive figure, citing his history of offensive comments about women, black people and the LGBTQ community. These remarks include telling a congresswoman that she did not deserve to be raped by him, and stating that he would rather have a dead son than a gay son. Bolsonaro insists he is not against homosexuality but opposes the dissemination of \"gender ideology,\" a view he shares with the Evangelical movement that forms a key pillar of his support. In particular, he accuses past leftist governments of \"promoting homosexuality\" in schools in its efforts to educate children about gender diversity. Many LGBTQ Brazilians view his government as a potential threat to their rights, and fear Bolsonaro will restrict same-sex marriage, which was legalized in 2013. In recent weeks, these concerns have produced a surge in same-sex weddings, as couples race into wedlock before Bolsonaro takes power. In November, there were 986 \u2014 a rise of nearly 66 per cent over the same period last year, according to government figures. \"We're worried about marriage, because this is a right that we spent a lot of time [fighting] to get, and it is important to keep it,\" said Sheylli Caleffe, who helped organize a mass wedding ceremony in S\u00e3o Paulo on Dec. 15, in which 38 LGBTQ couples took part.

After Bolsonaro's election in October, hundreds of same-sex couples began to marry, fearing that their right to do so will be curtailed by the new administration. That event was organized by Casa 1, a group that runs a shelter for abuse victims in the city. Using crowdfunding, it covered the legal costs of the marriages at a registrar's office and also the ceremony, which was largely a symbolic political gesture. \"We are going to marry today because we want security,\" said Lucas Nascimento, a 22-year-old blogger, as he nervously prepared with his partner, Felipe Lima, 22. \"We don't know what's going to happen.\" Couples applied online to be included in the ceremony. \"When we received Casa Um's email saying we were one of the selected couples, this was a huge joy,\" said Fernanda Spinelli, 25, a telemarketer who was clad for the occasion in a flowing white wedding dress. \"After Bolsonaro's victory, we felt really threatened.\" In the two months since the election, Bolsonaro's critics have watched closely as he and his transition team gradually assembled his cabinet. The final line-up comprises 22 ministers, of whom only two are women. The inclusion of seven retired military commanders underscores the remarkably close relationship between Brazil's new government and its armed forces. Particular criticism has been leveled at Bolsonaro's choice of foreign minister. Ernesto Ara\u00fajo is a 51-year-old middle-ranking career diplomat who has described climate change as a conspiracy by \"cultural Marxism.\" His appointment alarms environmentalists who already consider Bolsonaro a threat to the Amazon rain forest because of his desire to loosen environmental regulations and his close ties with Brazil's influential agri-business lobby. For the first time since Brazil became a federal republic in 1889, its government will have no minister from the country's north or northeast, traditionally a stronghold of the left. The northeast includes the predominantly black city of Salvador. Interviews with residents there point to a deep wariness about Bolsonaro \u2014 especially his hard-line policies on law and order, which include allowing Brazil's public far wider access to firearms and giving the police even more scope for the use of lethal force against suspects. On Oct. 7, the city was badly shaken when a widely celebrated Afro-Brazilian musician and master of capoeira \u2014 a martial art that fuses ritual combat with music and dance \u2014 was stabbed to death by a supporter of Bolsonaro after an argument in a bar. For many in the northeast, the killing of Mestre Moa do Katend\u00ea, 63 \u2014 `whose real name was Romualdo Rosario da Costa \u2014 has come to symbolize the deep divisions within Brazil opened up by Bolsonaro's rise, and stoked by a toxic election campaign fought on social media platforms amid a flood of fake news. Renilda da Costa, 41, a niece of Moa, says she is \"very worried\" about what the future might hold. \"I never saw an election that was so violent, so offensive and so disrespectful,\" she says. Da Costa predicts \"more political division.\" Since the murder, Bolsonaro has repeatedly called for unity among Brazilians, although it's unclear how this firebrand politician hopes to achieve it: Despite more than a quarter-century in Brazil's Congress, Bolsonaro is still largely defined by his words rather than deeds. Questions remain about the impact his policies will have on his country's international relations. Will Bolsonaro go ahead with a threat to pull out of the Paris climate agreement? (He said in October he wouldn't, but a month later, Brazil withdrew from a commitment to host next year's U.N. climate conference.) How will he handle China, Brazil's No. 1 export market, which he's accused of \"buying\" the country? Will Bolsonaro fulfill his pledge to follow Trump's lead and move the Brazilian embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 even if it means damaging Brazil's multibillion-dollar meat industry by losing sales to Islamic nations? And what does his rise to power mean for regional efforts to secure regime change in Venezuela, which Bolsonaro views with much the same hostility as Trump? As for Brazil's 209 million people, they're watching to see if this retired army captain, who has no executive experience, can somehow bring peace and prosperity to their troubled landscape.",

In person, Jawar Mohammed is quieter, smaller than the big persona he has built online. To see him, you arrive at what looks like an old embassy residence in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. It's hulking and white, multiple stories, surrounded by tall walls. You're frisked by plainclothes security officials and then guided through a series of empty rooms, one covered in Oriental rugs. Finally, you reach his small office, where he is sipping tea, monitoring his phones and keeping up with the latest political action on his laptop. At 32, with a mischievous smile and a round, boyish face, he keeps the air of a startup CEO, but Jawar is without a doubt the most controversial man in Ethiopia. The previous government branded him a terrorist, because from exile in the U.S., he created a media network and used it to bludgeon that government \u2014 one of the most brutal regimes on the African continent. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling party, was armed to the teeth and controlled the executive branch, Parliament and judiciary for almost three decades. An airtight intelligence operation meant there was little they didn't know, so any potential dissent was dealt with swiftly and violently. There is no comprehensive count, but human rights groups have for years decried vast abuses by the government.

Anti-government protests by young Oromo men began in 2015 and helped spur political change. \"This was one of the most powerful regimes in Africa,\" Jawar tells NPR. \"Supported by the West and China, Russia, together. Even a liberal like [Barack] Obama, who is committed to human rights and democracy, looked at them and said there is no way these guys are going to go.\" During a 2015 visit, and much to the dismay of Ethiopian civil society groups, President Obama was accommodating of the regime, even calling it \"democratically elected.\" But the regime had one big weakness: In a diverse country, it was mostly led by Tigrayans, a minority ethnic group that makes up less than 10 percent of the country's population. The Oromo \u2014 the largest ethnic group, representing more than a third of the population \u2014 had mostly been left out. \"[The Oromos] have been economically and politically, culturally marginalized for a long time, because the Oromos were always a threat to whoever was in power,\" Jawar says. \"And to prevent Oromos from coming to power, to disempower them ... ridiculing them was very important, demoralizing them was very important.\" Jawar, an Oromo, saw his opportunity. On his network, broadcasting from Minnesota to Ethiopia via satellite and social media, he decried injustice. He highlighted Oromo history and encouraged young Oromos to be proud of their culture. \"I called it the project of building collective self-esteem,\" he says. The qeerroo protests Confidence in their numbers \u2014 and in who they were \u2014 pushed protesters to the streets to demand better governance and equal representation from a minority-led government. And it worked. Beginning in the fall of 2015, thousands of protesters \u2014 mostly young bachelors known as qeerroos in the Oromo language \u2014 organized boycotts and set up roadblocks, paralyzing commerce. Ethiopia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world \u2014 its GDP expanding at breakneck pace \u2014 but the instability led to a 20 percent decrease in foreign direct investment. For a regime whose main promise was development, this was devastating. Eventually, the Amhara, the second-biggest ethnic group in the country, joined the protests. The government crumbled with the resignation in February of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.

In August, Jawar returned to Ethiopia as a hero. He had last been there in 2008. The government of new reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, an Oromo from the ruling coalition, dropped all terrorism charges against him, and Jawar transformed from an outside agitator, an activist, to a political figure with huge influence over the new government. Thousands of people lined the streets, celebrating his return. But across the country, perhaps emboldened by their unlikely victory, young Oromos clashed violently with members of other ethnic groups, and the violence displaced hundreds of thousands of people. On Twitter and in newspapers, critics wondered if the ethnically driven politics that helped push political change had become toxic \u2014 threatening to rip the country apart along ethnic lines. Jawar brushes off those kinds of concerns, dismissing them as political barbs with no basis in reality. \"When you do things the way I do, you create a lot of losers,\" he says. \"Of course you are going to have a lot of enemies.\" \"We were struggling for the whole Ethiopia\" Driving from Addis Ababa to Shashamane, you notice a couple of things: the vast factories quickly industrializing Ethiopia and the hordes of young, unemployed men hanging out on street corners, waiting for someone to give them any job. Shashamane, a small town about a five-hour drive south of Addis Ababa, is in the heartland of the Oromia region and is one of the places where Jawar's theories about political activism came to life. \"You can call it the second Minnesota,\" Kemal Welyali says. At the peak of the protest movement, images from Shashamane played all over Jawar's Oromia Media Network, showing young men running, crossing their arms in protest, or desolate streets during the nationwide strike earlier this year \u2014 not a single business open, not one truck shuttling goods out to the capital. Ethiopian opposition leader Merera Gudina was freed from jail in January. In today's Ethiopia, he says, \"There are a lot of clashes of dreams.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Eyder Peralta/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ethiopian opposition leader Merera Gudina was freed from jail in January. In today's Ethiopia, he says, \"There are a lot of clashes of dreams.\" Kemal played a central organizing role. He took every opportunity to speak about corruption and minority rule, even at funerals and weddings. It was time, he preached, to stand up to a cruel government. He says he spoke mostly to the older folks, because he knew when the young people took to the streets, they would need their elders' support. Kemal stops his car in front of a strip mall. On the day Jawar came to Shashamane, in August, thousands showed up to welcome someone they viewed as their philosophical inspiration. But at some point, the crowd fixated on one man \u2014 a non-Oromo whom they accused of carrying a bomb. Kemal points at a lamppost in front of him: That's where the crowd hung the man by his feet and beat him to death. No bomb was ever found. \"We were not the ones who hung him,\" Kemal says, blaming another group for trying to spark a new conflict between young Oromos and police. Either way, as images of a mob of young men surrounding the man's limp body spread across Ethiopia, it sparked fears that the Oromos' uprising had empowered violent ethnic nationalism. In the capital, the word qeerroo makes people shudder now. They are radicals, they say. But Kemal says only people who don't know their movement brand them as radicals. Yes, he says, this movement emboldened Oromos and gave them pride, but that was part of a bigger plan. The point of this struggle, he says, was to first bring Oromos together to defeat the old regime and then bring along the rest of Ethiopia. \"Our struggle is to bring real democracy,\" he says. \"We weren't struggling for the Oromo tribe only. We were struggling for the whole Ethiopia.\" \"A vacuum in the middle\" Jawar left Ethiopia for a university in Singapore in 2003. Two years later, he moved to the United States; he studied political science at Stanford and received a master's in human rights studies at Columbia University. As a student in the U.S., he was thinking and writing about Oromos in Ethiopia. In the mid-2000s, he led protests outside the State Department to bring attention to what he said was the mistreatment of Oromos at the hands of the Ethiopian state. He settled in Minnesota, where his wife, also Ethiopian, was a student. Jawar was controversial among Ethiopians from the very beginning of his political activism. In 2009, he wrote an essay highly critical of the Oromo Liberation Front, then a separatist group that had struggled against Ethiopian regimes for decades. It was time to move on, he argued, because it was clear the OLF could no longer serve the aspirations of Oromos. Jawar says he spent time studying nonviolent protests of the U.S. and India, and he paid close attention to the Arab Spring movements. His big moment came about three years ago, when the Ethiopian government moved to expand the capital city, in essence taking more land from the people of Oromia. That sparked huge street protests. At the same time, Jawar launched his media network, which gave young protesters a voice. His Facebook page garnered more than 1.5 million followers and he plastered his feed \u2014 and his satellite channel \u2014 with graphic content showing clashes between protesters and police. Critics say he exaggerated what was happening in Ethiopia \u2014 that he inflated death tolls and even reported falsely that the Ethiopian government had used helicopter gunships to mow down Oromo worshippers during their most sacred holiday. During this period, he was deemed an enemy of the Ethiopian state and was no longer able to return home. His critics said he fanned the flames by framing a lot of this in ethnic terms \u2014 as a Tigrayan conspiracy against Oromos. But Jawar sees his role through a more academic lens. He says as this protest movement unfolded, he and other Oromo leaders did recognize the potential for radicalization \u2014 and that's why they pushed for democracy. More recent episodes of violence, he argues, don't stem from ethnic division. Instead, he says, this is what happens during political transitions. He's calm and unemotional when he talks about the violence across the country. \"When you move from dictatorship to democracy, people move from fearing the guns to respecting the law,\" he says. \"But there is a vacuum in the middle; there is a gap.\" The \"not negotiable\" demands As Kemal pulls out of the Shashamane strip mall, a heavy rain begins to fall. For years, Kemal was on the run. The previous government tracked his cellphones, so he switched SIM cards hundreds of times. He would stay in a town for a few days, talk to leaders about nonviolent protests and then move elsewhere. His family stayed in Shashamane, and he encouraged his 18-year-old son, Wetumusa Kemal, to go out into the streets. He motions to Wetumusa to show this reporter the consequences of that. Wetumusa rolls up his pant leg, revealing a scar from a bullet wound on his left knee. During the struggle, Wetumusa says, the military was everywhere. It surrounded schools and beat the students in classrooms. Sometimes soldiers would round them up during protests and send them to re-education camps. \"They told us to lie down, then they beat us with the sticks and they ran over us with their big shoes,\" he says. Even if you weren't protesting, he says, if the military determined you were young and Oromo, you would face a beating or imprisonment. Over the past few years, human rights groups estimate, more than 1,000 Ethiopians were killed by the state and tens of thousands were thrown into detention centers, where torture, as Wetumusa describes, was common. This, father and son both agree, was a painful struggle, but they have won. Their victory, they say, gives them a right to two other demands: that the capital should once again be administered by Oromia, and that the Oromo language should displace Amharic as the country's official language. Reminded that those two demands could prove highly combustible, Kemal responds without hesitating: \"They are not negotiable.\" \"Clashes of dreams\" The issue of Addis Ababa is not simple. It has long represented the clash between the Oromo majority and the ruling class, a point of contention since the late 1800s, when Emperor Menelik II \u2014 an Amhara \u2014 staked claim to what Oromos called Finfinne. Today, Addis Ababa is a cosmopolitan city, a federal cutout in the middle of Oromia that is home to all ethnic groups and a source of much government revenue. Jawar, though, seems unconcerned about the capital's future. Unlike Kemal, he leaves room for negotiation \u2014 the federal government and the city's multiethnic residents have rights that should be respected, he says \u2014 but to him, the big issue is already settled: The territory of Addis Ababa has to be returned to the Oromos. \"I don't see how that can be a radical proposition,\" he says, \"if there is almost 100 percent consensus among Oromos.\" Merera Gudina, an Oromo and once the country's most prominent opposition politician, was released from prison thanks in large part to unrelenting qeerroo protests. These unresolved issues are the biggest danger in Ethiopia, he warns. \"There are a lot of clashes of dreams,\" he says. If they can't be negotiated, he warns, the country will crumble. One minute, Jawar can be a hard-liner who dismisses any negotiation, and the next, a pragmatist who insists controversial issues can be resolved once the Ethiopian government becomes \"legitimate\" and people come to respect the law. In Ethiopia now, \"No one has legitimacy,\" he says. Not even Ahmed, the prime minister, who came to his position by a decision of the ruling party rather than by popular vote. The uprising, Jawar says, was never about creating an Oromo state, but it was certainly about Oromos asserting their rights. \"When I was in America, I was Oromo; I was African; I was American,\" he says. \"We shouldn't be forcing people to choose; we should create a condition of complementary identities.\" In his mind, free, fair and credible elections are the answer. \"Elections will enable us to have legitimate representatives of the various ethnic groups and a real ethnic bargain will begin,\" he says. \"There will be conflicts; there will tensions. There will be communal violence every now and then, but that violence can be contained because you will have legitimate representatives.\" And if the process is fair, he says, he is willing to accept whoever comes to power \u2014 Oromo or not. \"We fought for a democratic government,\" he says. \"Not for a popular government. We don't care who is going to rule this place, but that person has to have the consent our people expressed through the ballots.\"",

Anti-Semitism and hate crimes have surged in the U.S. over the past couple of years, and almost 30 percent of accounts repeatedly tweeting against Jews on Twitter appear to be bots, according to a recently released study from the Anti-Defamation League. Researchers at the ADL analyzed 7.5 million Twitter messages between Aug. 31 and Sept. 17. Billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, was a leading subject of anti-Semitic tweets, according to the researchers. The study reports that while human users still account for the majority of derogatory Twitter traffic in the lead-up to the midterm elections, \"political bots\u2014which explicitly focus on political communication online\u2014are playing a significant role in artificially amplifying derogatory content over Twitter about Jewish people.\" The individuals behind the automated bots remain a mystery. \"The facelessness of the people who are targeting the Jewish population is a major problem,\" said Sam Woolley, an author of the study and director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at the Institute for the Future. \"It's something that has to be addressed, because it makes it impossible to either stop or report.\" The ADL study was released a day before a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people. Katie Joseff, an author of the study and research manager at the Digital Intelligence Lab, says the ease of creating bot accounts means anyone could be behind them. \"It wouldn't be at all out of the realm of question for Nazis or anyone on the alt-right to be able to use bot accounts,\" Joseff said. \"They are very accessible, and people who just have normal social media followings, or even high schoolers, know how to buy fake accounts.\" Woolley says more work needs to go into finding who may be behind automated accounts tweeting anti-Semitic slurs. \"We've known in the past that Russia has used the fa\u00e7ade of things like white nationalism, or blue lives matter or Black Lives Matter, or other groups, in order to infiltrate groups,\" Woolley said. \"So one of the things that the companies and intelligence officials ... need to do is figure out whether or not the hate speech that is generated by these seeming white national accounts is actually being generated by foreign entities.\" Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, released a statement on the reported surge in anti-Semitic attacks via the social media platform: \"Since 2016, we've been learning and refining our approach to new threats and challenges. We've expanded our policies, built our internal tooling, and tightened our enforcement against coordinated platform manipulation, including bot networks \u2014 regardless of the origin. \"We've also shared all the content connected to potential state-backed operations on Twitter with researchers to help inform the public and to promote independent analysis. Our goal is to try and stay one step ahead in the face of new challenges going forward. Protecting the public conversation is our core mission.\" Woolley and Joseff say to combat disinformation and abuse by bots, tech companies should label bots as automated accounts and also improve the chain of command so when a user reports extreme trolling and online threats, the companies can respond quickly to protect the user. But the push for increased scale and revenue discourages social media platforms from combating automated bots, Woolley says. \"Companies are incentivized to actually continually grow their platforms, and to continually grow their user base. In fact their stocks are quite intimately tied to the amount of growth that the site experiences or the amount of shrinkage of the amount of monthly users,\" Woolley says. \"This is a real reason why we can't rely upon companies alone to mitigate the usage of things like bots. ... We have to have some kind of regulation from government. We have to have civil society action. We have to have individual user-based action.\" Automated accounts are a force multiplier and allow for users disseminating hate speech online to be \"small but mighty,\" but Woolley and Joseff say people attacking people online remains a tougher problem for technology companies to fight. \"That's a case of free speech,\" Joseff says. According to the ADL, 3 million Twitter users posted or reposted at least 4.2 million anti-Semitic tweets in English over a 12-month period ending Jan. 28. For many Jewish people, the study reports, \"especially those in the public eye, social media platforms have become inhospitable for both general communication and as forums for discussing public life.\" The study's authors interviewed several American Jews about their experiences with online abuse, including a reporter at a major U.S. news outlet: \"Each time one of his stories got traction online\u2014or featured details on topics such as white nationalism, Donald Trump, or libertarianism\u2014he was sent photoshopped images of his face in a gas chamber or was threatened with the public release of his address and contact details.\" The ADL study says, \"It is time for technology companies to design their products for democracy. This does not just mean a facile attempt to protect or prioritize free speech. It means protecting minority ethnic and religious groups,\" which the study says are disproportionately targets of online abuse. \"Social media companies cannot escape responsibility by claiming not to be 'arbiters of truth,' the study says, concluding it is time for companies \"to inject ethics and\u2014more strongly\u2014human rights, into the heart of product design.\"",

Social conservatives may have lost their fight against same-sex marriage in the United States. But in Eastern Europe, they appear to be winning. Romania is one of several Eastern European nations that already ban both same-sex marriage and same-sex unions in civil law. Now it's trying to ban it in the constitution. The government is spending millions holding a two-day referendum this weekend so voters can approve the change. \"Do you know what a traditional family is? It's a man and a woman who are able to bear children,\" declared Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the ruling Social Democrats, after he cast his vote on Saturday. \"I have voted for what millions of Romanians have been demanding, for what I think defines us as a society and as a nation.\" The Romanian constitution defines marriage as \"between spouses.\" A collection of religious groups called the Coalition of the Family wants it to be \"between a man and a woman.\" A spokesman for the powerful Romanian Orthodox Church, which backs the constitutional change, says Romania, which overthrew communism in 1989 but is still struggling economically, is feeling pressure from the more liberal West to accept same-sex marriage. \"We managed to preserve our Christian values during the communist period, when the church was persecuted,\" Archdeacon Ionut Mavrichi told NPR in his Bucharest office. \"We should be able to decide how we understand the institution of the family. Every child has the right to be raised and born in a family from a mother and father like all the children that have ever been born.\" But the LGBTQ community here says the referendum only incites discrimination in a country that only fully decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 as a precondition for entering the European Union. \"I would never even consider holding hands with my boyfriend in public here,\" says Alex Andronic, a 25-year-old novelist. \"Because in Romanian society, people are told 'the gays are taking over the country,' like we are something that's supposed to be feared.\" Andronic spoke in the colorful terrace of his bistro-pub, Blueberry, one of the few gay-friendly establishments in Bucharest, which he runs with his close friend, Mihaela Balan. Andronic says he considers Balan, who is 48, to be a second mother, after relations with his own mother were strained when he came out. \"This referendum is only about hate,\" Balan says. \"I refuse to vote at all.\" \"In Romanian society, people are told 'the gays are taking over the country,' like we are something that's supposed to be feared,\" says Alex Andronic, pictured above with Mihaela Balan in their bistro-pub, Blueberry, one of the few gay-friendly establishments in Bucharest.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"In Romanian society, people are told 'the gays are taking over the country,' like we are something that's supposed to be feared,\" says Alex Andronic, pictured above with Mihaela Balan in their bistro-pub, Blueberry, one of the few gay-friendly establishments in Bucharest. Those who oppose the referendum are boycotting it in the hopes that they can kill it. It won't be valid unless 30 percent of voters participate. There's also concern about voter fraud, so the civic group Funky Citizens is sending out 700 volunteers to act as independent election observers. \"This referendum has no place in a democratic society because it's a vote on restraining human rights,\" says Elena Calistru, the group's president, as volunteers huddle around a table of laptops, checking spreadsheets of voters. She says it's not only same-sex couples who will suffer, but also single parents, grandparents and \"others raising children in households other than heterosexual, married parent households.\" Some analysts have suggested the ruling party leader, Dragnea, who's been convicted on corruption and abuse of office charges, is using the referendum to distract voters from his own problems. But Calistru points out that the referendum also says a lot about current divisions within the EU. \"Central and Eastern European countries have seen a wave of nationalism and nativism in the past two or three years with a narrative that calls for a return to traditions,\" she says. \"It's very worrying because these are countries that recently joined the European Union and are disappointed with the integration process, especially in rural areas. They don't feel like they've gotten anything out of the EU but still have to follow the EU's rules.\" American conservatives have also gotten involved in Romania's referendum. Last year, Harry Mihet, vice president for Liberty Counsel, the U.S. law firm that advocates for restrictions on same-sex marriage, visited Romania with Kim Davis, the Rowan County Clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage certificates. They told pro-referendum activists that same-sex marriage is not compatible with religious freedom \"because those who promote the former have zero tolerance for the latter.\" But conservative forces have faced resistance in the EU. In a landmark decision this June, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU countries that have not legalized same-sex marriage must respect the residency rights of same-sex spouses under the EU's freedom of movement rules. The case was brought by Adrian Coman, a Romanian who could not secure a Romanian residency permit for his American husband, Claibourn Robert Hamilton, because the country did not recognize their marriage. (The couple, both 47, wed in Belgium in 2010). Coman and Hamilton now live in New York City, but they're watching the referendum vote with trepidation.

The freedom of movement to live and work within the bloc has really improved our lives.\" In court, Coman says, Romania suggested his marriage was not compatible with national identity. But in his hometown of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, the medieval city in central Romania where his parents still live, the couple has found acceptance. \"We are always welcomed with homemade soup and open arms,\" Hamilton says. \"They see us like any other family.\" Freelance producer Mihai Ursu contributed reporting",

            "article_content": "The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment by Francis Fukuyama Hardcover, 218 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The phrase \"identity politics\" has come to be used as a political insult. It's now shorthand for pandering to voters according to demographics. But political scientist Francis Fukuyama says that everyone is playing at identity politics now \u2014 that nationalism, radical Islam and other movements are fueled by people wrestling with identity in an economic world order that's letting them down. The election of Donald Trump has ridden on the back of such identity issues, he says. \"His core supporters are people that feel that their understanding of a traditional American identity is being challenged,\" says Fukuyama. \"That's why immigration has been so important to him.\" Fukuyama is a senior fellow in international relations at Stanford University and director of its Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. His new book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, is an attempt to examine the development and role of identity in contemporary politics. On how identity is playing out in U.S. politics today I think that the real problem in American politics is we've shifted from arguing about economic policies to arguing about identities, where you have a number of identities rooted, unfortunately, in biology, on both the left and the right, where you really can't compromise or negotiate. ... If it's based on the way I was born, I can't change that, and so you're stuck with that identity. And I think that that's really toxic for democratic politics, because it makes communication, discussion, compromise, much more difficult, and it also erodes the necessary, commonly held beliefs that are necessary to maintain a democracy. On how white America is now talking about its identity I think it's perhaps not surprising, although, I must say, that it's very dispiriting. There's been racism and xenophobia for a long time. I think what's unique about this moment is that a lot of people on the alt-right, white nationalists, have borrowed the framing of left-wing identity politics to say \"We white people are an oppressed minority.\" That's something I think is quite new in our politics. On how the loss of dignity plays into identity politics I think that this is something behind the Trump vote, that a lot of the working class people that had lost jobs, that were not living in coastal cities, not connected to the global economy \u2014 except as they were victimized by it \u2014 simply felt ignored by the elites that were doing very well. And I think it reflected the fundamental economic inequalities that have appeared over the last 30 years as a result of advances in technology and globalization. And so, the real claim, I think, was being invisible to people that were part of the elite. On whether it's possible to step off this path I think it's actually quite possible, because we're actually not born with identities. Our identities aren't necessarily biological. We construct identities all the time, and I think one of the tasks is to reconstruct an American national identity that is open to everybody, bound together on the basis of political principles \u2014 like the Constitution, like the rule of law, like the principle of equality and the Declaration of Independence. That's the kind of constructed identity that we need as an antidote to the kinds of polarizing identities that our politics has fallen prey to.",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arizona senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain died from brain cancer. Arizona senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain died Saturday at the age of 81. McCain leaves behind his wife of more than three decades, Cindy; seven children, including three from his first marriage, to Carol Shepp; and his 106-year-old mother, Roberta McCain. Perhaps America's most famous prisoner of war, the former Navy pilot with a famous admiral father was shot down over Vietnam and spent 5 1/2 years as a POW in the north, most of that time in a prison sarcastically termed the Hanoi Hilton for the way inmates were treated. McCain endured torture at the hands of his captors, a cause he would speak out against 40 years later as a United States senator during the Iraq War following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. McCain even objected publicly to President Trump's nominee to be director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, for her role in overseas detention centers. I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country & has devoted her professional life to its service & defense. However, her role in overseeing the use of torture is disturbing & her refusal to acknowledge torture\u2019s immorality is disqualifying. https://t.co/ocDtdqU2Sx A Washington institution, McCain served in the Senate for more than 30 years, first entering public service as a congressman in 1982, just nine years after his release from the Vietnamese prison. 1 of 6 McCain released a memoir, The Restless Wave, earlier this year, and he noted how he wanted to be remembered. \"I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times,\" McCain notes, adding, \"What an ingrate I would be to curse the fate that concludes the blessed life I've led. I prefer to give thanks for those blessings, and my love to the people who blessed me with theirs. The bell tolls for me. I knew it would. ... I hope those who mourn my passing, and even those who don't, will celebrate as I celebrate a happy life lived in imperfect service to a country made of ideals, whose continued success is the hope of the world. And I wish all of you great adventures, good company, and lives as lucky as mine.\" Clashes with Trump The Arizona senator frequently clashed with President Trump. After McCain said in July 2015 that Trump \"fired up the crazies,\" especially when it came to immigration, Trump fired back. He mocked McCain, saying, \"I like people who weren't captured.\" The chasm between the two men \u2014 one of the party's past and one of its present \u2014 centered on more than just personal attacks; it was very much about America's place in the world. McCain laid it out in October 2017 during his acceptance speech for the National Constitution Center's Liberty Medal, in which he blasted \"half-baked, spurious nationalism\": \"To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain 'the last best hope of earth' for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems, is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was a longtime friend of McCain's despite their deep policy differences. Earlier this year, Biden presented an international peace and conflict resolution award to McCain's wife, Cindy. \"Regardless of any political differences we've had,\" Biden said, \"we've always stood shoulder to shoulder as staunch defenders of that enduring, bipartisan vision for vigorous, engaged American leadership of the liberal international order that was created after World War II. It's a vision that's under attack today.\" McCain, who was a thorn in the side of the last three presidents, extended his criticism of Trump to action on subject matters beyond foreign affairs. McCain effectively ended GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, signaling his \"no\" vote on a repeal bill with a thumbs-down in the middle of the night on the Senate floor. That move widened the gulf between him and the president. Trump would mock McCain at campaign rallies, without mentioning his name, when talking about the failed health care vote. And he tweeted his outrage toward McCain on multiple occasions following the vote. Earlier this month, Trump even declined to use McCain's name during an event about a defense-authorization bill \u2014 which had McCain's name on it.

McCain overcame a savings-and-loan scandal early in his political career. He and four other senators had pressured regulators to back off their political benefactor Charles Keating. They became known as the \"Keating Five.\" Keating eventually served jail time for fraud. McCain was the only congressman involved to go on to serve long-term. \"It's amazing he survived that,\" Arizona State University professor Bruce Merrill told the Arizona Republic in 2014 following Keating's death. \"And I guess one could argue that his political skills brought him through that.\" McCain's willingness to buck his own party earned him the nickname \"maverick,\" a moniker he wore proudly. But that independent streak \u2014 and his famous temper \u2014 did not always endear him to party leadership. In 1999, McCain clashed with the GOP establishment in his run for president. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, was seen as the far and away front-runner. But McCain nearly swiped the nomination, trouncing Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Bush saw a massive lead evaporate in the next primary, in South Carolina. But Bush and his supporters in the state used a heavily negative campaign to derail McCain. There was even a whisper campaign that McCain had fathered a black child. McCain has an adopted daughter from Bangladesh. The episode left McCain bitter toward the future president of his own party.

McCain tackled the system of campaign financing with like-minded Democrats, an issue that split him from Republican leaders. But McCain and Bush were able to work together on immigration. McCain, a border senator, championed Bush's comprehensive immigration overhaul effort. It eventually collapsed because of a lack of support from rank-and-file Republicans. And it was something for which McCain had to apologize to the Republican base to win the 2008 presidential nomination. The 2008 campaign: From \"No, ma'am\" to Sarah Palin and Barack Obama The 2008 campaign, in which McCain received nearly 60 million votes on Election Day, showed McCain's resilience. In the summer of 2007, he was seen as an afterthought in the Republican primaries after his campaign collapsed and ran out of money.

But on a shoestring budget and a limited staff, he ran a campaign full of town halls, retail politicking and a particular openness with the media. He wound up overcoming the long odds, displaying the same stubbornness and determination he had shown surviving 5 1/2 years as a tortured prisoner of war that left him with injuries so bad, he walked with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life and could not raise one arm above his shoulder. The Great Recession that began in late 2008 and the Iraq War during the Bush years proved impossible for McCain to overcome. McCain, needing a boost, took a chance with his vice presidential pick. He put Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on the ticket. It was a move that looked smart early on, as he got a bump in the polls, and Palin would routinely draw larger crowds than McCain himself. There was so much excitement with the base around her being on the ticket, some people would cut off the McCain portion of their McCain-Palin bumper stickers. The jolt was short-lived. Palin would make missteps that had a negative affect on the campaign. But her star turn with the base would inspire the outgrowth of the Tea Party, help Republicans take back the House in 2010, and lay a lot of the groundwork that made a Trump presidency possible. Compounding the difficulty of McCain's campaign was Barack Obama, McCain's Democratic opponent. Obama was young and dynamic and would be the nation's first black president. In a notable moment during the campaign, McCain defended Obama's identity against a woman who said she was uncomfortable with Obama, whom she declared an \"Arab.\" \"No, ma'am,\" McCain said in a video that went viral. \"He's a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about. ... I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments. I will respect him. I want everyone to be respectful, and let's make sure we are, because that's the way politics should be conducted in America.\" McCain also showed grace in defeat, praising Obama and focusing the country on the historic nature of his candidacy. \"Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country,\" said McCain, who grew up a generation before the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act.

McCain served 10 more years in the Senate, facing serious primary challenges in 2010 and 2016 that forced him to take more hard-line conservative positions during those campaigns than he had in the past, particularly on immigration and border security. He also became a critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy, calling it \"feckless.\" McCain was especially exasperated by the Obama administration's lack of engagement in Syria, as it fell into civil war. He personally made a trip to the country secretly in 2013 to meet with opposition leaders. McCain spent his final years in the Senate as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, championing higher defense spending. He also regained some of his \"maverick\" image as one of the few Republican lawmakers willing to criticize Trump. \"The senator has always understood that people in positions of power have a responsibility not only for what they say, but for what people hear,\" said Pablo Carrillo, who worked for McCain for 15 years and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. \"And in that sense, I think that his approach to governing and leadership would have been guided by that in mind. Indeed, that's something that we are well-served in remembering, especially those with responsibility.\"",

Updated August 13 One year after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., hundreds of counterprotesters overwhelmed the small number of 'this year's Unite the Right' rally attendees in Washington D.C. Experts who monitor domestic extremism in the United States are taking stock of where the far-right movement stands. The movement is often referred to as \"alt-right\" \u2014 a term that was coined around the 2016 election to describe the vast mix of extreme right factions including white supremacist and anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic groups, white nationalists and others. Here's what we know about where the movement is heading: 1. The movement is splintered One early consensus is that the movement is still going strong, with active recruitment online and at rallies. However, it appears factions have splintered in the past year. Hundreds of white men rallied in Charlottesville last year, many openly displaying neo-Nazi and white supremacist symbols. Today, some of those men are in legal trouble, including the founder of the \"Unite the Right\" rally, Jason Kessler. Others were reported to have been ostracized when they returned home to their communities. In an interview with Noel King of NPR's Morning Edition before the weekend rally, Kessler distanced himself from white supremacists, white nationalists and those who attended his 2017 march displaying neo-Nazi symbols. \"I'm not a white supremacist,\" he said, \"I'm not even a white nationalist. I consider myself a civil and human rights advocate focusing on the underrepresented Caucasian demographic.\" But Kessler has made statements that align with white supremacy. Later in the interview, Kessler said he believes there are differences between the races in including physical differences as well as \"differences in behavior and levels of aggression and intelligence, in bone density, etc. etc.\" Kessler also defended his right to hold marches like last year's in Charlottesville and another he has planned for this weekend in Washington, D.C.. \"The First Amendment is under attack,\" he said, \"if not legally, in practice. ... Legally, I have the right. It's not that the police are trying to oppress me or that the government is trying to oppress me. Who's trying to oppress the rights of white folks who are standing up for themselves are Antifa who come there to use violence to shut down speech.\" George Selim of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism says one year on, there are also divisions online among extremist groups over whether they should hide most of that racist imagery during public appearances and look more mainstream. That is a tactic, he says, designed to make their extremist ideology seem more acceptable to the mainstream. You know, how [do] they want to represent themselves? Is it with Nazi like symbolism or imagery or is it in polo shirts and khakis that's ensconced in kind of white supremacist ideology that could be more palatable to the American public? George Selim \"You know, how [do] they want to represent themselves?,\" he asked. \"Is it with Nazi-like symbolism or imagery or is it in polo shirts and khakis that's ensconced in kind of white supremacist ideology that could be more palatable to the American public?\" One of the biggest controversies thus far in the Trump presidency was after Charlottesville, when the president blamed \"both sides\" for the violence. Randy Blazak, who studies domestic terrorism at the University of Oregon, says the far right movement remains divided on Trump today. Some still support him and his 'America First' platform, while other, more anti-Semitic factions, are inspired by the anti-government beliefs of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber. \"They've used that rhetoric in social media [claiming] we need a Civil War and we have to be ready to throw our bodies into the fray to save America,\" Blazak says. 2. There's a rise of far-right groups not as closely aligned with white nationalism After the deadly violence in Charlottesville, it appears far-right groups not closely tethered to white supremacy are having their moment. This is especially the case on the West Coast lately, where groups like the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer have been staging rallies and protests in liberal cities and college campuses. The Proud Boys, self-proclaimed \"western chauvinists,\" have distanced themselves from official \"Unite the Right\" style rallies and many members condemned the violence in Charlottesville. Patriot Prayer was founded by Joey Gibson, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican in the U.S. Senate primary in Washington state. Both groups regularly appear together and claim they're promoting Free Speech rights. But they rarely seem to provide specifics about particular issues. Their protests and scuffles with counter protesters often end in violence and arrests. \"One of the things I learned from Trump is that he knows how to troll the left [and] the media,\" Gibson told supporters at a rally in Portland earlier this month. Blazak, who also chairs the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime, says that during the Obama administration these types of groups were mostly online, acting as pranksters. After President Trump took office, he says, their trolling is in 3-D. \"They're not really a movement in the traditional sense that they have a cohesive political platform and an end game,\" Blazak says. \"It's more about the agitation and creating the conflict that creates a space for them.\" Indeed, rallies that Gibson organizes can at times feel like a Twitter feed, or internet chat room, that's being acted out in real life, especially when the activists clash with counter protesters, like anti-fascists, both groups in costume. \"Gibson is very charismatic,\" Blazak says. \"He's a biracial person and can help broaden their message by playing that role of not being your grandfather's white supremacist movement.\" 3. Potential for a greater threat of violence? Even though organizers of the Unite the Right rally cancelled plans to hold an anniversary event in Charlottesville, Va., police and community leaders were concerned extremist neo-Nazi groups may show up anyway. The main event, organized by Jason Kessler, was moved to Washington D.C. As NPR reported over the weekend, there were about 25 participants in this year's Unite the Right rally as well as hundreds of counterdemonstrators and a heavy police presence near the White House. Kessler told Morning Edition before the rally that he wanted the event to be peaceful.  \"I have publicly stated numerous times I don't want neo-Nazis at my rally, and they're not welcome,\" he said. \"I've been putting that out on Twitter. ... I'm getting attacked by the far left and the far right because I believe that extremism is not where we need to go right now.\" Some far-right activists see themselves as being on the frontline of a culture war over the future of the United States. Experts who have spent their careers monitoring these extremist groups say there is an increased concern for violence as the movement becomes more splintered, volatile and hard to predict. The ADL's Selim echoes that sentiment, saying the alt-right is still \"a serious threat to our homeland security and something that we should be paying strong attention to.\"",

He announced that he will be establishing the headquarters for his new foundation 'The Movement' in Brussels.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Steve Bannon, former White House chief advisor, has his sights on European Parliament. He announced that he will be establishing the headquarters for his new foundation 'The Movement' in Brussels. Steve Bannon built his career on right-wing politics inside the United States but now he's taking on a new frontier: the European Parliament. Bannon described his plan to create a right-leaning foundation called \"The Movement\" to The Daily Beast. He plans to establish its headquarters in Brussels. The Movement, according to Bannon's account, is envisioned as a non-profit organization that will serve as the right's equivalent of George Soros' Open Society. Bannon's goal is to create a hub where the populist right can receive help with polling, research, voter targeting, policy proposals, and field operations among other efforts to help unite European populist groups. A staff of no more than 10 is expected to take on the task of running the foundation up until the 2019 elections for the European Parliament. If that goes well \u2013 meaning if populist candidates make it into Parliament - Bannon is hoping to bring on a full time staff of about 25, The Beast reported. Bannon did not respond to NPR's request for an interview on his project. He told The Beast that he's optimistic about uniting Europe's right wing across its national boundaries \u2014 an idea he says was sparked when France's Marine Le Pen asked him to speak before her Front National. Le Pen was defeated by French President Emmanuel Macron and his more centrist movement, En March. Bannon wants to help Le Pen and other European leaders on the political right in future contests, including the coming European elections. In his speech this spring, he urged populist leaders to stand firm in their positions. \"Let them call you racists. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honor,\" NPR reported in March. Following November's midterm elections in the U.S., Bannon said he will spend half of his time in Europe laying the groundwork for his foundation. But not all of Europe is looking forward to his arrival. Guy Verhofstadt, who has been a member of European Parliament since 2009 and is the president of ALDE, tweeted his disapproval of Bannon bringing his headquarters to Belgium and started the hashtag #BanBannon. Steve Bannon's far-right vision & attempt to import Trump's hateful politics to our continent will be rejected by decent Europeans.

Other Europeans tweeted similar sentiments. \"Bannon is a malignant far-right rabble-rouser. In his case I agree, just this once, with the no immigration mob! Keep him out of Europe.

Updated at 4 a.m. ET Leftist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 who campaigned partly on a platform of standing up to President Trump \u2014 will become Mexico's next president after easily outpacing his two main rivals. With about a third of the votes counted, L\u00f3pez Obrador was polling about 53 percent to 24 percent for conservative candidate Ricardo Anaya and 15 percent for Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary (PRI) party. \"The tendency favors Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,\" Anaya told his supporters minutes after Meade also conceded. \"I recognize his triumph.\" Pre-election polls had shown L\u00f3pez Obrador, a 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City, as a heavy favorite and exit polls indicated the trend in the early count was almost certain to hold. L\u00f3pez Obrador's calls for transforming Mexico by ousting the \"mafia of power\" and his advocacy for the poor held strong appeal. In addition, his nationalistic appeals, including a promise to defend Mexicans against U.S. bullying also helped win votes. The candidate, who goes by the nickname AMLO, even published a book, Oye, Trump (\"Listen Up, Trump\") aimed squarely at the U.S. president. Even so, as Reuters notes, \"L\u00f3pez Obrador's nationalism, stubborn nature and put-downs of rivals have drawn comparisons\" to Trump. Trump congratulated the apparent victor in a tweet Sunday night, saying he looked forward to working with him. Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! As NPR's Carrie Kahn notes, L\u00f3pez Obrador \"says he's going to cut the perks and corruption from the top and give that money and savings to the bottom \u2014 raising salaries, pensions for the elderly, scholarships for the young.\" The New York Times writes that the outcome of Sunday's election \"represents a clear rejection of the status quo in the nation, which for the last quarter century has been defined by a centrist vision and an embrace of globalization that many Mexicans feel has not served them.\" That banner for that vision has been carried by Mexico's long dominant PRI party and its outgoing president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Exit polls forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Obrador's Morena party in four of the eight state races being contested, as well as the capital, Mexico City, according to The Associated Press. Mexico's central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to the conservative National Action Party, the AP says.",

French President Emmanuel Macron has ambitious plans for European Union reform and has been counting on cooperation from Germany, France's closest European ally, to see those plans come to fruition. But when he meets in Berlin Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss his proposals, he may face resistance. While Germany is decidedly pro-EU, Merkel is under domestic pressure to push back against economic reforms that could vex taxpayers. And some of Macron's proposals would do exactly that. When he gave an impassioned speech in the European Parliament about the future of the continent on Tuesday, Macron appeared to have stepped into Merkel's shoes as the de facto leader of Europe. He warned against the \"erosion of democracy\" and argued the EU must change its ways if it is to fend off the current rise in nationalism. He went on to equate the continent's political divisions with civil war and urged fellow Europeans to act, not to turn into a \"generation of sleepwalkers.\" But even as Macron was speaking at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, France, lawmakers from Merkel's conservative bloc in Berlin were busy discussing how to restrict some of his proposed reforms. The sticking point is economic integration, and in particular, Macron's bid to turn the eurozone's current rescue fund into a full-blown European Monetary Fund, modeled on the International Monetary Fund. Originally floated by Germany's former finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and intended as a means to tackle another sovereign debt crisis within the monetary union, Germany and France do not see eye to eye how it would work. Germany favors a fund available for struggling eurozone member states, but only under strict conditions. Macron would like a more flexible model that shares more risk, but gives more firepower to EU institutions to help in calmer times as well as in crises. \"The Germans want to add a sovereign default procedure that can actually let governments fail on their debt,\" says Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. Schwarzer says the reason Germany wants this is that Merkel's conservatives worry that a eurozone-wide monetary fund might mean German taxpayers would foot the bill for member states like Greece or Italy, which they view as less fiscally cautious. \"The French vision is quite different,\" Schwarzer says. \"They believe the eurozone should work more like a nation-state with a monetary policy and a budget. If one region has job shortages, then unemployment insurance kicks in until the region has recovered.\" Ahead of Thursday's meeting with Macron, Merkel attempted to play down the fierce resistance she is facing from within her own party. \"Germany will be bringing its own ideas to the table,\" she said. \"We'll find a compromise with France before the [next EU leaders'] summit in June.\" Merkel personally supports the notion of a European Monetary Fund. But to placate the skeptics within her alliance, the chancellor also says member states must retain the right to veto eurozone bailout packages. Her coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are unimpressed with the conservative bloc's show of dissent. Carsten Schneider, the deputy leader of the Social Democrats' parliamentary group, warns time is running out. Following a long campaign leading up September elections, it took months for Merkel to be able to form a government in March. \"Europe has been waiting for Germany for more than a year,\" Schneider told German public broadcaster ARD. \"First the election, then the lengthy coalition negotiations. It's time we play our part.\" But fellow Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, Germany's new finance minister, is more cautious. Budgetary caution is part of his job description. Referring to Macron's suggestions as \"courageous,\" Scholz warned last weekend that not all of them would be feasible. Like his predecessor Sch\u00e4uble, whose name became synonymous with hard-line austerity during the eurozone crisis that started in late 2009, Scholz has vowed to continue Germany's schwarze Null or \"black zero\" policy of a balanced budget. That's a cultural trait in a nation of savers, as well as a debt-brake policy written into Germany's constitution. So despite Merkel's warm rhetoric and Scholz's cautious praise, it's unlikely that Macron will be able to convince the German government that pooling economic risks is prudent. Whether the finance minister or Merkel's party scuttles Macron's plans, commentators believe the French leader may find his warning about failing to act falls on deaf ears in Berlin.",

Twitter has banned Paul Nehlen, a Republican challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan for a congressional seat, for a racist tweet targeting American actress Meghan Markle, the fianc\u00e9e of Prince Harry. This week, the Natural History Museum in London released images of Cheddar Man, a dark-skinned Mesolithic man believed to be one of the oldest modern humans in Britain. Nehlen posted the couple's official engagement photo with Cheddar Man's face superimposed on Markle's, who is biracial. He captioned the tweet, \"Honey does this tie make my face look pale?\" Harry and Markle, set to wed in May, have dealt extensively with online harassment. In 2016, months into their relationship, Harry released an official statement decrying the \"racial undertones\" of abuse targeted toward Markle. The tweet is hardly Nehlen's first instance of controversy. The politician has made waves for racist and anti-Semitic tweets in the past and proclaimed that \"Jews control the media\" on former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's podcast last month. Nehlen \"has spent months curating an image of a sometimes ironic, but most certainly sincere, white nationalist willing to say things intended to push populist nationalism into the discourse,\" writes the Southern Poverty Law Center. Twitter, which does not normally comment on individual accounts, confirmed to NPR that Nehlen was permanently suspended for repeated violations of its terms of service. \"And as we explained in our blog about world leaders on Twitter: We review Tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly,\" a Twitter spokesperson told NPR. \"No one person's account drives Twitter's growth, or influences these decisions.

Green profiled Bannon and explained his role in Trump's election in his 2017 book, Devil's Bargain.

On the tense dynamic between staffers in the White House Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Nationalist Uprising by Joshua Green Paperback, 272 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The glimpse I've gotten into the White House through Bannon, through all the other White House officials and campaign officials that I interviewed for this book [is] that on a day-to-day basis what's really going on there is a kind of Darwinian fight for survival. Everybody in there is busy either stabbing other people in the back or trying to protect their own back. One of the themes I touch on in the new preface is why it is that this whole populist/nationalist project failed \u2014 the one that got Trump elected \u2014 once he got to the White House. And I think the answer is that Bannon ultimately decided to spend his time pursuing his internal enemies and nursing his own grievances. And that is the way that a lot of other senior people in the White House have behaved and continue to behave. On Bannon's public persona and unkempt appearance He cultivated this image of himself as a kind of behind-the-scenes Machiavelli, because I think he was shrewd enough to know that if you're out in front of the cable news cameras, Trump is eventually going to turn on you. ... 'Saturday Night Live' had just done their little skit where the Bannon character is Death who comes out as the Grim Reaper \u2014 and Bannon just thought it was the greatest thing in the world, thought it was hilarious. Joshua Green Bannon was delighted with his portrayal in the popular culture. I remember him calling me up one Sunday morning \u2014 this would be probably back in the spring or the summer when Saturday Night Live had just done their little skit where the Bannon character is Death who comes out as the Grim Reaper \u2014 and Bannon just thought it was the greatest thing in the world, thought it was hilarious. So all of this, I think, is a very carefully crafted image that is meant to distinguish him as someone different than kind of the lickspittle sycophants who are often representing Trump on cable news, people like Corey Lewandowski who kind of go on and shower Trump with obsequious praise. I think Bannon has much more of an ego than that, views himself as not just a serious figure but as a historical figure who was the brains behind the ideas that got Trump elected. On Bannon leaking to the press Bannon was notorious for leaking to the press. He was on the phone with reporters all day every day in the transition and in the White House. The idea that Bannon is hostile to the press \u2014 he famously dubbed us \"the opposition party\" \u2014 is a complete fiction and meant to cultivate this idea that Trump and the people around him were constantly and unfairly under assault by reporters. Bannon loves talking to reporters. He loves trying to shape the narrative, and ultimately, I think his sloppiness in talking to reporters and authors is what cost him his job. But he would use the press not only to kind of shape the daily news, but to go after his enemies and try to plant a dagger in the back of whoever it was that he was upset with these days. Everybody in the White House knows this. Everybody in the press knows this. And I think Trump knew it too, which is why he ended up leaving as early in the Trump administration has he did. On the falling out between Trump and Bannon What Bannon wanted to do when he left the White House was essentially to move the nationalist movement, as he thought of it, beyond just Donald Trump. The real cause of their falling-out \u2014 Trump's and Bannon's \u2014 was Bannon thought that presidential election was a referendum on a set of ideas, this kind of vision of right-wing populism, and Trump thought it was a referendum on Trump. And Bannon knew when he left the White House that he needed to advance this movement beyond Trump, who wasn't really committed to it anyway, as we've subsequently seen. And so what he wanted to do was elect a set of Senate candidates who were essentially mini-Trumps who would oust Mitch McConnell, the establishment-friendly Senate majority leader, and give Bannon a base of support within the Congress to essentially change Washington and change the Republican party in a way that would make everybody Trumpist. On Bannon's willingness to come back to the White House There isn't an obvious outlet for him to be able to speak and say things, and I think that's one reason why he has let reporters like me and a few other folks back into his world \u2014 to essentially have a megaphone to spread this idea and to try to get back on Trump's radar as someone who is still in his corner and is still willing to fight for him if Trump wants to reach out and repair that relationship. One thing is clear is that Bannon is willing and eager to go back, despite all the ignominy heaped on him by the president.

            "article_content": "It's been a wild time for President Trump post-midterms. After a combative week with the press, he went to France, where he separated himself further from European allies.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: President Trump's past week has been a wild one, ranging from a combative, post-election press conference to a trip to France in which he seemed farther than ever from the United States' European allies. Our own national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, joins us now to chronicle it all. Welcome, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So we've just been talking about what's happening in Florida. And the president has had a lot to say about it. LIASSON: That's right. He's been saying without evidence that there was tremendous fraud and corruption in the count - presumably, he's saying against the Republican candidate. Governor Scott, Marco Rubio have all been echoing those charges, even though law enforcement in Florida haven't found any evidence of fraud. But this reminds us of what he said in 2016, where he said the vote was rigged. And he would only accept the conclusion if he won. So this has a tendency to undermine people's faith in the most basic of democratic institutions, the ballot. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right - and he's also making claims of fraud in Arizona. But we're not even talking about a recount there. LIASSON: No, they're just counting the votes in Arizona where the Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema seems to be increasing her lead by the day. And there are also reports that the White House has encouraged Martha McSally, the Republican candidate, to make these charges. And she hasn't been. Maybe she hasn't been making the claims because she understands how Arizona works and because, in the past, she's both lost and won a very close election in Arizona. And also, there is a possibility that, if she loses the Senate race, she could be appointed to take the seat of John McCain, where former Senator Jon Kyl is serving right now. So we might end up with both Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema in as Arizona senators. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to turn to France now, where the president is. This is a trip that has not gone smoothly. Yesterday, President Trump chose not to go on a scheduled visit to a cemetery for fallen American soldiers. And for today's events, he didn't arrive with the other world leaders. And then in a speech, French President Emmanuel Macron said patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. That sounds pretty pointed. LIASSON: It is pretty pointed. Let's just try to unpack that. The reason given for the president's skipping the ceremony honoring World War I dead yesterday and the reason he didn't arrive with the other leaders today, the White House says, were security protocols. Now, the problem is that his credibility is low because he has said so many things in the past that weren't true. So nobody believed him. And he got a huge round of criticism for not honoring the dead yesterday, for not arriving with the other leaders. As for Emmanuel Macron's speech, he sees nationalism as something that's exclusionary, us versus them. Patriotism, he said, was about values, about pride in your country's values. And he has been trying to position himself as the leader of the liberal world order since the United States and President Trump has decided that U.S. leadership of that order, that post-World War II, rules-based, liberal world order is a burden, not an advantage for U.S. national security. So this is the big debate among democracies today. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And clearly a lot of tension. We only have a few seconds left. But what are your takeaways at this point from last week and the election? What do we know? LIASSON: Big takeaways - turnout busted all the records, surpassed even 1966. We had the biggest gender gap in history, where women voted for Democrats by - over Republicans by 20 points. It turns out that as time goes on, the Democrats have picked up more seats than they did in Watergate. We're probably looking at 35 to 40 pickups. And bottom line - we're more deeply divided ever by gender, geography, education - looks like we're having a realignment where the suburbs, especially college-educated women, are reliable Democratic voters. And white, working-class men particularly and rural voters are the base of the GOP. GARCIA-NAVARRO: More divided than ever - NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, thank you.

            "article_content": "After the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., it appears the far-right extremist movement has splintered. Though monitors warn the threat of violence is increasing.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: OK. We are approaching the anniversary of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. And we're going to take stock now on where the \"alt-right\" movement stands a year later. The \"alt-right\" was a term that surfaced leading up to the 2016 election to describe this vast and complicated mix of far-right groups, including those with white supremacist, nativist, anti-Muslim or anti-Semitic views. Joining me now is NPR's Kirk Siegler. He is based here in LA, and he has been tracking this movement. Hi there, Kirk. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So what should we know about the movement here in the summer of 2018? SIEGLER: Well, one year later, I mean, I think the early consensus is that this movement is still rather strong, and online recruitment is also strong. And this is according to a lot of sources I've been speaking with who monitor domestic extremism and hate groups. But you know, there's also some splintering going on among these groups, which is not necessarily surprising after Charlottesville. And you know, as you mentioned there in your lead, it was never really one firm, cohesive thing, this sort of far-right extremist movement. GREENE: So what do you mean by not cohesive and splintering? SIEGLER: Well, you remember - in Charlottesville, if we go back just for a second, you had hundreds of men who were out in the open brandishing neo-Nazi, white supremacist symbols. And now some of them are in legal trouble. The others were said to have returned home to their communities, where they were ostracized. And so there's this division on where this movement, if you will, should go next. And at the same time, a year later, we're seeing this rise in other far-right groups who are not as closely aligned to white nationalism. And you know, I think that's further complicating things. GREENE: Well, I know you spent some time with some of these groups you're talking about in the Pacific Northwest. And we're going to listen to your reporting, so set it up for me. SIEGLER: That's right. So I was in Portland this past weekend, where there was a rally held by two groups that have really been a growing presence on the far-right scene since Charlottesville, especially here on the West Coast. These are the Proud Boys. These are self-described Western chauvinists. That's the West, not the Western U.S. GREENE: Western because some of these groups say that their agenda is to protect Western culture. I mean, that's the way they put it. SIEGLER: Exactly. That's Proud Boys. And the other one is Patriot Prayer. And these groups in particular, their sort of preferred venues are college campuses and liberal cities. And that's why Portland, Ore., was in the spotlight. So let's hear from that now. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Shouting) USA, USA, USA... SIEGLER: Mostly young men dressed in paramilitary-style fatigues and black motorcycle helmets or khakis with red pro-Trump ball caps are squaring off with a crowd of counterprotesters. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTS) SIEGLER: Proud Boys, like this man Travis, who refuses to give his last name, say they've shown up to protect their free speech rights. TRAVIS: We're not here to cause issues. We're not here to start the violence. But we damn will sure finish it. SIEGLER: And most don't elaborate on what the specific political issues are that they support. Another guy initially agrees to talk to me with this blunt caveat. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: And I'll listen in. And if it streams, I'm going to find you and call your ass out. If you screen it and it doesn't sound anything like what I said, I will find you and call you out. SIEGLER: As is often the case, the Portland rally ends in dramatic fashion, with scuffles with anti-fascist counterprotesters and police firing tear gas into the angry crowd trying to disperse it. (SOUNDBITE OF TEAR GAS FIRING) SIEGLER: And there were hundreds of people here for this protest. Yet there were hundreds of thousands more people in this metro area who ignored it all. And as usual, a lot of TV cameras and streaming cellphones were trained on the organizer Joey Gibson, the founder of Patriot Prayer. JOEY GIBSON: And if you look all over the news, you'll see news coverage about my campaign. SIEGLER: Gibson ran for the U.S. Senate in Washington state as a Republican. He lost in the primary this week handily, but that may be beside the point. GIBSON: And one of the things that I learned from Trump is he knows how to troll the left. OK? He knows how to troll the media. SIEGLER: Watching all of this, it can, at times, seem like someone's Twitter feed or online chatroom that's being acted out in real life. And that's by design, says Randy Blazak. He's an expert in far-right extremism at the University of Oregon. RANDY BLAZAK: They're not really a movement in the traditional sense that they have a cohesive political platform and kind of an endgame. It's more about the agitation and creating the conflict that creates a space for them. SIEGLER: Blazak, who also chairs the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime, says this has been a powerful recruiting tool for the far-right, especially after Charlottesville. BLAZAK: Gibson is very charismatic. He knows how to give a good speech. He himself is not a white person. He's a biracial person and can help broaden their message by playing that role of not being your grandfather's white supremacist movement. SIEGLER: This also represents a division that's emerged after Charlottesville, says George Selim of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. He says there's a lot of debate online among hard-line activists about whether they should stick to overtly white nationalist themes going forward. GEORGE SELIM: You know, how they want to represent themselves - is it with Nazi-like symbolism or imagery, or is it in polo shirts and khakis that's ensconced in kind of white supremacist ideology that could be more palatable to the American public? SIEGLER: In the Northwest anyway, which is largely white and has a long history of anti-government extremism, it's clear that at least some of these far-right activists see themselves as being on the front line of a culture war over the future of this country. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Amen. SIEGLER: Kathryn Townsend drove down to Portland from her home in Gig Harbor, Wash. She says liberal politicians are mischaracterizing the movement. It's libertarian more than anything else, she says - and not racist. KATHRYN TOWNSEND: My daughter is half Spanish. I'm 65. If I had any white supremacist tendencies or experience, it would have showed up before now. GREENE: One of the voices there in a story from NPR's Kirk Siegler who is in our studio still with us. Kirk, that woman there saying she's not white supremacist, not racist. I mean, these groups - it sounds like many of them don't know exactly how to identify themselves. So it does sound like this is a splintered movement. And yet, there's going to be this \"Unite The Right\" rally in Washington, D.C., coming up. So what should we make of all this? SIEGLER: Well, exactly. It's hard to tell exactly even just from hearing them. But I should say, one of the reasons we did the story featuring the Proud Boys - the Proud Boys traditionally distanced themselves from white supremacists and disavowed Charlottesville altogether, though, David, I have been seeing some traffic online with some of the activists pressuring the Proud Boys to come to the rally. You know, the one thing that's clear is it's going to be tense. There's going to be a lot of security. The white supremacists, organizers of this thing - so it's going to be tense. There are state of emergencies declared in Charlottesville. We really don't exactly know what might happen. But I keep saying tense, and I think that's it. And I think there are a lot of questions right now. GREENE: All right, talking there about the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville this weekend when there are \"Unite The Right\" rallies being planned in Washington, D.C. NPR's Kirk Siegler talking about this movement. He's been tracking it. Kirk, thanks. SIEGLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF SMEYEUL.'S \"HER WANDERING GAZE.\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright describes herself as an \"optimist who worries a lot.\" And lately, it seems, there has been much to worry about. Albright's new book, Fascism: A Warning, starts by describing how Hitler and Mussolini came to power in the 20th century, then warns about today's authoritarian rulers in Eastern Europe, North Korea, Turkey and Russia. Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia and fled with her family after the Nazis occupied the country in 1939, notes that the United States has traditionally been viewed as a nation that opposes authoritarianism and supports democratic principles and human rights, but that perception is changing \u2014 in part because of President Trump. While Albright does not call Trump a fascist, she says that he is \"the most anti-democratic leader that I have studied in American history.\" \"We're not fulfilling the role that we're supposed to,\" she says of the United States today. \"I believe very much that democracy in the United States is resilient [and] that people can be skeptical about things that are going on, but I really am afraid that we are taking things for granted.\" On why she wanted to write about fascism A Warning by Madeleine Albright and Bill Woodward Hardcover, 288 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Part of the reason for writing [the book] is to say that, in fact, this can happen in countries that have democratic systems, that have a population that's interested in what's going on, that is supportive. ... That's what's so worrisome, is that fascism can come in a way that it is one step at a time, and in many ways, goes unnoticed until it's too late. On why parts of the world are moving toward authoritarianism I think that a lot of it has to do with the era that we're in, where there has been very rapid change in technology and that has created a lot of joblessness in countries. There is a whole way that technology and information is passed without making sure that it's really true. There are those people who are angry because the status quo hasn't changed, while the climate within a country has changed, and that the powers that be in a democracy aren't responding quickly enough. So it's kind of like as though we were seeing the people are getting their information on 21st century technology, but the governments are providing 19th century responses. And so the institutions are not responding to the divisions and the problems that people are having in these countries. And then the other part of this, which I think is essential, is there is some leader at the top who takes advantage of these divisions and, in fact, exacerbates them so that the societies are more and more divided and wrangled and looking for scapegoats, which is where the immigrants come in. But mostly, this is something that's created internally by massive changes in society and some of them, due to technology. On President Trump's \"America First\" ideology and criticism of NATO I see it as the most unbelievable step backwards, because I do believe that the United States is stronger when we have friends and allies to deal with the various issues. ... As a European who has spent her life in the United States, I see the Euro-Atlantic alliance as one of the most important bulwarks of our society, so seeing this go on, I find appalling. And what is the issue \u2014 again, it's this lack of understanding of what this alliance is about. ... What Trump is doing is making America seem like a victim. Everything is somebody else's fault: Countries are taking advantage of us. The Mexicans are sending drug dealers. Countries are not paying their dues. The trading system is unfair. And by making Americans seem like victims all the time, it then is able to, again, make the divisions stronger in terms of who is with us, who is not with us, and it's totally anti-American foreign policy. And so I think it's very, very worrisome in terms of this victimhood. I don't see America as a victim. I see America as the most powerful country in the world that has a role to play, standing up for democratic ideals and human rights across the board. On John Bolton's appointment as national security adviser My concerns are that he has been an outspoken person for the use of force, for the absence of diplomacy, for tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, for thinking that force is possible with North Korea. And frankly, part of the problem is ... that [Trump] listens to the last person who has talked to him, and the national security adviser is most often the last person, so I am concerned about that. On her belief that President Trump is \"anti-democratic\" What he's trying to do is undermine the press and [he] has disdain for the judiciary, and the electoral process and minorities, and I think that his instincts are not ones that are democratic. He is interested, basically, I think, in exacerbating those divisions that I talked about. ... I've picked up that phrase \"see something, say something,\" and I am seeing some things that are the kinds of things that we have seen in other countries, and so I am saying not only should we say something, but we have to do something about it. ... I think people may disagree with the president of the opposing party ... but we normally have believed that the president tells the truth. And I know I'm very worried about the fact that there are deliberate ways of misstating the issue, and then the people think, \"If the president said it, it must be right,\" when it's just a deliberate untruth.

Former Daily Show correspondent Jordan Klepper remembers a time, not so long ago, when he was barely aware of far-right media outlets like Alex Jones' Infowars and Breitbart News. That changed during the 2016 presidential race. \"I was going out into the field and covering a lot of Trump rallies and talking to people,\" Klepper says, \"and they were getting a lot of their ideas and their news from these far-right sources. So what first felt fringe, suddenly felt mainstream.\" Today those sites are required reading for Klepper's job. As the host of Comedy Central's satirical political show The Opposition, Klepper delivers commentaries in the persona of a far-right conspiracy theorist. \"He creates his own reality,\" Klepper says of his character. \"He sees the two dots and he fills the spaces with the things that make him feel more comfortable.\" On developing his character for The Opposition The character that I play lives in this world of Alex Jones, but is not a one-to-one satirization of Alex Jones. We kind of wanted to create a character that stood alone from those characters. So it's got the paranoia and the opportunism of an Alex Jones; it's got the Trump support of a Sean Hannity. It feels like state-run media. It's got the snark and smarm of a Jesse Watters, and it's got a little bit of Midwestern Jordan Klepper in there as well. The look that we've started to cultivate is less like \"I'm a New York guy with skinny ties and thin suits.\" ... These guys like to have flashier suits, bigger watches, big stripes and things of that nature. And so costume-wise we try to go in that direction. They sort of all preach the prosperity gospel; they're going to talk about God. But the best way to show that you are a person of God and living a righteous path is that you are successful. I think the Jordan Klepper character on the show wants to show he's successful in how he looks and how he holds himself. On how he relates to the people he satirizes I don't want to overplay my hand as someone who has lived a really difficult, tough life. I've been very fortunate. I had a great upbringing. [But] trying to become a professional comedian had its toil. I didn't have a lot of successes. I had a lot of failures, and I think out of that comes this [insecurity of], \"Am I smart enough? Am I thoughtful enough?\" And I do think we're all dealing with those issues and we all have those fears deep down inside. ... When I look at these characters who might be more on the fringe, who I disagree with ideologically or the things that they're pushing, and I try to find what is really going on right there \u2014 \"Why are you pushing so hard against this anti-intellectualism? Why are you so angry?\" \u2014 it's like, I think I can relate to [you] because you are scared. On how \"resistance\" is a theme for both the left and the right You see the ideology that exists on these far fringier sites like Infowars and even Breitbart \u2014 they're not like traditional Republican ideologies. They're based in conflict and opposing the mainstream \u2014 anti-mainstream, anti-intellectualism, anti-fact in many ways. As we wanted to build this show, we saw that, \"This is all opposing something. Find an enemy. Call it out. We want to be that.\" We also realized what was so interesting is [Jones] was calling himself \"the resistance\" at the same time Keith Olbermann had a show calling itself The Resistance, and it felt like a very American moment that we could all be united in being against something. We're all resisting something. We all want to be the underdogs. On getting cast for The Daily Show over his wife and comedy partner, Laura Grey They had us both audition and we went through a bunch of rounds. We both came in and read with Jon [Stewart] and they could only take one person, and I was the person who got that job, which was one of the weirdest, strangest, happiest, saddest moments of my life. ... We had worked together for so long, worked on these projects and gotten so close to this really cool dream job \u2014 one which she was so perfect for, I felt I had a strong chance for. ... So I got to go along with it and she didn't and started working on other things. ... It's kind of the truth of this industry. On the outside everything is a dream and you get to have dream jobs. And, again, I am so fortunate with the opportunities that I had, but up until that point, Laura and I had both been doing comedy for 15 years and we had some successes, but a lot of that was us making videos ourselves on no money, teaching improv 40 hours a week to try to get by, hustling, getting really close to opportunities and then failing. So this idea of this dream thing happening and everything is great is a fallacy. I think when I had that opportunity ... it was a mix of so many emotions. It's always going to be complicated.

            "article_content": "The White House is using the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border to pressure Democrats on immigration legislation. The president threatens tariffs on more Chinese goods.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Explosive criticism of a Trump administration policy has led the administration to continue the policy while denying it can do anything about it. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The Homeland Security secretary yesterday defended President Trump's policy choice. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, you'll recall, had announced the zero tolerance policy this spring. As Sessions promised in public at the time, the policy separates families arriving at the border, even some applying for asylum. Democratic and Republican lawmakers say they disapprove. But yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen blamed the lawmakers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: The voices most loudly criticizing the enforcement of our current laws are those whose policies created this crisis and whose policies perpetrate it. INSKEEP: Other officials have affirmed the administration can enforce the laws differently. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch says no change in the law is really needed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ORRIN HATCH: I think we've got to lead in Congress and get it done. But I also think the White House can fix it if they want to. I don't think there's any question about that. INSKEEP: Now, Secretary Nielsen denied that the administration is harming children to gain leverage to pass a broader immigration bill, but she pushed Congress to pass legislation. She also insisted, by the way, that people can apply for asylum at regular border crossings without trouble. GREENE: All right, let's talk this through with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So there was already a lot of disagreement in the Republican Party over immigration even before this explosive criticism over the separation of families. So where is the Republican Party now? LIASSON: That is a good question. The Republican Party is divided. There are a lot of Republicans who want this policy, this practice to end because it's potentially hurting some of their members in the upcoming elections. That's what they're worried about. Even the chairman of the House Republicans' campaign committee, Steve Stivers of Ohio, called on the administration to change the policy, stop separating children from families. And you've heard from people - a lot of Republicans. Ted Cruz, for instance - very conservative senator, up for re-election - he's even putting - creating legislation to stop this practice. So you see a lot of Republicans pushing back against this, but others are happy that the president is enforcing the law. GREENE: Well, what is the level of happiness about this policy out in the country? I mean, there have been polls over the months suggesting that there are a lot of Americans who want President Trump to be incredibly tough, right? LIASSON: Sure. Now, like - as with a lot of cultural issues, this splits the country and the Republicans in completely different ways. A new Quinnipiac poll showed 66 percent of Americans disapprove of the policy, but 55 percent of Republicans approve of it. Seventy percent of women, by the way, disapprove of it. And I should just point out that while the public at large is turning against this policy by 2 to 1, the president's Gallup approval rating is the highest it's ever been since the first week in office. And that shows you that the intensity among Republicans who support him is very, very high. GREENE: All right. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks a lot. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. This morning, we are watching the trade dispute between the United States and China really escalate, it seems. INSKEEP: Yeah. Let's remember here, President Trump imposed $50 billion in tariffs, saying it was a response to Chinese trade practices and a big trade deficit. China responded with tariffs of its own, so the president raised the ante, threatening tariffs now on 200 billion dollars' worth of Chinese goods. And the White House adds that if China responds unfavorably to that, the president will add another 200 billion. China's government says this amounts to blackmail. GREENE: All right, let's bring in NPR's Rob Schmitz, who is at his base in Shanghai. Hi there, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So is this basically what a lot of people predicted - a trade dispute just becomes a tit for tat with both sides just escalating in response to the other? SCHMITZ: Yeah, I mean, this is like a schoolyard fight. U.S. gets angry about China's behavior, punches China. China punches back, and now U.S. is threatening to throw the equivalent of a rock at China with this newest threat. I mean, it just gets bigger and bigger. GREENE: But there are real implications here, right? I mean, let's talk about this development. If President Trump imposes, you know, even more tariffs - if China responds, there are U.S. companies in China, and it could be incredibly impactful for them. SCHMITZ: Yeah. You know, the message from Beijing was that China would retaliate with what it called quantitative and qualitative measures. Now, the quantitative measures refers to tariffs on U.S. products. And up to now, Beijing has retaliated to U.S. tariffs with a sort of tit-for-tat manner like we mentioned. So the qualitative part, though, is different. And the qualitative part looks at - so basically, here's the thing. Beijing only imports 170 billion dollars' worth of U.S. goods, so Trump's new threat of tariffs on 200 billion dollars' worth of Chinese goods puts that tit-for-tat response out of reach for China. So that means that... GREENE: Oh, wow. SCHMITZ: ...We go to these qualitative measures, and that's where Beijing starts to target U.S. companies that are generating a lot of revenue inside of China. So I spoke to the US-China Business Council's Jake Parker about this today. He represents dozens of big American companies operating in China, and here's what he said. JAKE PARKER: That has a huge chilling impact on U.S. companies operating in the China market because it would be outside the scope of import and export and tariffs and would instead begin to chip away U.S. company market share in the China market, something that's almost impossible to rebuild. SCHMITZ: And that's a market share that U.S. companies have taken decades to build in the first place, so this is really worrying for them. GREENE: So qualitative seems to open the door, it sounds like, up to almost anything. It's not just about tariffs and money. It could involve punishment in all different forms. Is that right? SCHMITZ: It gets dirty. And what's happening now, according to Parker, is that China's already doing this. He told me that U.S. companies are beginning to complain to him that they're receiving increased scrutiny on the regulation side. But also, when U.S. products enter customs into China, Parker told me that, typically, 2 percent of U.S. products are inspected upon entering a Chinese port, and whenever that happens, of course, they can't sell that - those products. Recently, for some U.S. products, that's gone up to a hundred percent, meaning that entire groups of U.S. products are no longer available. Businesses here are also worried about boycotts. Should Trump go through with more tariffs, China's government could easily turn a growing sense of nationalism inside of China into a more targeted anti-Americanism. And we've definitely seen this before here in China with Japanese goods when China was angry with Japan and with South Korean goods when it had a tiff with that country. GREENE: And we're already seeing the immediacy of the impact. The markets are already tumbling in some parts of the world - a reminder that these are two very big economies that matter to the global economy. NPR's Rob Schmitz talking to us from Shanghai. Rob, thanks. SCHMITZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. Video gamers might recognize that theme. It is from the current blockbuster game Fortnite. And some gamers may know it all too well. INSKEEP: Much too well. The World Health Organization now says gaming disorder is officially part of its International Classification of Diseases. That's a milestone, although the U.S. psychiatric profession is not ready to take that step of recognition. GREENE: NPR's Anya Kamenetz has been following technology's grip on our brains for some time. She's here with us. Hi, Anya. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So gaming disorder - I mean, how does the World Health Organization define it and decide that it actually is a disease, as Steve said? KAMENETZ: Well, they say that they're not trying to set a precedent but instead following clinical practice here. And they are making it sort of similar to a gambling addiction. And here's a video about the new classification from Dr. Shekhar Saxena of the World Health Organization. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SHEKHAR SAXENA: Gaming has now been added because of very clear scientific evidence that it has characteristic signs and symptoms, and there is need and demand for treatment from many regions of the world. GREENE: Characteristic signs and symptoms, he is saying. So what is the significance of the WHO's recognition of this here? KAMENETZ: So they have a list of criteria, and that includes - basically, it interferes with other important life activities - with sleep, with school, with relationships. And it's something where it's out of the person's control; they don't seem to be able to stop. And the significance of this move, of course, is the hope that more people will be able to access treatment, and that insurance companies will start to recognize it and that there'll be more awareness that although video games are harmless for most people, there are some people who may have problems. GREENE: So it makes it sound like the WHO is trying to be careful here and to use sort of traditional scientific research to decide whether or not this is officially a disorder. But the U.S. psychiatric community is not buying into this yet, so does that suggest there are a lot of questions to answer? KAMENETZ: Well, it's really controversial, David, because obviously, video games are very popular and a harmless pastime for most people. And the psychiatric profession the U.S. lists this as a condition for further study. So the question is, is this really a stand-alone disorder, or is it something that's part of something else? We don't want to create a moral panic here around the prospect of video game addiction for every single kid. GREENE: Did this come as a surprise - I mean, the WHO coming out and getting involved in classifying video gaming - or has this been sort of a conversation happening for a while now among parents and others? KAMENETZ: I think it's part of a bigger conversation about the ethics of technology use in general. GREENE: All right. NPR's Anya Kamenetz, who covers technology and questions like that. We appreciate it, Anya. Thanks a lot. KAMENETZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ORGONE'S \"CYDELINES\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump visits Pittsburgh to show support for victims of the synagogue shooting. How online narratives make their way into the mainstream. And, tracking the migrant caravan in Mexico.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Today the president and first lady visit Pittsburgh. DAVID GREENE, HOST: The Trumps are visiting days after a man opened fire inside a synagogue in the city, killing 11 and injuring six. On a day of funerals with emotions still raw, some, including the mayor of Pittsburgh, are asking, why this day? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL PEDUTO: I do believe that it would be best to put the attention on the families this week and, if he were to visit, choose a different time to be able to do it. GREENE: Mayor Bill Peduto, speaking to CNN. INSKEEP: NPR's Brakkton Booker is covering this story from Pittsburgh. Brakkton, good morning. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So we heard the mayor of Pittsburgh there. What are other people in the community saying about the president's visit? BOOKER: Well, Steve, it's really a mix. A lot of people simply just didn't want to talk about the president's visit. They say that politics didn't have a place here at this time. Now, one rabbi told me that he was busy urging his community to, quote, \"stand up for their beliefs,\" adding that he was telling people to be proud that they were Jewish. Some expressed fears of clashes between the president's supporters and those who oppose his visit. But the White House, they pushed back, saying that Trump is coming to express his support for the American people and grieve with the Pittsburgh community. INSKEEP: OK, so what exactly is it that people would want to hear from the president, given that mixed reaction? BOOKER: Well, truthfully, for some people, it really just doesn't matter what the president has to say at all. There are some people that are just going to really ignore everything that the president says. Now, there are some groups, like the progressive-leaning Bend the Arc. They wrote an open letter to Trump urging him not to come, saying, quote, \"President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.\" But not all felt that way. There is an executive director of the D.C.-based Republican Jewish Coalition. He told CNN that Trump's condemnation of anti-Semitism was, quote, \"very powerful and strong.\" And also, Steve, I attended community service at Carnegie Mellon University, not far from where the shooting took place in Squirrel Hill. I met a professor, Professor Joel Greenhouse, who was cautiously optimistic that the president could be a consoler in chief. Have a listen. JOEL GREENHOUSE: I don't feel as if he can actually contribute to the healing process. If he could, that would be really inspirational. And if that's not what will be the outcome, then it's probably better to leave us to our own devices to come together. And we're doing a pretty good job at it I think. BOOKER: So there you hear it. Then other people are just reserving judgment until the visit happens. INSKEEP: Well, there's a bit of a dilemma here - isn't there, Brakkton? - because a part of the president's job, traditionally, has been to console the nation in moments like this. It's something that past presidents have done that this president has been fairly explicit about not being interested in. He is interested in conflict. He's interested in driving divisions that work for him and work for his policies and work for his beliefs. And that's where he goes. BOOKER: Well, I think that's right. And we heard from the Pittsburgh mayor, Bill Peduto, in the clip you played. And he's a Democrat. And he's telling of - he's telling folks to - he's telling the president to not come until at least the burials have taken place. Now, the first funerals take place this morning, with brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal. They were both in their 50s and some of the youngest people that died. And later today, there's Jerry Rabinowitz. Now, other funerals go on throughout the week. And one woman I spoke to named Gerry Spann (ph) told me that of course, this is a - it is a politically charged moment. After all, the midterms are just a week away. And she told me - she tells me that she's not expecting much from the president's visit, but she is hoping that down the line there will be political change on the national level. GERRY SPANN: I want to find other ways to commit myself to change, both - both in terms of my volunteer commitments, since I'm retired, and in terms of changing our national leadership. INSKEEP: OK, one of the voices we've heard in Pittsburgh through NPR's Brakkton Booker. Brakkton, thanks so much, really appreciate it. BOOKER: Thanks, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: How do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed? GREENE: Well, this question carries new urgency after the events of recent days. One man allegedly sent multiple pipe bombs to political and media figures. And then another killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Both were involved in social media conversations that featured explicit, racist diatribes before they ventured into terrorism. INSKEEP: Well, how do conspiracy theories persist and spread? Will Sommer has spent a lot of time thinking about this. He reports on fringe right-wing media for The Daily Beast. Good morning, sir. WILL SOMMER: Good morning, thank you for having me. INSKEEP: Thanks for coming by. What's an example of how this works, the way that a conspiracy theory would start and go - go national, go big? SOMMER: Sure, absolutely. So really the most obvious example right now is the so-called caravan coming up from Honduras. We've seen the president send troops down to the border, basically to respond to essentially a fiction, in terms of the actual danger posed to the United States. This is something that bubbled up really on, you know, fringe YouTube videos, Twitter, Reddit threads. And now we see the president reacting to it. INSKEEP: Oh, wait a minute. You're saying that this - you can trace this back. And some time before the president became exercised about this, it was a big deal on various sites. SOMMER: Exactly. So there's been some analysis that looks at really the first mentions of this and the various, you know, sort of fake news essentially used to promote this. You know, people will take a picture of someone with boils. And then they'll say, oh, you know, this is someone in the caravan. And it's completely unrelated, but it kind of ramps up the hype about it. INSKEEP: And you end up with someone on Fox News, which I believe happened yesterday, saying, gosh, these people might be bringing any number of diseases. SOMMER: Right, leprosy or what have you, yes. INSKEEP: And the president of the United States talks about this. Has this happened a lot with the president? SOMMER: Absolutely. This is far from the first time. You know, I think the most obvious example is when the president claimed after the 2016 election that 3 million illegal votes were cast, costing him the popular vote. That was an idea he clearly got through various channels - from InfoWars. And he sort of used that to then create the presidential voter fraud commission. INSKEEP: What are some of the influential sites here? The word Gab, I think, is new to some people because the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting had been active making anti-Semitic remarks on Gab. What are some of the other ones that are key? SOMMER: Sure. So there's various - it's almost like a mirror world for all these various sites. So, you know, YouTube would obviously be the main video site. Well, if you're kicked off YouTube, you might go to a website called, like, BitChute or something. And so there's various versions of Facebook and Twitter and so on. INSKEEP: And they don't say, we're racist; we're here to be racist, right? SOMMER: Well, you know, it's interesting. Some of them do actively court the \"alt-right.\" Some of them have positioned themselves more as a broader free-speech platform. In the case of Gab, I think they definitely did a lot of outreach to the \"alt-right.\" And that was sort of part of their business model. INSKEEP: Are they are becoming more influential? SOMMER: You know, it's interesting. I think they're very prominent within their niche. I mean, these sites are still, like, fractions of a fraction of what a mainstream social media site would have. INSKEEP: And do they get directly to policy makers? Or is there some intermediate... SOMMER: Well, you know, we've seen the president's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, mention Gab before, say that he would join if they would fix some technical issues. So there are some links to the mainstream Republican Party. INSKEEP: Will Sommer, thanks for coming by, really appreciate it. SOMMER: Thanks for having me. INSKEEP: He reports for The Daily Beast. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: And let's get an update now on one of the news stories that can be driven by conspiracy theories. The U.S. will deploy more than 5,000 troops to the border with Mexico in an effort to stop a caravan of migrants, some of whom say they eventually want to reach asylum in the United States. GREENE: Last night, in an interview with Laura Ingraham, the president said there are, quote, \"a lot of bad people in the caravan.\" And he called it an invasion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thousands and thousands of people on the bridge. When you looked at that bridge loaded up with people, that's called an invasion of our country. GREENE: And in a tweet, President Trump said, quote, \"our military is waiting for you,\" end quote. Mexican authorities estimate that the caravan has about 3 to 5,000 travelers. INSKEEP: Let's check that out with freelance journalist David Agren, who's been traveling with the caravan. He's now back in Mexico City. He was with them just days ago. Welcome to the program. DAVID AGREN: Good morning. INSKEEP: First I want to get a sense of how far away this caravan is from the border. We're told that U.S. troops will be at the U.S.-Mexico border within days. Is the caravan within days of the United States? AGREN: No, not at all. It's still probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest U.S. port of entry. And also, many in the caravan are saying that their destination is Tijuana, which - obviously, across from San Diego. And that's quite a bit more distance. With any luck, they would make it to Mexico City probably around the first - the end of the first week of November. And that's still quite a ways to go. INSKEEP: And let's check the size of this because yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United States, who said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and that it had declined in size considerably. And he thought it was about 3,500 people. Do you have any way to estimate that yourself? AGREN: Nobody knows for sure. Obviously, the official number that was given at the time, last week, was 3,600 with - and just yesterday the interior minister said about 1,895 people had applied for asylum. Another 500 had asked to go home voluntarily. Mayors along the route had put the number at closer to 6,000. That was just based - because - on the number of people that they were serving because they're obviously providing a lot of food and obviously assistance for the migrants. So nobody knows for sure. But it would probably be higher than that. INSKEEP: OK. So it may be higher than 3,500, according to the best information that you have. I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United States as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course? AGREN: Well, the migrants themselves had a nightly - they tend to have a nightly assembly, where they - when they arrive in a village, what they'll do is they'll set up camp. And they'll be in the town square. And they will have an assembly in which they will vote on proposals, usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning, what route they will take. And the proposal was read to them. And they voted to not accept it. I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United States. So that was - so most of them will do their best to get to the United States. INSKEEP: OK. So some of them - some of them are coming to the border, could be here, could be in the Unites States eventually. AGREN: Eventually, yes. I mean, there's no - nobody's really sure how quickly they'll get to - they'll get there. They're probably - they're moving about 40 miles a day, some days more, some days less. But that's still putting them probably late November at the earliest that they would get to the border at Tijuana. INSKEEP: OK, David Agren, reporter who's been traveling with the caravan. Thanks so much. AGREN: Oh, you're very welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF SIGNAL HILL'S, \"A SECRET SOCIETY\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR has learned a Russian politician's links to NRA leaders are deeper than previously known. President Trump baffled the GOP with calls for stricter gun-control, but then signaled a potential shift.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: NPR has some new details this morning about a Kremlin-linked Russian politician and his ties to the National Rifle Association. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: His name is Aleksandr Torshin. He serves as a deputy governor of the Bank of Russia. Unnoticed by people in the West until very recently, he documented for years how he cultivated relationships with NRA leaders. He says those relationships got him political access, and he says he even managed to meet the future president, Donald Trump, in 2015. GREENE: All right. This is exclusive reporting from NPR's political reporter Tim Mak, who joins us. And, Tim, who is this guy? TIM MAK, BYLINE: So Aleksandr Torshin is a former Russian senator. He serves as a deputy governor to the Bank of Russia. He's known as a longtime Putin ally. He served in the Duma in Russia, and he spent time on Russia's National Anti-terrorism Committee. That's a really powerful state body. It includes the director of the SSB. It includes the minister of defense and the minister of foreign affairs. GREENE: Wow. He has ties all over Russian government institutions. It's amazing. MAK: Absolutely, and for quite some time. Now, on the other hand, he's also a paid lifetime member of the NRA, which I previously reported. And over six years, he's developed ties with leaders of the NRA. He's used these connections to get deeper into American politics. And we can see these efforts actually documented in real time. These efforts are hiding in plain sight amongst 150,000 tweets that he had written in Russian. GREENE: What exactly is hiding? I mean, what is he documenting? What did he do? MAK: Well, it's really interesting. So he documented going to every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016. We hadn't known that he was going every single year, and it's very unusual for a Russian official to be coming to the United States so frequently to do this. He met during this time with four presidents of the NRA - in fact, every president of the NRA who has been there since he started attending in 2012. He appears to have developed a pretty close relationship with David Keene, who was the former NRA president around 2012, 2013. And he was the former president of the American Conservative Union. Torshin also says he met with Donald Trump through the NRA at their convention in 2015. The White House has previously denied this, but they didn't respond to NPR's request on this particular story. GREENE: OK, so a possible meeting with Donald Trump just before - I mean, if I do the math here, Trump was a presidential candidate in - I mean, back in - this is 2015 you're talking about. But - so is this guy just really interested in American politics? MAK: It extends beyond, you know, 2015, 2016 and that time period. In 2012, he visited the United States. This is Torshin. He visited the United States, and he was an international observer during the 2012 election. So the United States sends observers to foreign countries to watch their elections. GREENE: Sure. MAK: And it happens on occasion that foreign observers come to the United States, though probably typically not top Russian officials. In 2012, he traveled to Tennessee to watch balloting for the election when President Obama was facing Mitt Romney. And he writes in one tweet that he was able to leverage his NRA membership to help get him that status. GREENE: This is amazing. I mean, is there anything illegal about what he is doing? And does this fit somehow into the whole wider Russian effort to influence elections here? MAK: You know, it's a question that investigators have tried to answer. McClatchy reported last month that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, which is quite the allegation. And members of both the Senate and House intelligence committees have said they want to see whether or not they can answer this question. But it's inconclusive at this point. INSKEEP: This is all happening in a context where there is a branch of the conservative movement that has been sympathetic to Russia for years. It has seen Vladimir Putin as a strong leader at offending - or defender of Christians or even of white Christianity. And one of the tweets that Tim reveals that he wrote in Russian - this man wrote that he never heard one bad word about Russia in all his trips to the NRA. GREENE: This is interesting stuff. Tim Mak, thanks for the reporting. We appreciate it. MAK: Thank you. GREENE: And let's keep talking about the NRA because a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association is suggesting now that President Trump does not favor the gun measures that he said he did favor. INSKEEP: Yeah. Here are just two data points from a chaotic week - on Wednesday, the president held a televised meeting with lawmakers and appeared to endorse gun legislation, including measures that the NRA opposes. He accused fellow Republicans of being afraid of the NRA. And then Chris Cox, the top NRA lobbyist, dropped by the Oval Office. Cox came out saying the president does not support gun control, and the president himself wrote on Twitter that he had a, quote, \"good, great meeting with the NRA\" - unquote. GREENE: All right. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here. Tam, do we have any idea exactly where the president of the United States stands on guns right now? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: I certainly wouldn't want to go out on that limb and try to say where he stands. What we know is the last person he met with late last night, Chris Cox from the NRA, tweeted that he had a great meeting with the president and the vice president. He says we all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS and VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control. The support strong due process is an important thing to note because just on Wednesday in that televised meeting, President Trump seemed to be arguing for not going through due process, saying, quote, \"take the guns first go through due process second,\" in the case of people who are potentially a danger to themselves or others. GREENE: So this is all very confusing, including for the president's own party. Republicans don't seem to know where he stands. I just want to play a little bit here of Republican Senator John Thune describing a televised meeting with the president where Trump was sitting beside - seeming to side with Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN THUNE: You guys saw - you saw it, right? It was - it was wild. GREENE: I mean, even he thought this meeting was wild, a Republican senator. But I guess it's - he's laughing there not so funny because Republicans need in a very sensitive moment to try and see if there is some gun measures that they can sort of get behind without the clear guidance of the president. KEITH: Yeah (laughter). Another Republican congressman described it as a doozy of a meeting. And here's the thing - without - after that meeting, senators came back up to Capitol Hill and were asked by reporters where does the president stand. No one could say. And without pressure from the president, they don't really have a path forward. So yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the Senate was going to move on to a banking bill and not vote on legislation that it, for a while, had seemed to have, you know, bipartisan support and a decent path to passage. It was very narrow legislation to improve the background check system, making sure that records get in there. GREENE: All right. Well, the president himself moved on to a different topic as well yesterday. He makes this big trade announcement. He's meeting with business leaders and, without a whole lot of warning, he announces tariffs on steel and aluminum. But, Tam, this could have a big impact on U.S. trade policy and maybe a lot more, right? KEITH: Well, the - and the markets were a little bit concerned about it after it happened. But it's not clear. There aren't a lot of details. This seems to have been a case where the White House wasn't prepared to make an announcement. They don't have documents or fact sheets or anything ready for the president to sign. The president just called the press in and said 25 percent for steel, 10 percent for aluminum. INSKEEP: Awful lot of plot twists in the reality program this week. KEITH: (Laughter) Indeed. GREENE: NPR's Tamara Keith hosts NPR's Politics podcast. Tam, thanks. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, in Italy, today marks the end of a really nasty election campaign. INSKEEP: On one side, populist and right-wing parties have been gaining momentum, and on the other side is a center-left party that's held power in recent years. The results of Sunday's vote could have major repercussions for the European Union. GREENE: And NPR's Sylvia Poggioli joins us on the line from Rome. And, Sylvia, for those of us watching from outside Italy, I think the big story seems to be the return of Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister who you really knew well covering. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: (Laughter) Indeed. GREENE: Is he making a comeback? POGGIOLI: Well, indeed, after turning the country into the butt of jokes with his sex scandals and court trials. He was forced to step down as prime minister in 2011 over a serious economic crisis. He was expelled from Parliament two years later over a tax fraud conviction. But since, you know, he more or less owns his party, he never really left the political stage. He can't run because of his conviction. So he's acting like kingmaker. And at a very well-preserved 81 years of age, he's appearing constantly on TV, promising the same things he promised years ago but never delivered - lower taxes, more jobs, higher pensions. His one real achievement is cobbling together a coalition of right-wing parties that, according to the last polls, is in first place. The coalition just three points below the 40 percent needed to form a majority. GREENE: OK. So he's aligning himself with some of these right-wing parties that are seen as anti-immigrant. That's where he is today. POGGIOLI: Absolutely. They are two very populist parties, the League and the smaller Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots. The League leader, Matteo Salvini, has dominated the campaign. Many analysts blame him for escalating xenophobia and nationalism. He's really strident in promoting Italians first. He promises to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants, and he's virulently opposed to fiscal policies imposed on Italy by the European Union. And that has officials in Brussels very worried. GREENE: So what are the possible scenarios of this election? What should we be watching for in terms of implications? POGGIOLI: Well, most analysts predict no clear winner and a hung Parliament. If so, there could be weeks of negotiations between the parties, resulting possibly in a grand left-right coalition, but that could also lead to a political paralysis and yet more muddling through. And that's a process Italian politicians have long mastered. GREENE: All right. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reporting from Rome. Thanks so much, Sylvia. POGGIOLI: Thank you.

            "article_content": "President Trump has blasted establishment politicians as he travels through Europe. In the \"Barbershop,\" Michel Martin asks NPR correspondents if his populist messaging is affecting European politics.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump golfed at his resort in Scotland today, taking a break before his big meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. But this bit of quiet comes after President Trump dropped verbal bombshells on U.S. allies this past week. At a face-to-face breakfast meeting, he lashed out at Germany for its energy imports from Russia. Then the British tabloid The Sun published an explosive interview with President Trump that took several shots at his host, Prime Minister Theresa May, criticizing her approach to negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union, or the Brexit, even suggesting that a rival of hers would make a good prime minister. And he blasted Europe's immigration policy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I think you're losing your culture. MARTIN: Now, we know how all this is playing out in the U.S. Social media has gone wild. Top Democrats called the president's conduct overseas an embarrassment. But we wondered how this is being received overseas, so we've called several NPR foreign correspondents. NPR's Frank Langfitt is in London. Frank, hello. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Good afternoon. MARTIN: Martin Kaste is in Berlin. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Good evening. MARTIN: And Sylvia Poggioli is in Rome. Hi, Sylvia. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: So I'm going to start with Frank because President Trump is still in Britain, and Britain is still reacting to Trump's visit. Frank, you just went to two very different rallies. There was an anti-Trump rally yesterday. I think a lot of people have seen the pictures from that and heard your reports from that. Today, though, there was a rally of a far-right group, and I was wondering what these two rallies tell us about what's going on in England right now and how they view the U.S. president. LANGFITT: Well, it's really interesting because yesterday was tens of thousands. And I - it's hard to know exactly how many who came out. And it was a wide range of groups. You had Marxists, socialists, labor unions and sort of multicultural London coming out against President Trump. And then, today, you had a far, far smaller mix of a pro-Trump rally and also a far-right group that was protesting the jailing of a far-right activist named Tommy Robinson. And what was very interesting, I found, is that the rally on Friday was sort of all over the place in terms of messages. The rally today - much, much smaller - was very focused on exactly what President Trump was talking about - this concept of culture. And what they're really talking about, I think, is really here - white English culture. And the message seemed to resonate. I was talking with a guy named Hassan Yilmaz (ph), which is pretty interesting - an Englishman of Turkish descent. And he said Trump's mantra of America first should really try to apply here. And here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HASSAN YILMIZ: His message is, first, look after the people at home. If you can't look after home, and your home's in pieces, well, how are you going to build a foundation on that? MARTIN: You know, one of the things I was wondering, Frank - and I'm going to ask the others this as well - is, is there a Trump effect? Does President Trump's presence encourage the strains that you're talking about - this anti-immigrant strain, this - what some consider a white nationalist strain - or does it have the reverse effect, which causes people to kind of rally around Theresa May or rally around the other side? Because, as you said, there was such a collection of people who came out against him. Does it, in a way, have an opposite effect? LANGFITT: I think it has the same effect, in some ways, that it does have in America, and that is a polarizing effect. The people who agree with him do feel emboldened, and they also like to hear a very powerful man speaking their language. MARTIN: And, along the same lines, let's go to Martin now, where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is another leader who's struggling to hold her government together. And President Trump publicly attacked her - at least, he attacked Germany - at NATO last week, and it seemed to come out of nowhere. And the same question to you, Martin - is there a Trump effect? KASTE: Well, I think if the question is, you know, does Trump's bombshells somehow shore up Angela Merkel and her ruling coalition, I don't think it does. I think it might actually have the opposite effect. And it sort of leaves her without anywhere to go. And let me explain this. I mean, you have to keep in mind the history of Germany. American presidents since World War II always sort of invited Germany to be part of something international - an international project. It was sort of a way out of the - what had become for them this dead end of nationalism, you know. And that gave conservative parties the ability to sort of have a substitute for nationalism. You know, they said, we are part of this big, international project of initially anti-communism but eventually kind of internationalism - the EU, NATO. That is where Germany's pride is, right? Well, now, all of a sudden, there is this sense that maybe that's wobbly. If the American president now is saying, eh, it's every country for itself, well, that leaves her with kind of nowhere to go. There's no backstop to this rising tide of nationalism which we're seeing here in Germany, too. You know, the most important opposition party now is the Alternative fur Deutschland - this, you know, far-right group that talks a lot about making the borders mean something, about protecting the culture - that kind of thing. You know, if she can't counter with we're part of this international project, she's kind of stuck. MARTIN: You know, the number of migrants entering Germany is way down from 2015, as we understand it, when the chancellor agreed to let in hundreds of thousands of people seeking asylum. So why is migration still such an issue? KASTE: Yes, the number of migrants has tapered off. They're still coming, but it's much, much lower. But all the million or so people who came during that big surge are still here, in the main. There's a sense among some in the German public that assimilation doesn't look like it's going to happen very easily and that it was a mistake. They're here and now what? MARTIN: So let's bring Sylvia Poggioli in. She's in Italy, where Donald Trump seems to like the government. He tweeted that Italy's new prime minister is, quote, \"a really great guy\" and, quote, \"the people of Italy got it right.\" So, Sylvia, tell us about the new Italian government, and what is it that Donald Trump seems to like so much? POGGIOLI: Well, it's interesting that he chose the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who really is a kind of a cipher. Nobody - he came out of nowhere. The person who's really been totally dominating the scene is Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and the leader of the league. And he's ordered all NGO rescue ships banned from bringing migrants to Italian ports. He ordered out of the blue the idea that there should be a census, a registry of Roma people, which also had echoes of Mussolini's fascist laws against Jews in 1938. The migration issue is dominant. And yet, as you mentioned, the number of migrants arriving has dropped tremendously. There's been something like an 80 percent drop this year over the same period last year. So it's - a lot of it is rhetoric, and the fact is that Salvini is gaining popularity in the polls. MARTIN: So, Sylvia, let me ask you this question - others can jump in if they want to - is that, unlike the United States - I mean, the United States, the big conversation right now is about the southern border. But, in Europe, if you push migrants from one place, they go to another place in Europe. And I'm just wondering, how are people thinking about this? Or are they just not thinking about it? They're really only thinking in - sort of in terms of their own national borders? POGGIOLI: Well, no. Certainly, Salvini - he's been insisting that the EU has to consider Italy's border as the southern border of Europe. And he's not wrong in that because Italy has definitely taken the brunt of this huge, massive migration flow over the last few years. And this was one of the reasons the populists did so well in the elections in March - because there's huge resentment against Brussels, the EU for having left Italy alone - on the one hand, on the migrant issue, on the other, in strict austerity rules, which have really prevented the economy from picking up. So the resentment towards Brussels and the EU is very strong. MARTIN: So let me go back to Frank. In the U.S., when President Trump's behavior is discussed, some people say, well, he may be crude in his utterances, but, at the end of the day, he gets results, you know. And then other people say, well, yeah, but he's exacerbating social divisions that are ultimately going to be very destructive. For example, his poll numbers among women are very poor. So I wanted to ask because gender issues have been raised in the case of both national leaders of England and Germany, who are both women, and some people say, is part of the problem here that he has a problem dealing with strong women? Or is it that this is just his style, and, at the end of the day, U.S. relations with these countries are going to end up in a place that's mutually beneficial because, at the end of the day, the substance is what matters? Frank? LANGFITT: Yeah. I actually feel like you can find positions here that match those you'd find in the United States. So he criticized and basically told Prime Minister May how she should handle Brexit. I think people felt there was a bit of mansplaining (laughter) in there. And then he showed up late for the queen of England and walked in front of her, kind of eclipsed her. And, whether she's the queen or not, she's also a 92-year-old woman (laughter), and maybe you should have shown more respect. That was certainly a feeling here. On the other hand, you'll talk to people who are supporters of him - and they're a smaller number - who actually would say, I don't care about everything else. He has done what he promised to do, and he's worked on the issue that I care the most about. MARTIN: That's Frank Langfitt in London, Martin Kaste in Berlin and Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. Thank you all so much for talking with us. KASTE: A pleasure. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Michel. POGGIOLI: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He has since disavowed the white supremacist movement and works to help others disengage from it too. Christian Picciolini was 14 years old when he attended the first gathering of what would become the Hammerskin Nation, a violent, white-power skinhead group. Looking back, he describes his introduction to the group as receiving a \"lifeline of acceptance.\" \"I felt a sort of energy flow through me that I had never felt before \u2014 as if I was a part of something greater than myself,\" he says. Picciolini embraced the white supremacist message he heard that day and went on to front a white-power punk band, White American Youth, writing and performing songs that inspired others to commit racist acts of violence. But after eight years as a neo-Nazi, Picciolini began to question the hateful ideology he espoused. He remembers a specific incident in which he was beating a young black man. His eyes locked with his victim, and he felt a surprising empathy. It was a turning point. He withdrew from the movement and in 2011 co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit that counsels members of hate groups and helps them disengage. \"Over the last 14 years I have actually helped over 100 people disengage from the same movement that I was a part of,\" he says. \"[Neo-Nazis] know that I'm a danger to them because I understand what they understand \u2014 but I also understand the truth.\" Picciolini's new memoir is called White American Youth. On how he was recruited into believing the white supremacist ideology My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement-And How I Got Out by Christian Picciolini Paperback, 275 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? It started out with Clark [Martell, the former leader of Chicago Area Skinheads] and several of the older skinheads in this group appealing to my sense of pride, of being European, of being Italian. And then it would move on to instilling fear that I would lose that pride and that somebody would take that away from me if I wasn't careful. Then it went on to name specific groups through conspiracy theories that were bent on taking that pride or that privilege away from me. So it was the fear rhetoric. ... I can tell you that every single person that I recruited or that was recruited around the same time that I did, up to now, up to what we're seeing today, is recruited through vulnerabilities and not through ideology. On the role white power music plays in the movement I had already been a part of the punk-rock subculture, so I was already searching for something to express my anger. And when I heard Skrewdriver [a white supremacist rock band] and when I heard this music that was coming over from England at the time, it allowed me to be angry, because the lyrics gave me license to do that. I very effectively then used lyrics myself when I started one of America's first white-power bands to both recruit young people, encourage them into acts of violence and speak to the vulnerabilities and the grievances they were feeling so that I could draw them in with promises of paradise even through my lyrics. On his band, White American Youth (W.A.Y.), and the way music was and still is used as propaganda It brings back a lot of shame, because I know that I put words out into the world that still today are affecting people and hurting people. I learned just a few months ago that Dylann Roof had heard one of my songs a few months before he committed the tragedy in Charleston and he was on a white supremacist Web forum asking who the band was, and somebody had shown me that post just recently and I read through the lyrics and it didn't dawn on me instantly that those were my lyrics. But when I finished, I felt sick. Music was the vehicle for propaganda. It was the incitement to encourage people to commit acts of violence and it was a social movement. ... Still today, I believe that music is a very powerful tool that the movement uses to inspire vulnerable young people into a very hateful social movement. On how the white supremacists of the '80s and '90s strategized to make their movement more mainstream I do think that there were a lot of concerted strategies in the '80s and '90s that we're seeing take hold today. We recognized in the mid-'80s that our edginess, our look, even our language, was turning away the average American white racist \u2014 people we wanted to recruit. So we decided then to grow our hair out, to stop getting tattoos that would identify us, to trade in our boots for suits and to go to college campuses and recruit there and enroll, to get jobs in law enforcement, to go to the military and get training and to even run for office. And here we are, 30 years later, and we're using terms like \"white nationalist\" and \"alt-right\" \u2014 terms that [the white supremacists] came up with, by the way. They sat around and said, \"How can we identify ourselves to make us seem less hateful?\" ... Here we are in 2018 and we have a lot of hallmarks coming from political figures, the administration and policies that are very similar to what we espoused 30 years ago. ... It is a white supremacist culture that is being pushed. Christian Picciolini Here we are in 2018 and we have a lot of hallmarks coming from political figures, the administration and policies that are very similar to what we espoused 30 years ago. The language may be a little bit more palatable. Dog whistles may be used, but it is still the same underlying theme. It is a white supremacist culture that is being pushed. On how music led him out of the neo-Nazi movement What it came down to was receiving compassion from the people that I least deserved it [from], when I least deserved it. Just before I left the movement, I opened a record store to sell white-power music that I was importing from all over the world. In fact, I was one of the only stores in the United States that was selling this music. And I also knew that to stay in the community and get their support I would have to sell other music. So I started to sell punk-rock music and heavy metal and hip-hop and when the customers came in to buy that music, who were often African-American, or Jewish, or gay, at first I was very standoffish, but they kept coming back. The community, even though it's Chicago, everybody knew what I was doing, everybody knew how hateful I was and how violent I was, but these customers came in despite that. And over time I started to have meaningful interactions with them, for the first time in my life. In fact, I had never in my life engaged in a meaningful dialogue with the people that I thought I hated, and it was these folks who showed me empathy when I least deserved it, and they were the ones that I least deserved it from. I started to recognize that I had more in common with them than the people I had surrounded myself for eight years with \u2014 that these people, that I thought I hated, took it upon themselves to see something inside of me that I didn't even see myself, and it was because of that connection that I was able to humanize them and that destroyed the demonization and the prejudice that was happening inside of me. Music brought me in, but in many ways it also brought me out. Amy Salit and Seth Kelley produced and edited the audio of this interview. Bridget Bentz and Molly Seavy-Nesper adapted it for the Web.",

Reagan's political career and the Republican Party of the 1970s and '80s were long associated with Orange County, but the party was swept out of power there in this year's midterm elections. Richard Nixon was born and raised in Orange County, Calif. Ronald Reagan got his political fuel from there. In a state increasingly dominated by coastal liberals, Orange County was a conservative bastion with an ocean view. Even as Democrats came to dominate California politics, Orange County clung on as a Republican stronghold. \"Orange County was different,\" said Rob Stutzman, a Republican political consultant based in Sacramento. \"It was, as we called it, 'the orange curtain' and it has now fallen.\" Though the election results have been slow to trickle in, Democrats will now control all of the seven House seats that include Orange County. Loading... \"It's definitely a sobering wake-up call a couple of weeks after the election,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, Republican national committeewoman from California. \"Psychologically it's been challenging for us.\" Reflecting on this shift, Lou Cannon, the longtime documentor of California politics and Reagan, in particular, recalled what a state senator from Orange County told him in the 1960s. \"He said he joined the John Birch Society because he wanted to get the middle-of-the-road vote in Orange County,\" Cannon said, referencing the anti-communist ultraconservative group that had a large presence in Orange County at the time. Supporters of Democrat Harley Rouda celebrate as they watch the returns on election night. Rouda was one of four Democrats who unseated Republican House members in Orange County, Calif., signaling a political shift in the once conservative area.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Democrat Harley Rouda celebrate as they watch the returns on election night. Rouda was one of four Democrats who unseated Republican House members in Orange County, Calif., signaling a political shift in the once conservative area. It was a joke, but it came from a place of truth. Driven by white flight from Los Angeles to the north, Orange County was transformed from orchards and grazing land into affluent suburbs. Its conservative voters helped shape the Reagan-era GOP and fund its campaigns in California and the nation. Shifting ground The demographics in Orange County had been shifting for some time, growing less uniformly conservative and more diverse, in part because of rising Asian and Latino populations. Then in 2016, Orange County broke for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the presidential race \u2014 the first time the county's voters had backed a Democrat for president since the Great Depression. But still, the largely Republican congressional delegation held on. Seeing the demographic and political writing on the wall, Republican Reps. Darrell Issa and Ed Royce retired. They will be replaced by Democrats Mike Levin and Gil Cisneros. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher hung on to fight, but his cozy attitudes toward Russia made him an easy target for Democrats and he was defeated by Harley Rouda. And in a surprise to many Republicans Rep. Mimi Walters lost to law professor Katie Porter. U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher talks to reporters on election night in Costa Mesa, Calif. After days of ballot counting, Democratic challenger Rouda was declared the winner, ending Rohrbacher's nearly three decades-long career in Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    David McNew/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher talks to reporters on election night in Costa Mesa, Calif. After days of ballot counting, Democratic challenger Rouda was declared the winner, ending Rohrbacher's nearly three decades-long career in Congress. It was a wipeout. But how did it happen? The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to get Democrats elected to Congress, was on the ground early in Orange County, recruiting candidates, registering voters, building an infrastructure to get out the vote. Republicans are quick to point out that in the closing days, billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who may also run for president in 2020 as a Democrat) dropped millions of dollars of ads into a couple of the Orange County races. Democrats may have gotten in the right spot and paddled hard to catch it, but there was already a wave forming. In an election where college-educated suburbanites, especially women, turned their backs on Republicans, Orange County represents a stark example of the national trend. As the Republican Party has become the party of Trump, it has at least for now lost some traditional Republicans. Dhillon says the rap on Orange County today is that it is more country club (or yacht club) establishment Republicans and not the grassroots, new wave of Republicans and some Democrats who got Trump elected. The California GOP ponders the future \"What I see is not a permanent shift blue, but definitely a shellacking that requires us to really re-evaluate a lot of our strategies as Republicans in terms of the candidates we run, the strategies we employ to turn out the vote, the fundraising tactics that we need to use,\" Dhillon said. \"I think all of these things merit re-examination in the wake of this election.\" California Republicans are now arguing among themselves whether to blame Trump and his anti-immigrant rhetoric at the end of the campaign, or to look inward. Come January, there will be only eight Republicans in California's 53-member congressional delegation, with the GOP members mostly representing more sparsely populated inland areas of the state. Democrats will also hold every statewide elected office and supermajorities in the state Legislature and state Senate. \"The division in California is no longer North and South,\" said Cannon. \"It's East and West.\" Or as he calls it, \"the leftward shift of California.\" Republicans have essentially given up on the state, he argues. They are no doubt beleaguered. And many trace the beginning of the decline back to 1994 when then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, was running for re-election and endorsed a ballot measure, Proposition 187, to deny government services to immigrants in the state illegally. \"They keep coming. Two million illegal immigrants in California,\" said one Wilson campaign ad, with ominous music and video of migrants running across the border. \"The federal government won't stop them at the border.\" Wilson won re-election. The ballot measure passed, but ultimately got tied up in legal challenges. But the Republican Party in California has been in a slow decline ever since (it is now outnumbered by no party preference voters). And 25 years later, that ad with its negative depiction of Hispanic immigrants is part of California's political DNA. \"It's seared into the political culture of California,\" said Stutzman, the political consultant. \"We're now a Latino plurality state and that ad continues to linger\" even though few voters under the age of 40 remember seeing it on TV. No one wants to give that ad and the initiative it promoted too much credit or too much blame, but as Dhillon put it, \"It's a hurdle we have to overcome.\" For those who remembered the Wilson ad, the Trump campaign ad calling the caravan of migrants an \"invasion\" was familiar. \"It's hard to expand your base, which is what you have to do in California suburbs if you are the Republican Party\" with messaging like that, said Stutzman. \"It really hung Republicans out to dry in a place like Orange County.\" Stutzman, who is no fan of the president's, says Trump accelerated what had already been a significant decline of the Republican Party in California. \"We started digging the hole a lot faster once Trump became president, frankly once he was on the ballot in 2016,\" said Stutzman. \"The Republican brand has become even less popular than ever here over the last two years.\" Stutzman, who still identifies as a Republican, said the GOP's brand in California is toxic. But Dhillon, the RNC member from California, thinks it's a cop-out just to blame Trump. She says that Republicans need to run better candidates, younger candidates, more diverse candidates who look like the electorate. And the electorate doesn't look like the Orange County of the 1960s anymore. But all is not lost, insists a GOP operative who worked to get Republicans elected in 2018 and declined to go on the record so he could speak more freely. With a different candidate, the Rohrabacher seat wouldn't have been lost, he argues. \"It suddenly becomes one of the best Republican pickup opportunities in the country,\" he said, adding that in Orange County, Democrats \"are going to have to compete like hell\" to keep all those seats in their column.",

Churches and shelters are standing by to help.\n                \n                    \n                    Mallory Falk/KRWG\n                    \n                \nhide caption Families eat dinner at Holy Family Church in El Paso. Immigration officials have been releasing hundreds of asylum-seeking migrants into border communities. Churches and shelters are standing by to help. Earlier this week President Trump said his administration is no longer releasing migrants from custody. \"We're going to catch,\" he said. \"We're not going to release.\" But that's not what's happening along the southwest border. Although overall apprehension numbers were down a bit last year, the number of migrant families apprehended there by immigration agents is reaching record numbers. The influx is straining capacity at immigration holding cells and detention facilities. so, starting a few weeks ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement began releasing hundreds of families from custody. The sudden releases are  putting an enormous strain on nonprofits and communities along the border. In the past, in some border communities \u2014 like El Paso, Texas \u2014 ICE either helped families arrange transportation to sponsors around the U.S. before they released them, or released families directly to local shelters and churches. If those shelters didn't have enough space, some families remained in custody until there was room. Now ICE is no longer helping families with travel plans and is releasing them from custody regardless of whether shelters can accommodate them. Advocates worry that means some families may simply end up on the street, and are scrambling to find more housing and volunteers. Outside El Paso, at the Holy Cross Retreat Center in Mesilla Park, N.M., volunteers recently lined up to greet a bus of migrant families being dropped off by ICE. About 20 parents and children stepped off the bus. A volunteer named Orlando Carrillo Jim\u00e9nez ushered them into the retreat center. Jim\u00e9nez has a big personality and booming voice \u2014 he's a mariachi singer \u2014 and he cracks jokes to put the group at ease. He first welcomed them to the United States and apologized for what they had gone through with immigration officials. Then he explained what was about to happen. First, they would eat dinner \u2014 a hot, homemade meal. Next, they would receive medical evaluations. These families just completed long, sometimes treacherous journeys; adults and children alike may need medical attention. After that, volunteers would help them make travel arrangements so they could get to their final destinations, usually with relatives in other parts of the country. Finally, the guests, as Jim\u00e9nez calls them, could settle into their rooms. Jim\u00e9nez has this down to a science. He has done this nearly every week for the past two years, when Holy Cross started taking in migrant families. \"All these people are requesting asylum at the border,\" explained Father Tom Smith, the director of the Holy Cross Retreat Center. \"They are seeking asylum because of the danger or the extreme poverty or whatever it is that they're dealing with in their own country.  I just think it's important that we recognize that we are called to welcome the stranger.\" The families typically stay for one or two nights before taking a bus or catching a flight to join their sponsors. Holy Cross is part of a larger network of churches in El Paso and southern New Mexico that briefly house immigrants who have been released from custody. Annunciation House, an immigrant shelter in El Paso, coordinates with ICE and these so-called hospitality centers, to ensure that families have a place to stay. The recent releases, however, have at times come with no coordination at all between ICE and the shelters for migrants. Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia welcomes migrant families to Holy Family Church, which agreed to take them in for the night after they were dropped off at a Greyhound Station.\n                \n                    \n                    Mallory Falk/KRWG\n                    \n                \nhide caption Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia welcomes migrant families to Holy Family Church, which agreed to take them in for the night after they were dropped off at a Greyhound Station. Last weekend, ICE  dropped about 100 immigrants at a Greyhound station in downtown El Paso with no advance notice. Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia got word of the imminent release and hurried over to meet the migrants. He quickly arranged for a nearby church to house the families and walked them there himself. Now Garcia is meeting with local officials to find more hospitality venues and volunteers. Annunciation House is renting out 70 motel rooms in El Paso to help house families. The Catholic Diocese of El Paso set up an emergency shelter, with dozens of cots. State Senator Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez represents El Paso. \"I think it's unconscionable,\" he says. \"Now they're just simply dumping them here in the border communities like El Paso and expecting the community to provide the support services.\" In a statement, ICE Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Rodriguez said, \"family units continue to cross the border at high volumes, as they face no consequence for their actions.\"  She explained, because of legal limits on how long the agency can hold families, it no longer has the capacity to review and help with travel plans. But Senator Rodr\u00edguez thinks this is all a political ploy, to create a sense of chaos on the border right before the midterm elections. At the Holy Cross Retreat Center, where 20 immigrants had just arrived, the scene was controlled chaos. Volunteer Orlando Jim\u00e9nez tried to figure out how to get a Guatemalan father and child to their sponsor in South Carolina. He called up the sponsor on a cell phone and a bus company on a landline, all while looking up airfares and tossing the father pumpkin candies for his kid. Jim\u00e9nez took a moment to reflect. \"This is not fake news, quote unquote,\" he said, his voice starting to crack. \"And that's the only political statement I'm gonna make, is that this is not fake news. This is real. These are real peoples' lives. These are not numbers. This is not a caravan. These are actual, real people that need our help.\"",

Updated at 4:55 p.m. ET Congressional Republicans keep trying to downplay the possibility of a government shutdown this fall, just weeks ahead of midterm elections, even as President Trump returns again and again to that very scenario. \"I don't care what the political ramifications are,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday, \"our immigration and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown ...\" I don\u2019t care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown... Trump has repeatedly said this week that he would force the government to shut down if Democrats do not agree to significant increases in border spending, including money to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, along with changes to the legal immigration system. He renewed the threat Wednesday in an interview with conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh. Trump said a shutdown could happen before or after the election in November--whatever it takes to get funding for the border wall. \"The shutdown could also take place after the election,\" Trump said. \"I happen to think it's a great political thing, because people want border security.\" But Republicans on Capitol Hill fear that a government shutdown weeks before Election Day could cost them dearly with voters in what's already expected to be a rough midterm for the governing party, a view the White House rejects. \"There's much more at stake here than political fallout. This is about protecting a country and protecting a nation,\" said deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley to reporters aboard Air Force One as Trump traveled to Florida. Trump's threats intrude on what congressional Democrats and Republicans say have been uncharacteristically positive negotiations over the annual spending bills. The Senate has passed seven of the 12 regular appropriations bills so far this year. The tally includes a four bills that were passed in a single passage Wednesday in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 92-6. I would be willing to \u201cshut down\u201d government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country! Trump's aggressive comments highlight a continuing disconnect over policy between Trump and the congressional GOP. In recent months, they have clashed over tariffs, Russian interference in U.S. elections, North Korea and now spending. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters Tuesday that the parties are working together to pass spending bills ahead of a fiscal-year-end deadline on Sept. 30. If successful, it would be the first time the two sides reached a peaceful spending solution ahead of that deadline since Trump took office. \"Most Republicans, including myself, agree that we ought to fund the wall and we're going to try to achieve that in the course of a regular order process,\" McConnell said. \"It's all unfolding before you, and hope we don't get to that position at the end of the fiscal year.\" It is highly unlikely that Congress can pass funding for Trump's wall as part of that regular process. Democrats have vowed to block any new wall funding in the Senate, where Republicans don't have enough votes to pass a spending bill on their own. Republican leaders acknowledge that reality and are working closely with Democrats to pass spending bills quickly to avoid a confrontation with Trump ahead of the November midterm elections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that he believes Republicans are negotiating in good faith over spending. \"Leader McConnell and I have had almost daily conversations about the appropriations bill and we're making very good progress,\" Schumer said. \"The fly in the ointment here, of course, is the president, who keeps brandishing the floor and threatening.\" Schumer said he hopes Trump will stay out of the talks and leave it to Congress to do their constitutional job of funding the government. \"Whenever he gets involved he seems to mess it up,\" Schumer said. Most Republicans say they take Trump's threat seriously but are working to persuade him to change his mind. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., one of McConnell's top deputies, told reporters he expects Trump's own advisers are doing the same. \"Certainly, 30 days before an election, having the prospect of a government shutdown out there is not something I certainly would look forward to have happening,\" Thune said. \"I think he speaks his mind and this is, I suppose you would say, the current state of his thinking.\" President Trump has privately agreed to put off a potential shutdown or any fight over border wall funding until after midterm elections https://t.co/2IJeNGHslR via @WSJ Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, used Trump's own favored medium, Twitter to push back, writing, \"President Trump has privately agreed to put off a potential shutdown or any fight over border wall funding until after midterm elections,\" and linking to a Wall Street Journal article. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he takes the threat seriously, but it won't stop him from trying to pass spending bills in the coming weeks. \"It is mind-boggling to me that anybody would say well, we're going to shut down the government if I don't get my way,\" Shelby said. \"The political ramifications of a shutdown as everybody here knows is not good for either party, it's not good for America. It's something we've tried before, both parties, it doesn't work. It's not going to work in the future.\"",

Now Trump is president and McMaster is governor and campaigning for a full term.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-candidate Donald Trump is introduced by then-South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster at a campaign rally in Florence, S.C., in 2016. Now Trump is president and McMaster is governor and campaigning for a full term. Two of the things President Trump likes most are winning and loyalty, and both have clearly been on his mind as he's doled out prized political endorsements this year. For candidates this cycle in a Republican primary, winning Trump's endorsement is political gold. It can push them over the finish line in a tough race, and it gives the president a chance to claim credit for their victories and get some of the glory. But the president has had a mixed record of picking winners and losers since he took office. Attacking and taunting politicians he's deemed disloyal has worked in getting them knocked off in some cases, or in pressuring them not to run. And while Trump's endorsement is highly sought after in GOP primaries, it's also not a silver bullet. Two tests of Trump's endorsement powers This Tuesday offers two tests of how much Trump's influence can truly boost a candidate after he endorsed South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and New York Rep. Dan Donovan in their primary fights. In South Carolina, Trump is going all in for McMaster, who was the first statewide-elected official to endorse his 2016 presidential bid back when Trump was largely a political pariah among Republican officeholders. McMaster was promoted from lieutenant governor when Trump selected then-Gov. Nikki Haley to be his ambassador to the United Nations, and now McMaster finds himself in a runoff against wealthy businessman John Warren. Trump is appearing at a rally in Columbia for McMaster on Monday, and Vice President Pence also campaigned for him over the weekend. Trump has also frequently tweeted in support of McMaster, writing on Friday that he's a \"truly fine man.\" In past tweets, he's praised him as someone who's \"strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets.\" Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina. He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday! McMaster's support for Trump from the very beginning, when few others were willing to back him, makes McMaster a worthy candidate for a campaign event, argued South Carolina GOP consultant Chip Felkel. \"McMaster has certainly earned an enthusiastic reminder of his loyalty to the president.\" Initially Felkel and others in South Carolina were skeptical of whether Trump would come in person, because the governor's victory is no sure thing. McMaster got 42 percent of the vote two weeks ago in the five-way primary, and may have trouble increasing his share much beyond that. His rival, Warren, has been arguing he's the candidate more closely aligned to Trump \u2014 an outsider businessman who would shake up the political system, as opposed to McMaster, who's held elective office in the state for much of the past 15 years. But Trump and Pence's visits to the state shows that the president is willing to go beyond his Twitter feed to show support for a like-minded candidate. If McMaster pulls off a victory, Trump can claim the surge was his doing. But if he doesn't, it would saddle Trump with another loss on his mixed record so far during his term. Mixed record with endorsements That's what happened in last year's Alabama special election for U.S. Senate. First, Trump endorsed appointed Sen. Luther Strange (who replaced now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions) in the primary, over the objections of some of his most vocal supporters. Trump also traveled to Alabama to hold a rally for Strange, but it wasn't enough \u2014 former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore prevailed and Trump switched his support to the GOP's nominee. After multiple women accused Moore of sexual misconduct from when they were teenagers decades ago, Trump stood behind Moore. Although Trump didn't hold a rally for Moore, he did add a campaign stop across the border in Pensacola, Fla., just before Election Day. Ultimately, Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump also campaigned for Republican Rick Saccone in a Pennsylvania U.S. House special election March, which Democrat Conor Lamb went on to win. Later, both Trump and other national Republicans blamed Saccone for being a weak candidate. In comparison to McMaster, the president has taken a more hands-off approach with Donovan ahead of Tuesday. The incumbent is facing a vigorous primary challenge from former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, who is attempting to mount a comeback after pleading guilty to tax evasion charges and serving seven months in federal prison. Part of Grimm's case against Donovan has been that the incumbent isn't supportive enough of Trump. Grimm's argument was drowned out somewhat when Trump tweeted an endorsement of Donovan last month, writing that the congressman \"is helping me to Make America Great Again.\" There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement! Most important, Donovan's allies say, was Trump's follow-up tweet saying that Grimm would be unelectable in a general election, imploring voters to \"Remember Alabama.\" GOP strategists worry that if Grimm wins, the seat will be much more likely to flip to Democrats than if Donovan is the nominee. Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can\u2019t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat! Even without a visit from Trump, the president's tweets thrilled Donovan's supporters. \"We saw a significant uptick of support when Trump did endorse Dan Donovan twice via tweet,\" said Sarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, whose group is actively supporting Donovan. Fieldworkers from the group's political action committee reported talking with several people who switched their support to Donovan after Trump's endorsement. Ultimately, the primary race remains very tight and even Trump's blessing may not be enough. The president has broad support in Staten Island, the only New York borough he carried in 2016. But Trump hasn't campaigned for Donovan or invested as much of his time and energy as he has for McMaster. If Donovan loses, it won't be as much of a blemish for Trump than if the South Carolina governor is ousted. \"Helpful in a primary\" Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who has studied campaign endorsements, said that while Republicans in safer GOP districts are clamoring for Trump's favor now, that probably won't continue into the general election, especially for candidates in swing districts. \"He is helpful in a primary,\" Bullock said, \"but it's something which might come back to bite you if he endorsed you in a marginal district that got you a nomination, but you might pay a price for it come November.\" Two weeks ago, Trump endorsed the challenger to a candidate who had spurned him \u2014 South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford. The congressman's primary opponent, state Rep. Katie Arrington, had made Sanford's vocal criticism of the president the focus of her campaign against Sanford. Then, less than three hours before polls closed, Trump tweeted out his endorsement of Arrington. Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie! Trump's tweet let him exact revenge against Sanford and allowed him to boast he took down an enemy, even if it's debatable how much impact a tweet so late on Election Day could have had. At least some observers in South Carolina think the tweet helped Arrington defeat Sanford outright \u2014 without a runoff two weeks later, as most expected would happen, but others are skeptical it gave her much of a boost. The next victim of Trump's retribution could have been Alabama Rep. Martha Roby. She faces a politically perilous runoff next month after coming out against Trump in October 2016 when the Access Hollywood video surfaced, showing the president making vulgar remarks and bragging about groping and forcibly kissing women. But unlike Sanford, Roby has been contrite after initially criticizing Trump. On Friday, he gave her a somewhat surprising endorsement via Twitter. Alabama GOP pollster Brent Buchanan said that message from Trump was \"huge\" for Roby. Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda. She is in a Republican Primary run-off against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat. I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District! \"I would have said she was in a lot of danger because of what she'd said in the past about Trump, but now I think that with this narrative she's in a really good place,\" Buchanan said. \"This moves a lot of things in her favor. Ask Katie Arrington how helpful tweets can be.\"",

Larry Hogan (R) has an approval rating that hovers around 70 percent in a state that Hillary Clinton carried by 25 percentage points in 2016. He faces no challenge in Tuesday's primary. Whichever candidate breaks through the crowded field of Democrats to win Maryland's gubernatorial primary Tuesday, will likely face an uphill battle in the fall, trying to deny popular incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan from securing a second term. Four years after his surprise victory, Maryland's Republican governor enjoys sky-high approval ratings in a state where Democrats have a veto-proof majority in the state legislature, control both U.S. Senate seats and all but one of the U.S. Congressional districts. Registered Democrats also outnumber registered Republicans in the state by a 2-to-1 ratio. After ticking off a list of accomplishments over the last four years, including cutting taxes and cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, Hogan reminded a crowd at his reelection campaign kickoff earlier this month in Annapolis of his surprise 2014 election. \"We pulled off the greatest upset victory in the entire United States of America.\" Even in this election year, Hogan has shown a willingness to go against the leader of his party, President Donald Trump. In protest of the thousands of children being split up from their parents, the governor called the state's National Guard troops home from the southern border last week. Since his election, Hogan has earned praise for being a reassuring presence during the 2015 riots in Baltimore, following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. He also endeared himself to many throughout the state as he continued to work while fighting through a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The governor says he is now cancer free. Hogan has also built a strong base of bipartisan support and enjoys an approval rating that hovers around 70 percent. \"Unlike Washington, where nobody gets along and nothing ever seems to get done, here in Maryland we've chosen a different path. And we're setting an example for the rest of the nation,\" Hogan said at his campaign kickoff, before adding his sales pitch to voters for the fall. \"If we can make all this progress while dealing with riots and battling cancer, just imagine what we're going to get done over the next four years.\" Hogan is running unopposed in Tuesday's primary. Hogan's popularity isn't just aligned to his politics, according to Mileah Kromer, Director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College in Baltimore. \"He has a personality that people like,\" Kromer says. \"He's gregarious, he comes across as authentic, but he's also one of the most disciplined politicians I've ever come across.\" Damon Flemons, a voter in Maryland, says he sees those characteristics in the governor, too. \"I'm a traditional Democrat and I voted Republican,\" he said at Hogan's reelection campaign launch. Flemons is the type of voter Democratic Party officials are worried about because he crossed party lines once for Hogan \u2013 and plans to again in the fall. \"If we take ourselves out of partisan politics and look at what's best for our state, we'll see that he's the best candidate to do that,\" Flemons said.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., stumps for Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous in Silver Spring, Md. \"This is a primary that a lot of folks have contextualized as 'sleepy,' \" says Goucher College professor, Mileah Kromer. \"Which is really a shame,\" she adds, \"because the two front-runners for the Maryland gubernatorial primary are African-American men, in a state that has never elected an African-American governor.\" Polls heading into primary day indicate it's a two-man race between Rushern Baker, a former state delegate and current top official in Prince George's County, one of the nation's wealthiest majority-black jurisdictions, and Ben Jealous, a first-time candidate and former head of the NAACP, the country's oldest civil rights organization. Baker has the backing of much of the state's political establishment, including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and former governor and one-time presidential nominee, Martin O'Malley.

In the closing weeks of the primary campaign, Jealous had big-name progressives stump for him including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, Cory Booker, D-N.J., and childhood friend and comedian Dave Chappelle. There is evidence voters may be more engaged as the primary campaign draws to a close. The Baltimore Sun reported that early voting, which ended Thursday, was up 56 percent from the previous gubernatorial primary in 2014. The paper also found before early voting started Jealous and Baker were tied at 16 percent, according to a poll of registered likely voters. Other Democrats seeking the nomination include state Sen. Richard Madaleno, Baltimore attorney Jim Shea, technology entrepreneur and author, Alec Ross, and Krish Vignarajah, a former policy director for Michelle Obama. Valerie Ervin, a former Montgomery County, Md. city councilmember, dropped out of the race earlier this month and endorsed Baker. Ervin was running for lieutenant governor but moved to the top of her ticket after running mate, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz, died suddenly in May.",

            "article_content": "President Trump meets with congressional Democrats to discuss his request for $5 billion to fund a border wall. Democratic leaders have suggested offering $1.3 billion for border security.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The country's top Democratic lawmakers meet with President Trump at the White House today. They're going to try to hash out a plan to avoid a partial government shutdown. The obstacle - a wall, specifically the president's request for $5 billion as a down payment on a border wall. This is something President Trump has been promising his supporters - that he would build a wall - ever since he announced his run for the White House in 2015. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have suggested offering $1.3 billion to the president for border security. Joining us now - NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: The president has been busy on Twitter this morning - not exactly offering a conciliatory tone before this meeting, is he? KEITH: Well, that would be the president, and that would be Twitter. There were five tweets - long ones in fact - talking about the wall, talking about border security, saying Democrats want open borders. But it was all a bunch of throat clearing to get to the end, which seems to be almost a concession of defeat mixed with a declaration of victory, which is President Trump at his essence. MARTIN: OK, tell us what he's saying. KEITH: Yeah, so let me read it. Mind you, there have been four tweets before this one. But then he says, people do not realize how much of the wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will build the remaining sections of the wall. They know how important it is. MARTIN: OK. There are clearly things to discuss about this. First of all, how is he going to have the military build the wall? KEITH: Well, that isn't clear. As we all know, the military - troops have been stationed along the border since just before the midterm elections. He sent them there to help deal with the caravan, to put up some concertina wire and otherwise fortify things. Some of those troops are being extended. Other units have been sent home. I reached out to a budget expert, a man named Stan Collender who goes by the name the budget guy, to ask him what he thought President Trump was talking about. And he says that he thinks maybe the president is talking about reprogramming or transferring funds from the Department of Defense from other programs. And then he says that that would take resources away from other military activities. But he's also not sure that the president really has the discretion to do that or that Democrats that will be taking over in the House of Representatives in January will be particularly happy about going along with it. MARTIN: Right. Also isn't he just giving away his leverage by saying he doesn't need Pelosi and Schumer and Democrats? Won't they just call his bluff? KEITH: And the reality is that they've already called his bluff. And he may well have been sort of responding to the statement that they put out last night. Pelosi and Schumer put out a statement saying Republicans still control the House and the Senate and the White House, and they have the power to keep the government open - essentially washing their hands of this current budget fight and saying that it's up to the president and Republicans to do it. They add this holiday season the president knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House and the Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement. MARTIN: So I mean, we have been here before, Tamara, many times. Someone's got to blink. I mean, they could pass a short-term spending bill that would buy more time, but ultimately someone's going to have to make a concession. KEITH: Well, and it almost seems like - and we will see because things often change - but it almost seems like, with this series of tweets, President Trump is conceding that he's not going to get the wall funding that he wants. And in the process, he's saying, and I don't really need it anyway, which is the declaring victory in the face of defeat. MARTIN: So you don't see a real possibility of a partial shutdown at this point? KEITH: I mean, I don't like to make predictions. But it certainly seems as though there is a softening of the president's position at a time when no one really wants a government shutdown. MARTIN: No one ever does, right? It doesn't politically work for anyone. KEITH: Well, no one ever wants one but especially now, you know. There are so many Republican members of Congress who the president would need their votes. And they just want to go home there. They're done. They've been voted out of office, and they just want to go home. MARTIN: Right. All this is happening of course while there is a revolving door in White House staffing. Chief of Staff John Kelly is gone. President Trump needs a new one. Who's on the list today because there aren't that many people lining up for this job? KEITH: Well, and guess what? There's a tweet for that too. The President Trump - President Trump is just out with one saying that there are over 10 people vying for and wanting the White House chief of staff position. He doesn't say who they are. Most media outlets that are tracking these things do not have a list that is nearly that long. One name that keeps rising to the top is Mark Meadows. He's a congressman from North Carolina, head of the Freedom Caucus and a close ally of President Trump's - unclear whether he would get the job. He initially said he didn't want it and then said that it would be a great honor. MARTIN: Stay tuned. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "There is growing concern as more and more migrants are headed toward the U.S. border near San Diego, creating crowded conditions and protests in Mexican border towns.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The first Central American caravan of migrants traveling toward the U.S. has stopped. It's been moving north across Mexico for a month. More than 2,500 people are now in Tijuana, just south of San Diego. And another 3,500 are also headed that way from the border town of Mexicali to the east. That's causing tension with some of the people who live in those cities. And it's also a growing concern among U.S. officials on this side of the border. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman has been following the deployment of active duty troops to the border and joins us now. Hi, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: These troops have been in place at the border for about 10 days. What have they been doing? BOWMAN: Well, first of all, there are about 5,900 soldiers and Marines all along the border. They've been setting up tents, reinforcing fences along border entry points. And they're in support of border police and the Department of Homeland Security. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited them last week at a camp outside McAllen, Texas. And one soldier asked if they'll be taking down the razor wire at some point. And Mattis said, we'll let you know. SHAPIRO: These are active duty troops, so they're limited in what they can actually do. Tell us about what those limitations are. BOWMAN: Right, and again, it's simply support, shoring up fences and so forth. But they have no law enforcement role. They're barred from that role because of a 19th century act called Posse Comitatus, which prohibits the military from getting involved in any law enforcement duties. So that's all up to border police. SHAPIRO: Who are these troops reporting to? Who's actually in command there? BOWMAN: Well, the commanding general is Army Lieutenant General Jeff Buchanan. And, Ari, what's unusual here is, again, you have about 6,000 active duty troops. And in past decades, it's almost always National Guard troops that help the border police along the border for drug interdiction or refugees coming across. And some I talk with in the Pentagon are kind of scratching their heads over there. They're saying, listen; there are already 2,100 National Guard troops along the border. There is really no need for these thousands of active troops. And that's led to some on Capitol Hill and some retired military folks to say this is all a serious waste of money and clearly a political stunt by President Trump, who ordered these troops down to the border right before the midterm elections. SHAPIRO: Is the mission there on the border changing as more migrants arrive? BOWMAN: Well, we've been hearing that - at the Pentagon, that President Trump may expand authorities for the troops to essentially, let's say, come to the aid of border police if there's, let's say, a breach in the border fence and violence ensues. But at this point, there's absolutely no indication now of any violence. There are hundreds more people arriving in Tijuana, Mexico, right on the border and seeking asylum in the U.S. Many more are expected to come. There are protests by Tijuana residents about these folks coming in but no sense at this point of any real problems, any violence really at all at this point. SHAPIRO: This was never supposed to be a long-term deployment. It was scheduled to end on December 15. Is there any chance that the deployment could be extended? What's the road ahead? BOWMAN: Well, we don't really know right yet. I was talking with one Pentagon official who said, you know, it's a possibility this deployment of troops could extend past December 15 - but no word on that yet. General Buchanan was talking to reporters, and he said he may send home some of his troops, some of the engineering support and so forth. But at this point, again, no sense of any - any troops actually heading home. And we also don't think there'll be any additional troops heading there. At one point, Defense Secretary Mattis said, you know, we could send more troops. But at this point, it looks like it's going to stick at roughly the 5,900 troops. And actually tonight, those troops, the cost of them - the Pentagon just put out tonight the cost of this deployment of 5,900 troops through December 15 - $72 million. SHAPIRO: Seventy-two million dollars - all right, NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman - thanks so much, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Central American immigrant families are already arriving at the border. Due to lack of room, ICE is releasing many migrant detainees and counting on nonprofits to house and help the migrants.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump said this week his administration is no longer releasing migrants from custody. We're going to catch. We're not going to release. That's what the president said, but that's not what's happening right now along the southwest border. The number of migrant families apprehended there has reached record numbers. So a few weeks ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement began to release hundreds of families from custody, and that places a strain on nonprofit groups and communities along the border. From member station KRWG, Mallory Falk reports. MALLORY FALK, BYLINE: About 40 minutes from El Paso at the Holy Cross Retreat Center in Mesilla Park, N.M., volunteers line up to greet a bus of migrant families being dropped off by ICE. About 20 parents and children step off the bus. A volunteer named Orlando Carrillo Jimenez ushers them into the retreat center. ORLANDO CARRILLO JIMENEZ: Whoo. All right. (Speaking Spanish). FALK: Jimenez welcomes them to the United States and explains what's about to happen; first, dinner. JIMENEZ: (Speaking Spanish). (LAUGHTER) FALK: Next, medical evaluations. Then, volunteers will help them make travel arrangements so they can get to their final destinations - usually with relatives in other parts of the country. Jimenez has done this nearly every week for the past two years when Holy Cross started taking in migrant families. In the past along this part of the border, immigration officials would either help families arrange transportation to relatives around the U.S. or bring them to a so-called hospitality center like Holy Cross. If those centers didn't have enough space, some migrants remained in custody until there was more room. Two things changed in recent weeks. Officials aren't helping families with travel plans, and they're releasing large numbers of families regardless of whether shelters in churches have the space to accommodate them. ICE recently dropped around a hundred immigrants at a Greyhound station in downtown El Paso with no advance notice. Ruben Garcia runs the city's main immigrant shelter, Annunciation House. He hurried over to meet them. RUBEN GARCIA: Can we cross? FALK: Garcia quickly arranged for a nearby church to house the families and walked them there himself. Annunciation House is working with local officials to find more housing and volunteers. JOSE RODRIGUEZ: I think it's unconscionable. FALK: State Senator Jose Rodriguez represents El Paso. RODRIGUEZ: And now they're just simply dumping them here in the border communities like El Paso and expecting the community to provide the support services. FALK: Annunciation House is renting out 70 motel rooms, and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso set up an emergency shelter with dozens of cots. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, quote, \"family units continue to cross the border at high volumes as they face no consequence for their actions\" - unquote. With legal limits on how long families can be held in detention, ICE said it no longer has the capacity to review travel plans. But Rodriguez suspects these sudden releases are a political ploy to create a sense of chaos on the border right before the midterm elections. Back at Holy Cross Retreat Center, the scene is controlled chaos. Orlando Jimenez tries to figure out how to get a Guatemalan father and child to their sponsor in South Carolina. He calls up the sponsor on his cellphone and a bus company on a landline, all while looking up airfares and tossing the father pumpkin candies for his kid. He takes a moment to reflect. JIMENEZ: You know, this is not \"fake news,\" quote, unquote, and that's the only political statement I'm going to make. These are real people's lives. This is not a caravan. These are actual, real people that need our help. FALK: With limited resources and already stretched thin, advocates are scrambling to make sure families don't simply end up on the street.

            "article_content": "President Trump will speak at the White House, where he is expected to claim victory for widening the GOP's Senate majority. NPR's Noel King, Scott Detrow and Tamara Keith offer a preview.  NOEL KING, HOST: President Trump will speak to the press soon from the White House. He'll be talking about the results of last night's midterm elections. Republicans lost the House, held onto the Senate. We'll cut to the president as soon as he starts talking, but in the meantime in studio with us is NPR's congressional reporter Scott Detrow. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. KING: And NPR's Tamara Keith is at the White House. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. KING: So Tam, the president has been talking a little bit this morning. What's he been saying about the midterm results? KEITH: Well, the president is never one to declare defeat when he could declare victory. And that is exactly what he's doing in a series of tweets. He also says he wants to maybe work with Nancy Pelosi. But I would say take that with a giant grain of salt because he has said those kinds of things before only to make a 180 very quickly. So, you know, he very much is interpreting this as a win. He's also saying that, you know, Democrats shouldn't spend time investigating his administration, or he'll have the Senate investigate the House. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: OK. KING: (Laughter). KEITH: Yeah. So some early threats. INSKEEP: Well, that's the president's style, isn't it? You don't defend. You just attack, attack, attack. But the reality is - is it not, Tamara Keith? - that the White House - and not just the White House, the entire administration - has to be prepared for examination and oversight by a House that will now have subpoena power over them whatever they may say about it. INSKEEP: The administration has to be prepared for examination and oversight by a House that will now have subpoena power over them, whatever they may say about it. KEITH: Oh, absolutely. And it's a target-rich environment. There have been numerous scandals at various agencies that have largely gone uninvestigated by a Republican Congress. Democrats don't intend to let those things rest. And in my reporting, thus far, the White House counsel's office has not staffed up in a way that you would expect or need to be able to be responsive to what will likely be a number of requests. But they are working on it or they will be soon (laughter). KING: So maybe not prepared for the moment - but, Tam, I wonder, when you talk to Democrats and when you look at what they've been telegraphing, what are some of the areas that you would expect them to begin investigating immediately? KEITH: Well, you'd expect them to try to get President Trump's tax returns. KING: Yeah. KEITH: You would expect them to look at the Department of the Interior and the EPA. You'd expect them to look at the way the Trump administration has dealt with the Affordable Care Act and sort of stealing - not stealing, but not putting full funding into promoting health care plans. You'd expect them to... INSKEEP: Openly doing whatever they can to undermine it - they've been pretty frank about that. KEITH: That's true (laughter). And you'd also expect them to investigate whether what the administration has been saying about how it's handling family separation along the border is true. You might well expect them to look into the president's decision to send troops to the border on the eve of the election to deal with the migrant caravan that's hundreds of miles away. INSKEEP: I want to note one additional point, then take it over to Scott Detrow as we wait for President Trump, who will be making a statement at the White House shortly. Reporters are already in their seats. Ron Klain, a longtime Obama administration aide, is writing in The Washington Post to Democrats, take your time with those investigations. It's going to take a while anyway. Try to actually pass substantive things that matter to people. And he raises a few suggestions such as raising the minimum wage, shoring up the Affordable Care Act or dealing with voting rights and that sort of thing. Scott Detrow. DETROW: Yeah. I think we're going to hear President Trump declare victory and say that this was a big win for him. Yes, the Republicans did add to their majority in the Senate. And that's a big deal on a couple different fronts, among other things. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says his top priority for the next two years is going to be the same priority as these two years, and that's confirming as many federal judges that President Trump nominates as he can. It'll be easier for McConnell to do that. And he said, frankly, they'll have more Senate floor time to do that since he doesn't anticipate a lot of agreement with a Democrat-controlled House in terms of trying to pass bills. But this was a really big night for Democrats. And the fact that they flipped control of the House of Representatives is a really big deal. First of all, this is a national referendum in the way that the Senate election wasn't because as we talked a lot about, the Senate map was a historically tough map for Democrats - a ton of states deep red, where President Trump is very popular. And the fact that Democrats were able to keep seats in the three states that made Trump president - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan... INSKEEP: Yeah. DETROW: ...I think tempers the idea that this is a big victory for Trump, even though, again, good on the Senate side to pick up seats. But the fact that Democrats were able to regain control of the House of Representatives, even with so many of these seats drawn in a way by Republican legislatures to make it hard for Democrats to do that, I think, says a lot. INSKEEP: That is an important point, Scott Detrow. Democrats, in order to win the House, had to not just win the popular vote but win it big. And it appears, by all accounts, that they did - seven or eight points, something like that, which is a pretty substantial win in a divided country. KING: Scott, talk a little bit about the Democratic - sorry, the demographics of how this all played out. We heard a lot about suburban voters, the importance of them, the importance of women voters. What were some of the trends that we saw across the country? DETROW: The trend was that Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives by and large through the suburbs. Seat after seat that had been in Republican hands for sometimes generations - I'm thinking of one suburban Houston district that was once held by George H.W. Bush, hadn't sent a Democrat to Congress in decades. KING: Wow. DETROW: A Democrat won there. Philadelphia suburbs, Miami suburbs - basically every big city, you could probably find one or two Republican control districts that flipped to Democratic control. That was the main way that Democrats retook control of Congress. And they did it by winning a lot of independent voters, by winning a big chunk of women voters and by picking off several Republican voters who seemed to clearly be uncomfortable with the type of hard-line, anti-immigration fearmongering that President Trump really leaned into in the final weeks of the campaign that he credits for helping keep Republican Senate seats. KEITH: Yeah. I mean, the way the president is going to read this is that candidates who did not hug him closely lost. Now, those candidates also happened to be in districts that demographically are not Trump country. But the White House interpretation of this is this is President Trump's party, and people who lost didn't hug closely enough to him. DETROW: The one good counterpoint to that is a surprise Democratic win in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District where the Republican candidate Katie Arrington lost. And that's after, in the primary, she defeated Mark Sanford by basically saying, you're not pro-Trump enough; you do not back the president as much as you should; I will be the Trump candidate. That's how she won the primary. It lost her the general election. Same goes for Dean Heller who made a very dramatic pivot from Trump skeptic to standing onstage next to President Trump in the final week saying, Mr. President, everything you touch turns to gold. That did not keep him a Senate seat. INSKEEP: Let's note another factor in these results and something that broke in the president's favor or the Republicans' favor. There is the issue of race. The president and his party in many specific places injected race into this campaign in various ways. The president's own aides put out an ad that was deemed so racist that various networks, including Fox, declined to air the ad or stopped airing the ad. And the president went to campaign on behalf of Republicans in Georgia and Florida who were running for governor against African-Americans. And in one case in Florida, he said the African-American running for governor, Andrew Gillum, was not equipped to be governor. A remarkable amount of racial language. We don't know that the president is going to be asked about that at the news conference that we expect shortly at the White House. But it is absolutely in the air that this was part of the campaign. We don't know that it particularly hurt the president anywhere. Where there's an argument to be made, it might've helped the president in a few places whatever that says about the electorate. DETROW: And the smaller Republican conference in the House by and large lost a lot of the Trump critics, the moderate Republicans who did not like that approach. And you have a Republican Party in both chambers that's now much more in President Trump's image and style of kind of populism and culture wars as opposed to limited government. And at the same time, you have a Democratic Party that is increasingly diverse. A ton of first-time candidates coming in. You have the first Muslim woman elected. You have Indian-Americans coming. You have two women under the age of 30 elected to Congress. So that divide is just increasingly clear of a younger, more diverse demographic Democratic Party and an older and whiter Republican Party. KING: And yet, we had Republicans on the show this morning saying that they could not figure out why the president throughout these midterms was not hammering harder on how well the economy is doing. And I know that you guys were both out on the trail talking to voters and - as were Steve and I. And it was one of the first things you heard from people who support President Trump. The economy's doing great, so I'm sticking by the guy. And I wonder as we go forward, do you think President Trump will come around to the idea that he should play to his strengths, a low unemployment rate and economy that for the moment is booming in most sectors, many sectors? KEITH: Well, he starts talking about those things in his rallies. And then he says, oh, that's kind of boring; let's move on. And then goes to the culture war things. You know, happy people are not driven by fear to the polls. KING: Yeah. KEITH: And so, you know, this strategy of taking a very hard line, in particular, on immigration is something that has worked for President Trump in 2016. The lesson he's absolutely going to take from these results is that at least in the Senate, it worked in 2018. I have done an analysis of the president's tweet endorsements, though, before he comes out to this press conference and fully declares a great night. Of the 84 candidates that he endorsed - this is House, Senate and governor - 84 that he endorsed, 40 won, 31 lost and 13 races have not yet been called. INSKEEP: OK. KING: Wow. KEITH: So this is not... INSKEEP: So that's a... KEITH: ...This is not an overwhelming anything. INSKEEP: ...Winning NBA season but not exactly overwhelming. Scott Detrow. DETROW: Even as we approach noon on Wednesday on the East Coast, we have an important election update. Jon Tester in Montana has now gone ahead of his Republican opponent, Matt Rosendale. Rosendale had led all last night, but some of those outstanding districts came in. They were in the Democratic favor. Now, Tester is on pace to maybe retain his seat, so not another Democratic pickup for Republicans. INSKEEP: Now, I want to note that we're hearing from a number of top officials today. We're awaiting this news conference from President Trump and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be the next speaker of the House. The past speaker of the House and the next speaker of the House will be talking sometime after the president, we would anticipate. Mitch McConnell, who remains the Senate leader with a bit larger majority, has spoken to reporters today. And let's listen to a little bit of what Mitch McConnell had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) MITCH MCCONNELL: The one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning is where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement would be something on infrastructure. Look, there'll be a lot of other things. I think it... INSKEEP: OK. Cut off in the middle there but - so he's talking about a list of possible areas of bipartisan cooperation. And maybe it's actually appropriate, Tamara Keith, that he was cut off. (LAUGHTER) KEITH: Well, so here's the thing about infrastructure. Since President Trump won in 2016, Democrats or Republicans have at times said, you know, infrastructure, that could be something where we come together. And it just hasn't happened. You know, President Trump has had something like four different infrastructure theme weeks, which have all turned into very weird weeks completely unrelated to infrastructure. And the real problem with infrastructure - everybody talks about it - is that they agree more or less on maybe building roads. They don't agree on how to fund it. They don't agree on the mix of transit versus, you know, roads... INSKEEP: Yeah. KEITH: ...And bridges. And it - you know, there's - although the sort of headline seems like something where there could be room for agreement, you know, transportation bills - big transportation bills that used to be bipartisan haven't been for the last five, six, seven years. INSKEEP: Let's explain what the partisan divide is here. In the broadest terms, if you're a Republican, you like private funding for highways. And if you're Democratic, you like public funding for trains. That's an oversimplification, but that's kind of where it goes. Is that right? KEITH: Yeah. Yeah. And maybe gas taxes, too, somewhere in there. INSKEEP: OK. OK. Mitch McConnell used another phrase I want to ask about, Scott Detrow, presidential harassment. DETROW: Yes. INSKEEP: He seems to have said it several times. What does that mean, presidential harassment? DETROW: Democrats will call that oversight. (LAUGHTER) DETROW: McConnell did point something out, though, that - a lot of - I know a lot of Democratic leaders are thinking about, though. He said if you go back to 1998, Republicans, when they had control of the House and Bill Clinton was president, leaned very into presidential harassment, as he put it. Impeachment was the term that they used at the time. INSKEEP: Well, that's true. Yes. DETROW: They went full-bore, investigating every nook and cranny of President Clinton's life. And in the end, President Clinton had a 65 percent or so approval rating. And Republicans lost seats in the last midterm. Mitch McConnell brought that up and said that's worth Democrats thinking about. I don't think many - well, in terms of impeachment, I know Democratic leaders are very wary of going down that road. They can look at the result of winning back control of the House of Representatives and say, you know, a lot of the candidates that put us back in control of the House were moderates who focused on local issues, focused on things like health care and kept the idea of trying to impeach President Trump at arm's length. The line from Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats were, well, we'll just have to see what Robert Mueller's investigation leads to, and we'll go from there. But especially now that Republicans have control of the Senate by larger margins, the idea of going down the road to impeachment would kind of be a bridge to nowhere to use another term from the political past. INSKEEP: Yeah. KING: Well, it's interesting, and the results seem to bear that out. I mean, it was centrist Democrats that did really well. DETROW: Exactly. KING: The progressive Democrats, the ones who even in - you know, who were willing to invoke the word impeachment, they did not fare as well last night, which really seems to be saying something about - I don't know - maybe some cohesion in the party, some agreement about, you know, things that can be discussed and things that can't. DETROW: Here's a weird split track, though, on the progressive front. Progressive issues did great. In three Republican states, Medicaid expansion passed as referendum. Several other progressive referendums passed as well. And at the same time, the progressive candidates - the ones who got the most attention at least - did not fare well. So I think a lot of Democrats are trying to sort out what exactly this means for messaging and approach to presidential races among other things. INSKEEP: Can I just mention - we've all been out and talking with a lot of voters this fall. And you folks can share your experiences, but I'm thinking of people that I spoke with in about four states over the last several weeks. And there were one or two people who raised the Mueller investigation and protecting the Mueller investigation and concern about Russia. But people were much more likely to talk about health care and raise their concerns about Medicare or Medicaid or to talk about how Obamacare benefited them. And that was evident in what the individual candidates were saying, not just the Democrats but the Republicans - because as we've covered on the air, there were a lot of Republicans who, despite their past votes against Obamacare, despite their lawsuits to overturn Obamacare, during the campaign, proclaimed their support for a key provision of Obamacare, the protection of people with pre-existing conditions, which suggests, I think, there are a lot of people - for all the millions of people who are upset about President Trump or profoundly supportive of President Trump, there are a lot of people in this country who are not as engaged or engaged in a different way or would just like something practical out of this situation for their lives or for their country and are thinking in a different way than those who are the most intense partisans. KING: Well, one of the things I thought was so interesting, Steve, when I was reporting in northern Minnesota in the 8th District there, which flipped to the Republican... INSKEEP: Yeah. KING: ...You know, people had a lot of concerns about health care, but they were all over the place. It was really hard to get people to pin down exactly what they were worried about. We heard, you know, I have elderly parents and I'm worried about them, I have kids, I'm worried about losing my insurance. But it really did illustrate how complex health insurance is, how difficult it is to make an issue because everybody's got different worries. And I suppose that's maybe one of the reasons why, you know, the Democrats focus on it. To them, it seemed very productive, but to a lot of Americans, it's just still really confusing, isn't it? INSKEEP: You've just touched on the reason that it was such a landmine for Democrats to step on when they passed Obamacare in the first place, that it's very difficult to explain what you're doing, it's very difficult to persuade people that it's a good thing for them, and for their neighbors, and for their family members and anybody else. KEITH: Well, and the interactions that a lot of people have with insurance, at least, are not always very positive. You know, they find out that their insurance is more expensive than they thought or covered less than they thought. And for years, any negative interaction that anyone had with the Affordable Care Act was blamed - or had with their health care system as a whole was blamed on the Affordable Care Act. This cycle, Democrats began trying to turn that around. And in some ways, they succeeded by talking about the positives in a way that they were afraid to do in years' past. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the way that this election has changed the Republican Party. We've already touched on it. Scott Detrow, you were pointing out that some of the more moderate Republicans - or let's just say some of the Republicans who wanted to embrace the demographic changes in the country - lost their seats. Carlos Curbelo in Florida comes to mind. And there are some others we could talk about. Nevertheless, there were some Republicans, obviously, who won big races. And that moves the party in a different direction. One classic example comes to mind as we await President Trump's remarks today is in Tennessee, where Bob Corker, who had sometimes been a critic of the president - sometimes a quite sharp critic of the president - retired and is replaced by Marsha Blackburn, who is a lawmaker who has been much more supportive - openly and vocally supportive of the president. So she goes to the United States Senate, which is not only a little more Republican, it appears, but also a little more Trumpy, if that's the proper adjective. DETROW: Absolutely. Look through all, so far, of the Republicans who have picked off Democratic incumbents in the Senate. Mike Braun in Indiana won his primary by saying, essentially, I am the Donald Trump in this Republican primary field. I'm a businessman. I'm anti-establishment. So on and so forth. Josh Hawley, who defeated Claire McCaskill in Missouri, repeatedly embraced President Trump, repeatedly appeared next to him at rallies, ran a very Trump-focused campaign. You mentioned Marsha Blackburn. It goes on. So sub out the Bob Corkers and the Jeff Flakes, who were very quick to criticize President Trump, even though Democrats, especially Democrats living on Twitter, always pointed out that they never really backed up their words with actions. But you're losing several of them. You're gaining people who are going to reflexively back the president on almost everything. One area where you may see a pretty early example of what that shifted dynamic means is, if President Trump decides in the coming months that he's had enough of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and decides to fire him or ask for his resignation, I think it's now going to be a lot easier for the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. For most of the past two years, you had Republicans in the Senate signaling to the White House, don't fire Jeff Sessions, we're not going to confirm another attorney general. That dynamic, I think, is gone. INSKEEP: Some of those Republicans are still there, but some of those Republicans are gone. And there are a few votes to spare. I want to mention that we've been told that we are a minute or so away from President Trump stepping out before this group of reporters and a bank of television cameras in the White House. That is the East Room of the White House. Am I describing that correctly, Tamara Keith? KEITH: That's correct. That's the East Room. It's a much bigger venue for holding a press conference than the White House Press Briefing Room and tends to be where these - you know, President Trump doesn't like to follow precedent set by his predecessors, but in this case, he is doing exactly what past presidents have done on the day after midterms. INSKEEP: OK. And as we await the president stepping out, let's just review what has happened, what we have learned in the last 24 hours as the election results have become clear. It is clear that Democrats have won the House. It appears they'll be up around 230 votes for the Democrats in the House. They needed 218 to be a majority. There's still a couple of races we're not entirely sure about. There are a couple of races we're not entirely sure about on the Senate side, but Republicans have clearly gained there. We should mention - I think we haven't mentioned much - Democrats won a Senate seat in Nevada. Dean Heller, Republican, is down. We did mention it once or twice here, but it's worth underlining. However, Republicans won in more conservative and rural places - North Dakota and Missouri and Indiana. Scott Detrow? DETROW: And the Republican candidate in Florida is ahead by the slimmest of margins, and that could be headed to a recount. Recount in Florida - nice flashback for everyone. KEITH: Oh, my gosh. I'm having flashbacks. (LAUGHTER) INSKEEP: It's the way to do it. It's the way - but it's the law in Florida. I mean, Bill Nelson, the Democrat who seems to be on the losing side, has already said, we're heading to a recount. But it appears to be the law if when the counting is done it is less than half a percentage point. Although, it is pretty close to half a percentage point, which is a lot of votes in a state as big as Florida. DETROW: About 30,000 votes separating them right now. KING: It does make you wonder. We've talked throughout this midterm campaign season about Republicans who feel like they no longer have a home in the party. You know, we spoke to someone this morning, Max Boot, a former conservative, a former lifelong Republican conservative commentator, who has abandoned the Republican Party and is urging others to do so, as well, because he just cannot abide by President Trump's rhetoric and his behavior. Why don't we play a clip of that? In fact, we don't have that clip from Max Boot. But, Scott, Tam, I'm curious. What happens to Republicans without a party? KEITH: Wilderness? KING: Where do they go? Yeah. What does the wilderness look like? DETROW: Well, I think that's a good question. I think we're going to look to see if any of those Republicans tries to challenge President Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries. INSKEEP: Someone like Jeff Flake, for example. DETROW: Or John Kasich, the now outgoing governor of Ohio. They would have a very hard road, but I think a small, vocal handful of Republicans have been so critical of the president but haven't taken that drastic step of actually confronting him in that sort of way. INSKEEP: We should note presidents like Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, who were incumbents who ran for re-election and had a primary challenge, they weathered the primary challenge. But it signaled their weakness. It was difficult. It cost them a lot of energy, a lot of money. And those two presidents lost in the end. DETROW: The difference, though, would be that they were challenged from their base side. And this would probably be from the moderate side, the more bipartisan approach. INSKEEP: And you would have to ask, are those votes even there in a Republican primary, or have they gravitated to the Democratic side? DETROW: Exactly. KING: President Trump expected to start speaking in just a couple of minutes. Tam Keith, I wonder. Do you think that the president, when he speaks this morning, will admit to any kind of vulnerability whatsoever? Or is this sheerly going to be, you know, a sort of self-congratulatory talk? KEITH: I don't think that he would be having a press conference if he felt like he didn't have something positive to say. KING: Yeah. KEITH: He is not someone who admits defeat. He is someone who had multiple business bankruptcies and said they were a good thing, that he came out ahead. He, when the health care bill went down, said, oh, no, this is great, this is actually a positive. His approach to life - I was speaking to one of his biographers today - is just not to accept defeat. It's to brand, re-brand and market and say, I'm the winner. INSKEEP: Re-brand defeat. (Laughter). DETROW: And that's going to be the key difference here because Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all walked down that hallway in the White House to the East Room the day after a midterm where they lost control of the House and were contrite and said that I'm willing to work with the other party. I don't think, based on the tweets we've seen this morning, that President Trump is going to strike that tone at all. KEITH: No. You know, we had George W. Bush say that there was a thumpin'. President Obama said that he got shellacked. And you're simply not going - you know, President Trump is going to say that he defied history. INSKEEP: And he has always also laid the groundwork, has he not, by pointing out that there were just too many House districts for him to personally campaign for them and what he actually focused on was Senate races? And he didn't win every Senate race that he campaigned in, but he campaigned in some. And we should also take note that for a while there, the president was also campaigning in House races. He campaigned in the 6th district in Kentucky, just to give one example. But later on, when it became very, very clear that Democrats were likely to win the House, he noted his lack of involvement in that particular race. KEITH: Yeah. In the last week, he really shifted course. Earlier in the month of October, he had been campaigning for House candidates, and then he decided that he wanted to campaign for winners. Or what the White House would say is that he wanted to campaign for candidates that were statewide where he felt like he had a better chance of helping them because these were Trump states. And just to go back to my numbers on this, based on the candidates that he endorsed on Twitter, there are still some undecided races, but his record is 24 and 18 in the House. So 24 wins to 18 losses. In the Senate, he's nine wins to six losses. And with governors, it's 7-7. So there very much is - it's not some overwhelming victory that - I mean, he simply, he did lose a lot of seats, including people that he endorsed. INSKEEP: Yeah. We should be clear about what's going on here because we mentioned the president's arrival was imminent. That is, in fact, what we were told quite some time ago. A news conference was originally scheduled for about 11:30 eastern time, which is 27 minutes ago. And as soon as that begins, we'll take you to it. But meantime, we do have an opportunity to review an awful lot of significant results and races around the country. We've talked about the national level. Perhaps we should talk, while we wait on the president a little bit, about the state level. For starters, Democrats have gained, so far, how many governorships, Scott Detrow? About seven? DETROW: I'm blanking on the exact number, but there were several seats the Democrats flipped. INSKEEP: OK. And here's the president of the United States. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold parliamentary elections in April. He's the frontrunner. He spent 2018 as an ally to President Trump and with right-wing leaders worldwide.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Yesterday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced parliamentary elections will be held in April. If he wins, Netanyahu would likely become Israel's longest-serving prime minister. He has faced controversies this year, too, including corruption charges. And here to talk with us about this past year for Netanyahu is NPR's Daniel Estrin on the line from Jerusalem. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: OK. Give us two snapshots. How would Netanyahu characterize the year he's had? And how do his critics see it? SHAPIRO: Netanyahu says things have never been better. He says Israel has a strong military, economy, technology. He actually said last week, quote, \"we are in a mighty revolution, the likes of which has not been seen in the history of humanity.\" He talks about expanding ties with Africa, with Asia. He claims Arab countries in the Gulf no longer see Israel as an enemy but as a partner. Here's how he summed it up, recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: The Arabs get it. The Muslims get it, and they're coming closer to us. Israel is a world force in global technology. Everybody gets that, everybody. ESTRIN: So he's taking the credit. He's portraying himself as a world statesman. There is criticism of him, though. He is nationalist. He's right-wing, and he is a big supporter of far-right, authoritarian-style figures around the world - Orban in Hungary, Duterte in the Philippines, Brazil's new far-right leader. And, of course, Netanyahu is facing possible criminal charges for corruption. SHAPIRO: This has also been an interesting year in the relationship between the United States and Israel, between the Trump family and Netanyahu. ESTRIN: That's right. Trump and Netanyahu are best buds. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Netanyahu touted that as a major diplomatic achievement. And then, Trump withdrew from the Iranian nuclear deal, and Netanyahu says he played a leading role in persuading Trump to do that. Both of those moves were widely criticized, internationally. And, unlike in previous administrations in the U.S., you don't hear any criticism from the Trump administration on any Israeli actions, even Israel's use of force, its troops killing Palestinians during protests and violence at the Gaza border this year. And Netanyahu - for his part, he embraces Trump, even though Trump, of course, is a divisive figure in the U.S. And so support for Israel has become much more of a partisan divided issue in the U.S. SHAPIRO: In the last couple years, the Trump administration has postponed the date for offering a peace plan, and they now say that will be coming in the year ahead, in 2019. The Trump administration says that plan would require concessions from both sides. How seriously is Netanyahu taking this? ESTRIN: Well, Netanyahu doesn't want to say no to Trump's plan. But Netanyahu's right-wing base won't like the plan, either, so he's kind of in a bind. Although, I think Netanyahu's betting on the Palestinians being the ones to reject the plan. They've already rejected Trump's role in peacemaking. But, really, Netanyahu has been making an argument - we've been hearing it the last couple days and weeks - that Israel's doing fine right now without a peace deal with the Palestinians. And he argues, you know, Israel's expanding ties with rich Gulf Arab states. The Palestinians don't matter to that. And we'll have to see if Netanyahu's theory holds. SHAPIRO: So tell us about the political strategy behind Netanyahu deciding to hold elections in April as he potentially could soon be charged with bribery and corruption offenses. ESTRIN: Well, the two have something to do with each other. He feels that this is the right time for him, when the polls show that he will win re-election. There's no serious challenger out there. And he thinks if he wins a new mandate from the public, it can minimize the impact of any corruption charges he might have to face. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks, Daniel. ESTRIN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "The Down Jones Industrial average has suffered its worst Christmas Eve performance. How is President Trump reacting? Israel's government wants to move up its elections from Nov. 2019 to April.  NOEL KING, HOST: President Trump usually takes a lot of pride in the stock market. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The stock market has hit record numbers. The stock market is hitting one all-time record after another. The stock market is soaring to record levels. The stock market has smashed one record after another. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, what a difference a couple of weeks can make. The market the president once touted is now headed for its worst December since the Great Depression. And a bad month could make for a bad year, as stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008. KING: All right. So how did we get to this point? NPR's business editor Uri Berliner is with us. Good morning, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So market downturns do happen. Why is this one happening right now? BERLINER: Well, the market's been volatile and going largely downhill for about three months now. You know, you can blame any number of culprits - higher interest rates, the trade dispute with China, Brexit, the gloss coming off some of the big tech companies that investors love so much, like Google and Facebook. But what's happened in the last few days seems to really be coming directly from Washington and the Trump administration. You've had the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis, the partial government shutdown and another attack by President Trump against the Federal Reserve. So the turmoil and conflict in Washington has gone to just another level, if that's possible. KING: So President Trump seems to be setting his sights on the Federal Reserve. He tweeted yesterday that the only problem with the economy is the Federal Reserve. How much does the Fed actually influence markets versus what the president says about the Fed influencing markets? BERLINER: Well, the Fed policy is just one of a number of factors that influences markets. Other things, like corporate earnings and consumer spending and the global economy and geopolitics and also what a president says and does. But Fed policy does move markets. KING: There were reports over the weekend that President Trump was considering removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Can the president do that? BERLINER: Well, as far as we know, no president has ever tried to fire the Fed chairman, so the answer to that isn't entirely clear. The law says members of the Federal Reserve Board, including the Fed chair - they can be removed by the president, but for cause. And presumably, that means breaking the law or some highly unethical act, not a disagreement over interest rates. At least that's the way it's been interpreted by legal scholars, but that statute's never really been tested. KING: That's interesting. OK. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made kind of a strange move over the weekend. He called the heads of six top banks, and those bankers then told him, you know, nothing's out of the ordinary. Banks have plenty of liquidity for lending. Mnuchin then tweeted that, which seems like an attempt to calm things down. But it's worth noting that bank lending is not the issue that people are worried about, right? BERLINER: Right. And that was what was so unusual, or even strange, about that - not that the Treasury secretary met with the heads of the big banks. That's fairly normal. It is somewhat unusual to tweet about it. But whether or not borrowers have enough access to credit from banks - that hasn't been raised at all as a concern. So instead of, you know, addressing market fears and concerns, it just seemed to elevate them. The market didn't really like that. KING: And, Uri, last question for you - is it worth trying to predict whether or not this slide in the markets will continue? BERLINER: It's not worth me trying to predict it. I can't do that. (LAUGHTER) BERLINER: Markets go up and down. At a certain point, they reach a bottom, and people start buying in. But I have no idea whether we're anywhere near that. KING: NPR's Uri Berliner exercising restraint there. Thanks, Uri. BERLINER: You're welcome. KING: All right. Now I want to bring in our White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So how is the president reacting to the market slide? KEITH: I mean, I can't be certain that this is what was happening, but based on all signals, it seems as though he spent a lot of the early part of the day yesterday watching TV and live-tweeting what he was seeing on TV, including, as you referenced, a tweet about the Fed. He says the only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the market. They don't understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars, or even Democrat shutdowns over the border. And then this is where the tweet takes a turn that is a little confusing. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch. He can't putt - exclamation point. KING: Either a metaphor or an analogy - it's too early for me to tell which... (LAUGHTER) KING: ...But an interesting one. And to be fair to President Trump, in many ways, he is right about the economy, or has been right. The economy's been doing well under him, and now we have this, which is quite a change. KEITH: Yeah, the economy has been doing well. I'm now going to repeat a line that you will hear regularly on Marketplace, the business show, which is that the stock market is not the economy. KING: Yes. KEITH: And although sort of psychologically and politically for a lot of people the stock market is a proxy for the economy, in reality, it isn't the economy. But as we heard in the clips at the beginning, President Trump has conflated the two on a regular basis and has made, you know, how are your 401(k)s doing sort of a central selling point for his presidency. KING: Which is really interesting because people do worry about how what their 401(k)s are doing. And when they see them shrinking, you know, it tends... KEITH: Yeah. KING: ...To lead to a lot of concern. President Trump had planned to go to his Florida club for Christmas. He instead stayed in Washington to deal with the shutdown. Now, you and I both know it's not always fun to work on the holidays. What has the president been saying about this move to stay in Washington instead of going away? KEITH: Well, he - there's another tweet. There's a tweet for that, too. He - and it's unclear whether he was being facetious or serious, but many people took this as serious. He tweeted, I am all alone, poor me, in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security. And the tweet goes on, but the point there is that negotiations aren't really happening. There were some - just as the shutdown started - some talks. But Congress has gone home. The president is stuck in Washington, D.C. He's not in Florida. And there's really no progress in sight on the shutdown. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders, sent out a statement of their own. And they said - I'll read part of it - it's Christmas Eve, and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. They go on to say that every time they talk to somebody from - different from the White House, they get a different answer about what the president would accept to end the shutdown. And that leaves them really not knowing where this stands at any given moment. KING: Tamara, are you going to be watching the president's Twitter feed today, or are you taking some time off for Christmas Day? KEITH: I will be watching the president's Twitter feed. My hope is that he spends quality time with his family and doesn't tweet, but you never know. (LAUGHTER) KING: NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith. She's also host of the NPR Politics Podcast. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Israel's government wants to move its elections up. GREENE: Yeah. These elections were scheduled for November 2019, but now Israel's governing coalition says the elections are going to be held in April. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be running for a fourth consecutive term. And if he wins, it would pave the way for him becoming the longest serving leader in Israel's history. KING: NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem. Good morning, Danny. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So why would the government want to move elections up? ESTRIN: Well, Netanyahu announced this, and he didn't actually give a reason. But early elections have been expected. His governing coalition has become unstable. His defense minister recently quit. There have been other disagreements. But political observers here suspect that there is one big reason Netanyahu wants elections now, and that is to fight for his political survival. He is a suspect in three separate corruption cases. We've been talking a lot about that over the last couple of months. And just a few days ago, there were reports that a top justice official in Israel concluded that Netanyahu should face criminal charges. KING: Wow. ESTRIN: So yeah. It seems like it's only a matter of time before Netanyahu will have to face the music. And analysts here say that by calling elections now, Netanyahu hopes that Israel's attorney general will delay an announcement on an indictment so he's not seen as interfering in the elections. And then Netanyahu bets that he'll win the elections and win a fresh mandate from the public. And then that would dissuade the attorney general from issuing an indictment at all. KING: I mean, this is really interesting because he's obviously being followed - Netanyahu is - by the shadow of corruption if he's potentially facing criminal charges - brings up a really interesting question, which is, does he have any serious challengers? And if he doesn't, why not? ESTRIN: Not really. The newest opinion poll out predicts that Netanyahu will win and will win big. There is one popular former army general who may run maybe on the center-left - maybe not. We don't know. And the latest poll shows him as a runner-up and still quite far behind Netanyahu. Netanyahu is going into this election after a very strong year. He's presenting himself as having very good relations with the leaders of rising powers in the world - Russia, China, India, rising nationalist leaders in Europe. He's been hinting of warming ties with Gulf Arab states, and he's been in power for almost a decade now. He's facing a very weak opposition. KING: So what are going to be the big issues in this campaign? If these corruption charges aren't, what will be - what will everyone be talking about? ESTRIN: Well, the corruption allegations will be a major issue and prominent. KING: OK. ESTRIN: And I think as one analyst put it, people will be asking, is Netanyahu a crook or Houdini? The biggest issue I think here, as it usually is in elections, is what's called security. The U.S. withdrawal from Syria has people worried here. There are concerns about escalating tensions with the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon. There's been violence in Gaza and the West Bank recently. And any of those fronts could heat up. So Netanyahu will be tested on how he'll handle those issues. But this is also a referendum on the way the government and the way Israel's going - the ideological, right-wing, religious, nationalist direction Israel is headed. One big issue, I should mention, is that the White House has vowed to release its peace proposal for Israelis and Palestinians. Maybe Trump will delay that because of these elections. KING: NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks so much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The White House and Democrats seem far apart on a deal that could avert a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. The sticking point is the president's demand on border wall funding.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Parts of the federal government could shut down just before Christmas if the White House and Democrats are unable to reach a deal over funding. The sticking point has been President Trump's demand for $5 billion - that's billion with a B - $5 billion towards his long-sought-after Border Wall. White House adviser Stephen Miller, who is considered a hard-liner on illegal immigration, reiterated over the weekend that Trump would shut down the government to get that wall money. Here's Miller on CBS' \"Face The Nation.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\") STEPHEN MILLER: We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall, to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that means a shutdown. MILLER: This is a very - if it comes to it, absolutely. KELLY: But earlier today another White House adviser, Mercedes Schlapp, had a slightly different message. She told reporters the White House does not want to get to a point where there's a shutdown. And she described Trump's $5 billion ask differently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERCEDES SCHLAPP: We're going to find ways to get to that $5 billion and make sure that we increase funding not only for the physical barrier but also for technology and for personnel. KELLY: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us from the White House to decipher all of this. And, Mara, which is it? Is the president going to shut down the government to get his wall money or not? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, despite Trump's defiant tweets, he tweeted again recently that you shouldn't listen to Democrats who say you can have border security without a wall. That sounds like exactly what the White House is trying to negotiate. They have until Friday midnight to reach a deal. It looks like they're trying to find a way to get President Trump out of the box he put himself in during that meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer when he said he would proudly take responsibility if there was a shutdown and he would shut down the government if he didn't get $5 billion for the border wall. But if you listen to what Mercedes Schlapp is saying, it sounds like there are a lot of different ways to get money for border security. She did not mention the word wall. She talked about technology, personnel. That could mean drones, fencing. So it sounds like the White House wants to find a way to satisfy the president perhaps by using the amount of money Democrats have offered plus other sources of funding - maybe the military, the way they strung that concertina wire along the border during the caravan crisis. KELLY: I mean, what it sounds like, just to put it bluntly, is the White House is maybe trying to figure out a way that the president can declare victory even if he doesn't get that $5 billion. LIASSON: Absolutely. Don't forget. In that meeting with Chuck and Nancy, Donald Trump said he already had tremendous success decreasing illegal immigration at different parts of the border by using the money that he's already been given, which of course is much less than $5 billion. So it's - what I am hearing is the White House does not want to shut down. They do not want to punt this into January. And it sounds like the president is just as eager to get home to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas as members of Congress are to get home to their places. KELLY: He is still slated to leave Friday. Is that right? LIASSON: That's right. KELLY: OK, so he can't do this by himself. He needs Democrats. Are Democrats likely to go along with this evolving White House plan? LIASSON: That's the big question. Senator Schumer, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, said that he had not heard from the White House. And here's what he said on the floor of the Senate just moments ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Nor have we even heard from our Republican colleagues in the Senate or House about what they might support to avoid a shutdown. Senate Republican leadership has no idea what President Trump wants. Neither does House Republican leadership. LIASSON: So Democrats have to be on board with this because in the Senate, you need 10 Democratic votes to pass this. And of course our reporters are saying there might not even be the votes for this in the House because so many Republicans have just gone home. They've lost their seats. They've vacated their office for incoming Democratic freshmen. And they're just not around. KELLY: Mara, in the minute or so that we've got less - left, let me switch gears and ask about another story, this Texas judge who has ruled that Obamacare is unconstitutional. Setting aside the legal questions 'cause I gather that decision is expected to be appealed, what are the political questions it raises for you? LIASSON: Well, that's true. Nothing changes on a practical level right now. It will be adjudicated further. But the president has been tweeting triumphantly about this. But it's also true that Republicans have not been able to coalesce around a replacement for Obamacare. They tried and failed pretty spectacularly. Then they just litigated again in the fourth election where Obamacare has been an issue. And it turns out that Obamacare is getting more and more popular, especially the parts of it like banning insurers from rejecting you if you have a pre-existing condition, allowing your kids to stay on your plan till 26, expanding Medicaid. So I think this is a situation for Republicans of beware of what you wish for. You just might get it. KELLY: NPR's Mara Liasson reporting there from the White House. Thank you, Mara.

            "article_content": "President Trump wants $5 billion to build a border wall, but Democrats won't agree to more than $1.3 billion in border security. If they don't reach a deal by Friday there will be a partial shutdown.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to start the program today in Washington, D.C., because this week, lawmakers are facing a Friday deadline to pass a budget or face the prospect of a partial government shutdown. This past week, an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer made the prospect of a shutdown quite apparent. And it seemingly all comes down to funding that wall on the southern border that the president has promised but the Democrats will not support. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Twenty times you would call for, I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall. None of us have said... PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You want to know something? SCHUMER: You've said it. TRUMP: OK, you wanted to put that in my... SCHUMER: You said it. TRUMP: I'll take it. SCHUMER: OK. TRUMP: Good. You know what I'll say? Yes. If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government. SCHUMER: OK. Fair enough. TRUMP: Absolutely. And I... SCHUMER: We disagree. TRUMP: ...Am proud. And I'll tell you what... SCHUMER: We disagree. TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. MARTIN: We wanted to learn more about where the lawmakers stand on this, so we're joined now by NPR's Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thanks so much for joining us. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Well, it doesn't really seem like we're seeing the flurry of last-minute negotiations and talks that we're used to seeing before a possible shutdown. Is there a plan out there to prevent this from happening? SNELL: There really isn't that we have seen so far. I have talked to staff for all of the major leaders, and none of them can tell me how this gets fixed. Republicans in particular say it's almost entirely a conflict between Trump and the Democrats, as we heard earlier this week at the White House. Basically, there isn't a spending bill that can pass Congress without votes from Democrats in the House and the Senate. So President Trump has to decide if he'll sign something that will almost certainly involve him losing out on some if not all of his border wall demand. That's the - really the only way that Democrats are saying there can be a solution. MARTIN: So, you know, earlier this year, I think people may remember that the Democrats were talking with President Trump about a deal to approve some money for the wall in exchange for legal protections for immigrants who were in the country illegally after being brought here as children - the so-called DREAMers. Are the Democrats still willing to negotiate on that? SNELL: I've been talking to Democrats a lot, and they say that that is definitely off the table. There's a lot of blame to go around for why that original deal fell through. But none of the Democrats I've spoken with are willing to even entertain it at this point because things basically have changed. They think the election was decisive on this in a couple of ways. One, lots of voters - not just Democrats - say they support protections for those immigrants. Those are the people who were covered under President Obama's program of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA program. The other thing is they don't trust President Trump, and they just don't believe that things will actually get resolved here. And the third and maybe biggest issue here is deals like that rely on having some moderates, particularly in the Senate, who are willing to bridge the gap between Democratic leaders and the rest of their party and the president. And over in the Senate, most of them lost. None of them seem remotely interested in betraying their party politics as their very last vote in Congress. MARTIN: So do the Democrats have all this leverage? How did that happen? SNELL: Yeah. They still need 60 votes in the Senate, and Republicans don't have 60 senators, so they have to get votes from Democrats. And traditionally, they've had a hard time passing spending bills on Republican votes alone in the House, too. And that's really only gotten worse here in December. A lot of Republicans haven't been around in voting since after the election. Some people lost and want to go home and be with their families. And then there are those other people who want other jobs. Like, think about Kristi Noem, who gets sworn in to be governor of South Dakota next month. She has to build a whole staff. And Marsha Blackburn was elected to the Senate, and she also has to do the same thing. The other thing that I think people need to remember is there are the optics of shutting down the government over the holidays when employees will be without a paycheck - lots and lots of government employees. And Trump has already said he would own all of those consequences. MARTIN: So is there a way out of this that avoids a partial shutdown next weekend? SNELL: Well, one option is a short-term spending bill that would move the negotiations to January. Or Trump could maybe accept the Democrats' offer. One thing I've also heard floated is that they could come up with some sort of big package that maybe satisfied other demands from Democrats in exchange for a small amount of border security funding so that Trump can walk away and say he got a little bit of something. MARTIN: So if this shutdown happens, what does that mean in terms of both services that will be affected and people who will not be getting paid? SNELL: Right. You know, I mentioned that there would be those people who would have to work and maybe not get paid. And this particular shutdown would really only affect about 25 percent of the government. And that might seem small, but there's some pretty important agencies involved in that. There's the Department of Homeland Security. There's the Security Administration - the people who do the airport screening. And the national parks are all on the list of places that won't have funding. So you have essential employees like border agents or people who are doing those checks at the airport. They would all have to work without a paycheck, and everybody else would be sent home. MARTIN: That's NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thank you. SNELL: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Updated at 5:37 p.m. ET In a testy Oval Office exchange with the two top congressional Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, President Trump made clear he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government in less than two weeks if he doesn't get funding for his border wall. \"I'll be the one to shut it down. I will take the mantle. And I will shut it down for border security,\" Trump told House and Senate Democratic leaders as Vice President Pence sat by stoically. The statement from Trump came in an extraordinary show before the cameras and the press, with minutes of tense back-and-forth with both Pelosi, the likely incoming House speaker, and Schumer, the Senate minority leader. Democratic leaders have made it clear they don't intend to give the president a victory on funding for his signature border wall, and afterward they released a statement reiterating that \"We gave the president two options that would keep the government open. It's his choice to accept one of those options or shut the government down.\" Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill at a holiday reception later Tuesday she and Trump had spoken on the phone but there was no response to the earlier offer from her and Schumer. According to an aide, the call was around 4 p.m. and lasted about a minute. Speaking immediately after the meeting, both Schumer and Pelosi thought they had emerged with the upper hand after seemingly baiting Trump into taking the blame if there's a partial shutdown just days before Christmas. \"This Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum he seems to want to throw, will not get him his wall,\" the Senate minority leader told reporters outside the White House. Throughout the meeting, Trump kept insisting that much of the wall has already been built (numerous fact-checkers earlier this year determined it hasn't, which Schumer pointed out) and he has also said that the military can build the rest. In a statement provided to NPR Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense said \"to date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall.\" But \"Congress has provided options under [existing law] that could permit the Department of Defense to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.\" During the 2016 campaign, Trump also kept claiming that Mexico would pay to build the wall, but he has since dropped that talking point. Pelosi insisted during the meeting that the cameras should leave, saying afterward she made such a request because \"we didn't want to contradict the president when he was putting forth figures that have no basis in fact. ... I didn't want to say in front of those people, 'You have no idea what you're talking about.' \" Except by making that comment just after leaving the Oval Office, Pelosi was saying just that. She also kept trying to explain to Trump that there wasn't enough support even in the GOP-controlled House for his border wall, urging him to accept a continuous funding resolution at the current spending levels, or $1.3 billion for a year. But Trump kept interjecting to shift blame, saying a House vote wouldn't matter since he needs to get to 60 votes in the Senate anyway and that would require help from Democrats \u2014 a frequent complaint of his. Back on Capitol Hill, Pelosi told fellow Democratic lawmakers in private that she was \"trying to be the mom\" in the room. \"I can't explain it to you. It was so wild. It goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you,\" Pelosi said, according to an aide in the room. \"You can't let him take you down that path. But the fact is we did get him to say, to fully own that the shutdown was his. That was an accomplishment.\" In another comment sure to irk the president, Pelosi went even further, saying that Trump's obsession with the border wall is \"like a manhood thing for him.  As if manhood could ever be associated with him.\" The tense exchanges underscored the challenges in the coming two years of divided government. Trump diverted from discussing Democrats' takeover of the House, choosing to focus on GOP gains in the Senate \u2014 thanks, in large part, to a very Republican-friendly map in the 2018 midterms. \"When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble,\" Schumer jabbed. \"Well, I did,\" Trump retorted. The White House tried to paint a very different picture of the meeting after the fact, with press secretary Sarah Sanders saying in a statement, \"President Trump had a constructive dialogue with Democrat Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi,\" although \"Major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency.\" Trump himself told reporters later on Tuesday that \"believe it or not, I think it was a very friendly meeting. ... I've actually liked [Schumer and Pelosi] for a long period of time, and I respect them both\" and that \"when the press left, we had a fairly long meeting and we really discussed a lot of great subjects.\" And the president showed no regrets for having said he would own a shutdown if it comes to that. \"If we close down the country I will take it, because we're closing it down for border security, and I think I win that every single time,\" Trump said. Speaking on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., acknowledged it had been a \"spirited meeting\" at the White House, but that \"I'd still like to have a smooth ending here\" and avoid a government shutdown. \"I'm sort of hoping for a Christmas miracle here that we'll have a level of cooperation that we don't normally have in getting bills across the Senate floor,\" McConnell said, pointing to not just the government funding bill but the farm bill and a criminal justice overhaul. Democratic resistance to funding the wall may have prompted Trump's pre-meeting tweetstorm, which over a series of five long tweets seemed to simultaneously concede defeat and declare victory on wall funding. .....I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built... ....People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is! Troops have been stationed along the Southern border with Mexico since just before the midterm elections, and while some are being extended through the end of January, other units have been sent home. \"He's talking about reprogramming/transferring funds from other [Department of Defense] programs,\" said Stan Collender, a federal budget expert, when asked if he could explain the Trump tweets. \"That would indeed take away resources from other activities.\" Collender said he wasn't sure how much discretion Trump would actually have to do this and said it will \"get the new Democratic House very angry.\" Even before the Tuesday morning tweetstorm, in recent days Trump had been far less specific about his demands for border wall funding than he has been in past rounds of budget talks. Sometimes he leaves out specific dollar amounts (though the standing request is $5 billion). And his use of the phrase \"border security\" indicates more than just funding to build the wall. Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall! \"Congress must fully fund border security in the year-ending funding bill,\" Trump said Friday in a speech at a law enforcement conference. \"We have to \u2014 we have to get this done. They're playing games. They're playing political games. I actually think the politics of what they're doing is very bad for them, but we're going to very soon find out. Maybe I'm not right, but usually I'm right.\" Democrats, looking at public opinion, may feel they have some leverage in the talks. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll out Tuesday shows that 57 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of independents, want the president to compromise on the border wall to prevent gridlock and not risk a government shutdown. Two-thirds of Republicans, however, want the president to stand his ground. And Trump is often laser-focused on his base. A history of failed meetings with \"Chuck and Nancy\" The days of high expectations for White House summits leading to bipartisan breakthroughs were well in the past even before Tuesday's Oval Office throw down. A little more than a year ago, Trump had a couple of meetings with Schumer and Pelosi. He said he had worked out a deal on immigration with \"Chuck and Nancy,\" as he called them. \"I think something can happen,\" Trump told reporters. \"We'll see what happens. But something will happen.\" Nothing happened. The deal blew up without even an agreement on what the deal was. Can Trump work with a Democratic House next year? The sparring between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer may well be a preview of the next two years of divided government. Both Trump and Pelosi, who is expected to once again become speaker when Democrats take control of the House, have talked about the potential for bipartisan compromise on things like infrastructure and prescription drug prices. But they've also both foreshadowed conflict. Pelosi and Democrats are promising robust investigations of Trump and his administration, and Trump has said that would lead to a \"warlike posture.\" \"Then at the end of two years, nothing is done,\" Trump predicted. \"Now what's bad for them is being in the majority; I'm just going to blame them.\" This leaves many questions: Are Democrats willing or able to compromise with Trump? Is Trump willing to deal? If he is, will congressional Republicans go along? And given the way Trump has changed his mind in the midst of past negotiations, will anyone trust him? Still, allies of the president and Pelosi interviewed for this story say some limited compromise is possible. \"I think there's several positions the president has that frankly line up more traditionally with Democrats,\" said Marc Short, former director of legislative affairs for the Trump administration. \"The question I think that is yet to be determined is whether or not Democrats will give their leadership the flexibility to negotiate with the president.\" That's one way of pinning blame back on the other party when big things fail to get done. Short also questioned whether Democrats would be willing to give Trump a win as he begins his re-election campaign in earnest. John Lawrence, a former chief of staff to Pelosi, countered that Democrats are likely open and looking to cut some deals. \"[Pelosi] is going to be, and I think Democrats in the House are going to be, concerned with proving that they can be trusted that they can govern,\" Lawrence said. Short and Lawrence both see incentives for their respective parties to get something done, while questioning whether those incentives exist for the other side. But first they have to make it to next year. And the budget fight brewing as 2018 closes out could well affect the relationship going forward.

            "article_content": "Construction on the first new stretch of border wall under the Trump administration is slated to begin this winter. In South Texas, the wall will cut right through a butterfly sanctuary.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Trump is pushing for more money to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The debate could come to a head as Congress nears a deadline to fund parts of the government. Some sections of the border already have a wall. And in many areas, building more wall means cutting through private property. In South Texas, NPR's Cristina Cala and Sam Gringlas visited a place where that conflict is already playing out. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: We're just looking at dozens and dozens of these red and black butterflies. CHRISTINA CALA, BYLINE: Like a cloud of butterflies - just one right after the other. GRINGLAS: The National Butterfly Center in Mission, Texas, hugs the banks of the Rio Grande River. It has a visitor center, hiking trails, gardens - all on 100 acres of land at the end of a long dirt road. MARIANNA TREVINO-WRIGHT: These are queens. And this one right here is a soldier... CALA: That's Marianna Trevino-Wright, executive director of the sanctuary. She says this part of the Rio Grande Valley has more butterfly species than anywhere in North America. TREVINO-WRIGHT: Every day I come to work, it's like going on a safari. GRINGLAS: Right before the midterm elections, the Trump administration announced it had awarded contracts to build six miles of border wall in Hidalgo County, Texas. It will be one of the first new stretches of wall built under President Trump. Trevino-Wright says the wall will be constructed up to a mile back from the river, basically cutting the butterfly sanctuary in half. TREVINO-WRIGHT: So this is it. GRINGLAS: So all this land in between here, the river and where we started out by the levee, that's going to maybe be closed off to you. TREVINO-WRIGHT: It's going to be a no man's land. It's going to be border patrols' enforcement zone. They will clear everything. One agent told me, why would we leave even one bush for someone to hide under? GRINGLAS: Customs and Border Protection denies that it plans to completely clear-cut the land. It also says that property owners who need access to the land between the river and the wall can have it. CALA: The Butterfly Center doesn't have a lot of options to stop the law. The federal government can claim private lands for public use through a legal process called eminent domain. The government has used eminent domain many times before to build other stretches of the border while under previous administrations. Trevino-Wright gets that. But she was shocked when last year she found workmen wielding chainsaws, cutting down trees and mowing down brush to survey the land. TREVINO-WRIGHT: Imagine going home to your house one day and finding people cutting down your trees, knocking down your fence and destroying your yard. GRINGLAS: Trevino-Wright says that's really the crux of her complaint. TREVINO-WRIGHT: It's not really about the butterflies. The birds and the butterflies can fly over the wall. The issue is the seizure of private property. The issue is the violation of due process. Those are the real issues. GRINGLAS: So the Butterfly Center sued. The lawsuit claims those workers illegally entered the sanctuary and destroyed property. And here's the important part. Trevino-Wright says that clear-cutting happened before Congress approved funding for wall construction. CALA: Legal experts say the federal government has a lot of leeway when it comes to eminent domain. Attorney Alan Ackerman, an expert on eminent domain, says the government does have to meet one really important requirement before taking private land. ALAN ACKERMAN: The federal government has tremendous discretion, but that discretion is only based upon approval from the legislative body. And once the federal government has the discretion, it's pretty hard to beat them. CALA: In other words, Congress has to fund the project before work can get underway. The funding eventually did come through. GRINGLAS: The government has filed a motion to dismiss the suit. CBP declined to comment on the case since the litigation is ongoing. Trevino-Wright said she understands construction will probably move forward anyway. Still, there's a lot of open questions. Like, how much of their land will get clear-cut? CALA: How much money will the government pay out in compensation? GRINGLAS: And how long will that process take? CALA: And the big question - can the Butterfly Center even stay open after all that? TREVINO-WRIGHT: I mean, we have long-term plans for this place. We're not going to just pack up and abandon that. GRINGLAS: Come February, workers will start construction on a wall in Hidalgo County. Whether a barrier will eventually stretch the entire U.S.-Mexico border, that deal is far from done. I'm Sam Gringlas. CALA: And I'm Christina Cala, NPR News, Mission, Texas.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is likely to reduce the number of active-duty U.S. troops who are currently deployed at the Mexico border, from around 5,900 to around 4,000. Updated at 7:25 p.m. ET The Department of Homeland Security has asked several federal agencies to send civilian law enforcement officers to the border, according to a DHS official. These agencies include the Departments of State, Justice, Energy, Transportation, Labor and Interior, the DHS official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"The President has made it clear that border security is a top administration priority,\" DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in a statement. \"In line with the President's direction and given the very real threat we face at the border from potential mass migration actions \u2013 of course, DHS has reached out for assistance from partners across the federal government to defend our sovereignty, protect our frontline men and women, and secure our border. We appreciate all of the support we have received to date.\" The request comes as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to extend the deployment of thousands of U.S. active-duty troops at the Mexico border through the end of January, Pentagon officials tell NPR. The deployment had been slated to end on Dec. 15. In addition to moving the withdrawal date back, the defense chief is also likely to reduce the force's size to around 4,000 personnel, from the current number of about 5,900. Mattis is expected to sign the Department of Homeland Security's request for assistance at the border this weekend, when the news is expected to be formally announced. Some troops will go home under the plan, with new troops deployed to replace them. But others will remain through the holiday season. Senior officers and their staff are working now to determine which units will be withdrawn. In cases where units are based nearby, such as at Camp Pendleton, they might be given short-term passes to visit their families for Christmas, officials tell NPR. The active-duty military personnel who have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border are meant to provide only a supporting role to Customs and Border Protection agents, mainly in logistical help \u2014 everything from installing barbed wire to moving personnel \u2014 as part of the Trump administration's response to the arrival of thousands of migrants from Central America who have traveled to the U.S. in a large caravan. The deployed troops have included military engineers and military police; officials say medical and aircraft units are also needed to bolster the U.S. presence at its Southern border. So far, a key job for the troops has been to install roll after roll of concertina wire along the border. Some of the engineering teams who were involved in that effort will now go home \u2014 and won't be replaced \u2014 because their work is done, defense officials say. In addition to the active-duty personnel, the Trump administration has sent 2,100 National Guard troops to the border. The unusual decision to send active-duty troops to the Mexico border, rather than deploying only National Guard personnel, has sparked a wide range of reactions, from criticism to praise. As we reported earlier this week, \"Trump's political opponents called the move, which came just before the November midterm elections, an overreaction \u2014 and even a stunt.\"",

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko on Friday barred Russian men of military age from entering the country, saying the order was needed to prevent an infiltration in what appeared to be an allusion to Moscow's 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine. Poroshenko's decree comes days after he assumed martial law powers in Ukraine following a maritime skirmish in the Kerch Strait that joins the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov through Crimea. That encounter saw Russian warships fire on and seize three Ukrainian navy vessels, wounding several of their crew. \"Today, the entry of foreigners is limited \u2014 primarily citizens of the Russian Federation \u2014 non-admission of citizens of the Russian Federation aged from 16 to 60, male,\" Petro Tsygyka, the Ukrainian head of the border service, said in a televised meeting Friday. Poroshenko tweeted on Friday that the restriction was enacted to prevent the infiltration of \"private armies.\" In 2014, Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms infiltrated Crimea, taking control of Ukrainian ships and military bases on the peninsula as Moscow insisted its forces were not involved. The Kremlin has also backed an ongoing separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. On Monday, Poroshenko declared martial law in response to the latest naval incident, citing fears that Russia was planning further military action. It is set to continue until Dec. 26 in 10 regions bordering Russia. At the time, The Associated Press noted, \"Martial law will include a partial mobilization and strengthening of the country's air defense. The measures before parliament also included vaguely worded steps such as 'strengthening' anti-terrorism measures and 'information security.\" As NPR's Lucian Kim has reported, \"Domestic opponents of the unpopular president accused him of planning to use martial law as a way to suspend an election scheduled for March 31. Poroshenko only got Ukraine's boisterous parliament to approve the measure once he had watered down his proposal by reducing martial law \u2014 which entered into force Wednesday \u2014 to 30 days from 60, limiting it to border regions and promising not to postpone the election.\" A 2003 treaty between the two countries says the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov are shared territorial waters. Russia has attempted to exert greater control over the area since annexing Crimea \u2014 including opening a bridge linking Russia to the Ukrainian peninsula earlier this year. \"Ukraine's navy estimates it lost at least 80 percent of its assets and capabilities after the annexation of Crimea, as its most important bases were located on the peninsula,\" Kim reports. \"Russia's seizure of the two gunboats on the weekend is a further blow.\" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called Russia's seizure of the vessels an \"outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory.\" On Thursday, President Trump cancelled a scheduled meeting with President Vladimir Putin at G-20, citing the intensifying Russian aggression toward Ukraine.",

It is one of the many Sikh holy sites that dot the Pakistani province of Punjab. India's Sikhs have struggled to reach these sites for over 70 years. For decades, India's Sikhs have longed to reach one of their holiest sites, a soaring white temple, built on a river bank. From about 2 miles away, they constructed viewing platforms simply to gaze at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur. It is the site where Sikhs believe their faith's founder, Guru Nanak, passed away in the 16th century. But since Pakistan was partitioned from India in 1947, following the end of British rule of South Asia, the temple has been mostly out of reach. It lies in Pakistan, beyond a largely shuttered and troubled border. Most Sikhs live in India \u2014 more than 20 million people, of the country's 1.4 billion population. But in a goodwill gesture on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan broke ground on a corridor allowing Indian Sikhs visa-free access to the gurdwara. It will be part of a broader complex known as the Kartarpur Crossing. \"For 70 years, we have watched the site from 4 kilometers away,\" said Harsimrat Kaur Badal, an Indian government minister who attended the ceremony. Now, \"a new history is being written.\" It followed India's inauguration of its section of the corridor on Monday, led by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu. \"We are fulfilling the wish of thousands of Sikh devotees,\" Naidu said, according to local media. Inder Singh, 66, was one of the hundreds who traveled to Pakistan by train from the Indian city of Hyderabad to watch Khan's ceremony. \"We had never imagined this would happen,\" Singh said. \"I think it's a miracle with the grace of Baba Guru Nanak.\" Sikh worshippers gather outside their holiest site, the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.

In a rare goodwill gesture this week, India and Pakistan broke ground on a corridor that will allow visa-free travel for Indian Sikhs to the holy site. A few thousand Indian pilgrims do visit the shrine every year, but they said securing permission was difficult. Khan used the rare moment of cross-border cooperation to call for peace with India. The countries are nuclear-armed rivals that have waged three wars in their seven decades since independence. \"We want a civilized relationship,\" he said. \"There is no problem that can't be solved if you want to solve it.\" That frothy optimism was shared by pilgrims who appeared, at a distance, like a sea of colorful turbans, worn by devout Sikh men. \"Relations will definitely improve with the grace of Guru Nanak,\" said the pilgrim, Singh. \"And look, the two cricketers have done it,\" he added, referring to the provincial Indian Cabinet member Navjot Singh Sidhu \u2014 a former cricket player and old friend of Khan, an international star athlete of the sport who led Pakistan's team to Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. Plans for the crossing had been dormant since 1988, but momentum was revived after Sidhu, a Sikh, requested it be opened when he attended Khan's inauguration in August. It took several more months for India to approve. The pilgrim, Inder Singh, said despite tensions, ordinary Indians and Pakistanis want peace. \"When I descend off the train people embrace me, they invite me for tea and other things.\" Then he rushed toward the gurdwara, cordoned off with walls topped with barbed wire. Worshippers feasted outside the soaring structure, topped with several domes. Later, they thronged into the building, praying and chanting.

But analysts said it was unlikely that the corridor would warm relations. India accuses Pakistan of harboring militants who have conducted deadly cross-border attacks. The right-wing Hindu nationalist ruling party has traditionally hostile relations with Pakistan. Hinting at that chilly state of affairs, India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj declined an invitation to attend the Pakistani ceremony. In later comments, she suggested Pakistan had long delayed building the corridor. She also turned down an offer to represent India at a regional summit that was to be held in Pakistan. Many in India accuse Pakistan of supporting a Sikh separatist movement to build a homeland called Khalistan. Spotlighting those concerns, about a dozen Pakistani Sikh schoolchildren sporting matching lavender turbans briefly chanted \"Long live Khalistan!\" outside the gurdwara. They were met with silence. A former head of Pakistan's intelligence agency, Javed Ashraf Qazi, said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to build its part of the corridor with an eye on upcoming elections in May. \"By denying the Kartarpur crossing, he would have annoyed the Sikh community,\" he said. For Pakistan, Qazi said the gesture was meant to improve the country's beleaguered image abroad. \"It will certainly earn a lot of goodwill for Pakistan and Imran Khan,\" he said.

A Pakistani newspaper editorial said the move by India and Pakistan to open the crossing, however modest, was encouraging. Even if the Indian foreign minister did not attend, two ministers were dispatched, suggesting India \"does not want to ignore the growing bloc that favours a thaw,\" Pakistan Today wrote. The inauguration comes a year before Sikhs will commemorate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak's birth, an event that Pakistan hopes will bring tens of thousands of religious pilgrims and tourists. For now, the corridor's expected opening was celebrated by many Sikhs as a long-awaited balm to the trauma of being separated from their holy sites since partition. \"This is just the beginning,\" Inder Singh said. \"I hope that the days that we had 70 years ago come back.\"",

President Trump is expected to extend the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border into January rather than withdrawing the personnel in the middle of December, Pentagon officials tell NPR. The move would further extend the rare deployment of active-duty troops at the Mexico border, rather than just National Guard personnel. The deployment orders for active-duty troops had been scheduled to end on Dec. 15. But defense officials tell NPR that the much of the active-duty troop deployment is expected to be extended into January and that part of the force may also be switched out for new troops. News that the deployment will likely extend through the holidays comes days after U.S. agents fired tear gas at migrants who tried to cross into the United States from Tijuana, Mexico, on Sunday. That event took place at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry between Tijuana and San Diego \u2014  \"the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere,\" as NPR reported. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the troops are meant to support Customs and Border Protection agents and provide logistical help \u2014 everything from installing barbed wire to moving personnel to where they're needed. The troops include military engineers and military police, who are supposed to leave any actual law enforcement duties to CBP officials. Some of the active-duty military personnel are being sent to the border without weapons, as Steve Walsh of member station KPBS reported last week, during a visit to Marines and military police along a fence at the line between the U.S. and Mexico. Armed members of the force guard the Marines as they work, Walsh reported. The military deployment came after the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon to help its Border Patrol units along the southern border in October, planning for the arrival of a caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America. Trump's political opponents called the move, which came just before the November midterm elections, was called an overreaction \u2014 and even a stunt. In addition to the 5,900 active-duty personnel, the Trump administration has sent 2,100 National Guard troops to the border. When Mattis visited the deployed troops the week before Thanksgiving, he said, \"I think that it's very clear that support [for] the border police \u2014 or Border Patrol is necessary right now.\" But he did not go into detail about why the use of active-duty personnel was required. The president has called the caravan's arrival an invasion. But as of earlier this month, Mattis and others were not using those kinds of terms to describe the situation.

Click here Democrats will have control of the U.S. House once again beginning in January, thanks, in large part, to their performance in America's suburbs. Of the 41 congressional districts that Democrats turned from red to blue this election, 38 were suburban, according to an analysis by The New York Times. (Democrats may pick up one to two more seats, once all votes are counted and elections are certified.) But more granular than congressional districts overall are the counties that compose them. We mapped the percentage of House ballots cast for the party that received the most votes in each suburban county, and we looked at how that compared with 2016. (Some counties span multiple congressional districts, and the maps do not break down the vote cast by county within each congressional district.) The data came from the Associated Press vote tallies and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's designation of \"suburban\" districts. Below are some of the suburbs that had the most dramatic turnarounds. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Some of the biggest county flips in the South were in suburbs of Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas; Memphis, Tenn.; Charlotte, N.C.; Oklahoma City; and Atlanta. Democrats saw gains because of that shift between the metropolitan areas of these seven cities. Atlanta Two counties near Georgia's largest city flipped from red to blue this election: Cobb and Gwinnett. Cobb County, which spans three congressional districts, voted 54-46 for Democrats across those districts. In 2016, Cobb County voted 61 percent Republican. Gwinnett, which also spans three congressional districts, voted 56-44 for Democrats. AustinAdjacent to Texas' most liberal major city, Democrats picked up majorities in two counties that voted for Republicans last election. Hays and Williamson counties voted by close margins for Democrats. Williamson County, which falls in Texas' 31st District, split 50-48 against Republican incumbent John Carter, who ended up winning the district by fewer than 10,000 votes. CharlotteThough no counties flipped from red to blue in the Charlotte area, Democrats made gains in several of them. In Union County, for example, the Democratic share of House votes went from 32 to 39 percent in the past two years. In nearby Cabarrus County, the share went from 38 to 44 percent. Houston Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, changed from red to blue in the midterms. Sitting in the 9th and 22nd districts, Democrats went from 48 percent of the county's votes in 2016 to 54 percent this year. MemphisJust across Tennessee's state border with Mississippi, Marshall County voted 52-47 for the Democratic candidate challenging incumbent Republican Trent Kelly, who won re-election. Two years earlier, the county voted for Kelly 48-47. San AntonioSouth of the city, Atascosa and Wilson counties flipped from red to blue. The counties voted overwhelmingly for Democratic incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar over his libertarian opponent. Oklahoma City Each of the suburban counties surrounding Oklahoma City voted for Republicans, but the margins were tighter than they were in 2016. Democrats went from receiving 32 percent of House votes in Cleveland County to 41 percent and from 20 to 24 percent in Lincoln County. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Continuing a trend over the past few elections, Democrats won the West. President Trump, undoubtedly, was a major reason why. Trump's approval rating was just 37 percent in the West, in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. That was second only to the Northeast for lowest rating by region. And Democrats saw big gains because of it \u2014 picking up several seats, particularly in California. Democrats also continued the trend of turning Colorado blue, fueled by the Denver suburbs. The Midwest is turning into a true swing area. Trump was able to do well in places like Minnesota, for example. He only lost the state by fewer than 2 percentage points. But the Twin Cities metro area turned bluer than in 2016. ChicagoIn 2016, six of the seven suburban Illinois counties around Chicago voted Republican. This year, all of them voted for Democrats. One of the most dramatic turnarounds in the region was in McHenry County, where Democrats went from earning 40 percent of the House vote in 2016 to 51 percent this year. This helped propel Democrat Sean Casten, who knocked off Republican incumbent Peter Roskam. DenverArapahoe County, just east of Denver, voted mostly in the state's 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jason Crow unseated Republican incumbent Mike Coffman. The county, which voted mostly for Republicans in the last election, went for Crow by a 17-point margin,  57-40 percent. Nearby Douglas County, which favored Republicans, went from casting 30 percent of its votes for Democrats two years ago to 41 percent this year. Los AngelesEven though Orange County is just outside Los Angeles, the CDC's urban-rural scale technically doesn't consider it a suburb but a large central metro. Still, something big happened there that's worth noting. Orange County has traditionally had been an area dominated by Republicans, or at least a place where the GOP did well. Consider that before these midterm elections, Republicans held four of the six congressional seats in Orange County. Come January, Democrats will control all six. What's more, every single congressional district that touches the Pacific Ocean was won by Democrats, except one in Washington state. A note about California: San Bernardino County, which is geographically the largest suburban county in the United States and contains five different congressional districts, flipped from blue to red over the past two years. So what happened there? California has a top-two primary system, where the two highest primary vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party. In the 8th Congressional District, two Republicans advanced this year. This inflated the total number of Republican votes cast in the county. In 2016, the same thing happened in Orange County. There, two Democrats ran against each other in the state's 46th District. MinneapolisWashington County, east of the Twin Cities, cast 53 percent of its House votes for Democrats this year \u2014 up from 45 percent in 2016. The county is part of the state's 2nd Congressional District, where Democrat Angie Craig beat Republican incumbent Jason Lewis. PortlandIn the cross-state suburb, Washington's Clark County voted 51-49 against incumbent Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler. Yamhill County, southwest of Portland in Oregon, voted 50-45 in favor of Democratic incumbent Suzanne Bonamici. Both incumbents won their re-election bids. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Nowhere is Trump's brand worse than in the Northeast, and within just four states \u2014 Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York \u2014 there were 11 Democratic pickups in districts that included suburban counties. As in California, these suburbs, full of well-off, educated people, used to be prime GOP turf. New YorkDemocrats made big progress west of the Big Apple in Morris County, N.J., where they went from receiving 37 percent of the vote in 2016 to 52 percent this year. This contributed to the defeat of incumbent Rep. Leonard Lance, as well as the Democrats' flipping the state's 11th Congressional District from red to blue. That seat was previously a Republican stronghold represented by retiring Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen. PittsburghNone of the suburban counties around the Steel City flipped from red to blue, though they did move more in Democrats' direction. Beaver County, for example, went from voting 41 percent to 48 percent Democratic. And Fayette County went from 37 to 42 percent Democratic. PhiladelphiaOf the four suburban counties neighboring Philadelphia, only one \u2014 Delaware County \u2014 cast most of its House votes for Democrats in 2016. And even that was close; Delaware County voted just 52 percent for Democrats. This year, though, three went for Democrats. And Delaware County? It went from being barely blue in 2016 to solidly Democratic this year at 62 percent. Rochester, N.Y.Democrats flipped two suburban counties surrounding the Western New York city of Rochester: Niagara and Ontario counties. They also made a 15-point gain in Livingston County in the state's 27th Congressional District, where Republican incumbent Chris Collins is under federal indictment for alleged insider trading. Washington, D.C.Democrats strengthened their lead in already-blue suburbs and took back others around the nation's capital. In Frederick County, Md., for example, Democrats went from receiving 44 to 50 percent of the vote, and in Prince William County, Va., they went from 46 to a whopping 63 percent. Prince William contributed to Democrats' success in beating incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock in Virginia's 10th Congressional District. NPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited active duty soldiers deployed at the border near McAllen, Texas. About 5,000 troops are being sent to the border in response to a caravan of migrants headed to the U.S.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: In the weeks leading up to the election, President Trump warned of a threat to national security. What he was referring to was a caravan of mostly Central American migrants moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. He ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents, and most of these troops are already in place. And the first members of the caravan are just reaching the border. In a moment, we're going to hear from NPR's Carrie Kahn on the Mexican side of the border. But first, we're going to go to NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman who's joining us in the studio now to talk about the border deployment. Hey, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hello. CHANG: So Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was on the border today. Tell us about his visit. BOWMAN: Well, he visited active-duty Army troops outside McAllen, Texas, the far eastern portion of the Mexican border. And he defended the deployment as a way to help the Department of Homeland Security. That department asked for Pentagon assistance. Here's Mattis (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM MATTIS: I think that it's very clear that support the border police - or Border Patrol is necessary right now. If they come to me and say, we do not have the people to put in barbed wire; we don't have the capability to use helicopters to move people; we don't have the helicopters... BOWMAN: Now, Mattis said troops have been sent to the border in the past going back several administrations, both Democrats and Republicans. But in almost all cases, they were National Guard troops and not active-duty troops. So Mattis didn't explain why that was necessary to send active troops. And of course, the president can immediately dispatch troops anywhere. That's why some on the Hill are calling this a stunt. And it's funny, Ailsa, because I was talking with a senior Pentagon official just a few days before these deployments. CHANG: Yeah? BOWMAN: And I said, hey, you guys sending troops to the border? I keep hearing the White House talking about that. CHANG: (Laughter). BOWMAN: And he said, it's not necessary. We have more than 2,000 Guard troops down there already helping the Border Patrol. CHANG: Wow. I mean, the message that we're getting from the Pentagon during this deployment is that, quote, \"border security is national security.\" But is that the same as saying this caravan represents some sort of threat to national security? BOWMAN: Well, I think Mattis was talking in general terms. And he was careful not to be alarmist, as President Trump has been. The president called this an invasion. Mattis and others are not using those kinds of terms. But Mattis did say that Mexican police clashed with some in the caravan on the border between Guatemala and Mexico, so he is indicating it's a possible threat. But still, most American troops - active-duty troops will not carry weapons. Only MPs, military police, will carry weapons... CHANG: OK. BOWMAN: ...We're told. And again, he said they'll likely be far away from any migrants. CHANG: So if that's the case, what is the role of these active-duty troops if these migrants actually do overwhelm Customs and Border Patrol agents? BOWMAN: Well, there's no sense of that yet. But again, they're in a support role, as Secretary Mattis said. And the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits troops from taking part in any kind of law enforcement activity. Of course, in addition to these troops heading down there, there's also more border police being sent to shore up these crossing points. So the sense is that they should be sufficient to deal with any sort of problem at these border crossings. And again, the military is also adding fencing, barbed wire and so forth, so that should help the situation. CHANG: So how long are these troops going to be there? BOWMAN: Well, Ailsa, the deployment is supposed to end on December 15, but they could be extended. We have no sense of that right now. CHANG: So if these troops are down there indefinitely, I mean, how much is all of this going to cost? Are there any projections? BOWMAN: You know, Secretary Mattis was asked about that today, the cost of this operation. He said we're still calculating the cost. So we have no sense, but we're talking millions of dollars or maybe even tens of millions of dollars. Any time you move this many troops and you have helicopters and cargo planes and so forth, it's a lot of money. CHANG: That's NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Republican candidates across the country aired a lot of campaign ads intended to stoke fears about illegal immigration. But the results were mixed, and some of the most outspoken hard-liners lost.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Republican successes in Tuesday's elections are looking narrower and, in some cases, in doubt. Ballot counting in the Arizona Senate race has given a slight lead to the Democrat. Florida's races for governor and senator are heading for recounts, and counting continues in Georgia. Still, Republicans strove to limit the damage in an otherwise Democratic year. President Trump unleashed ferocious rhetoric targeting immigrants. One ad was deemed so racist that networks, including Fox, stopped airing it. So did that rhetoric work? Here's NPR's Joel Rose. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: If you live in a place where the elections this week were close, you might have seen - TV ads full of sinister, shadowy figures, police sirens and migrants on the move, like this one, attacking Democrat Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Spanberger defended the violent gang MS-13 and supports sanctuary cities. And pro-amnesty radicals are pouring millions into Spanberger's campaign. ROSE: Congressman Dave Brat frequently tried to portray his opponent as soft on immigration. Its a strategy that worked for him in 2014, when he stunned the political world by defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary. But it didn't work this time. Across the country, candidates, mostly Republicans, spent more than a hundred-million dollars on immigration ads in races from Pennsylvania to Iowa to California, and a lot of them came up short. Elaine Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. ELAINE KAMARCK: If you look at the governors' races and the House races, you have to say that immigration didn't seem to be the magic that the Republicans were looking for. ROSE: There were a lot of issues playing out on Tuesday night, but President Trump made his crackdown on immigration a central part of his pitch to voters. Still, that failed to translate into success for some prominent immigration hawks in the party, including Kris Kobach, who is running for governor in Kansas. Elaine Kamarck says the GOP immigration strategy got mixed results. KAMARCK: There are some people that are going to be swayed by these scary immigration ads and others that won't be. It's obviously not an issue that you would use everywhere. ROSE: Kamarck says the GOP's immigration scare tactics did not play well with suburban voters, who are angry about the administration's hardline policies like separating migrant families. But she suspects the ads did help to turn out rural voters, who say growing immigrant populations are taking jobs and benefits away from citizens in places like Tennessee and Missouri, where Republican Senate candidates won this week. And in Indiana, where Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly was unseated by Republican Mike Braun, who put out a flurry of immigration ads. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) MIKE BRAUN: We must build the wall, ban sanctuary cities and put an end to chain migration. There are lives at stake. ROSE: Meanwhile, down in Texas, Republican Senator Ted Cruz fended off a serious challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke with TV ads that called the Democrat Open Borders O'Rourke and accused him of encouraging the migrant caravan to come to the United States. Those ads helped Cruz's cause, says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration. MARK KRIKORIAN: That's the kind of place where advertising on the immigration issue, the border issue, really could make a difference. ROSE: But immigrant rights advocates say the GOP's immigration strategy backfired. Frank Sharry is with America's Voice. FRANK SHARRY: Did Trump's exploitation of racism and xenophobia work to mobilize some of his voters? Probably. Did it also mobilize a backlash made up of voters of color and suburban whites, educated of all backgrounds? Yes. ROSE: Immigration hawks, however, say without those ads, the results on Tuesday could have been worse for the GOP. Joel Rose, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And while there are areas of common ground, there are also vast obstacles to cooperation.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: This week's midterm elections are going to be reshaping the policy landscape here in Washington. After two years in which Republicans controlled every lever of power, Democrats will soon have a seat at the table. President Trump insists he's not worried by that. Despite the rancor of the midterm elections, he sees opportunities for legislative dealmaking. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble, that we agree very much with them and they agree with us. I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity. CHANG: But the president also warned that cooperation could quickly evaporate if House Democrats use their new powers to investigate his administration. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: House Democrats have been out of power for eight long years. Congresswoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois says they used that time in the political wilderness to draw up a game plan they can put to work in January when they reclaim their House majority. CHERI BUSTOS: So yeah, we're ready on day one, and we're ready with an agenda that will work for people in our country. HORSLEY: Bustos, who co-chairs the Democrats' Policy and Communications Committee, says at the top of that list is a large-scale public works program to rebuild vital infrastructure while putting millions of people to work. BUSTOS: We know that for every $1 we invest in roads and bridges and high-speed Internet and rail, we get a $2 return on that. So we think we can work together with Republicans across the aisle. HORSLEY: President Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also pointed to infrastructure as a potential area of cooperation. Trump campaigned on that two years ago, although there are big differences between the parties in how to pay for it. Trump's plan relied on borrowed money and privatization while Democrats would use public dollars raised in part through a slightly higher gasoline tax. Democrats also have a proposal to rein in the high cost of prescription drugs, which McConnell notes is something the president has pushed for as well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Yeah, I can't imagine that that won't be on the agenda. HORSLEY: At the same time, Democratic control of the House will put a roadblock in the path of some potential Republican initiatives. Forget about another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And McConnell says any effort to address the cost of Medicare and Social Security will have to wait. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MCCONNELL: The Democrats have made it perfectly clear they're not interested in dealing with entitlements. And they're in a position to say no, and so I don't think that'll be on the agenda. HORSLEY: Democrats have also promised to use their new House majority to conduct vigorous oversight. Nancy Pelosi, who's confident she'll be the next House speaker, says Democrats will investigate policies like family separation at the border using subpoenas if necessary. At a White House news conference today, Trump warned that could poison any chance of cooperation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt. And I would blame them. HORSLEY: Congresswoman Bustos strongly disputes that idea. She notes oversight of the administration is one of lawmakers' traditional roles. BUSTOS: The problem has been with the Republican leadership. They've taken a hands-off approach and turned a blind eye to the corruption that's out there. HORSLEY: The White House is already preparing for what could be a flurry of congressional investigations. But McConnell offered his own warning that oversight or what he called presidential harassment could backfire on the Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MCCONNELL: I remember when we tried in the late '90s. We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up, and ours went down. HORSLEY: McConnell offered a rare smile this morning as he reflected on Republicans' numbers in the Senate, which are going up as a result of the midterms. He says his top priority will be using that majority to confirm more conservative judges to the federal bench. And despite their gains in the House, there's nothing Democrats can do to stop that.

This story was updated as of 6 p.m. Wednesday Nov. 7. This was a midterm election in which both parties took some lumps, but could also take some satisfaction. And no one is better at taking satisfaction than President Trump. The president began crowing long before dawn, when midterm election results were still rolling in, taking to Twitter at a moment when the tally was tilting his way. Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all! The president was entitled to a partial victory lap. In recent weeks, he had stormed the states where he could do the most for Republican candidates, several of whom were being outshone by the Democrats' fresher faces. He rallied in these red states and brought out the reddest of votes. Trump helped the Republicans overcome what had seemed an advantage in enthusiasm that was energizing Democrats in half-a-dozen states with marquee statewide races. President Trump arrives at a campaign rally for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun in Fort Wayne, Ind., on Monday. Braun defeated Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P.

Braun defeated Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. His impact was undeniable. In these specific cases, Trump could claim his intervention in the endgame was the GOP's not-so-secret weapon and deciding factor. And the Republicans wound up ahead in several of those marquee statewide races. So for those who concentrate on the flashy stars and the largest states, Trump could boast of his breakthroughs. The House But not all states had high-profile statewide races. In fact, the only vote that was held throughout the country was for the House of Representatives and all its 435 seats. Democrats won more than 218 of these, giving them the majority in the chamber for the first time since 2010. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum gives his concession speech in Tallahassee, Fla., on Tuesday. Gillum fell short in his bid against Republican Ron DeSantis.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum gives his concession speech in Tallahassee, Fla., on Tuesday. Gillum fell short in his bid against Republican Ron DeSantis. That's why you also heard a victory speech from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is likely to return as speaker of the House with the new Democratic majority in January. And, it should be noted, the Democrats got the majority back by winning the total national raw vote for House candidates by several points.  That was the closest thing to a national balloting we will have between 2016 and 2020. The Democrats had to win by at least that much to take the majority, because in more than a few states, their candidates had to overcome not only their opponents, but also the district lines within which they had to run. Those lines on congressional maps, drawn by Republican legislatures and governors after the 2010 census, have been widely acknowledged as the most efficient and effective gerrymandering in the two centuries that both parties have practiced it.

Sherrod Brown celebrate his campaign victory in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday night. Brown defeated Republican challenger Jim Renacci to win a third term in the Senate. The Senate In a sense, the Senate map offered Republicans a similar kind of structural advantage: There were 35 seats on the ballot around the country, and only nine of them belonged to Republicans.  The rest of the 51 GOP members had years yet to run on their six-year terms, so in effect four of every five Republicans in the Senate already had their tickets to the 116th Congress. Of the nine who did have to risk defeat, only one was in a state Trump had lost in 2016. That state, Nevada, ousted Republican incumbent Dean Heller on Tuesday, in spite of Trump's repeated visits and rallies. The Democrats, in stark contrast had to defend 26 Senate seats this fall, more than half their total.  Worse yet, 10 were in states Trump had carried in 2016. And sure enough, at least three of those 10 fell to Trump's party on Tuesday. Two others were too close to call as of Wednesday night. Interestingly, however, Democratic incumbents won fairly easily in the other five: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia, where Trump in 2016 won by 42 points. Nationwide, the Democrats won close to two-thirds of all the Senate races and garnered 57% of the nationwide vote for that office. On yet another scoreboard, Democrats managed to narrow the gap in governorships Tuesday, winning about half the 36 seats at stake on the day and narrowing the overall GOP advantage in the category from double-digits to just three. The Democrats flipped previously Republican governorships in seven states: Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, New Mexico, Nevada and Maine.  The Republicans captured the statehouse in Alaska, where it had been held by an Independent. But they missed in Florida, where Andrew Gillum conceded a race he narrowly lost, and Ohio, where first-time candidate Richard Cordray fell short against veteran Mike DeWine. In Georgia, their candidate, Stacey Abrams, pointed to missing votes and allegations of voter suppression in refusing to concede. As with the House and Senate, the overall national raw vote for governor favored the Democrats as a party. It is important to remember in all this that these contests were not conducted simply to fill a scorecard, but to fill some of the most important offices in our democratic system of government. And having fulfilled that function, this election is likely to fill Washington and many a state capital with rancor and wrangling for many months to come. Republican Sen.

The House majority will be narrow, and some tension surrounds its choice of a speaker and other officers. But if the Democrats are likely to scrap with each other, they will be united in opposition to the president and his administration. They will resist Senate attempts to enact more of the president's legislative agenda, with the possible exception of higher infrastructure spending. They will seize every opportunity to probe, investigate and question the president's Cabinet and White House team. Expect protracted wrestling matches over documents and testimony beginning soon after the first of the year. One other consequence of the election may be heightened tension over the Dec. 7 deadline for passing the remaining appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The president wants full funding of his wall on the Mexican border and threatens to withhold his signature on other appropriations until he gets it. In the lame-duck session expected to begin later this month, resolving this showdown without a government shutdown will be the first priority. And it will also provide the first test of all that talk of comity and compromise you heard from winning candidates at their victory parties on Tuesday night.",

On Tuesday, Davis lost her clerkship in Rowan County, Ky. Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk whose refusal to sign marriage certificates for same-sex couples grabbed national headlines in 2015, has lost her bid for re-election to the Rowan County clerkship. The Republican lost to Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr., 54 percent to 46 percent. With all 19 precincts reporting, preliminary results show Caudill earned 4,210 votes to Davis' 3,566. It was Davis' first time facing re-election since her fight against same-sex marriage landed her briefly in jail in 2015. She had defied the Supreme Court's ruling that year in Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, explaining that distributing marriage licenses to such couples went against her beliefs as a member of the Apostolic Church. Her refusal quickly became a lightning rod of controversy, drawing support from social conservatives and anger from same-sex-marriage advocates. Held in contempt for declining to fulfill a key pillar of her duties as county clerk, Davis found herself thrown in jail for several days \u2014 and all the while, demonstrators across the political spectrum descended on the small county of some 23,000 people. When she was released in September 2015, a large rally of conservatives \u2014 including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee \u2014 was there to greet her. These days, her national profile has diminished, though she has retained enough cultural cachet to campaign against same-sex marriage beyond U.S. borders. Just last year, Davis flew to Romania to push for a change to the country's constitution that would define marriage as specifically between a man and a woman. Now, back at home, Davis is out of a job. Her victorious opponent, Caudill, inevitably got caught up in the swirling controversy around same-sex-marriage licenses as well. Caudill's rival in the Democratic primary earlier this year, David Ermold, was one of the men whom Davis had denied a license in 2015. Despite dramatically outraising Caudill, Ermold failed to win the nomination. But after Ermold's loss, he refused to throw his support behind his fellow Democrat, asserting in a Facebook post this summer that Caudill was an anti-gay bigot.",

Updated at 3:44 a.m. ET Wednesday Republicans and Democrats will split control of Congress next year. House Democrats are projected to pick up enough GOP-held seats to take the majority in the House, according to The Associated Press. Senate Republicans are projected to maintain and perhaps expand their majority. The results create a divided Capitol Hill next year and mean President Trump's plans for new tax cuts, tougher immigration legislation and changes to the Affordable Care Act will be blocked. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared victory late Tuesday night and Trump called her to congratulate her on the win. \"We have all had enough of division. The American people want peace; they want results; they want us to work for positive results for their lives,\" Pelosi said at an election night celebration with top House Democratic leaders. And after Trump's concentrated focus on rallying in the final weeks of the campaign, Senate Democrats in several red states suffered projected losses. The GOP is poised to enlarge its majority by at least two seats. Republicans will maintain control of the Senate for at least two more years, after Democratic losses in Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, North Dakota \u2014 states that Trump won by double digits in 2016. The president campaigned aggressively in those states. Senate GOP leaders capitalized on a battleground map that left Democrats defending 26 seats, including 10 in states Trump won in 2016. Now they must defend Trump's hard-line rhetoric and policy on issues like immigration and trade, despite tensions within the party over those same issues. Trump was not on the ballot this year, but the midterm election was viewed as a nationwide referendum on his leadership. Now, leaders from both parties will pursue vastly different agendas on Capitol Hill. Democrats in the House vow to launch wide-ranging investigations into Trump, his business dealings and the transparency of his administration. Republicans in the Senate will continue to install more Trump nominees to the federal judiciary and defend the president and his policies. Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, tweeted late Tuesday about the phone call between the president and the House minority leader: \"President Trump called Leader Pelosi at 11:45 p.m. this evening to extend his congratulations on winning a Democratic House Majority. He acknowledged the Leader's call for bipartisanship in her victory remarks.\" A divided Congress is likely to extend the heated battles of the 2018 campaign into the presidential election in 2020. Early vote data released early Tuesday indicated that the electorate was younger and more diverse than in the last midterm election. Turnout levels were significantly higher across several demographic groups, and up in states with competitive Senate contests \u2014 Arizona, Texas and Nevada. The president's impact played out differently in the roughly 80 competitive House races and more than a dozen close Senate contests. House battlefield hinged on contests in suburban and exurban districts Demands within the Democratic Party will test the power and influence of leaders like Nancy Pelosi, who plans to seek another term as speaker of the House.\n                \n                    \n                    Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demands within the Democratic Party will test the power and influence of leaders like Nancy Pelosi, who plans to seek another term as speaker of the House. Democrats pinned their hopes for retaking the House on boosting turnout among women and minorities and wooing moderate suburban voters who were turned off by Trump. They focused on recruiting diverse candidates that might have once seemed outside the box for the party. That included gun owners and military veterans \u2014 and a lot of female candidates. The strategy was well-tailored to turn out voters for House seats, and a record number of women will be sworn in early next year. But the election also likely means Democrats will have to bridge the demands of a party that has grown to embrace progressives, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won in a safely Democratic district in New York, while electing moderates like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, who won a special election earlier this year and won Tuesday in a reconfigured district. Such a Democratic caucus will test the power and influence of leaders like Pelosi, who plans to seek another term as speaker of the House. Pelosi has been criticized by a vocal group inside the caucus as being out of touch with her changing party and unwilling to provide opportunities to newer members. She was the subject of millions of dollars in Republican attack ads this cycle, forcing more than a dozen candidates to publicly vow not to support her for speaker. That divide could make it difficult for House Democrats to unify around an agenda. There will be pressure from her most progressive flank to vote on proposals like a \"Medicare-for-all\" health care plan. But Pelosi has promised to focus first on government and campaign finance reform measures. \"When we win, on the opening day, our Democratic Congress will be open and transparent,\" Pelosi said at an event Tuesday morning. Republicans will have to battle an opposite trend. Many moderate members chose to retire rather than face tough re-election campaigns. With the bulk of the competitive races focused in suburban districts, GOP candidates and leadership aides worried the president's tough rhetoric about immigration may have turned off women and independents in those areas. House Speaker Paul Ryan appealed to the president the weekend before the election to focus on the strong economy and benefits from the 2017 tax cut. While Trump did boast about these accomplishments, he continued to emphasize his push to crack down on the \"caravan\" \u2014 the group of Central American migrants heading toward the Mexican border with the United States. He also declared he would end birthright citizenship with an executive order \u2014 a proposal Ryan said would be unconstitutional. House GOP leaders are expecting to oversee a more conservative conference next year, with many of their losses coming in seats held by centrists. That tilt to the right is likely to mean even more pressure by top leaders for members to stick together to vote on legislation that is closely aligned to Trump and his agenda. Senate races in mostly red states benefited from Trump focus Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky talks to reporters after the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Oct. 6.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky talks to reporters after the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Oct. 6. Senate Democrats had faced a steep challenge as they fought to keep seats in states Trump won by double-digit margins in the worst battlefield for any party in modern history. Just six Republicans were up for re-election; all but one of them ran in safely Republican states. Democrats landed on a plan to allow each vulnerable Democrat to run an independent campaign without a unified platform. For example, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota could stump on protecting farmers while Joe Manchin in West Virginia promised new health protections for coal miners. But Republicans had the advantage of simply reminding their base of all of the times Democrats voted against Trump. Heitkamp reached out to Trump White House officials and attempted to craft a bipartisan posture, but she voted against Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. And other red state Senate Democrats running for re-election \u2014 Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana \u2014 did the same. Trump personally played a significant role in tight Senate contests in the closing weeks of the election cycle. He traveled to Indiana, Florida, Montana, Nevada, Missouri and Mississippi \u2014 and in some cases landed in dramatic fashion aboard Air Force One to crowds of supporters enthusiastically cheering his red-meat speeches focused mostly on immigration and warnings about what Democratic control meant for his agenda. His visits included overt reminders to his base supporters that they weren't just voting for any Republican on the ballot \u2014 they were voting for senators promising to back his priorities. \"They want to raise your taxes, the Democrats do, restore crippling regulations, shut down your new steel mills, take away your health care, and put illegal aliens before American citizens,\" Trump said in a closing rally in Indiana on Monday. \"If you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow.\" A year of big money and big controversy Democrats benefited from a flood of donations to official party organizations and outside groups working on their side. Democratic candidates and their outside supporters are expected to spend more than $2.5 billion on this year's election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Republican candidates and their backers are on track to spend $2.2 billion. Fundraising in 2018 far outpaced what is normal for a miderm election. Both parties saw dramatic surges in donations that were closely correlated with national political events like the hearings on sexual assault allegations during the confirmation of Kavanaugh. Donors responded to heated political battles, like funding a wall on the border with Mexico and Republicans' failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by flooding candidates with cash.

The race for governor has captured the most attention with attacks and counter-attacks from both candidates.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Let's check in now on Georgia. The governor's race there is one of the tightest and most bitter in the country. Stephannie Stokes of member station WABE reports on how voters in the Atlanta area are feeling. STEPHANNIE STOKES, BYLINE: Alice Lovelace has a huge smile on her face as she walks out of a southwest Atlanta library. She can barely get words out. ALICE LOVELACE: I - I - I am - I am so proud. I'm just so proud. Let's turn out the young people. It's just amazing. STOKES: This is her usual polling place. She's lived in this neighborhood for 20 years and has never seen a line. But this morning, when Lovelace arrived at 7, there was a 30-minute wait. LOVELACE: This is the longest line I've ever been so happy to stand in (laughter). It's beautiful. STOKES: The precinct in a historically black part of the city is full of excitement. For November Scandrett, another voter, it's because of what the Democratic candidate for governor represents. NOVEMBER SCANDRETT: It was empowering, you know, to see someone that looks like me. STOKES: Stacey Abrams would be the first black female governor in the country, and Scandrett says that matters to her. SCANDRETT: I know my ancestors and my grandparents would be proud if they were alive because they never foresaw any of this. STOKES: Lovelace says that milestone would be great, but she also thinks Abrams would signal a shift. She's so upset about national politics, she started ignoring it all. LOVELACE: I decided instead I would simply concentrate on this day and that this day would be the referendum. STOKES: That today will be a referendum is precisely what's worrying Republican voters here. Lines are just about as long at a recreation center 20 miles north in Atlanta's suburbs. Brian Martin brought his family to vote. How are you feeling today? BRIAN MARTIN: A little nervous. STOKES: With all of the attention on the governor's race, he hopes the contest doesn't end up being a national win for Democrats. He supports the Trump administration and is backing Georgia's Republican candidate for governor, Brian Kemp. MARTIN: Trends are good. I'm not worried about an occasional non-PC tweet, so I'm happy with the way things are going. STOKES: Like Trump, Kemp has bragged about not being politically correct. Jim Munsell is afraid the national conservative agenda is on the line, particularly around immigration. He knows immigrants are valuable to Georgia. They work in the state's farms. JIM MUNSELL: You know, they're really hurt when they don't have them, so I'm not against it, but I want them to come in the right way and do it legally. STOKES: So the country can keep track of who's here. Munsell thinks the border wall President Trump has promised would help. MUNSELL: And that's probably not going to happen if the conservatives don't get get in power again. STOKES: But he does agree with democratic Georgians on one thing. He says no matter what, more people voting in the midterms is good. For NPR News, I'm Stephannie Stokes in Atlanta. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Each party is selling a different version of the future through their respective political ads.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Unless you have already voted early, tomorrow is the big day to head to your polling station and have your say after months of hearing from the candidates. Each party is selling a different version of the future through their respective political ads. So we're going to take a moment now to talk ads with NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hey there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. KELLY: Glad to have you with us. Start with the Republicans. You've been watching all their ads. What do they tell us about the case that Republicans are making to voters? MONTANARO: Well, the fact of the matter is Republicans really wanted to start this election talking about local issues. Jobs and the economy have been very good. They were hoping the president, frankly, would push that. Instead, that's not so much what they're closing on. They're closing on this. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"COREY STEWART FOR GOVERNOR - TV AD\") UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Stewart cracked down on illegals, as governor, will ban sanctuary cities and... (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"SO CONSERVATIVE\") BRIAN KEMP: I got a big truck just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and... (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"LOU BARLETTA LAUNCHES 'RALLY' AD\") LOU BARLETTA: We want to secure our borders. We want to put an end to illegal immigration once and for all. MONTANARO: So Republicans really at the outset had this kind of internal conflict, whether or not they were going to separate themselves from President Trump, whether they were going to tie themselves to him. And, you know... KELLY: They've gone for the latter, it sounds like from those ads. MONTANARO: Absolutely. This president has talked over and over again about immigration and the fear that comes with immigrants coming into the country illegally for his base, which was a foundational thing. And they were really nervous that the Republican base would stay home. And this they're hoping fires them up and gets them to the polls. KELLY: Unusual for a president in a midterm election year to have so much sway over what candidates are putting in their political messaging? MONTANARO: Presidents historically have a problem in their first midterm where their parties wind up losing a lot of seats. So most of the time, people try to distance themselves from the president or the - if - especially if the president's unpopular, and this president right now is historically unpopular. But it doesn't matter. He is going to be - whether or not he's the anchor around Republicans' ankles or he's the plane that carries them across the finish line. KELLY: (Laughter) Trying to keep up with the metaphors here (laughter). MONTANARO: Me too. KELLY: Join me to a Democratic metaphor here. They do not see immigration as the key to turning out their base. What are Democratic ads focused on? MONTANARO: Not at all. Democrats have been laser-like focused on health care. And they've started from the very beginning of this campaign saying that they were going to run on health care, and that's exactly what they've run on. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"HEIDI HEITKAMP: 'DENISE'\") DENISE SANDVICK: Mr. Cramer, I don't know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for preexisting conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"DEAD WRONG\") JOE MANCHIN: Now the threat is Patrick Morrisey's lawsuit to take away health care. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"WRECKING BALL - LIZZIE PANNILL FLETCHER FOR CONGRESS\") LIZZIE PANNILL FLETCHER: We all know our health care system is broken. And Congress could help fix it. But John Culberson is taking a wrecking ball to it. MONTANARO: What's fascinating there is the two Democrats that you hear in that ad - Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia - very conservative states, and they are running on health care as well. It's a huge turn because in 2010, Republicans were able to use Obamacare as a way to take back the House. This time around, especially when it comes to protecting preexisting conditions, Democrats are running on health care. And Republicans say it's effective and has put a lot of their candidates on their back foot. KELLY: Anything that strikes you that's not being talked about in the political messaging? MONTANARO: Well, I mean, you know, when you have an economy that's as strong as it is, and you have a president who's going around instead of talking about the details of the economy and how that economy is benefiting regular people and trying to reach out to independents - instead at his rallies, he acknowledges it briefly and then moves on to really rev up the base with immigration. KELLY: Has that shifted a little bit in the closing days of the campaign, though? The president at numerous rallies this weekend was saying, look at the numbers from Friday. They're great. MONTANARO: Sure. He says, look at the numbers, look at the numbers. They're great. They're great. But it's not the kind of salient issue that drives out his base. And he's nervous about it. Frankly, he admitted that talking about the economy for him is boring. So he doesn't want to have to do it. KELLY: Are the ads keeping up with the candidates? By which I mean, there's this lag time to put together a highly polished, produced ad. And in this environment where, with one tweet, the whole thing can change on a dime, are you hearing the same messaging on TV, on the radio and broadcasts as you're hearing from the candidates who are out stumping? MONTANARO: Well, what Republicans tell me is that this election has been about, quote, \"volatility,\" that no single issue has really broken through in a way that can help them. Tax cuts was the thing that Republicans were supposed to try to run on. Instead, now polling shows tax cuts as something that benefits Democrats. KELLY: Right. MONTANARO: And Republicans have seen that as a major problem. At the same time, Democrats see President Trump as the floor in this election. In other words, sort of... KELLY: What does that mean? MONTANARO: ...Sort of the foundation for the House to be built on. They don't need to talk about President Trump because President Trump is already what's driven out a record number of candidates, especially women candidates, to run in 2018. And they know that if they can build, you know, the Sheetrock in the House with health care and increased wages and saying that the tax cuts are a, quote, \"scam\" to take away your Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that that can win over persuadable voters. KELLY: And with one day to go, NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro, thank you. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "What are the final cases Republicans and Democrats are making to the electorate before Tuesday's election? Weekend campaign rallies demonstrate the messaging parties hope will tip the balance.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We are hearing closing arguments now, the final case Republicans and Democrats are making before tomorrow's election. Steve Inskeep went to two weekend campaign rallies. They were in different states, for different gubernatorial candidates, but each rally featured a presidential headliner. And we begin in Atlanta, Ga. ASHLEY WESTERMAN, BYLINE: But there's a big line right there. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Producer Ashley Westerman and I walked outside the basketball arena at Morehouse College. Are you the very first person in line? BARBARA MCKEE: Very first person. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. What's your name, if you don't mind my asking? MCKEE: I'm Barbara McKee. INSKEEP: Barbara McKee, how long you been standing here? MCKEE: Well, since about 8:30 last night, 8:45. INSKEEP: No. MCKEE: Last night, yes. INSKEEP: No. She was using a walker. She has cancer. Why was it so important to be first in line? MCKEE: Because Stacey is an advocate for Medicare. So it's very important that she get in because I'm on Medicare. INSKEEP: Stacey is Stacey Abrams, Georgia's Democratic candidate for governor. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Chanting) Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. INSKEEP: Jackie Stewart and Nikita Hammond want a Democratic governor and a Democratic Congress. What is one thing you want the next Congress to do? JACKIE STEWART: Health care. NIKITA HAMMOND: No, no, no, no. The first thing Congress needs to do is protect Mueller. INSKEEP: Oh, the Mueller investigation, the Russia investigation. HAMMOND: Yes, they need to protect Mueller. Once they protect Mueller, then they can do everything else. INSKEEP: Some people who filed inside were dressed up in three-piece suits and heels. This is Forbes Arena. We've got in ahead of some of the crowd, which is now filling a kind of mosh pit on the basketball floor in front of the stage, people filling the stands as well. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: American flags, giant American flags, have been set up along with big signs that say simply, vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAPHAEL WARNOCK: Hello, Democrats. INSKEEP: Raphael Warnock is pastor of the church where Martin Luther King once preached. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARNOCK: God calls us to faith and action. So we recommit ourselves, oh, God, tonight to the work of justice and to the art of democracy. We thank you for sending us servant leaders... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. Stacey. STACEY ABRAMS: My name is Stacey Abrams, and I intend to be the next governor of Georgia. INSKEEP: She wants to be the nation's first black female governor. Atlanta star power was in the room - the rapper 2 Chainz, the actor Chris Tucker, Kandi Burruss of \"Real Housewives Of Atlanta.\" The crowd was racially diverse, young and old. At least one person identified as trans, and one woman wore a peach-colored headscarf. Peach - it's Georgia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: Thank you. INSKEEP: In a conservative state, the candidate for governor wore a purple blazer and sometimes sounded centrist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: When I was the House minority leader, I blocked the largest tax increase on working families in Georgia history. INSKEEP: But she's more progressive than past Southern Democrats, promising to expand Medicaid and spend on public schools. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: That's why I intend to be Georgia's public education governor. INSKEEP: She has also advocated voting rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: And the thing of it is, I've had to do this against Georgia's homegrown architect of voter suppression. INSKEEP: Abrams' opponent is the Georgia secretary of state. Brian Kemp is overseeing his own election and was criticized for cutting many people from voter rolls. Kemp accused Abrams herself of failing to register them properly, but she made fair elections part of her message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: I know that we can't wait for change. As someone said, we must be the change we want to see. INSKEEP: The Democratic candidate never mentioned the president, at least not the current president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAMS: State of Georgia, the 44th president of the United States, President Barack Hussein Obama. INSKEEP: He wore a dark blazer and an open-collared shirt, and he'd gone hoarse during a round of campaign stops. People shouted they couldn't hear him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: Well, there's only so much I can do because my voice is starting to go. So you just got to pay real close attention. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. But maybe most of all, the character of our country is on the ballot. INSKEEP: The former president noted that Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare. But now that it's more popular, Republicans are pledging to protect a key part of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Suddenly, they are saying that they're the ones to protect people with pre-existing conditions. They - I want everybody to pay attention to this - they have literally been doing the opposite of what they're now saying. INSKEEP: Obama finished his closing argument urging his supporters to turn Georgia blue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: God bless you, these United States of America. INSKEEP: And we got a night's sleep before heading to the airport the next morning. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Zone 2, you're welcome to board. INSKEEP: Well, that's our zone. We finished the Democratic rally here in Atlanta, and now we're boarding a flight to Pensacola, Fla., to attend a very different rally with a different president. Where Democrats met in a gym, Republicans told supporters to meet the president at an airport in Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF JETS ROARING) INSKEEP: We're in the sunshine. We're in a field. It's on the edge of the Pensacola airport. People parked here on the grass to line up for shuttle buses to the Republican rally. Whoa, just got hit by a giant beach ball that says 2018. We found Will Beasley at the front of the line, where he had been since the day before. WILL BEASLEY: Steve. INSKEEP: Yeah? BEASLEY: Great to meet you, Steve. INSKEEP: Just one quick question, though. BEASLEY: I want to ask you a question first. INSKEEP: Sure. BEASLEY: Can I ask you a question? INSKEEP: Yeah. BEASLEY: What is your favorite thing about Donald Trump? INSKEEP: I'm not going to talk about that 'cause I'm a journalist. I try to keep my opinion out of it. MIRANDA MATTHEWS: Well, ask me. INSKEEP: OK, what is your favorite thing about Donald Trump? MATTHEWS: Because everything that he said he was going to do he has done. He's a wonderful president. There's nothing that you can say bad about him. INSKEEP: That's Will's wife, Miranda Matthews. What is one thing you want the next Congress to do? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Build the wall. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Close the borders. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Build a wall. Pass the middle-class tax cuts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Close the borders. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: And hold the corruption in the government accountable. INSKEEP: Farther back, Delores Morris is comfortable with the Republican candidates for governor and senator, but there was no doubt who she had come to see. DELORES MORRIS: This is on my bucket list, to see a president before I pass away. INSKEEP: And she's glad that president is Trump. She sometimes winces when he talks but rejects the idea that he is divisive. MORRIS: He says things that are - that might be critical, but they're not critical in a way that's bad. It's just telling the truth. INSKEEP: Although I'm thinking about something like that caravan that he's talking a lot about now. MORRIS: Specifically what about that caravan? INSKEEP: Well, I'm thinking about the way that it's pretty far away, but he acts like it's an imminent threat. And he says the Democrats are behind it. MORRIS: Behind it - I believe they are behind it. INSKEEP: Why would Democrats be behind this thing that Trump can use as a big election issue? MORRIS: Well, we know that they were behind a lot with the Supreme Court nominee, all of that - things that happened. INSKEEP: She does not believe the story of a woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. School buses ferried this crowd of thousands to an airplane hangar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MEL PONDER: Good evening, everybody. If you would, we'll begin this evening with prayer. INSKEEP: Mel Ponder, a state representative and pastor, requested a moment of silence to remember recent shootings in Pittsburgh and in Tallahassee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PONDER: Bless our first responders and those called into harm's way, Lord. Lord, we release your peace and your blessings into this place, and we pray all this in Jesus' name. And everybody said amen. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: Amen. INSKEEP: It was a crowd overwhelmingly white, casually dressed, a lot of red Trump hats and T-shirts. A father held his daughter on his shoulders to watch Air Force One taxi up to an open door of the hangar. Vice President Mike Pence came down the steps and climbed to the lectern. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PONDER: Introduce to you the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. INSKEEP: The president called out a celebrity in attendance, a boxer whose fights Trump's casinos once hosted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Evander the Real Deal Holyfield. Where's Evander? What a great champion. What a great champion. Evander - I've made so much money on Evander. INSKEEP: And he acted as master of ceremonies, introducing Republicans running for senator and governor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You have only one choice - Ron DeSantis for governor. He's going to be a great, great governor. Ron, come on up. INSKEEP: DeSantis is a veteran and former congressman in a red tie much like the president's. And he promises to keep taxes down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: I'm also the only candidate that can say that I've never been - had my palms greased by an undercover FBI agent while I've been in office. INSKEEP: That's a reference to Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate. He's mayor of Tallahassee, where the FBI is investigating city officials' links to real estate developers. After delivering that line, DeSantis turned to the president, who still owns a real estate business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DESANTIS: And we have such a good opportunity to bring more investment to Florida. Mr. President, I just want you to know when I become governor, I'm going to go to Don Jr. and Eric, and I'm going to try to bring The Trump Organization to Palm Beach. TRUMP: Good. DESANTIS: We can save you a lot of money. INSKEEP: When the president took back the microphone, he took aim at Gillum, who is seeking to become Florida's first black governor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I will say this. Andrew Gillum is not equipped to be your governor. He's just not equipped. It's not for him. It's not for him. INSKEEP: The president promoted the strong economy and the move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. But he grew most animated as he spoke of the caravan, which he linked without evidence to Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They want to invite caravan after caravan. And it is a little suspicious how those caravans are starting, isn't it? Isn't it a little? And I think it's a good thing maybe that they did it. Did they energize our base or what? INSKEEP: He told his listeners they face danger. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for violent predators and ruthless gang members like MS-13. No, thank you. You can have them. INSKEEP: And he told citizens of this southern state that people were trying to destroy their history and American heritage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: So I'm asking every citizen from every party, every background and every race, color and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division, reclaim our proud and righteous destiny as Americans. INSKEEP: Listening to closing arguments in succeeding days revealed something about each party's candidates and core voters. In Atlanta, Democrats were most clear about what they want. In Pensacola, Republicans were most clear about who they want and also what they fear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Thank you, Florida. Thank you.

If Republicans keep their majority, McCarthy could be the next speaker of the House.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump shakes hands with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy during a rally this summer. If Republicans keep their majority, McCarthy could be the next speaker of the House. Keeping control of the House would validate President Trump's governing style and mean full speed ahead for Hill Republicans to move his agenda. But if the GOP loses its majority it will need to to go on defense to protect Trump. When the Democrats lost the House in 2010, they rapidly saw President Barack Obama's legislative agenda die. Former Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor says that's what Republicans can expect if they fail to maintain their majority. \"Look, it's no fun to be in perpetual minority, I can tell you that,\" he says. \"And especially in the House where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again set the agenda and get bills across the floor.\" Cantor says he thinks more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose. But Karl Rove, former top adviser to President George W. Bush, has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the House. \"I think they will be both miserable and emboldened,\" says Rove. \"They'll be miserable because they're in the minority. They will be emboldened because if the Democrats take it by a narrow margin, there will be deep divisions within the Democratic Party.\" Republicans will do their best to exacerbate those divisions. But one factor that could complicate things for GOP leaders is that most rank-and-file lawmakers have never served in the minority and are likely to be frustrated at how little they can do to stop bills through committees or on the House floor. They will instead be forced into a new role that is primarily messaging instead of legislating. What if Republicans keep the House? If Republicans hang on to their majorities in the House and Senate after two years of protests and marches against the Trump administration, it would be a crushing blow to Democrats. President Trump and congressional GOP leaders will see holding the House as validation of their approach to governing. Senate Republicans can continue to confirm judges at record rates. And both chambers could take another swing at repealing the Affordable Care Act and possibly help Trump shut down the Mueller investigation. Lawmakers also plan to enact additional tax cuts aimed at the middle class and work to promote new trade policies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP leaders have also been blaming Social Security and Medicare as sources of the ballooning deficit, suggesting cuts and other reforms could be coming if they hold control. The president has vowed to continue pushing for significant funding for a border wall, which Republicans may feel more comfortable with backing if voters hand them power again. But even if Republicans keep the House, their margins are likely to be smaller, making it harder to pass bills. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican leader, told NPR that fewer GOP members overall means \"you don't have as many people that can just be free agents.\" He noted that some GOP members who faced blowback from constituents on some key agenda items opted to \"vote no but hope that the bill passes.\" There won't be much room for error on controversial bills, but keeping the Republican conference all on the same page could be a big task for leaders. \"So ultimately, if we're going to have a smaller team I think we're going to have a more united team,\" he says. \"Because at that point we're all in it together or it's not going to happen.\" Most Republicans admit the best-case scenario is keeping the losses to a minimum. At the core, the goal they're pitching in the final stretch of the campaign is two more years of moving Trump's agenda and a focus on creating more jobs. \"We need to keep building on the success we have with the economy. You know we're just starting to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. We need to get better trade deals with our friends around the world. I don't want tariffs. I want a free trade environment where we actually can not only have good relationships tradewise with our friends but stand up to China,\" Scalise said. What about compromise? Trump, without control of Congress, could decide to triangulate. He is already talking about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure, something that could leave Republicans on the sidelines. Not to mention he has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus, says Doug Heye, the former communications director for the RNC. \"It could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that,\" says Heye. \"But it could be good for Trump \u2014 for his own personal political goals.\" Heye says the challenge for a lot of Republicans is that what's good for GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill and what's good for the president aren't necessarily the same thing. Something else will happen if Republicans lose big on Tuesday: Their ranks in Congress will get smaller \u2014 but also white, older, more male and much more conservative. In other words it will more closely match the Trumpian base of the party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose and privately blame Trump for their loss, they'll have no choice but to stand by him. \"The Republican Party, first of all, is going to be the Trump party,\" Gingrich says. \"The first thing [Republicans] will say the morning after the election is we are dedicated to the re-election of Donald Trump. And that becomes the overriding goal.\" They will need to defend the president against a swift shift by the Democrats to investigate many corners of the administration. Any political damage inflicted on Trump's re-election efforts will also affect GOP candidates in 2020. NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has outlined a legislative agenda that includes Democratic priorities like lowering prescription drug prices and overhauling campaign finance laws.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has outlined a legislative agenda that includes Democratic priorities like lowering prescription drug prices and overhauling campaign finance laws. Veteran Democratic strategist Paul Begala doesn't think it's hyperbolic to say that \"everything\" is at stake for Democrats heading into Tuesday's elections. \"They always say it's the most important election of your life,\" he says, explaining that in the past two years, Democrats learned the consequences of being \"completely shut out\" as the GOP controlled both Congress and the White House. If Democrats fail to take back the House and make significant gains at the state level, they'll be shut out again, without a say in legislation and judicial appointments. Ron Klain, a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White Houses, calls the upcoming election an issue of \"life and death\" for Democrats. He says if Democrats lose on Tuesday, their worst fears come true and President Trump has a free hand. \"[It will mean] he can fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the Mueller investigation and replace him with the attorney general of his choosing. It means that Trump could continue to roll back regulatory protections and undo the Affordable Care Act.\" Changes in the House How the House operates can change dramatically with a shift in party control. Here are six ways the House could change under new leadership: 1. The agenda: The majority decides what legislation the House votes on and schedules hearings on the issues it wants to highlight. Democrats have a lengthy list of their own priorities they would like to vote on such as lowering prescription drug costs. 2. Subpoenas: Many committee chairs can unilaterally issue subpoenas to demand information and testimony from federal agencies. GOP-controlled committees in the House and Senate haven't done much to press Trump administration officials for details on reports of government mismanagement. That could change with a Democratic-controlled House. 3. Investigations: Leadership can direct committees to investigate top Trump administration officials or policies. 4. Rules: At the beginning of each new session of Congress, the House adopts a rules package to govern how the chamber is run and how legislation comes up for a vote. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said that Democrats are working on new rules to allow for more debate on the House floor. 5. The impeachment process: The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach a civil officer of the government. Any articles of impeachment would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for review and possible hearings. If the committee approves any articles, the full House would vote on impeachment and then refer the matter to the Senate for a trial. Top congressional Democrats are throwing cold water on moving to impeachment quickly, but they say if there is evidence that emerges from the special counsel's probe of any wrongdoing, they don't rule out Judiciary Committee action. 6. Potential government shutdown: If Democrats retake control of the House, the president will be forced to negotiate on government spending to enact key administration priorities. Standoffs over border-wall money, cutting money for agencies regulating industries and implementing health care programs are likely and could trigger government shutdowns. More oversight If the Democrats win one chamber or both, Klain says, then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president. That means one thing for certain \u2014 a lot of oversight. \"You'll start to see questions being asked about how taxpayer dollars are being wasted, how the government is being used as a piggy bank for the Trump family,\" Klain says. He added that committees will start to investigate various agencies and allow Democrats to zero in on concerns they have about \"how big corporate interests are turning our environmental laws inside out at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department.\" As part of that oversight, Pelosi has named a top priority: forcing Trump to hand over his tax returns. Key committees do have the authority to trigger the Treasury secretary to respond to a request for tax filings, but it's unclear what kind of legal battle would ensue. Other areas of oversight could include probing allegations of waste and fraud within the administration (think former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's spending and former HHS Secretary Tom Price's use of private planes), foreign contacts during the 2016 campaign and the Trump Organization and family members' finances. Beyond oversight If Democrats take back the House of Representatives, they stress they will be a check on the president, but they also have an ambitious agenda of their own. Democratic candidates pledge they will take up legislation to increase the minimum wage, expand child care availability and control prescription drug costs. Even if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto, Begala says, Democrats can use the House agenda to preview what they would do heading into the next election for president in 2020 against Trump. Pelosi has also outlined plans to vote on legislation to fund infrastructure projects, overhaul campaign finance laws, expand background checks for gun sales and provide a path to citizenship for those children of immigrants brought to the United States illegally. But Republicans who have been down this road before offer words of caution \u2014 be careful what you wish for. Eric Cantor came to power as the Republican majority leader when Republicans took over the House after President Barack Obama's first midterm in 2010 thanks to the Tea Party. Those who fueled that movement demanded instant results. \"I can tell you if we weren't contemplating at least monthly, if not more often, repealing Obamacare \u2014 then we were not doing all we could, even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself,\" Cantor says. Cantor warns that if Democrats win, they'll have to deal with that same danger of high expectations from their left-wing base. \"These constituencies are gonna expect abolishing ICE. They're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on 'Medicare-for-all,' \" he says. \"And at the most extreme, they're going to expect the Democrats who, if they win majority in the House, to go ahead and impeach the president.\" If Democrats win the House, impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato. Their left-wing activist base will demand they move quickly to impeach the president. But the current Democratic leaders are lukewarm at best to that idea and say it's important to allow special counsel Robert Mueller's probe to wrap up to review its findings. But Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll encounter only if they win the majority again.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are fighting an uphill battle to hold onto control of the House, but one seat they could pick up is an area in northern Minnesota, where President Trump won in 2016.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Republicans are fighting an uphill battle to retain control of the House. But in Minnesota's 8th Congressional District, they could be poised to pick up a seat. While President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016, he won handily in this area of northern Minnesota. Mark Zdechlik of Minnesota Public Radio takes us there. MARK ZDECHLIK, BYLINE: Grand Rapids, Minn., is closer to the Canadian border than it is to Minneapolis-St. Paul. It's in the heart of Minnesota's 8th District. Logging trucks frequently rumble down the main road through town. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK RUNNING) ZDECHLIK: Local Republicans put together a makeshift headquarters here that's stacked high with GOP campaign signs. JANIS JOHNSON: Two years ago, we did it for Trump. ZDECHLIK: It's an old muffler repair shop that belongs to Janis Johnson. In addition to the signs, she's got bright-orange sheets listing more than 50 Trump accomplishments as president. JOHNSON: We got to stay behind Trump. ZDECHLIK: Republicans say former police officer and professional hockey player Pete Stauber is a perfect fit for the district. Stauber calls himself a common-sense conservative, as he promotes lower taxes and less regulation. President Trump endorsed Stauber and held a rally for him in June. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you, is this a pretty good sendoff for Pete? This is not bad. ZDECHLIK: Back at the muffler-shop-turned-campaign-headquarters, Jim Love stops in for a Stauber sign. He says he thinks Republicans are poised to flip the district Democrats have controlled for all but two years since the mid-1940s. JIM LOVE: I can only hope that people are finally going to see the light. ZDECHLIK: Democrat Joe Radinovich jumped at the opportunity to run for Congress earlier this year when fellow Democrat Rick Nolan announced he would not seek re-election. Radinovich held one term in the Minnesota legislature, worked as a union organizer and served as chief of staff to the mayor of Minneapolis. JOE RADINOVICH: We need to take back our government. We need to wrestle control from the special interests in Washington, D.C., and invest power in the people in rooms just like this. ZDECHLIK: Democrats settled on Radinovich after a hard-fought, 4-way primary campaign ended in mid-August. Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of 2017. Stauber calls Radinovich a political opportunist who moved from Minneapolis to northern Minnesota to run for Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE STAUBER: You could just look at our life experience. I've got 52 years of life on this earth. And I've spent the vast majority of my life outside politics. My opponent has been in politics his entire life. ZDECHLIK: Outside special-interest groups are pouring millions of dollars into the race. Biting ads slam Radinovich for speeding and parking tickets and a citation for marijuana paraphernalia possession when he was 18 years old. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"FAST TIMES\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Fast times. Broken laws. Joe Radinovich isn't fit to serve in Congress. ZDECHLIK: Outside spending on behalf of Radinovich has gone after Stauber regarding health care. The chair of the county Democratic party in Grand Rapids, Cyndy Martin, says affordable health care is the number one concern here. She says Democrats are more united than ever. CYNDY MARTIN: Well, we can thank Donald Trump a lot for that. ZDECHLIK: At a recent debate, Stauber challenged Radinovich's assertion that Republicans Stauber supports have sought to weaken health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STAUBER: Wrong. RADINOVICH: No. That's not wrong. It's a fact. You... STAUBER: Wrong. RADINOVICH: ...Can Google it, Pete. You can literally look this up. STAUBER: Wrong. RADINOVICH: These are - OK. ZDECHLIK: But the bickering between the two candidates is a backdrop to the heart of the battle, which, for many, is ultimately about Donald Trump. Back in Grand Rapids, outside a hardware store, Bob Thomas says he can't stand Trump. BOB THOMAS: I don't care for his dictatorship. ZDECHLIK: And Thomas says his vote for Democrat Joe Radinovich will be a vote against the president. But Republicans are betting support for the president will flip the district in their favor.

            "article_content": "It's two days before the midterm elections. The Republican Party has had control of both houses of Congress and yet President Trump's message to voters is about fear \u2014 of migrants and the Democrats.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: President Trump has made these midterm elections all about him. And voters are about to deliver a verdict. The president has been in power for almost two years, and the Republican Party has had control of both houses of Congress. And yet the president's message to voters is about fear of migrants and of the Democrats. To understand why, we are joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So President Trump has been hitting the stump, making a final push for Republican Party candidates. Is this the kind of messaging where Republican candidates wanted to be? LIASSON: Not originally. Republicans thought that they would run on the economy, which is very, very good. They'd run on their tax cuts. But the tax cuts got less and less popular as time went on. So the president has a message for his base. He thinks this is an election that will be all about the base, not about persuasion. And in rallies over the weekend, in the face of the best economic news any president would want on the eve of an election - you had wages up, growth up in that report on Friday - he was expressing his belief that the economy was not such a great motivator in his mind. And here's what he said in West Virginia on Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They all say, speak about the economy. Speak about the economy. Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. (CHEERING) TRUMP: But, sometimes, it's not as exciting to talk about the economy - right? - because we have a lot of other things to talk about. LIASSON: And those other things, of course, are immigration, race, crime, this invasion that he says is coming to the southern border. Look. This is not just Trump's closing argument. This was his opening argument when he rode down the escalator in New York and announced his candidacy, and he said that Mexico is sending rapists across the border. So this is the core of everything he's done. It's a kind of us-against-them message, very nativist. And what we're going to find out is whether this is the issue that will motivate voters. It worked for him in 2016. The question is, will it work for him this year when he is not on the ballot? Can he get his supporters to vote for Republican candidates when he's not on the ballot? President Obama couldn't do it. And we'll see if Donald Trump can. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How is President Trump using his control of the government to help Republicans? LIASSON: In every way he can. Every president does what he can to help his party. He's doing lots of rallies. That's obviously what every president does. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sure. LIASSON: But he's also using his control over policy and government resources. He's sending thousands of troops to the border, perhaps, he says, up to 15,000. That would be more than the soldiers - number of soldiers in Afghanistan. Many former military officials say that's just a gross misuse of the military. It's a political stunt. He's promised a 10 percent middle-class tax cut that would be passed before November. Of course, November is here, and it hasn't been passed. He's talked about changes to birthright citizenship, changes to the asylum process. So he tries to control the narrative by using every lever of government. And the question is, is he still writing the script? Or will these other events like pipe bombs sent to his critics, the massacre of Jews in Pittsburgh by someone who was upset about the caravan - which happens to be the thing that Donald Trump wants people to be upset about - will that overtake the narrative in the closing days? GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how is this resonating with voters? You know, we are seeing numbers that early voting has been really high. LIASSON: Really high. We don't know how it's resonating with voters in terms of the results. We'll know that on Tuesday. But we do know that this election is on track to set records for a midterm - 33 million early votes so far. That's surpassing the entire 2014 midterm voting totals. And in some places, we might get to presidential-year-level turnout. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Extraordinary. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, thank you. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "With three days to go, the nation's top political leaders are out in force trying to sway the contests for control of Congress and the states.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: The midterm elections are just days away now. A lot of people have already voted, but both major parties have some of their biggest names out on the road. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Republicans believe we must defend our borders. We have to defend the borders of our country. And that country is... BARACK OBAMA: If they keep control of Congress, you'd better they're coming after your health care. MIKE PENCE: Four-point-five million new jobs created in the last two years. JOE BIDEN: We will win on Tuesday, and we will take back this country. PENCE: Keep it going. Vote Republican. OPRAH WINFREY: Let your vote make a difference. Let your vote count. Let your vote speak for you. MARTIN: That was President Trump in Montana this afternoon, followed by former President Obama in Florida yesterday as well as Vice President Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden. And even Oprah Winfrey was working to get out the vote this week. NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor is here to tell us more about how this final sprint of the 2018 campaign is going. Jessica, welcome back. JESSICA TAYLOR, BYLINE: Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: So where is Trump campaigning in these final days, and what does that tell us about the GOP strategy? TAYLOR: Trump's schedule shows that Republicans are focused on defending the Senate. That is the most important job for them right now. Today, he's in Montana and Florida, and then he's going to Tennessee, Ohio, Missouri and Indiana in the final days. Now, notice he's not going to places with the most vulnerable House seats because he might hurt them there more than he helps. And he seemed to concede as much yesterday, admitting that Republicans could lose the House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: It could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. But it could happen. And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? Don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out. TAYLOR: Trump likes to take credit for winning, and by campaigning in these Senate states, where he's still relatively popular - in some places, he won by upwards of 20 points in 2016 - he can still say on Tuesday, even if they lose the house, that, hey, look - I saved the Senate. MARTIN: Let's talk about immigration for a minute. In recent days and recent weeks, the president's message has gotten really intense - harsh, even, I might say. Is that what his campaign is focusing on today? TAYLOR: Republicans wish that he were focused a little bit more on the economy probably, especially after a really good jobs report on Friday. And he did talk about it at the top of his rally in Montana. But he still spent most of the time talking about immigration and this approaching caravan of migrant families from Central America seeking asylum. Now, of course, they're still far away from the border, and he said this week he'll send between 10,000 and 15,000 troops in a speech at the White House, which was really just a more official looking version of his stump speech sort of stoking these fears. And he even said that he would authorize them to fire on any migrants who were throwing rocks at the troops, and that he had to walk that back later on Friday. You know, they're making a bet here that they can double down on this strategy of fear, really. And it's something that worked for Trump in 2016. That's the only campaign he's ever run. So he thinks that it worked then, but this is a much different election. When you're looking at the House especially, it's so different, and I'm not sure that you can win by running just a base election. MARTIN: So what are Democrats saying in response to that? TAYLOR: They're really trying not to take the bait. Democrats are saying this is just the politics of fear and racism. MARTIN: Well, then, do they have a message to counter that? TAYLOR: They've really been focused on health care - has been the issue that we have seen the most in ads by Democratic candidates and Democratic campaigns. The fact that the Republican health care plan that passed the House would have weakened protections on preexisting conditions - this is something that even Republicans are running ads now saying, hey, we would do this even when the bill they voted for would have weakened them. You know, this is a winning issue for them, according to polls, and we will see if it bears that out on Tuesday. They lost the House in 2010 largely because of Obamacare's unpopularity. But, eight years later, this is the thing that could help them win it back. You know, and they're also stressing you have to go to the polls. If you didn't go out in 2016, look what happened. They especially need minorities to turn out - Latinos, African-Americans - and especially young voters as well. MARTIN: That is NPR's Jessica Taylor. Jessica, thank you. TAYLOR: Thanks, Michel.

            "article_content": "We recap the week in politics and look at a kind of pre-election anxiety that's gripping the country.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Americans head to the polls Tuesday, but more than 30 million people have voted already. President Trump's name isn't on a single ballot, but he still managed to make himself the preeminent issue for many voters who will decide control of the House and Senate. NPR's Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent on the Washington Desk, joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: First, my friend, a bit of pre-analysis - what does the fact that 30 million early votes already been cast mean? ELVING: You know, in a typical midterm, voter turnout drops by roughly one-third from the most recent presidential election. And this year, though, turnout may be much closer to a presidential level. And in part, as you say, that's about the president - not on the ballot anywhere but on voters' minds everywhere - not least because he has insisted on it. And it's hard to imagine this president having it any other way. SIMON: President Trump's been campaigning very hard ahead of these elections. And despite having good - even great - economic numbers, he's been sounding a trumpet about immigration. ELVING: It's worth noting that given all that good news about the economy, the president has chosen to fixate on the border issues and a caravan from Honduras that he and his media allies call an invasion. He has sent several times as many troops to the border as there are people in the caravan. And that's even counting all the children and the elderly. And this week, he announced he would personally end birthright citizenship, which is in the Constitution. And he said he would do it by his own executive order. SIMON: Ron, what do you believe are some of the effects of putting this anti-immigrant drumbeat into American politics? ELVING: It seems to be raising the heat on what was already a pretty feverish enthusiasm among the most passionate people in both parties. And when I say both parties, I mean, the pro-Trump and anti-Trump parties - calling them that because the current conflicts blur the old lines between traditional Republicans and Democrats. Our political landscape has been rearranged by this president. And that helped him in 2016. We shall see if it helps him next week. SIMON: With humility, which parties or party do you think will wind up in control of the House and Senate after Tuesday? ELVING: A consensus has emerged around the polls and the structural considerations - that is, which seats are on the ballot in what parts of the country - and it says Republicans will keep control of the Senate, perhaps picking up a seat or two more than they lose. But the Democrats will get the two dozen seats they need as a net gain to retake the majority in the House for the first time in eight years. Now, they could get more, a few more or perhaps a dozen more. And they could fall short. After all, we're talking about 435 separate elections around the country. But the expectation now is that they will get the two dozen they need. SIMON: I have heard politicians of both parties say that this is the most important election of our times. And without trying to discourage anybody from exercising their democratic duty to cast a vote, I'd like you to take a bit of a long view on this election because you've seen and reported on a number of the most important elections of our time. ELVING: We won't count the numbers, Scott. But if the Democrats don't gain control of the House, it will be seen as a tremendous validation to the president and encourage him to push harder than ever on his agenda. So we are told that everything is riding on this one midterm vote. And it is important, maybe the most important in decades. And everyone should, vote. And everyone should work hard to support their candidates. But there will be a morning after. There will be consequences that are neither foreseen nor intended. There always are. And sometimes, an incumbent president is better off running for re-election if his party does not control Congress. So there are lots of unknowns now. And there will be much to revisit after the voting is done. SIMON: That certainly happened with President Clinton and President Obama, didn't it? ELVING: Four of the last five presidents who have been re-elected were re-elected when the House was controlled by the other party. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

The shooting there and heated reactions to it added to the anxiety leading up to the midterm vote. How much should we worry about Tuesday? There is nothing more normal than the regular scheduling of midterm elections for governorships, one-third of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But this year's midterms, two years after the surprise election of President Trump, have brought on a major case of national anxiety.  The tenor and tone of the national discourse has deteriorated to the point that most Americans think it will lead to violence.  Indeed, it arguably already has. In a historical sense, it's surprising the mood is so fraught. We might expect such an atmosphere in times of war or economic hardship.  But the U.S. now has fewer combat troops deployed around the world than it has had in nearly two decades \u2014 and far fewer than the country has averaged since World War II. Moreover, the economy is thriving as it rarely has in memory. Yet, there seems to be no one running a feel-good campaign. No \"morning in America,\" no \"happy days are here again.\" Instead, the dominant emotions in the campaigns of both parties emphasize fear, resentment and anger. You might expect that from the party in opposition, especially given that the party in power has the White House, majorities in both chambers of Congress and a distinct advantage on the Supreme Court. No surprise then that the out-party Democrats do talk about threats to health care protections under the Affordable Care Act and warn of autocratic overreach from the Oval Office. But the Republicans in charge are just as consumed with dire predictions about high taxes, unilateral disarmament and \"open borders.\" The epitome of this is the focus on a migrant caravan from Honduras trying to walk across Mexico. They have become an \"invasion force\" on Fox News and in Republican talking points. The president is, as always, at the center of the action. While not on the ballot anywhere, he is on voters' minds everywhere. And who would have thought he would have it any other way? His tour of red states backing Republican candidates has begun its own dramatic subplot to the larger narrative.   And it has raised the heat on both sides of what was already a feverishly passionate season. If Trump's role is unusually potent and high profile, so is the sudden reappearance of former President Obama as a drawing card at Democratic rallies and a magnet for younger voters and racial minorities. Add to all this the post-2016 insecurity over computer hacks by foreign trolls or other nefarious influencers.  Even the time-honored tradition of the local polling place and the volunteer staff is badly strained by contemporary pressures. So with all these explosive elements and divisive issues, we contemplate our Election Day in a somber if not fearful mood. So, time for a few words of encouragement. First, it appears that all the angst and agitation have produced (or at least coincided with) record-high levels of voter interest, early voting and expectations for turnout on Election Day in a non-presidential year. In most midterms, turnout is only about two-thirds as large as it is when the White House itself is in play. This year promises to be different.  Some say turnout will be closer to that of a presidential election than a typical midterm, and the highest of any midterm in roughly half a century. And if you believe in democracy at all, you have to see higher voter involvement as a healthy sign for ours. There is an old adage that goes back at least to the social worker Jane Addams a century ago: \"The cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy.\" Most of what is going on right now is in the nature of a hard-fought campaign, lurching into its ugly finale. Everybody's rhetoric goes over the top.  Civility takes a back seat, as it so often has since the earliest days of our free elections in a free republic. In the end, what happens and does not happen will matter a great deal.  But it will not be the end, nor the beginning of the end.  We know that predictions about election outcomes are often wrong. Even more often, the predictions of what will happen after an election are wrong. There will be consequences as foreseen, but also consequences that were neither anticipated nor intended. In sum, there is enough motivation in what this Tuesday's elections can decide.  It is not necessary to overburden it with all that may come after. If you are looking for signs of what may happen in 2020, an argument can be made that Trump is more likely to be renominated and re-elected if he has a Democratic Congress (and he will label it as such even if it's only a Democratic House). Congress makes the ultimate foil for a president seeking re-election. We have seen that work in the re-election of former Presidents Obama, Clinton, Reagan, Nixon and Eisenhower \u2014 all of whom won a second term when the House was controlled by the opposition party. Raising the stakes to the heights of Armageddon may work for boosting turnout in the election at hand. But no outcome this next week will settle the larger issues or the overarching struggle between the parties and the tribes in our politics. One thing we can count on: That struggle will continue.",

Funding for the border wall is one of a number of administration priorities that may face challenges if the Democrats flip the House. With days to go before the midterm elections, President Trump has tried time and again to turn the nation's attention to immigration with headline-grabbing moves. On Monday, Trump announced the deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the Southwest border. On Tuesday, he said he's considering an end-run around the constitutional right to citizenship for those born on U.S. soil. On Wednesday, the president tweeted an inflammatory ad comparing migrants in the caravan to a convicted cop killer who entered the U.S. illegally several years ago. And on Thursday, Trump called for new limits on asylum claims. Trump is trying to fire up his base \u2014 Republican voters frequently cite immigration as a top concern \u2014 as the GOP tries to retain control of the House and Senate. With control of the White House and Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump has ushered in sweeping changes to immigration policy. A \"blue wave\" at the polls could change the shape of the immigration debate. At the moment, pollsters are predicting that Democrats are likely to retake the House but not the Senate. That could give Democrats a degree of power they haven't wielded in years. Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a D.C.-based immigration advocacy group, predicted Democrats would pursue \"an aggressive oversight agenda.\" He said there's \"no doubt\" they would use congressional committees to investigate who is responsible for the Trump administration's family separation policy, which drew international outrage. It was one of several policy changes that Trump made through executive order or administrative rule-making. A Democratic-controlled House couldn't overturn the president's actions, but it could bring more scrutiny. \"The main thing that changes is that the Democrats will have the power to issue subpoenas and to conduct investigations,\" said Sharry, whose group has been highly critical of Trump. A number of Trump's immigration policies have been controversial. He imposed a travel ban on immigrants from mainly Muslim countries, as well as North Korea and Venezuela. He tried to terminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, ending protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought here as children. That issue is still being litigated in the courts. And Trump has moved to strip Temporary Protected Status, TPS, from about 300,000 immigrants from seven different countries. Trump also wants to build a wall on the southern border. Congress has yet to fully fund the $25 billion project, and a Democratic-controlled House could try to block Trump's spending priorities on immigration. Trump's best chance for getting a border wall appropriation may be during the lame duck session after the election, especially if Democrats are set to take over in January. But first, House Republicans, who are divided over spending, would have to overcome those differences. Or, Trump could try to cut a deal with Democrats by agreeing to protect some 700,000 DACA recipients and several hundred thousand more \"DREAMers\" who were never covered by that program. \"I think the president would be happy to trade DACA or even expanded DACA for up to 2 million people for actual appropriation of the money for the wall,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates limits on both legal and illegal immigration. \"The president, I think, would take that in a minute,\" he said. But such a deal \u2014 border wall funding for protecting DREAMers from deportation \u2014 has failed once before. And aides from both parties say a continued standoff over immigration is likely to lead to a partial government shutdown at the end of the year. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said she would trade \"nothing\" with Trump to help him get the wall. Pelosi is the odds-on favorite to be House speaker if the Democrats prevail. \"It happens to be like a manhood issue for the president, building a wall, and I'm not interested in that,\" Pelosi said in remarks at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics in early October. Pelosi said protecting DREAMers is a legislative priority and Democrats do support stronger border security measures. But the wall, she said, \"is probably the worst way to protect the border.\" Moreover, any immigration deal would have to get through the Senate. \"If the Republicans hold onto the Senate, I don't see a DACA bill getting through there unless there are a lot of enforcement provisions and possibly some reforms to legal immigration,\" said Chris Chmielenski, deputy director of Numbers USA, which bills itself as the nation's largest grassroots immigration reduction organization. There's one thing activists on both sides of the immigration debate agree on: It's hard to predict Trump. \"I think at the end of the day the X factor in all this is really the administration,\" said Ali Noorani, director of the National Immigration Forum, a nonpartisan immigration advocacy group. \"Is the president going to be in a state of mind to actually want to reach a compromise? There has been very little, if any, evidence that Trump, quite frankly, wants to compromise with Democrats or even his own Republican Party on the question of immigration,\" Noorani said. With the president having thrown in with immigration hard-liners, some predict a further stalemate in Congress over any immigration legislation. \"We have for too long been in an environment where people are throwing invectives at each other and claiming that's an immigration debate,\" said Cecilia Munoz of the New America Foundation. She served as domestic policy director in the Obama administration. \"I don't think that a change in parties in control of one or two bodies of the U.S. Congress is enough necessarily to get us to a more thoughtful debate.\" And if Republicans retain control of the House and Senate, that could embolden the president by confirming that his campaign strategy worked. But even immigration restrictionists say much would depend on the margin of victory by various Republicans. Republican candidates in competitive races are split between those who support Trump's crackdown and immigration limits and those who warn that the president has gone too far, says Chmielenski. \"So one side could increase their strength within the caucus, but only if they win a larger share of the seats up for grabs,\" he said. \"If the toss-up districts go evenly between two sides, then I don't think it'll have much of an impact.\"",

Despite leading overwhelmingly Democratic states, the two Republicans have positioned themselves well to win reelection on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gov. Charlie Baker, R-Mass., and Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., appear at the National Governor Association 2018 winter meeting in February. Despite leading overwhelmingly Democratic states, the two Republicans have positioned themselves well to win reelection on Tuesday. It's a political puzzle that frustrates Democrats \u2014 in two states where Donald Trump is deeply unpopular, two incumbent GOP governors have remained consistently popular. Maryland and Massachusetts are places where Trump has his lowest approval ratings in the country \u2014 35 percent. Yet, the Republican governors in those states have approval ratings near 70 percent. Few will be shocked if Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker both win reelection on Tuesday even though Republicans are largely on the defensive in governors races. Polls show they have double-digit leads over their Democratic challengers, with a shared ability to create a distinct GOP brand in an era of politics dominated by Donald Trump. At a recent rally in Montgomery County, Md., a vote-rich, left-leaning region near Washington, D.C., Hogan spoke with a sign that read \"Democrats for Hogan\" hanging off the stage, urging the crowd to look beyond party labels. \"The divisiveness in politics today, it's one of the things that I'm disgusted with,\" Hogan said. \"We need to bring both parties together. And quite frankly, I think we're setting an example for the rest of the nation about how you can work together to get things done.\" The remark was met with cheers. Keep the trains running on time After running four years ago as a mass transit cynic, Hogan has championed major transportation projects. The biggest was ending the three-decade debate over whether to build the Purple Line, a light rail route connected to the Washington, D.C., transit system that would link the state's two most populous counties, which broke ground last year. The other involves having the state eventually join neighboring Washington, D.C., and Virginia to provide permanent funding for their shared public transit system. Gaithersburg, Md., Mayor Jud Ashman, a Democrat, highlighted those accomplishments while praising Hogan's record on a strong economy. \"So four years into the Hogan era we find ourselves a state on the right track,\" he said. \"Jobs are up, taxes are down. Our reputation to do business is reinvigorated.\" Hogan also garnered public support for his response to the 2015 Baltimore riots, following the death of 25-year-old African-American Freddie Gray while in police custody. Hogan deployed the National Guard to help tamp down the unrest, a move that many people, particularly outside of Baltimore, saw as an example of leadership. In Massachusetts, Baker recruited a couple of high profile Democrats to his administration, including his transportation secretary Stephanie Pollack, who describes herself as a \"lifelong progressive Democrat.\" Despite her personal politics, she says she's found common ground with the Massachusetts governor on the need to improve existing infrastructure \u2014 specifically the subway and bus lines. \"His philosophy is we owe it to taxpayers to run government well. And isn't that a core progressive belief?\" she asked rhetorically. Pollack, who was well-known in Boston as a transportation guru for her work at Northeastern University's Dukakis Center, says too often her fellow progressives don't realize that their visionary ideas won't matter if they don't know how to run the government and deliver. \"For me, Governor Baker's entire administration is about delivering,\" she said. \"And delivering right now is actually more important than promises and vision.\" Other Democrats praised Baker's management and leadership after a series of record snowstorms in 2015 that blanketed the region with more than 100 inches of snow. \"The thing that really sticks out about his poll numbers is how broad his support is,\" said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group. \"Often times his support numbers have actually been higher among Democrats than among Republicans.\" Koczela's most recent poll found 61 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of Baker. Keeping their distance from Trump Both say they did not vote for the president in 2016. Both broke with the administration over sending National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border during the family separation crisis. Both governors also publicly disagreed with the president's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. \"How [Hogan] has governed under Trump has been really politically impressive,\" said Mileah Kromer, the director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College in Maryland. \"Hogan has been able to maintain a [diverse] coalition of voters throughout his time in public office, really speaks to someone who really under stands what resonates with the public.\" Will Keyser, a former aide to the late Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and now a senior adviser on Baker's reelection campaign, said the Trump administration has created a set of challenges, but it's also created a clear contrast for Baker. \"People are seeing how they would like it to be done, versus how they would like it not to be done,\" said Keyser, who had never worked for a Republican prior to Baker. Despite their bipartisan appeals, both men have their Democratic critics. John Walsh, the former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, insists Baker is popular because he's noncontroversial and noncommittal. \"Literally, the most conservative Republicans in Massachusetts and I agree about Charlie Baker. We're not voting for him because he stands for nothing,\" said Walsh, who's volunteering for Baker's opponent Jay Gonzalez. \"He values his high poll numbers more than progress on any issue, on any side of the issue spectrum.\" In Maryland, a major criticism from Democrats is that Hogan will oppose policies, then take credit for them later. One example is the so-called \"lock box\" ballot initiative, that if approved would ensure casino revenues don't get divvied up for anything other than funding K-12 education. In ads the governor asks voters to support \"the Hogan lockbox initiative.\" Maryland Democrats say he is taking credit for a constitutional amendment they worked to put on the ballot. Other critics of Hogan fear that he will shift from being a moderate to a more conservative politician if he wins reelection. Larry Stafford, the executive director of Progressive Maryland said, \"He can play a nice political game and say he's distanced himself from Donald Trump, but he's not someone who is going to stand up when Donald Trump is at his worst.\" Stafford backs Hogan's Democratic opponent, former NAACP President and CEO Ben Jealous. But aides and analysts say there hasn't been a compelling case made by the Democrat challengers in either state that voting for Baker or Hogan is somehow a vote for Trump.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is spending the run up to the midterms talking about immigration proposals. House Republican leaders hope they are still in the majority and say their agenda will focus on the economy.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: With all the talk of a blue wave for Democrats on Tuesday, many Republicans are still optimistic. House Republicans are preparing for their best-case scenario where they hold onto a narrow majority. And while President Trump is floating big plans to crack down on immigration with a Republican win, House GOP leaders have other plans. NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell spoke with two House Republican leaders, Majority Whip Steve Scalise and his top deputy, Patrick McHenry. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: All right, we're heading into this really tight election. If Republicans in the House can hang onto their majority, what are the plans they have for governing? SNELL: Well, the very first thing that Scalise mentioned when we were talking was the economy. He talked about how well the economy is doing and how he wants to expand on that, particularly with trade agreements. Here's what he had to say. STEVE SCALISE: We're just starting to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. We need to get better trade deals with our friends around the world. I don't want tariffs. I want a free trade environment where we actually can not only have good relationships trade-wise with our friends but stand up to China. SNELL: Did you hear that there? There's a lot of talk about developing new trade agreements... CHANG: Yeah. SNELL: ...And not tariffs, things that Trump just isn't talking about. CHANG: Right. SNELL: It's just a really... CHANG: Kind of the exact opposite, actually. SNELL: (Laughter) It's a really different approach. And, you know, we hear Trump talk a lot about immigration, but this focus on the economy kind of spans across Republican leadership. CHANG: So even though Republicans controlled both chambers the past two years, they failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If they are able to retain majorities in both chambers again, do you think they're going to try to repeal the health care law? SNELL: Now, I asked a lot of Republicans about this, and I asked both Scalise and McHenry. And health care is really not as prominent in their plans as it was back in 2016. Republicans feel pretty burned by the process when they've tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a really big chunk. And so they're moving away from big, sweeping plans to kind of smaller ideas. McHenry used a baseball metaphor. He said, no more home runs. PATRICK MCHENRY: We learned a lot out of that health care debate. SNELL: Like what? MCHENRY: Singles and doubles and bipartisan results are the best way to achieve any lasting difference in health care. SNELL: What he's talking about is returning a lot of power to the states. So they might focus on making small changes so that states have more control over, say, Medicare or Medicaid or decision-making about who receives benefits. CHANG: Whichever party ends up controlling the House, Republicans still expect to lose some seats - right? - in any scenario. So how are they planning for that? SNELL: Both McHenry and Scalise say they're looking to House Republicans to kind of give up the internal squabbles that we've seen for the past two years. Most House Republicans have never served in the minority. They've never even been in a tight majority. And so Scalise says there's going to be a learning curve. SCALISE: When we have a 23-seat majority, it might seem like a lot. But there's probably about 35 people on any given vote that think, hey, I can just vote no and hope that the bill passes. You know, if you disagree with a bill philosophically and it breaks your principles, vote no. But if it's a bill that you think is important and a good bill but you're just concerned you might get a few phone calls if you vote no but hope that it passes, nobody has that luxury anymore. SNELL: And McHenry says they're going to need to slow down and be more deliberate. MCHENRY: When you have a narrow House, you have to build out consensus much earlier in the process. You have to have a more measured approach for what you're going to achieve. We were hyper-aggressive with the timeline on health care, and that timeline forced a lot of tough decisions. Because we're focused on going fast, it actually slowed things down. SNELL: They're both essentially saying that conservative factions of the party need to end their strategy of rebelling and just get behind leadership when it comes to critical bills. CHANG: OK, so if they take on a less aggressive, more deliberative approach, aside from what's on the table next year, I mean, how do House Republicans plan to deal with all the things they left unfinished before the election? They've got a government funding deadline coming up. SNELL: Yeah, December 7. And, you know, that leaves them just a couple of weeks to figure out how to keep the government open. And while they did get a lot of big spending bills passed, they still need to do the Department of Homeland Security, which includes money for Trump's wall on the border. And that is shaping up to be a big fight. CHANG: That's NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Thanks. SNELL: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In the tightening Senate race, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and challenger Matt Rosendale are criss-crossing the vast, sparsely populated state with the hopes of meeting every voter personally.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: One of the tightest U.S. Senate races in the country could come down to something pretty old-fashioned. Who is more likable? That's a key strategy of Montana Democrat Jon Tester. He's trying to win a third term against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale in a state where President Trump is wildly popular. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: President Trump will visit Montana for a fourth time this weekend to stump for Republican Matt Rosendale. He's a former state legislator and current insurance commissioner. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATT ROSENDALE: Good evening, Montana. (APPLAUSE) SIEGLER: Here's Rosendale speaking at a recent Trump rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENDALE: President Trump is making history again here in Montana, by golly. (APPLAUSE) SIEGLER: Now, Rosendale's speeches tend to be short. He usually sticks to GOP talking points - on the border wall, on guns, repealing Obamacare. But he quickly comes back to the fact that he is all in with the Trump agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENDALE: President Trump and all of his policies are on the line. So let's make history and retire Jon Tester and send President Trump the help he needs. SIEGLER: Rosendale moved here from Maryland in 2002, which Democrats point out all the time, including in this Facebook ad where they make fun of how he pronounces the state name. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Because he doesn't sound like a Montanan. ROSENDALE: Citizens of Montana... The people of Montana... Citizens of Montana... Citizens of Montana... SIEGLER: Montana is a huge state with barely a million people. So the political playbook here has always been shake as many hands with as many Montanans as possible. JON TESTER: How are you? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Hi. SIEGLER: It's worked for Jon Tester twice before in similarly tight contests. With his signature flat-top hair, the Senate's only working farmer spent part of this week campaigning on the state's remote Hi-Line. TESTER: He doesn't know what the challenges are in Montana 'cause he's not from here. And look, I couldn't go to Maryland and do it. And I'm not going to 'cause I don't particularly want to. I love this state. SIEGLER: The Hi-Line is a vast region of prairies and wheat fields along the border with Canada near where Tester grew up. There are three reservations here, traditional Democratic strongholds. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Singing). SIEGLER: At this get out the Native vote rally, there's an honor song. And at a nearby table, Raymond King, a Vietnam vet, says he doesn't trust Rosendale. RAYMOND KING: He's never lived here. He's not from here. How can he be for Montana? And so I think he just wants to sell some more land. SIEGLER: Rosendale has been a real estate developer. His campaign declined interview requests. And right now, support for Tester is predictably strong in the liberal college towns and say the state capitol. But the rural areas are harder to gauge. Most voted for Trump, but some also re-elected a Democratic governor. On the country highways, you're just as likely to see a Rosendale sign plastered on an old barn as you are one for Tester. SUSAN GOOD-GEISE: Montana is truly a maverick. SIEGLER: Susan Good-Geise is a classic example. She formerly chaired the state GOP but is a vocal critic of Trump. Now she says Montana is known for voting people over party. GOOD-GEISE: They want somebody who's approachable. They want somebody with whom they'd be comfortable having a beer or seeing them at church or seeing them at a basketball game, you know. And Jon Tester is certainly that. SIEGLER: But that folksy-old model is getting tested right now. And she says this race has become more like a symbol of the country's tribalized politics. BRAD LOTTON: Come on in, and get away from the highway. SIEGLER: In Havre, the largest town on Montana's Hi-Line, Republican Brad Lotton runs a construction company on the east end of town. LOTTON: I don't know how long you have to be here before you're considered a Montanan. SIEGLER: Now, Lotton's met Rosendale several times. And he supports him, even though like most people here Lotton has a connection to Tester. His brother went to junior high with him. LOTTON: But if you're a Montanan and you vote with California here, you really have lost touch with your voters or your constituents. SIEGLER: The latest poll shows Tester with a narrow lead, though the Libertarian candidate in the race just endorsed Matt Rosendale, which could give the Republican a boost.

            "article_content": "Active duty troops have begun moving to bases in the southwest, preparing for deployment along the U.S.-Mexico border.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: At the White House this afternoon, President Trump defended his decision to send as many as 15,000 active duty troops to the border with Mexico. It would be the biggest domestic deployment of active duty soldiers in modern history. The president justified this mobilization by pointing to a caravan of Central American migrants close to a thousand miles from the U.S. border making its way north. NPR's David Welna joins us now. Hi, David. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: We've heard the president talk a lot about this migrant caravan ever since it crossed into Mexico from Guatemala 11 days ago. Did he say anything new today? WELNA: He did. He said that those caught at the border will no longer be released until they have a court hearing, which has been the practice because there haven't been enough places to detain these migrants. And he said the children will be held with their parents in tent cities that the military will be building. He also said people will be able to apply for asylum only at legal points of entry along the border. Right now they can do so anywhere. And when he asked - he was asked if the military will be shooting people. He said he hoped not. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I will tell you this. Anybody throwing stones, rocks like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico - we will consider that a firearm. WELNA: And so that would appear to be a rationale for shooting stone throwers. SHAPIRO: In April, Trump ordered a couple thousand National Guard reservists to the Mexican border. Fifteen thousand active duty soldiers is a much bigger presence. Why does he say this is needed now? WELNA: Well, a reporter asked him if this was all political given its timing right before the midterm elections, and Trump pushed back on that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: There's nothing political about a caravan of thousands of people and now others forming pouring up into our country. We have no idea who they are. All we know is they're pretty tough people when they can blast through the Mexican military and Mexican police. They're pretty tough people. WELNA: Trump has also asserted that there are gang members and tough criminals as well as Middle Easterners among the 3,000 or so people that the Department of Homeland Security estimates are in this group of migrants, but he's offered no evidence to back up those claims. SHAPIRO: The defense secretary authorized this movement of troops to the border. What does he have to say about sending this many people? WELNA: Well, Jim Mattis has fallen in step with Trump on this deployment. He was asked yesterday at the Pentagon by a reporter if this was a stunt, and his response was, we don't do stunts in this department. SHAPIRO: How long are the troops likely to stay there? WELNA: Well, right now the plan is to keep the troops there only until the middle of December. It's not clear whether the folks in this caravan could even reach the U.S. border by then. They still have about 900 miles to go. And for now, it looks like they'll be walking that distance if they indeed even make it that far. SHAPIRO: NPR's David Welna - thank you, David.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The midterm elections are just a few days away, and as Americans head to the polls, many will be thinking about how their votes could affect their communities or their jobs or their families. Family is a big consideration for Victoria (ph) and Matthew Keller (ph) of Denver, Colo., because theirs is growing. The two got married four years ago after they met at work, and they are now expecting their first baby in just a few short weeks. Do you have a nursery? I'm just curious if you're one of these people who already set up your nursery or you're just going to, like, put your baby in a box. MATTHEW KELLER: Oh, yeah. VICTORIA KELLER: Oh, yeah. But that's all Matt. MARTIN: Oh, this is Matt? V. KELLER: This is Matt. He set up our nursery months ago. If it was up to me, he would be in a box. MARTIN: (Laughter). M. KELLER: Everything's been way too well-planned. I have like way too much stuff already, and it's all set up and ready to go. MARTIN: I talked with the Kellers for the last in a series of conversations we're bringing you this week that illustrate how our personal, intimate lived experiences shape how we vote. Matt, you're originally from Denver, is that right? M. KELLER: Yes, born and raised. MARTIN: And, Victoria, where is your family from? V. KELLER: So I was born in Managua, Nicaragua. And then in 1988, my family immigrated to the Bay Area. MARTIN: Why did they leave Nicaragua? V. KELLER: It was in the middle of the civil war. And I think my parents saw the writing on the wall and knew that it wasn't a place that they could really raise children in a safe environment. Both of my parents were working professionals in Nicaragua. My dad was a businessman. My mom was a journalist. And going from being in a country where they were born and raised and they spoke the language to a country where they didn't speak the language, not having a lot of resources and trying to figure out a new society and a new culture was very difficult for them. This is only something that I learned when I was older. My parents were really good at sheltering me and my brother and sister. MARTIN: Did you feel some kind of pull on your identity? I mean, you hear that from a lot of children of immigrants that they don't feel really American. They don't feel really of their home culture. Was it that way for you? V. KELLER: It was. I felt like I had, you know, at home, we would speak Spanish. We would eat different foods. We had different cultures. I grew up in a very predominantly white town, so definitely looked a little bit more different than my classmates. And I think that was also something that differentiated me. MARTIN: Did that sit OK with you? V. KELLER: No. I was really embarrassed and practically ashamed of being so different. All you want when you're a kid is to fit in. And it was really hard for me when I was younger. But as I got older, I became embarrassed that I had been embarrassed about the way that I grew up and started taking a lot of pride in the fact that I have come from a family of immigrants. And my parents are the quintessential immigrant story. And they were able to build a really good life for me and my brother and sister here. MARTIN: And you are due in a matter of weeks now right, Victoria? V. KELLER: November 24. MARTIN: What kind of conversations have you two had about not just the parenting part but the responsibility of raising a kid in this political moment? V. KELLER: I think the biggest thing is just people are so unwilling to talk to each other, that we just yell at each other or block each other on social media. And how do you really move on from a moment when people are really unwilling to speak to each other and have difficult conversations? MARTIN: Let me be clear. Both of you would identify as Democrats or progressives or both. M. KELLER: Yes. V. KELLER: Yes. MARTIN: Do you intend to vote this year? V. KELLER: Yes. M. KELLER: Absolutely. MARTIN: And what's going to motivate your vote? V. KELLER: Definitely the immigration issue. I don't understand how people can have so much hatred for an entire group of people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. Just the cruelty we've seen with not just the family detentions at the border, but also policies about revisiting naturalized citizens, punishing immigrants who use public assistance when they need a little bit of help getting back on their feet so they can contribute. One of the things I'm most concerned about because of my family, my background, especially in light of the Kavanaugh confirmation debacle, I'm definitely concerned about reproductive rights, not just access to abortion services but access to birth control services. Because for me, being a woman, an integral part of my health and my ability to lead the life that I want and that all women can lead the lives that they want is to be in control of our own bodies. M. KELLER: And just to add on that, I think as sort of an expecting father, one issue that is more in the forefront of my mind at least right now would be gun control, which I'd never really thought about all that much very specifically. But now, it's definitely - for some reason, it seems to be at the back of my mind. MARTIN: Do you attach expectations to having a baby? I mean, it's - we shouldn't start dreaming for our children's future and living vicariously through them when they are still in utero. But do you find yourselves thinking about what your baby's going to be like, the things that he or she is going to do? M. KELLER: Nothing specific. I think, you know, expectations would be healthy and be a good person. You know, that's... MARTIN: That's pretty good. M. KELLER: ...As of right now I think once, you know, once we get a little further down the road and I see he's good at golf, then I'll start trying some other things. (LAUGHTER) V. KELLER: I think the same thing, just Hoping that he's stands up for the right thing and is willing to help people who don't have as much as he did. That's really all that I want is just to raise someone who respects people. MARTIN: You know you're having a boy? V. KELLER: We are having a boy. M. KELLER: Yes. MARTIN: Do you have a name? You want to announce it on National Public Radio? V. KELLER: Sure. His name is Andrew Enrique (ph). MARTIN: Aw. Andrew, we await your arrival. Victoria and Matt, thank you so much for talking with us. M. KELLER: Thank you. V. KELLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LAMBERT'S \"AS BALLAD\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally Wednesday night in Florida, Trump said the number of military personnel on the border \"will go up to anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel on top of the Border Patrol, ICE, and everybody else at the border.\" The current number of troops deployed to the border is 5,239, the head of Northern Command, Gen. Terence O'Shaughnessy, said on Tuesday. He said that number would likely grow even larger. A contingent of 2,092 National Guard members is already stationed at the border.

The president's announcement comes as the midterm elections next week are widely viewed as referendum on his administration. Trump has made it clear that he will make his anti-immigration policies a key issue in the elections. The original plan to send about 5,000 troops to the border was announced Monday. On Tuesday, Trump said he's considering changing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by executive order in order to deny citizenship to people born on U.S. soil. In his remarks Wednesday, Trump repeated his threat to cut off foreign assistance to Central American countries whose people have joined the caravan of migrants moving north to the U.S. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking at the Pentagon, was asked whether the troop deployment was a political stunt as some critics allege. \"The support that we provide to the secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of Customs and Border [Protection], so we don't do stunts in this department,\" said Mattis. He also compared the mission to what the Defense Department might do after a natural disaster. \"We do this following storms, we do this in support of the Department of Homeland Security. This is a different aspect of it, but that's what we are doing,\" he added.",

Voters on either side of the street talk about the choices they're making at the polls this November. Kathleen VanPoppelen and her daughter Brooke knock doors for Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat running for Congress in Michigan. Kathleen has never voted for a Democrat before, but she'll vote for Slotkin on Election Day.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Shapiro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kathleen VanPoppelen and her daughter Brooke knock doors for Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat running for Congress in Michigan. Kathleen has never voted for a Democrat before, but she'll vote for Slotkin on Election Day.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Michigan was part of the reason Democrats felt so confident during the last presidential race. They imagined a great blue wall stretching across the Great Lakes through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. The industrial Midwest had been a core of Democratic support for years. All of those states went for President Trump partly thanks to white working-class voters who used to reliably support Democrats. Now President Obama has come to Detroit, where he spoke tonight. He won the state twice, and he's hoping to revive those coalitions for the midterms in just over a week. I came here to see whether these political shifts are permanent. ZACH GORCHOW: This I believe is the most significant political border in the state of Michigan now. SHAPIRO: This is a five-lane road called Dequindre. It's more functional than beautiful - lots of strip malls and residential developments. The man walking alongside me is Zach Gorchow, editor of a statewide news service called Gongwer which covers Michigan politics. Why did you choose this place to meet? GORCHOW: Well, on the west side is the city of Troy, which is in Oakland County. SHAPIRO: If we turn left right now... GORCHOW: If we turn left. SHAPIRO: ...We'll be in Troy. GORCHOW: Yes. And on the east side, if we turn right, we would be in the city of Sterling Heights, which is in Macomb County. And these two communities in these two counties are really emblematic of this divide that's happening nationally where college-educated voters are tending to move away from the Republican Party toward the Democrats, and those white working-class voters who don't necessarily have bachelor's degrees are moving away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans. SHAPIRO: Two communities right next to each other moving in opposite political directions. Wealthier Troy, where Gorchow grew up, is shifting away from strict Republican rule. GORCHOW: The idea that they could be represented by a Democrat or Democrats in the state Legislature to me is shocking. You know, these are areas that used to elect their members to the Legislature by 70, 75 percent for the Republicans. SHAPIRO: And across the street, working-class Sterling Heights is becoming less solidly Democratic. GORCHOW: I mean, that is a chasm of a difference. And it's on either side of the road here. SHAPIRO: These shifts could determine whether Republicans hold onto the Michigan governor's mansion. And it could even influence which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. All right, well, let's explore these areas. We've walked Dequindre. Now let's see what lies on either side of it. First we turn left into a community with lots of people like Kathleen VanPoppelen. She's got a master's degree and a nursing job with a good salary. KATHLEEN VANPOPPELEN: I love Michigan. And I love living here. No hurricanes, no mudslides, no typhoons, just good old Midwest values. SHAPIRO: Have you considered yourself a Republican all your life? K. VANPOPPELEN: Since I was in high school - very conservative. SHAPIRO: Have you ever voted for a Democrat? K. VANPOPPELEN: No. SHAPIRO: And yet here you are wearing a pin on your coat for a Democrat for Congress. K. VANPOPPELEN: Correct. I have a T-shirt, too. (LAUGHTER) K. VANPOPPELEN: But you can't wear it at work. SHAPIRO: Educated suburban women are becoming disillusioned with the Republican Party across the U.S. And for VanPoppelen personally, this political shift is an earthquake. For her, it has a lot to do with President Trump. K. VANPOPPELEN: It's like we're all on a reality show, but we didn't sign up to be participating in it. The only reality show I want to be on is \"Survivor\" if they will ever pick me. But, no, I didn't sign up for this one. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). K. VANPOPPELEN: I'm serious. I tried six times to be on it. SHAPIRO: Was there one moment that made you change your mind and say, forget it; for the first time in my life, I'm going to vote for a Democrat? K. VANPOPPELEN: Yes. It was the shooting in Florida, that high school shooting on Valentine's Day. SHAPIRO: Yeah, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas... K. VANPOPPELEN: Yes, that one. SHAPIRO: Yeah. K. VANPOPPELEN: And I was having lunch with a lot of my nursing school friends. And we've all known each other since 1976. We all started nursing school together then. And we were lamenting. And I said, we can't lament anymore. We have to do something about this. We can't just sit back and wring our hands anymore. What are we all going to do? So that's what happened. SHAPIRO: Her sister invited her to see the Democratic congressional candidate at a house party, and VanPoppelen fell in love. Now she's knocking on doors with her daughter, a lifelong Democrat. It's the first time they've ever supported the same candidate. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hello. BROOKE VANPOPPELEN: Hi, my name's Brooke. This is my mom, Kathleen. And... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi, Kathleen. B. VANPOPPELEN: ...We're volunteers for Elissa Slotkin for Congress. SHAPIRO: A Republican incumbent represents the district right now. If it flips, that could determine which party controls the House. K. VANPOPPELEN: Will you sign a pledge card that you're going to vote for her? SHAPIRO: So that's the west side of Dequindre, the road separating these two communities. Now let's visit the east side of the street. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: There you go. You're welcome. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: That's OK. SHAPIRO: The Sterling Frights Halloween festival is a sea of children and their parents. There are a bunch of superheroes that come up about to my waist, some unicorns. There's a little flamingo being pulled around in a wagon. Sterling Heights, where this is located, is historically a blue-collar, union, Democratic-voting area. And it's been shifting more purple. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Get your Halloween bands. RYAN LIETAERT: I'm Ryan Lietaert. SHAPIRO: Looks like you've got a newborn baby here. LIETAERT: We do, yep. SHAPIRO: How old is she? LIETAERT: She's like 10 days. SHAPIRO: Oh, my goodness, that's amazing. Congratulations. LIETAERT: Thank you. SHAPIRO: He's a pipefitter wearing a union hoodie. The baby girl in his arms is his third child. LIETAERT: You know, we've got tons of work. Businesses are growing. I mean, I get to see the inside of it. All these places that we do jobs for, they're all expanding. And things are looking positive. SHAPIRO: Who do you give credit for that? LIETAERT: I don't know. I guess Obama got things rolling decent. And, you know, since Trump's come on board, obviously the stock market exploded. SHAPIRO: At least it did at first. In the last month, stocks have lost most of their gains from the previous year. Lietaert supported Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016. What do you think led to you making the shift from blue to red? LIETAERT: Well, honestly I just didn't really care for Hillary Clinton. SHAPIRO: And now that Trump is in office, how do you feel about the job he's doing? LIETAERT: I mean, I don't have any complaints. SHAPIRO: Other people we met in Sterling Heights switched parties in 2016 and are ready to switch back, like Matthew Fair. He just recently returned to work in the auto industry. He got laid off during the economic crash and worked as a truck driver for several years. He supported Trump in the last election. MATTHEW FAIR: I figured - because he had a business background figured he was - you know, would do a lot better for the country. Not that Obama didn't. Obviously that was a mistake. SHAPIRO: So you were an Obama-Obama-Trump voter. FAIR: Yep. SHAPIRO: And you're regretting the decision. FAIR: Now that I look back, yes. I think a lot of people around here, you know, wanted - want a little bit of change. You know, but obviously maybe he wasn't the right candidate. SHAPIRO: Tell me why you say that. FAIR: Because of the way Trump's actually portraying the country, you know, on a - actually a national and a social media way. SHAPIRO: In the last two years, President Trump has transformed the Republican Party with a focus on trade barriers and immigration enforcement. He's also reshaped the coalitions that Republicans and Democrats need to win elections. Here in Michigan, people will cast ballots just over a week from now in a competitive governor's race and several tight congressional races that could determine control of the House. The results here could tell us a lot about whether the transformation President Trump began is a realignment that will last.

As a migrant caravan heads toward the U.S., Nielsen says her agency has asked for the military's help. \"It's a wall,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, standing in the shadow of a newly built stretch of a 30-foot border wall in Calexico, Calif., which she said would help U.S. agents secure the border. The wall was built to replace an older barrier in the same area. But Nielsen celebrated its opening as a symbol of the Trump administration's hopes of building a longer wall \u2014 and she also provided details about the U.S. plan to send hundreds of troops to the border, to help stop the flow of people entering the U.S. illegally. \"Let me be clear: Walls work,\" Nielsen said. \"That's not my opinion, it's not a tagline, it's not a political statement \u2014 it's a fact.\" As she unveiled the wall, Nielsen also showed off a plaque with President Trump's name on it, affixed to the U.S. side. But despite the plaque and the president's repeated calls for walling off the southern U.S. border, the section of wall Nielsen visited had been ordered built during the Obama administration, to replace an aging fence. Nielsen \"said she was proud to acknowledge the completion of the first section of President Trump's border wall,\" member station KQED reports. \"To be clear, she was visiting a renovated section of an already existing barrier.\" The old wall was built during the 1990s, using concrete and \"Vietnam-era helicopter landing mats\" made of steel, according to the Customs and Border Protection agency. The CBP says the new wall is \"a bollard structure \u2014 hollow steel beams filled with concrete and steel rods.\" Nielsen spoke one day after news emerged that the Pentagon could order as many as 800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as thousands of people make their way north from Guatemala in a large migrant caravan. When asked about that development, Nielsen said she requested help from the Defense Department, mainly in engineering and logistics support \u2014 and that it is up to military leaders to decide how to accomplish those goals. The military's role \"would include vehicle barriers, pedestrian barriers,\" Nielsen said. NPR's Tom Bowman reports that the troops will also \"set up command and control centers, temporary shelters, field kitchens and field medical personnel.\" The migrant caravan is heading north from Guatemala; it's now about 1,000 miles from the U.S. When asked how DHS plans to cope with the group, Nielsen said her agency will be announcing measures \"within our legal construct, to ensure that this is an orderly process, and that those who have no right to be in our country are able to be apprehended quickly and removed.\" Nielsen's remarks come one day after she spoke to Fox News about the plan to deploy troops at the border. In that interview, she was asked whether a scenario might develop in which migrants who try to rush the border \"could be shot at.\" \"We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people,\" Nielsen replied. \"They will be apprehended, however.\" .@SecNielsen: \"We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people. They will be apprehended, however.\" pic.twitter.com/cYXpxev5xj When Nielsen was asked if the U.S. troops would be armed, she said, \"All of the rules of engagement are up to [Defense] Secretary [Jim] Mattis.\" NPR's Bowman notes that the troops will not \"engage with migrants or protesters\" because of the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which bars the U.S. military from enforcing state laws. Instead, they will be there in a support role to bolster a surge of hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers along the border. Describing the features of the section of wall in California, Nielsen said, \"It's different than a fence in that it's part of a system, so it also has technology \u2014 some of which you can see, some of which you can't.\" \"Our hope is that ... it serves as that impedance and prevents a flow over\" the wall, she said. Nielsen added, \"This is what the president has asked us to do. It's part of a system.\" A plaque placed by Nielsen is seen on the border wall.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A plaque placed by Nielsen is seen on the border wall. In early 2019, Nielsen said, the government will start building another 11-mile section of the wall, on the other side of the port of entry in the El Centro area. Nielsen praised President Trump for his commitment to building a wall along the border with Mexico, and she repeatedly called on Congress to change America's immigration laws \"that have made it nearly impossible to detain and remove those who arrive with a minor.\" Nielsen called on Congress to fund the construction of a wall \u2014 reminding lawmakers of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, in which lawmakers endorsed the idea of adding a barrier and other security measures to around 700 miles of the border. \"We do need the wall,\" she said, \"so we will continue to ask Congress for additional funds.\" The Trump administration's plan calls for the troops to be in place by Tuesday \u2014 one week before Election Day. Editor's note: After this story was initially published, NPR added more background detail about the border wall, to clarify that it was planned during the Obama administration.",

NPR's Rachel Martin speaks with two women who live in the same suburb but have different political views.  NOEL KING, HOST: And now we turn to the midterm elections. Leading up to next month's voting, we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country. Texas' 23rd District is viewed as one of the Lone Star State's only real, true swing districts. And that's where we find our own Rachel Martin. Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hey, Noel, good morning from Del Rio, Texas. That's where we're broadcasting from this morning, right near the U.S. border with Mexico. This district is huge - not in terms of population, necessarily, but in terms of just actual landmass. It goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio. And the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections. Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes, in particular of white, suburban women like the two women we're going to introduce you to right now. We drove into Hunter's Creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern. We passed Hunter's Circle, Hunter's Gate, Hunter's Dew. JANET OGLETHORPE: Every street starts with Hunter's, yes. It's kind of silly, right? It just makes it that much more confusing I guess. MARTIN: This is Janet Oglethorpe. She and her husband made a good living in real estate. They are retired now. And she teaches part time pilates at the gym nearby. OGLETHORPE: And so that makes it more cardio. MARTIN: OK. OGLETHORPE: And a little sweatier. MARTIN: OK. OGLETHORPE: Have you taken pilates? MARTIN: We met her at her house in a well-manicured cul de sac. Janet says people here are friendly enough. But on the whole, everyone sort of keeps to themselves, which actually suits her just fine. She filled up water bottles. And we headed out for a walk. Are we going straight? OGLETHORPE: Yeah, actually, let's go this way. MARTIN: In many ways, Janet represents a lot of white, liberal women. OGLETHORPE: When Trump was elected, I kind of fell apart. And to get back together, I actually, you know, did a lot of reading of, you know, OK, how to survive this. And the advice was, get busy. MARTIN: For her, that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about, Planned Parenthood. OGLETHORPE: And I actually got a pink cape my first year volunteering there because I put in more hours than any other (laughter). And people kid me about it. Come on, Janet, you don't have to wear the cape again today. MARTIN: Janet follows politics more closely than she ever did before. She registers people to vote. She donates to campaigns. She even lets campaign staffers stay in her house. So is it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening for you? OGLETHORPE: Oh, it's - I've always been aware politically. But I've also been complacent. I mean, look around. We're in this relatively affluent area. I got mine. You know, I don't really have to worry that much. And I hate that about my history. I wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates. I just didn't think it was so necessary. And now I do. MARTIN: We keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the cactuses are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween. OGLETHORPE: So if you like, we can cut right through here to my house. MARTIN: Yeah, let's do it. OGLETHORPE: Yeah, OK. MARTIN: There are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard, all for Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz. Janet's not the only one. Campaign signs have stirred up an internecine battle on the website Nextdoor. It all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign. Then he and others on the site talked about rigging their signs with a power cord to electrocute the next person who tried. Janet reads us comments off the thread. OGLETHORPE: Here's one. (Reading) I wouldn't want to kill them. But I would share the video of them being shocked until the breaker kicked. Good for you. It just goes on... MARTIN: For her, Cruz supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters. And she just can't understand where they're coming from. OGLETHORPE: I think Trump's base is lost. I think - when I hear them described as a cult, that makes sense to me from what I've heard and seen - that whatever he says is fine. Whoever he hurts is fine. MARTIN: Janet's neighbor, Ellen Pfeiffer, is a big fan of Donald Trump. Hi, Ellen, thank you so much for doing this. ELLEN PFEIFFER: Absolutely, I'm excited. MARTIN: We were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet. But then Trump came to Texas for a rally, and Ellen had to go. She and a couple friends drove up to Houston, stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing. We spoke the next morning. How was it? PFEIFFER: It was great. It was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be and more. MARTIN: Ellen likes the direction that the country is moving. She likes Trump's tax cuts, the low unemployment rate. She also likes the president's position on immigration. PFEIFFER: The obvious onslaught of migrants coming up, the inability of the countries they're coming from and coming through to staunch the flow, it's very concerning. And there's just no accounting for all these people flowing in. MARTIN: I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor, Janet Oglethorpe, in particular the bit where Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult. Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical. She's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican Will Hurd in the congressional race, but she thinks of herself as open-minded. PFEIFFER: I block walked with a liberal in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and - because I thought she was the best person for the job. So I don't - you know, I don't think I'm part of that cult. MARTIN: I guess I would close by just asking, if you could change anything about our current political moment, would - what would you change? PFEIFFER: I think I'm out there every day, you know, trying to be - to be the opposite of a cult and have open arms to people. And I, you know - I hope that I can lead by example. And I think I do. We might have political differences, but we all are, you know, working towards the same goal. MARTIN: But, Noel, that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational. She - she totally feels the divides between parties right now. So does her neighbor, Janet, as we heard. They are each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it. KING: And these voters are going to be making decisions in two really big races. How are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race? MARTIN: Right, so we should say, the congressional race pits the incumbent, Republican Will Hurd, against the Democratic challenger, Gina Ortiz Jones. And according to a recent poll by The New York Times, Will Hurd is up in that race by 15 points. So that's a really big spread. You know, he's got an advantage. Not only is he the incumbent, but he's really positioned himself as a moderate in a swing district, which he has to do. And that is working to his advantage. O'Rourke and Cruz, much closer - Cruz is up by 7 points. Beto O'Rourke is making a play. We'll see if all the miles he's put on his car, all the face time he's put in with voters, will make a difference. But it would be - it would be a tectonic shift in Texas politics.

            "article_content": "Texas's 23rd Congressional District is a swing district that includes Pecos. Pecos is in the middle of an oil boom that seems to be changing the politics of this once slow, sleepy city.  NOEL KING, HOST: All right. NPR has been visiting swing districts in the 2018 midterms. And in the state of Texas, that is the 23rd Congressional District, which is where we find our own Rachel Martin today. Hey, Rachel. How's it going? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hey, Noel. It's going pretty good. I am in Del Rio, Texas, looking out over Lake Amistad, which is actually part of the natural barrier that separates the U.S. from Mexico, at least in this part of the border. But this is a huge congressional district just in terms of geography. It stretches all the way from outside of El Paso to San Antonio. But what is in the middle of this district is also very interesting at this moment. Fracking has turned the once small city of Pecos, Texas, into a boomtown. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING) MATT ELLIOTT: This is the frack that's going on. There's a lot of things that are happening all at once here. MARTIN: The voice you hear is that of 30-year-old Matt Elliott. Like a lot of people born and raised here in Pecos, he knows the language of oil drilling. ELLIOTT: So they call it zipper fracking. They'll go down hole. They'll put a plug in, and then they'll... MARTIN: He's one of many people making money off the oil industry here. He's got a wife and three kids and not a lot of tolerance for risk. ELLIOTT: You'll hear people say that the oil industry is like a drug. And it really can be because if people aren't careful, they get so dependent on it that when it's gone, they don't know what to do. And I didn't want that to be us. MARTIN: So he started a business that rents out construction equipment, like port-a-potties, to all sorts of corporations, including oil companies. And when it comes to politics, Matt Elliott doesn't give President Trump all the credit for this boom. But he does like what he's been seeing. ELLIOTT: \"America First,\" taking pride in what we do, you know, letting people know that, you know, that we're not - you know, we're just not - we're not just going to be somebody's little handout all the time and that, you know, we want to grow our economy here. MARTIN: And as for Pecos specifically... ELLIOTT: As long as we keep moving forward, that's the main thing. MARTIN: But Pecos hasn't just been moving forward. It has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speeds with no road map. VENETTA SEALS: It's really an emergency situation. We weren't prepared for this. MARTIN: This is the mayor of Pecos. Her name is Venetta Seals. And she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here than this place can handle. What's the population of Pecos? SEALS: That's a hard one to answer. According to the 2010 population, we're just under 10,000. We are easily on any given day somewhere between 30 and 50,000 depending on how many people are driving in. MARTIN: And that's putting a huge strain on this small town's infrastructure. There aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores. SEALS: Unless you've actually been here, you don't understand what the need is here. You don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store. And then when you go, the shelves - they're out of bread, milk, eggs, you know, all the staples. My husband's retired. He knows when the milk guy shows up at Walmart (laughter), when the bread guy shows up literally. And that's when he goes to get those things for us. MARTIN: That's crazy. SEALS: It is crazy. We would probably have exploded even more if we'd had the housing in place because right now so many of these workers that are living in the RVs, travel trailers, the workforce lodging - they'll live there. But most of the time, their families aren't going to live there for an indefinite length of time. KAYLEY DUKE: This is a oil field. You don't want to bring your family here anyway. This is a man camp. Like, no, and then, you know... MARTIN: Yep. She said man camp. That is literally what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers. Kayley Duke is the 24-year-old manager of this man camp. She's wearing a rainbow tie-dye T-shirt with a unicorn on it. It says keeping it real. DUKE: They work these crazy hours, so we just have to get in there and make it like home, like home-cooked meals, smile on your face, you know, greet them, like, kind of that thing. So it's not like it's - they're princesses, but it's nice to come home to a made bed. MARTIN: Kayley points out the double-wide trailers as we walk around. Each of them can sleep up to 10 men. Sometimes they get their own room. Sometimes if they work opposite shifts, they share. DUKE: We got our two full-sized beds, and we have a night table and two closet-like - with drawers. MARTIN: Two years ago, Kayley was doing the same work in North Dakota. And when the oil in Pecos took off, so did she. DUKE: It's good money. And let's say you're not going to college at the moment. I mean, this is the place to be if you're wanting to stack some money. MARTIN: So that's a snapshot of the situation here in Pecos. Fracking has opened up the basins. And there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses. Not everyone is seeing a direct benefit, though. Property taxes have gone up here. The problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike. It's working-class families who have been here for generations. ALVA ALVAREZ: The mentality is take it while you can, but they don't recognize that there are people who are being left behind. MARTIN: Alva Alvarez is the county attorney. She's a lifelong Democrat as are most people here, but the oil boom seems to be changing that. ALVAREZ: Here we are, Reyes. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) MARTIN: Alva has been going door to door. ALVAREZ: Hi, how are you, sir? We are trying to get the vote out for Beto O'Rourke. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: See you. ALVAREZ: OK (laughter). Thanks. Bye-bye. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Bye. MARTIN: Beto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money. And Alva never expected that O'Rourke would have an uphill battle here. ALVAREZ: People I knew who had been Democrats for years have now just decided that, I guess, the Republican way is better. MARTIN: Better because even if they themselves aren't making money hand over fist, people around them are. And that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes. Maybe they'll finally get that grocery store. There's also talk of a new hospital. Maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the run-down cemetery in the middle of town. So what happened to the blue wave? I mean, the reason Beto O'Rourke has gotten so much national media attention is because he's come further than any other Democratic candidate in recent history. But you're not feeling it. ALVAREZ: I'm not feeling it here. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DRIVING) MARTIN: When we were filling up our GMC Yukon at the gas station on the main drag, a bearded guy in an equally large truck drove up and started chatting. His name is John Pack. JOHN PACK: I retired from the fire department after 23 years to come out here to work. MARTIN: So are you making good money? PACK: (Laughter) Yes. I've doubled my salary from the fire department. MARTIN: Wow. PACK: I've struggled for a long time. And I've come out here, and I'm just - I'm not struggling anymore like I was. MARTIN: Does it feel like it's going to dry up anytime soon? PACK: No, as long as Trump's in office. MARTIN: So you're feeling good. PACK: We're riding the Trump train. MARTIN: Do you feel like the country's divided right now? Do you care? PACK: Do I care? No, because right now we're moving forward quick, fast and in a hurry. MARTIN: Quick, fast and in a hurry. KING: Yeah. MARTIN: People like the feeling of the momentum here, Noel. And the impact of the oil boom, as you heard, is shifting politics in Pecos. But like we said, this is a really big congressional district. It is truly one of the state's only swing districts, and we explore two other fascinating corners of it this week. KING: Well, it was great to hear those voices. And you can hear more stories from Rachel's reporting in those other corners of the 23rd Texas Congressional District elsewhere in today's show that includes a story of a city along the U.S.-Mexico border.

            "article_content": "A new poll from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist suggests a voter's impression of President Trump will factor into that person's vote this November.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This morning we are broadcasting from Del Rio, Texas, which is just a few miles from the U.S. border with Mexico. I am, at this very moment, looking over Lake Amistad on the Rio Grande River. This is the natural divide between the U.S. and Mexico. Del Rio is part of the 23rd Congressional District in Texas, really one of the only swing districts in this red state. And we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind ahead of the 2018 midterms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump. There's a new poll out this morning from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist that addresses that very topic. And we have NPR's lead political editor, Domenico Montanaro, with us to discuss the findings. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So I am, at this moment, looking up at the vast Texas sky. And it feels pretty far away from Washington, D.C., and politics. But let's... MONTANARO: Sounds nice. (Laughter). MARTIN: Yeah, it is. It's really nice. But let's dig into the poll findings. Let's start with the president and Republicans. They saw a bump in enthusiasm among the base during Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. Did it last? MONTANARO: Not really. You know, the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters. Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm. But what the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October. The closer you get to the election, there's a natural rise. And when you look at Kavanaugh specifically, the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties, including Republicans. And we see the president's approval rating back down to 39 percent. We see Democrats opening up a gap of 10 points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district. MARTIN: I feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections. President Trump is struggling on that front. Does the poll show that he's making any inroads with female voters? MONTANARO: Not at all. One of our pollsters said that it's really all about the gender gap here in 2018. They said 2010 and 2014 were really about men who were motivated to take back the House and Senate, upset with President Obama. But in 2018, it's about women who are motivated against President Trump. We saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating, to preference for control of Congress and, in particular, when you look at white, college-educated women, they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important. So they are very motivated. MARTIN: Really interesting because we did meet a woman here, Janet Oglethorpe, in the suburbs of San Antonio. Same thing, she's a liberal. She's a Democrat. But the election of Donald Trump shattered her. And she's become politically motivated in a - in a totally new way. So we've definitely seen that play out here. What about issues, Domenico? I mean, does the poll address what are the issues that are going to motivate people to turn out this year? MONTANARO: Well, you know, first and foremost, the driving factor in this election is President Trump. Two-thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote. That's 20 points higher than in 2014, when the same question was asked about President Obama. And that's the year Republicans took back the Senate. But when we dove in, specifically at some of the issues that are important to people, the top issue of course was jobs and the economy, followed by health care and immigration - all of which we've heard a lot about in this election. But when you break it down by party, that's where you see some real differences. Republicans, jobs and the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues - nothing else comes close. For Democrats, it's health care and climate change. Notice I didn't mention those tax cuts. Republicans hoped to run on those, but they haven't broken through. More people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts. And when you ask people about the rising federal deficit, 60 percent, including a plurality of Republicans, say in order to address the deficit, they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than touch entitlements.

            "article_content": "The latest on the investigation of the 10 packages sent across the nation to multiple high-profile Democrats. Also, a new poll suggests voters' impression of Trump will impact their votes in November.  NOEL KING, HOST: A massive search is underway for the person or people who mailed what appear to be bombs to critics of President Trump. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah, at least 10 suspicious packages were sent to a list of notable names, including President Obama, his former attorney general and his one-time CIA director. KING: NPR's justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this story as it has been developing. Good morning, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: All right, so let's get up to speed on the investigation. Is there any more information on who may have done this? JOHNSON: Not yet. The investigation seems to be centered in two places. One is the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., which is analyzing these devices. They look like homemade pipe bombs. And the experts of the FBI will be looking for clues about how the bombs were constructed, what materials were used. They'll also be looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind on the devices or those manila envelopes. Retired investigators are telling me that it's very promising because so many of these devices are intact. They didn't explode. But if history is a guide, that whole process could take a while. It won't be immediate or overnight. KING: Well, last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility outside of Miami. What do we know about about that place and what they were looking for there? JOHNSON: This postal service facility is in Opa-locka near Miami. The operating theory for now is that some or all of the 10 packages went through that facility and through the U.S. mail. Investigators were looking for more devices but also any other clues. And there's a lot of manpower deployed here and around the country. The postal inspectors, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are already on the case, as is Homeland Security. So are local police, like the bomb squad and canine unit at the Miami-Dade police force near Opa-locka and, of course, the New York Police Department as well. KING: Carrie, it is really notable that none of these devices so far have gone off, have exploded. What do we know about the threat that's actually posed by them? JOHNSON: There is an open question about that. Police and the FBI are declining to answer questions on the record about whether those bombs could have been a lethal threat. Former officials at the ATF are raising questions about whether they included a key component that would have set off the devices. In fact, some retired investigators say they appear to lack at least one critical component. But New York Police Commissioner Paul O'Neill (ph) said at a news conference yesterday the powder and the bomb sent to actor Robert De Niro is not a biological threat, like anthrax, for instance. O'Neill was still quick to add police are taking this very seriously. And he says if you see a suspicious device, don't touch it. Don't move it. Instead, call police or the FBI immediately. This is being taken with the utmost seriousness, he says. KING: Sounds like good advice. NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks so much, Carrie. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right, a new poll out this morning from NPR, the PBS NewsHour and Marist shows that President Trump is a major factor driving people to vote in the midterm elections this year. MARTIN: Right. The poll also shows that Republicans have had trouble selling their signature legislative achievement. This is the tax overhaul. They've had a hard time selling that to voters. KING: NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here with more on the poll. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: All right, let's start with President Trump and Republicans. They saw this bump in enthusiasm - right? - among the base during Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. Did that bump last? MONTANARO: Well, the Kavanaugh factor really appears to have faded as a salient motivating issue. You know, Republicans have maintained, actually, their level of enthusiasm. But the pollsters say that that probably has more to do with the fact that it's October and there being a natural rise closer to Election Day - because when you look specifically at Kavanaugh in this poll, the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has actually gone down, even among Republicans. And we also see that the president's approval rating is back down to 39 percent. And Democrats have expanded their lead to 10 points on that crucial question of whether you'd vote for a Democrat or Republican in your district. KING: All right, so maybe just a temporary bump. You know, past polls have shown that women, by and large, do not like this president. Does this new poll show him making any midterms - any inroads, excuse me - ahead of the midterms? MONTANARO: Not at all. I mean, one of our pollsters said it's all about the, quote, \"gender gap, gender gap, gender gap.\" They said that if 2010 and 2014, those elections were about Republicans - you know, when they took back the House, that was about men upset with President Obama - 2018 is about women motivated to vote against President Trump. We saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating, to preference for control of Congress. And in particular, white, college-educated women give the president among the lowest ratings of any group and are among the highest to believe that the elections are very important. KING: So as Rachel said a little bit earlier, Republicans have had trouble selling the big tax overhaul to voters. This was their big legislative achievement. Do we know why that is? And do we have - do we have a sense of what is going to motivate people to turn out to vote this year? MONTANARO: Well, you know, when we're talking about the president, he is the driving factor in these elections. Two-thirds said that President Trump will either be a major or minor factor in their vote. That's 20 points higher than in 2014, when the same question was asked about President Obama. And that's the year Republicans took back the Senate. Again, I come back to the power of women in this election. Fifty-one percent of women overall, 54 percent of women who live in the suburbs, where a lot of these key House races are being run, say the president is a, quote, \"major factor\" in their vote. Those who say President Trump is a major factor, by the way, are twice as likely to vote for a Democrat in a couple of weeks. And when you talk about those tax cuts, I can tell you that that is not motivating voters. More people say that they're likely to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts. And when asked about the rising federal deficit, 60 percent of people, including a plurality of Republicans, say in order to address the deficit, they'd prefer to roll back the tax cuts rather than touch Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. KING: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. KING: All right, Rachel, I want to get your thoughts on what Domenico was saying because you have been in Texas for the last week talking to voters. MARTIN: Right. Let's talk about Texas. I am currently in Del Rio, which is just next to Lake Amistad on the Rio Grande River, which separates the U.S. and Mexico. And this is the last stop on a weeklong road trip that we've done through the 23rd Congressional District here in Texas. This is one of the state's only true swing districts - totally fascinating place, Noel, that spans about a third of the entire U.S.-Mexico border. KING: OK, so this is a massive district. And I wonder, as you've been knocking doors, talking to people, does any of what Domenico was just saying line up with what you've been hearing from people, particularly from women? MARTIN: Right, so he mentioned the power of women. So we wanted to talk to some, especially in the suburbs around San Antonio. Suburban women are really going to be influential in these midterms. We met a woman named Janet Oglethorpe. She, like a lot of white, liberal women in this country, said that Donald Trump's election just devastated her and really caused her to become politically active in a completely new way. Now she registers people to vote. She volunteers for Democratic candidates. She is committed in a way she never was before. Let's listen to a little bit. JANET OGLETHORPE: I wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates. I just didn't think it was so necessary. And now I do. MARTIN: So at the same time, I should note we also talked with one of Janet's neighbors, a Republican who really likes what President Trump is doing. In fact, she was going to speak with us on Monday. We had this all scheduled. And she had to reschedule so that she could road trip to Houston with her friends to see Donald Trump do his thing at a Houston rally. KING: (Laughter). All right, and I know that while you've been down there, you've also been looking at particular economic factors in these places. And you visited a place that's experiencing something like an oil boom. MARTIN: Something - I mean, totally like an oil boom. This is a place called Pecos, Texas. It's really benefited from all the fracking that's been happening in oil country. Just to give you a sense of how the place has grown, in 2010 the population was around 8,000 people. Today, city officials don't even know what the real population is. KING: Wow. MARTIN: They speculate that because of all the temporary oil workers who are there, there could be up to 50,000 people living there at any given time, which has put a massive strain on the town. Because it all happened so quickly, they haven't been able to really keep up. There's not enough food on the grocery store shelves. They don't have enough restaurants. But what's really interesting is how it seems to be changing the politics of the place. Most of the population is Hispanic. Traditionally, they've been Democrats. Based on our conversations there, that could actually be shifting because these - all these new people are coming in with new viewpoints, people who give the party in power credit for the current economic boom. I want to play you a clip from a conversation we had with a guy named John Pack. JOHN PACK: I've doubled my salary from the fire department. MARTIN: Wow. PACK: I've struggled for a long time. And I've come out here, and I'm just - I'm not struggling anymore like I was. MARTIN: Does it feel like it's going to dry up anytime soon? PACK: No, not as long as Trump's in office. MARTIN: So you're feeling good. PACK: We're riding the Trump train. MARTIN: He's riding the Trump train, Noel. KING: Trump train (laughter). MARTIN: Yep, Trump train - he's pretty happy about the economy, credits the president. Clearly a lot of people here feel that way. KING: And of course, immigration, a huge issue where you are. MARTIN: Right. You would think so, anyway. We're actually at a part of the border that's pretty quiet. We're just a few miles from Acuna, Mexico. These two communities, Del Rio and Acuna, are totally entwined, like is the case in a lot of border cities. We met people who cross the border on a daily basis to go to the dentist, to buy their groceries. They don't see it as a crisis here. And opinions about President Trump and his immigration policies are pretty much split in a partisan way. What people here do agree on - and we're talking about Democrats we spoke with and Republicans - is that a wall, the idea of building a border wall, is not going to fix the country's broken immigration system. KING: Last question, Democrats have been looking for years to turn Texas blue. You think it's going to happen? MARTIN: Right, So we've heard a lot about the so-called blue wave on the congressional side. The incumbent Republican, Will Hurd, has an advantage. A recent poll says he's up 15 points against his Democratic challenger, Gina Ortiz Jones. On the Senate side, the Democrat Beto O'Rourke has given Ted Cruz a run for his money. Recent polling has him down 5 points against Cruz. Ted Cruz is fighting for every vote, though. He is going to be here in Del Rio next week, something people here say hasn't happened for a long, long time. KING: Rachel Martin in Del Rio, Texas. Thanks for the great reporting, Rachel.

In the same remarks, however, Trump criticized mobbing people in public places and destroying public property \u2014 both apparent references to recent GOP criticisms of Democrats and liberal protesters in the final contentious weeks of the midterms campaign season. And Trump suggested the media was partly to blame for the recent conflagration in the country's already overheated political culture and rhetoric. \"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone,\" the president said. And \u2014 echoing his frequent complaints about how the media covers him and his administration \u2014 Trump added that the media produces \"constant negative and often times false attacks and stories.\" But in a much more subdued rally than his usual campaign events this year, the president struck a much different tone in the wake of the apparent effort to target high-profile Democrats, saying \"we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony.\" \"Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective....No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done all the time,\" Trump said. Trump has frequently derided Clinton, his 2016 opponent who he's continued to mock in his campaign events nearly two years after his victory over her. Chants of \"Lock her up!\" remain staples of his rallies, and reporters at Wednesday's rally noted the crowd did break into the familiar refrain before Trump arrived. Well. We\u2019re barely into the pre-program here in Wisconsin and the crowd is already chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!\u201d after senate candidate Leah Vukmir mentions Hillary Clinton in passing. Trump has also repeatedly mocked Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., as \"crazy' and \"low IQ.\" Waters, who has become a liberal hero after she called for Trump's impeachment, said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. Capitol Police had intercepted a suspicious package sent to her D.C. congressional office. But Trump told the Wisconsin crowd that he was trying to \"behave\" and \"be nice\" and none of his usual, red-meat crowd pleasers directed at Waters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Clinton or others were part of his repertoire Wednesday night. \"We're all behaving very well, and hopefully we can keep it that way,\" he insisted. \"We should not mob people in public places or destroy public property,\" Trump said instead. \"There is one way to settle our disagreements: it's called peacefully at the ballot box.\" Trump and leading Republicans in Congress have called liberal protesters in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's divisive confirmation battle part of a Democratic \"mob\" \u2014 a moniker that Trump morphed into a new GOP campaign slogan about \"jobs, not mobs\" in the final weeks before Election Day next month. Trump also shifted blame for such division in the country, in part, to journalists. \"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone, and to stop endless hostility, and constant negative and often times false attacks and stories,\" the president said. Trump didn't mention the suspicious package sent to CNN \u2014 who he frequently brands as \"fake news\" during his campaign rallies \u2014 which caused the cable network's New York bureau to be evacuated on Wednesday. The comments from Trump seemingly faulting the media for the spate of suspicious packages being investigate by federal authorities comes a week after the president appeared to praise a fellow Republican who assaulted a journalist last year. At a rally last week, Trump praised Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., who pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor assault of a reporter who was attempting to ask him a question about health care. \"Any guy who can do a bodyslam, he's my kinda guy,\" Trump said, mimicking throwing a person on the ground. The rest of Wednesday's rally, in support of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Republican Senate nominee Leah Vukmir, was much of Trump's standard campaign stump speech, touting his economic achievements and warning voters that Democrats will not be tough on illegal immigration, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants is heading for the southern U.S. border apparently to seek asylum.",

Dean Heller in Nevada on Saturday for a campaign rally.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump arrives with Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada on Saturday for a campaign rally. Nevada Sen. Dean Heller turned to President Trump at a rally Saturday and told him, \"everything you touch turns to gold.\" Whether or not Heller returns to the Senate next year may be the ultimate test of that statement \u2014 at least when it comes to politics. Few Republicans have traveled further than Heller from entrenched Trump critic to staunch Trump ally. Two years after memorably saying he was \"99 percent against\" Trump, Heller is not only repeatedly appearing with Trump at political rallies, he's using his speaking slots at the events to heap compliment after compliment on the president. \"We weren't friends. I didn't like him, he didn't like me.\" Trump recently told a Nevada crowd. The president memorably taunted Heller during a White House meeting at a point when Heller was a key holdout on the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But then, Trump recalled, \"We started to like each other, then we started to love each other.\" A close relationship with Trump is an asset in 2018, if a Republican wants to survive a primary challenge. But it's not clear how that positioning plays in a general election in an evenly-divided state like Nevada. Whether or not voters reward or punish Heller for his evolution to close Trump ally will be one of several key political questions that Nevada's Senate results will answer. The outcome will also show whether Democrats or Republicans ended up more energized this year, and how Democrats navigated the challenging terrain of the 2018 Senate map. Nevada will likely be the most closely-watched Senate race over the final two weeks of the midterm campaign season. Early voting plays a critical role in Nevada elections, with more than half of the state's voters casting ballots before Election Day. County election boards provide daily updates on how many voters from each party have cast ballots, and both Democrats and Republicans are working hard to get as many people to the polls before November 6 as possible. After three full days of voting, it's not quite clear which party has the upper hand. Nevada's most prominent political journalist, Jon Ralston, wrote Tuesday morning that \"it does not appear yet to be a wave election, as it was in 2014 (red) and 2016 (blue). But this is not like the last two midterms. ...It looks now like an unusually high turnout year for a midterm, three quarters of the last presidential year.\" Typically, the higher the turnout the better it is for Democrats in Nevada, but Ralston cautioned against drawing too many conclusions until several more days' worth of early voting data had come in. In the meantime, Democrats are doing everything they can to energize the type of voter who shows up in presidential races but sits midterms out. Former President Barack Obama rallied with Rep. Jacky Rosen, Heller's Democratic challenger, in Las Vegas Monday, warning that, \"the consequences of you staying home would be profoundly dangerous to this country, to our democracy.\" Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada, looks on as former President Barack Obama speaks during a get-out-the-vote rally as he campaigns for Nevada Democratic candidates on Monday in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada, looks on as former President Barack Obama speaks during a get-out-the-vote rally as he campaigns for Nevada Democratic candidates on Monday in Las Vegas. Former Vice President Joe Biden recently visited the state, as well, as have several likely 2020 Democratic candidates. For her part, Rosen is trying to channel anti-Trump energy into votes. While many other Democratic candidates have tried to keep Trump out of their campaign messaging, Rosen is framing a vote for her as a vote to put a check on the Trump administration. She's repeatedly criticized Trump's decision to try to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA, as well as his controversial policy of separating children from parents who tried to enter to the United States illegally at the southern border. And Heller's swing from \"no\" to \"yes\" during last year's Obamacare repeal attempt is a centerpiece of Rosen's ad campaign. Rosen told NPR that the repeal attempt has stuck with voters for a simple reason: everyone gets sick. \"That's the thing that binds every single person,\" she said, \"even though there may be other things they're worried about. That's why it matters.\" Rosen has called Heller a \"blank check\" for Trump, and her campaign has portrayed him as one of those wiggling tube men often spotted in front of car dealerships, drifting in the wind between anti-Trump and pro-Trump positions. At the end of their lone televised debate last week, Heller defended his newfound faith in President Trump. \"We started working together and it built trust,\" he said. \"When you have success it builds trust. When you have trust it builds friendships.\"",

            "article_content": "The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has fueled growing international outrage. But how the case is resonating in the media and with voters in the U.S. just two weeks ahead of midterms?  AILSA CHANG, HOST: As we've been hearing, the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has sparked international outrage, but people right here in the U.S. are also talking about the incident and how President Trump has been handling it. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports on how it's playing out among voters and U.S. media outlets just two weeks before the midterm elections. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Carol Marotti and her friend Boston Neary work in publishing and live near Burlington, Vt. Both say they're definitely voting next month. Both describe themselves as independents. When I ask if they're paying attention to the Khashoggi case, they nod their heads. CAROL MAROTTI: We actually were discussing it in the car on the way down here. MANN: We meet on the street in Vergennes, Vt., where the two are shopping and leaf peeping. Marotti says she's troubled by President Trump's focus on money and an arms deal with the Saudis rather than seeking justice for a slain journalist. MAROTTI: If he was murdered, I don't think that his biggest concern should be pushing this deal through. Let's get all the facts first and find out and make an educated decision. It was a human being. MANN: Neary agrees, says she thinks Trump's tone just isn't right. BOSTON NEARY: I think that sums it up. More transparent world leadership would be the right thing to do. MANN: This narrative, questioning Trump's moral compass on the Khashoggi case, has played over and over in media that tends to be critical of the president. Here's Joe Scarborough on MSNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNING JOE\") JOE SCARBOROUGH: And then he was killed, and he was dismembered. And Donald Trump's response - we get a lot of money from them. There are Trump's values - not American values. Those are Donald Trump's values. MANN: But in conservative-tilting media friendly to President Trump, this sounds very different. The Washington Post last week described a whisper campaign by conservative commentators and activists aimed at discrediting Khashoggi, some suggesting possible ties to Muslim radicals. This narrative has been taken up by Republican politicians, including Corey Stewart, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia who spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\") ANDERSON COOPER: Mr. Stewart, when you say that Jamal Khashoggi was not a good guy himself, what does that mean exactly, not a good guy himself? COREY STEWART: Well, Anderson, I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there. MANN: One voice leading this attack on Khashoggi is Rush Limbaugh. Less than three weeks after the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist was brutally killed, Limbaugh used his influential radio show on Friday to describe Khashoggi as suspicious, a man unworthy of the president's concerns. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW\") RUSH LIMBAUGH: There's no whisper about this, OK? I'm not whispering anything when I talk about this. I'm shouting it from the rooftops. MANN: On Saturday, the Saudis acknowledged Khashoggi died in their embassy. But many conservative outlets have simply downplayed his death. Like President Trump, they've focused attention instead on that caravan of migrants moving north through Central America and Mexico. Peter Hegseth is the host of the program \"Fox & Friends.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX & FRIENDS\") PETER HEGSETH: It will be time to deploy the military. I believe so because we haven't changed our immigration policies. MANN: This issue, immigration, did seem far more significant to many of the voters we spoke to. They ranked protecting America's borders as a higher priority for Trump than the Khashoggi case. Mike Downs is a retired state trooper in Westport, N.Y., a Democrat who says he'll be voting Republican this year. MIKE DOWNS: Trump is on the right track trying to correct certain things, like, for instance, the immigration. You know, we watch it on television. You know, I feel sorry for these people, but we can't police the whole world. MANN: With voting already underway in parts of the country, our interviews didn't find that Trump's handling of the Khashoggi killing appeared to be changing many minds about him or the midterm elections. Those who favored the president seemed untroubled by the case or weren't paying it much mind. Voters hostile to Trump said the story just reinforces what they felt before - anger and outrage.

Many of the migrants have reportedly returned to their home countries of Honduras and Guatemala.\n                \n                    \n                    Oliver de Ros/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands of migrants attempted to cross the border from Guatemala into Mexico this week. Many of the migrants have reportedly returned to their home countries of Honduras and Guatemala. Guatemala's president says 2,000 migrants have returned to Honduras following a tense standoff on Friday between the mass caravan they had been traveling in and officers on Mexico's border with Guatemala. The president of Honduras said another 486 members of the convoy were also en route back to Honduras, according to Reuters. The migrants were part of a group of thousands that attempted to cross a border bridge over the Suchiate River along the border between Guatemala and Mexico. Many of the migrants had given up waiting on the bridge, and trekked across the water using ropes and rafts. Violent clashes erupted on Friday when thousands rushed across the bridge, and were met by Mexican police officers armed with riot gear and pepper spray. Mexico has said it will allow only migrants carrying valid passports and visas to enter. On Saturday, officials there began accepting small groups for asylum processing and granting some 45-day visitor permits, according to the Associated Press. An estimated 4,000 people made up the group waiting to cross into Mexico this week \u2014 a reflection of what Elizabeth Oglesby, a professor at the University of Arizona's Center for Latin American Studies, described as the growing size of migrant caravans. According to Oglesby, as border restrictions have tightened, the journey for migrants has become more expensive and dangerous, increasing incidences of extortion and the trafficking of women and children. She says migrants have begun banding together in caravans for protection. \"The migrant routes through Mexico are increasingly controlled by organized crime in Mexico, and they prey on Central Americans. They extort them for money,\" Oglesby said, \"They sometimes force them to work as couriers for drug trafficking. There are high levels of violence, especially against women crossing through Mexico.\" Such violence along these routes was much less common 20 to 25 years ago, according to Oglesby. \"It used to be that Central Americans would cross with people from their same community. They would go to Mexico; it wouldn't cost so much. The more the U.S. border has become militarized, the more migration has become the realm of organized criminal elements in Mexico, the more expensive it is for Central Americans, the more dangerous it is for Central Americans and the more that we're going to see these caravans that are a form of protection for Central Americans as they cross through Mexico,\" Oglesby said. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called illegal immigration a \"crisis,\" and insisted that migrants must be stopped before reaching the U.S. border. Pompeo was in Mexico City to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso. In a joint press conference, Videgaray said the migrant caravan that massed along Mexico's border with Guatemala this week is \"a challenge that Mexico is facing, and that's how I expressed it to Secretary Pompeo.\" Reporting from the Tecun Uman border crossing that's between Guatemala and Mexico on Thursday, James Frederick told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly: \"You can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here for the imminent arrival of this caravan.\" Most of the migrants who had gathered there were from Honduras, but there were also people from El Salvador and Guatemala, Frederick said. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales held an emergency meeting with his Honduran counterpart Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez to address the situation on Saturday. According to The Washington Post, \"The leaders said an estimated 5,400 migrants had entered Guatemala since the caravan was announced a week ago, and about 2,000 Hondurans have returned voluntarily. Both leaders had spoken by phone with Pe\u00f1a Nieto and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to discuss humanitarian aid and efforts to help people who want to return.\" Earlier this week, President Trump tweeted that he will send U.S. troops to close the border with Mexico if the group of migrants is not stopped. ....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!.. The Washington Post reports the number of migrant parents entering the U.S. has recently surged to record levels. \"Border Patrol agents arrested 16,658 family members in September, the highest one-month total on record and an 80 percent increase from July,\" according to The Post. President Trump has seized on immigration as an issue ahead of next month's midterm elections. On Saturday, he tweeted about the \"horrors taking place on the border,\" and urged Democrats to work with the White House on a solution. If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together, we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless  pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck & Nancy, call me!",

Democrats have placed their chips as they try to unseat Republicans \u2014 but not on Russia red. This week in the Russia investigations: Why aren't the Democrats trying harder to exploit the Mueller investigation? And Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is set to stop by for a little visit to Congress. The president's onetime national security adviser, campaign chairman, campaign vice chairman, campaign foreign policy aide and others have pleaded guilty to federal charges. The president's son before Election Day in 2016 met with representatives of the same foreign government that employs roughly two dozen people charged by the Justice Department with attacking the election. It's a slam dunk for political opponents, right? Wrong. As midterm campaigning heats up and Democrats try to make their way back from the political wilderness, they are mostly not relying on the Russia imbroglio to make their case to voters. Although the subject comes up and the party has elected to attack President Trump and Republicans for what they call a \"culture of corruption\" \u2014 which broadly involves the Russia saga \u2014 the big political focus is elsewhere. Why? One reason is that Democrats want to program their messaging in affirmative ways, especially on health care, as NPR's Scott Detrow has reported. They want to run on it and in support of the Affordable Care Act, in addition to all the running against Trump they are doing. The president and Republican leaders in Congress are happy to meet Democrats on that playing field, as Trump did on Twitter, for example, on Thursday. All Republicans support people with pre-existing conditions, and if they don\u2019t, they will after I speak to them. I am in total support. Also, Democrats will destroy your Medicare, and I will keep it healthy and well! Moreover, Trump is happy to talk about alleged collusion and alleged obstruction of justice \u2014 because he hasn't committed either one, he says. That's a \"hoax,\" a \"witch hunt,\" and the product of \"derangement\" by his political enemies. A report from the Wesleyan Media Project confirmed the focus of the midterm campaign in terms of ad spending: The 2018 elections are the health care elections, it found, to the exclusion of many other big issues and especially Russia. Per the report out this week: Other interesting issue discussion from 2018 include: 3.8 percent of federal airings in the last month mention opioids and only 0.1 percent of airings mention Russia. Looking at U.S. Senate airings only for which the Wesleyan Media Project has supplemental coding information from English-language airings from September 18 to October 15, zero airings mentioned Robert Mueller, Russia or the Mueller investigation.

Democrats want to program their messaging in affirmative ways, especially on health care. Not the scandal they wanted The Russia story has not turned out the way that Trump's political opponents had hoped. Liberal commentators especially used to talk about the Trump presidency as though it were a temporary \"tryout\" and that Trump would be swept away in no time by a Mueller cast as an avenging angel. Fast forward to now, when Democrats say that even if they take control of Congress \u2014 which is a long shot as compared with simply reaching a majority in the House \u2014 they won't necessarily make trying to get rid of Trump a priority. Former Vice President Joe Biden, dipping his toe into the water for a 2020 presidential run, said he hopes that if Nancy Pelosi is restored as House speaker, she wouldn't try to impeach Trump right away. Pelosi herself doesn't want to use the I-word if she can avoid it. Instead, she wants to mitigate high negatives about herself in red districts and knit together as many moderates as possible to form the kind of coalition she needs to retake control of the House. That's not good enough for the most liberal minority of Democrats, led from outside by billionaire Tom Steyer, who has been running a months-long national media campaign aimed at impeaching Trump. Steyer's organization has been building steam, and if Pelosi becomes speaker again, it could bring a huge amount of pressure on her and Trump in 2019; as The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere reports, Steyer's network reaches more people than the National Rifle Association. The bottom line for both Republicans and Democrats is that they don't know what's at the bottom of the Russia imbroglio. If Mueller were to produce a certified letter from Putin to Trump pledging support for his campaign in exchange for favorable governance, that would take this story in a new direction. Anything short of that, however, given the once-apocalyptic expectations by Trump's enemies of what the Russia story might mean, will seem to them like a letdown, as Politico's Darren Samuelsohn reports. Collusion is so hot right now Then again, there sure are a lot of accusations these days about foreign influence in U.S. elections. Trump has accused the opponent he vanquished in 2016, Hillary Clinton, of conspiring with the Russians. He and Vice President Mike Pence accuse the Chinese of interfering more severely in the United States than the Russians. Trump claims Democrats are supporting the \"caravan\" of migrants headed for the southern U.S. border, a charge that has no basis in fact but which furthers the collusion storyline. Is this a strategy to make \"collusion\" seem ubiquitous ahead of whatever might issue soon from the special counsel's office? Democrats complained this week that the discussion was \"irresponsible\" \u2014 they called it a strategy to disguise how little, in their view, Trump has done in response to Russia's active measures since 2016. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is scheduled to conduct a long-delayed visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, albeit one slightly different from the trips he's made before. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and House oversight committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., say they'll interview Rosenstein behind closed doors themselves, along with ranking members Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Elijah Cummings, D-Md. None of the rank-and-file members will be there.

Rosenstein will swear an oath to tell the truth, and a court reporter will record the session, committee officials said. Once the transcript has been reviewed and cleared by the intelligence community \"to avoid the public dissemination of classified or otherwise protected information,\" it will be \"publicly available,\" they say. When? Good question. That may depend on Rosenstein's answers. If the deputy attorney general says something like, \"yeah, I wore a wire, see, and I sent my G-Men to bug the president's bedroom and we've been wiretapping his phone,\" that may find its way into the press swiftly \u2014 ahead of Election Day in just a few weeks. If Rosenstein sticks to the public accounts he's given about his conversations early in his tenure at the Justice Department, the transcript might not make much of a splash. The deputy attorney general isn't the only witness meeting with members of Congress, even though both the House and Senate are in recess for the campaign season. Nellie Ohr, the woman who worked for the political intelligence firm that commissioned the Steele dossier \u2014 and who is married to Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who kept in contact with Steele \u2014 visited Congress on Friday. And onetime junior Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos is due on the Hill on Thursday. He has been an aggressive booster of Trump's since his sentencing, and Papadopoulos' theorizing about how he was set up by the British or Australian governments will likely be music to the ears of Trump's allies in the House. Remember that wild Bloomberg Businessweek story that said that China had waged an industrial-scale hardware-based cyberattack against American government and business? That there were tiny spy chips in server hardware in use across the tech world? Apple, Amazon and others denied it at the time, and they continue to deny it stronger than ever. In fact, Apple wants Businessweek to retract the whole story.",

He has been holding events around the nation in the final weeks of the midterm campaign, but most of his stops are in states that he won in 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump arrives at a campaign rally in Mesa, Ariz., Friday. He has been holding events around the nation in the final weeks of the midterm campaign, but most of his stops are in states that he won in 2016. As President Trump came to the big finish at a recent rally, his supporters crowded into the Kansas Expocentre shouted along with his 2016 catchphrase. Voices bounced off the walls saying \"we will make America great again\" as the Rolling Stones swelled through the sound system. Donald Trump \u2014 now the president and not on the ballot himself \u2014 is on tour again, performing his greatest hits at fairgrounds and airport hangars and imploring his supporters to vote for someone other than himself.  Like most of his campaign stops this year, the rally in Topeka, Kan., was in a state Trump won in 2016. The two candidates he brought up on stage, gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach and congressional candidate Steve Watkins, are in races rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report. But, the Kansas congressman facing an even tougher race, Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, whose district is rated \"leans Democratic,\" wasn't there. His campaign cited a scheduling conflict for missing the rally. His district in the Kansas City area was only an hour away from the rally by car, but Republican strategists say his race may already be lost due to anti-Trump sentiment in the city and neighboring suburbs and a backlash against Republicans statewide. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: Trump Campaigns In Mostly Friendly Territory Control of the House of Representatives could be decided in suburban swing districts outside of major Democratic strongholds. But an NPR analysis finds that Trump is largely avoiding those areas for his rallies. Of 24 general election rallies he has held or have been announced, just three have been in suburban swing districts. \"He doesn't go to places that are sure wins. He doesn't go to places that are sure losses,\" said White House political director Bill Stepien in an interview with NPR. \"This is a point in time in the campaign where there isn't any time for waste or to send the president to a place that in which the outcome is already decided. So he's in places that are competitive, that are up for grabs and in which he can make a real difference.\" On Monday, Trump is set to hold a rally with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in Houston, a Democratic stronghold with a handful of competitive districts surrounding it. A source familiar with White House political strategy tells NPR Houston was chosen because that's where Cruz's team determined Trump would be most helpful and because there are Republican congressional candidates in the area who could use a boost too. But, the Houston Chronicle reports Rep. John Culberson, whose district is near the rally, won't be attending. Instead, he'll be attending a previously scheduled neighborhood meeting related to flood control. His district went to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Cook rates it a toss-up. \"If he were to come to a suburban swing district, most vulnerable Republicans would likely be busy washing their hair,\" Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said of the president. Trump's goal is to campaign more aggressively ahead of the midterm elections this fall than any of his recent predecessors. He is concentrating his efforts in areas where in 2016 he outperformed previous Republican candidates, like Erie, Pa., where he campaigned last week. Stepien explains these areas \"are bastions of Trump-ism, that candidly are more Trump than Republican.\" As for the states he visits, Trump's travel schedule consistently favors those where Republicans are dominant as well as battleground states that will be key to deciding the 2020 presidential election. There are competitive house and senate races in Democrat-heavy states like New York, New Jersey and California but Trump isn't staging big rallies there. A Republican involved in Senate races around the country suggested to NPR that Trump's travel schedule is at least partially influenced by 2020 electoral considerations. He is campaigning for a mix of House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates, who as Stepien puts it, \"are echoing the president's message and the policy successes of these last two years \u2014 more jobs; better paying jobs; safer, more secure borders \u2014 most boldly, most proudly.\" In other words, those who are embracing Trump are much more likely to be embraced by him and are more likely to benefit from a presidential campaign stop anyway. Boisterous rallies are a big part of the Trump experience. But the people who attend those rallies aren't necessarily Republicans or regular midterm voters. Stepien said as many as 30 percent of those in attendance at these rallies either voted for the first time in 2016 or typically vote only in presidential years, which is why Trump says that while he isn't on the ballot, his policies are. It is a somewhat unusual strategy for a president with an underwater approval rating headed into the first midterm election of his presidency. Trump often says he intends to buck history, and if he's going to do it, it will involve boosting turnout for Republicans. Stepien said Trump's rallies \"are real opportunities in front of big crowds\" to introduce Trump fans to Republican candidates who are on the ballot in November. NPR's Don Gonyea, who has reported from several Trump rallies this year, often finds attendees who have no idea who their congressional representative is. So, such introductions are apparently needed.  Republican pollster Robert Blizzard, who worked on a congressional special election in Ohio in August, where Trump held a rally on the eve of voting, said he saw the president boost enthusiasm in the Republican base. And in the places Trump is going, Blizzard doesn't see much risk of it backfiring. Democratic enthusiasm is through the roof, and complacency among Republicans is a bigger concern, according to Blizzard.  \"I mean, Democratic voters on a 1-10 scale are already at like a 13,\" he said. \"Getting the president into some of those places to kind of fire up the troops and get them excited can only be a benefit,\" Blizzard said. \"At this point in time, Republicans will get all the negatives associated the president; we sure as heck might want to go after the positives as well.\" Does the president help more than he hurts? It's a debate waged every midterm. Ferguson, the Democratic strategist, is betting it hurts, at least in districts where Republican incumbents face Trump-generated headwinds.  \"When he goes to a district, he is a reminder that Republicans in Congress have become his yes men,\" Ferguson said. \"And voters want a check and a balance, not a servant.\" Trump said this week, though, if Republicans lose the House, then he doesn't bear responsibility because he's been campaigning so hard for them.

            "article_content": "Arizona will be majority-minority by 2030. As Arizona's Latino population rapidly grows, what efforts are Republicans making to court the Latino vote?  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Trump is campaigning here tonight. Arizona is a state where the GOP dominates politics right now. Both U.S. senators, the governor, most state lawmakers - they're all Republican. But that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years, and they tend to vote Democratic, which means Arizona could flip from red to blue unless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state. And to get a sense of that challenge, I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called Tolleson. It's about 80 percent Latino. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Spanish). CHANG: I'm in a restaurant serving tortas ahogadas and tacos. And I bump into a guy who could give the Republicans some hope. RAMON BARON: The way we handle our home, especially in Hispanic communities, is the way Trump wants to run the U.S. CHANG: Ramon Baron owns a small business repairing floors. He's a registered Republican, and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands for. BARON: Security, order, you know? You need a certain order in your home. You know, the issues that came with the wall - you know, building a wall... CHANG: You think that's a good idea. BARON: It is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door. I already have a door, but I put a better door. CHANG: You put your own wall... BARON: Yeah, and my son - he's 14 years old. And it's funny that he told me, somehow that door makes me feel safer. It made me think, you know, that, you know, it does make sense. More metal there keeps the worst people out, you know? CHANG: But step outside, and within seconds, you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with Baron like Abel Hernandez, a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker, the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican. ABEL HERNANDEZ: You heard the news. They're coming out with all these laws that make it more difficult for people from any country in the world to legalize their status. You've seen the kids being separated from the families at the border. I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party, if you ask me. I mean, who's ordering all that - you know, Trump and his agenda. CHANG: But there is a reason Hernandez's view may not be worrying Republicans right now. JOSEPH GARCIA: Republicans are banking on two things. CHANG: Joseph Garcia heads the Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University. GARCIA: They're banking on that there's enough white voters to still win the election today, and they're banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow. CHANG: But Garcia says data don't lie. Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by 2030. And a whole lot of them are going to be U.S. citizens. GARCIA: 2018 could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote. CHANG: So the question for Republicans is, how will they persuade those Latino voters to join their team? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey, captain. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Captain. CHANG: I'm at a baseball diamond in a small park in northern Phoenix in the district of State Representative Tony Rivero. Have any of your friends or any other members of the Latino community given you a hard time for becoming a Republican? TONY RIVERO: People have given me a hard time. CHANG: Like what? What do they say to you? RIVERO: Well, they'll say, how could you be a Republican when the Republicans don't support Hispanics, they don't support immigration reform? CHANG: And his response to them is, take a look at all the other values of the Republican Party. They mesh perfectly with Latinos' - faith, the traditional family, small business, entrepreneurship. But it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration. And you can hear that when you walk around Rivero's district as he knocks on doors. (SOUNDBITE OF DOORBELL RINGING) RIVERO: I promise I'm only going to take two minutes of your time. My name is Tony Rivero. I'm a state... I'm a Republican running for re-election. And I'm here answering any questions that you may have. A lot of topics, including our budget, education. Immigration's a hot topic. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, that is a a hot topic. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: I think separating families isn't the way to do it. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: On paper, it doesn't look good. You know, on the news, it doesn't look good. RIVERO: Well, I want to let you know I'm a Republican. I was born and raised in Peoria. My parents are from Mexico. And this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit. And the reason for that is one, yes, we are a nation of laws, but I think this is a country of opportunity. And I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label. But there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform. There are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration reform, and I'm one of them. CHANG: I'm one of them. I ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters. RIVERO: I believe we need a realistic position on immigration, one that includes border security, one that legalizes people who are here who want to work hard, who are looking for opportunities. And we need to increase the number of visas of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and that it doesn't become a political football 10 years from now. CHANG: This sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump administration's pushing. RIVERO: I'm going to continue pushing my position, and that position is what I just mentioned. CHANG: That independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate. Like, you hear it from Republican Governor Doug Ducey, who's running for re-election this year against a Latino candidate. DOUG DUCEY: I'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington, D.C. I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona. I can't be in control of what happens back east. CHANG: Still, I ask Ducey if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters. DUCEY: You won't hear me using the word Republican in the re-election. It's Doug... CHANG: Why not? DUCEY: ...Ducey on the ballot, and it's Doug Ducey's agenda. CHANG: Ducey hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters, a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats, including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry. It was Diaz who approached Ducey for the job because Diaz thinks over the past four years, the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past. MARIO DIAZ: The governor does not support certain language, doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood may call for. He is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them, we need to keep them out, we need to build a wall. Not once has he said that. Now, I cannot vouch for other Republicans. I am vouching for Doug Ducey. CHANG: But under that logic, if Republicans want to appeal partywide to Latino voters, they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric. And there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez. Remember him, the truck driver who says immigration's the deal breaker for Hispanics? Here's the key, Hernandez says. His kids are going to feel the same way he does. HERNANDEZ: They see what's going on. They see how they treat us. And I tell my kids, you got to vote. You got to vote. You got to register to vote. And they said, Dad, we're ready to go. We're there. All right. CHANG: In other words, Hernandez says, the Republican Party's fate may already be sealed for generations to come. And as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party, Governor Ducey will be appearing onstage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: In TV commercials and on debate stages across America, the attacks are now blistering as candidates see Election Day coming up fast. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) TED CRUZ: The kind of policies Congressman O'Rourke supports - high taxes, high regulations, open borders. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: And DeSantis voted five times to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: It was disgusting. We have seen a mob rule in Washington, D.C. CINDY AXNE: Every single one of us is in this together. This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and we all... KELLY: National political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us to talk about what both parties are doing to gain an edge in this final stretch before the midterms. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: Hi. So start with the issues. There's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks - the Kavanaugh hearings, the president's campaign rallies, constant campaign rallies, developments at the border, a crisis with Saudi Arabia. Can we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field? LIASSON: They are not. There might have been a kind of Kavanaugh bump, but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all. The House still looks pretty good for Democrats, not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net 23 pickup seats that they need, the... KELLY: Which they need, yeah. LIASSON: Which they need. Senate map looks excellent for Republicans. It always has. That's because there are a lot of Senate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular. We know that Democrats are more energized this year. Republicans are becoming more energized, as they always do in October. We're also seeing signs that they - we might have a very high turnout midterm election, which is pretty rare. People are self-reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting. We've seen record turnouts in primaries and special elections. KELLY: And what's the closing argument that both parties are settling on? LIASSON: Well, the closing argument from Republicans, who began thinking that that tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them - but as the tax cuts got less popular, their closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts, put regulations back on the economy, wreck the economy. They're kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues, which do energize their base, talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people. And I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters, a Republican congresswoman from California who says, we just learned that my socialist pro-tax opponent outraised us; we can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress. Now, Democrats, on the other hand, have stuck to health care, which is the No. 1 issue for voters this year, except for they're refining it a little bit. They're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich, created a huge deficit, and to close that hole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security. KELLY: Let me ask you the flipside of the closing argument question, which is, what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point? What's keeping Republicans up at night? What's keeping Democrats up at night as Election Day closes in? LIASSON: Republicans are worried about the Midwest. This is the area of the country where Trump really won - Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. They thought those states would turn red. They thought Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states. They'd be solidly red. But they are really struggling in the Midwest. The next two weeks will tell us whether that's true. So they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland. Trump - and another problem for Republicans is that Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave, and his supporters believed him and got a little complacent. And we know that anger is the best motivator. And we don't know who's going to be angrier, white working-class voters, especially men - that's the Trump base - or college-educated white women, who are very angry. But both sides are worried about history. Republicans know the party in the White House usually loses big when a president is under 50 percent. Democrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms. They're worried about motivating low-propensity voters like Hispanics and young people. KELLY: All right, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson - thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: I'm Ted Cruz, and I approve this message. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Beto O'Rourke is more extreme than he wants you to know. BETO O'ROURKE: In one attack ad, which eventually seemed to backfire, Cruz's campaign misleadingly edited videotape to make it appear as if O'Rourke said he supported flag burning, which he did not say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: If Beto O'Rourke's positions are too extreme even for them, he's just too reckless for Texas. GOODWYN: Until now, Beto O'Rourke has declined to participate in negative campaigning. But with the polls showing Cruz with anywhere from a six to a nine point lead, the congressman relented and has gone on the attack. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) O'ROURKE: Republicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform. And yet Ted Cruz is the only senator to vote against moving forward with that conversation. He's vowed to deport every single DREAMer. GOODWYN: Last night in their debate in San Antonio, this trend continued - Cruz painting O'Rourke as a dangerous extremist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CRUZ: If you work in energy, if you work in oil and gas, Congressmen O'Rourke's record on this is extreme. He didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil. He's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking. GOODWYN: But unlike the first debate, last night O'Rourke hit back. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) O'ROURKE: This is what you can expect over the course of this debate. Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. It's why the president called him lying Ted. And it's why the nickname stuck because it's true. GOODWYN: Although Cruz would force a laugh when O'Rourke attacked him, his face revealed his true emotions, and the senator didn't like it. But the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle. It was substantive too. Cruz has the numbers on his side. There are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats. As a result, Cruz spoke mostly to his base. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CRUZ: The state of Texas is booming. We've got right now the lowest unemployment in 49 years. Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and low regulations. And Congressman O'Rourke's position is always, always, always in favor of higher taxes. GOODWYN: If Cruz generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power, O'Rourke tended to speak to voters' better angels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) O'ROURKE: Whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now. The partisanship, the pettiness, the dishonesty - that defines so much of the national conversation. We are in desperate need right now of inspiration. GOODWYN: Although O'Rourke is running way ahead of other Texas statewide Democrats, close still gets you no cigar. CAL JILLSON: I think that a very good Democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through. That's why O'Rourke came up so strong on Cruz. GOODWYN: Cal Jillson is a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University. JILLSON: Cruz is an acquired taste. People respect him as a conservative fighter. They don't necessarily like him. They gave O'Rourke a look. But Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out. It's not two years. It's not four years. It's longer than that because demographic change is very slow. GOODWYN: Beto O'Rourke will appear in an hour-long CNN town hall event tomorrow evening in McAllen on the Texas border. Ted Cruz declined to participate, so O'Rourke will answer the voters questions himself. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The state's growing Asian-American population is expected to have an impact on the midterms in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Bentley/Here & Now\n                    \n                \nhide caption In the Orange County neighborhood known as Little Saigon, signs for political candidates with Vietnamese names line an intersection. The state's growing Asian-American population is expected to have an impact on the midterms in November. Asian-Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in California, now making up more than 14 percent of the population. It's a slice of the demographic pie that has tripled since 1980. And in historically red Orange County \u2014 where there are four races that the Cook Political Report labels as competitive \u2014 Democrats are hoping that Asian-American voters could help turn the county blue. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian-Americans now make up more than 20 percent of Orange County residents. Mary Anne Foo, executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance, says that many of these families have roots in the Philippines, China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan and more. This has been the case for decades, but the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the U.S. \"You see more and more diversity here in Orange County,\" she says, \"and you'll see more of a rise of second-generation [voters].\" Asian-Americans tend to vote Democratic, according to data from the Pew Research Center, with 65 percent identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic and just 27 percent who identify as or sway Republican. When Pew first started tracking the Asian-American vote in 1998, 53 percent identified as Democrats compared with 33 percent Republican. While Asian-Americans generally voted Democratic, those in Orange County are becoming even more progressive and politically active than their parents and grandparents, says Alex Kim, a Korean-American Republican who is currently the principal and CEO of Three Kings Public Affairs. He previously worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Hahn, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and former California Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Among Korean-Americans in Orange County at least, the first generation leans more conservatively for the same reasons that Cuban-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans do, Kim says. Their political views are informed by where they came from: countries torn apart by trauma, war and financial distress. Many of the first-generation Asian immigrants in Orange County are small-business owners running nail salons, dry cleaners and restaurants. Kim says they often use Korean community banks because decades ago it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks. The younger generation also is influenced by their environment, but in the opposite way, Kim says. \"A lot of these Korean-Americans that grew up in [the] second generation tend to grow up in urban areas,\" he says. \"Urban areas tend to focus more on progressive thinking than more of the conservative, suburban ideals.\" For Asian-American voters on both sides of the aisle, one of the key issues on their minds is immigration, Kim says. Many are concerned about President Trump's policies on family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border and \"the thought of eliminating\" chain migration, he says. \"A lot of my relatives came here through chain migration, and the question of workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are [hiring] immigrants coming from that chain migration system,\" Kim says. \"It seems like Korean-Americans, the first generation, still are more majority loyal to Trump. They came here legally, a majority of them, and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country. But definitely my friends that lean more Democratic or liberal Republicans, progressive Republicans like myself, have definitely some qualms about that key issue.\" For Vietnamese-Americans in Orange County, the politics also are shifting by generation, say Tam and Sonny Nguyen, Vietnamese-Americans who own businesses in the Orange County neighborhood known as Little Saigon. They were born in Vietnam but raised in the U.S., Sonny says. \"So we understand what it means to be an American, but we also understand our parents and where they came from,\" he says. Tam and Sonny Nguyen, Vietnamese-American business owners in the Orange County neighborhood of Little Saigon, say they see a \"stark difference\" between the generations not just in their politics, but in how they do business.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Bentley/Here & Now\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tam and Sonny Nguyen, Vietnamese-American business owners in the Orange County neighborhood of Little Saigon, say they see a \"stark difference\" between the generations not just in their politics, but in how they do business. Sonny says they can see a \"stark difference\" between the older and younger generations in not just their political views, but in how they do business. Vietnamese-American businesses were historically isolated because their owners came from a country where you couldn't trust the government or corporations, he says. That's why you'll notice a lot of the businesses in Little Saigon are cash only, he adds. \"First generations, they're known to be very fragmented, and you don't want to collaborate,\" he says. \"And being an American and having inclusivity, I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown, is because we do collaborate, and we're showing our first [generation], our parents, that look, 'We work closely with the cities. We are sharing our best practices.' \" On the streets of Little Saigon, the fence at a busy intersection is covered in political campaign signs. Nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese, but the only Asian-American running for Congress in Orange County this year is 55-year-old Young Kim, a Korean-American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she is running to replace, Rep. Ed Royce. There hasn't been a Korean-American in Congress since 1999, but three are on the ballot this November. Alex Kim says some Asian-American voters are more inclined to support a candidate that looks like them, regardless of party. Even though he's a Republican, Alex Kim is working with a Korean-American Democrat who is running for office in Georgia. \"As a Republican, I'm helping a Democrat because it's more not just about party, it's about also this connection, this ethnic connection,\" he says. \"And having not a single Korean-American in Congress right now, I'd rather, it doesn't matter if they're Democrat, Republican, I would like to see a Korean-American on there to represent me.\" That sentiment is in part a reaction to the way many Asian-Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders, Foo says. They still face discrimination in the workplace, education and housing. \"Asian-Americans, no matter how long they've been here, they get the question of you know, 'Where are you really from?' \" she says. \"I'm fourth generation, my family's been here since 1861, and I still get it. And so it makes people feel that they're not really accepted, or they're not really American.\" Politicians on both sides have a lot to gain from these Asian-American communities in Orange County, Foo says, adding that those who haven't paid attention to them in the past are now. But if Democrats expect to flip conservative districts in Orange County, they will have to convince Asian-Americans to show up on Election Day. Voter turnout among Asian-Americans has been historically low compared with other groups \u2014 just 49 percent in 2016. But Foo says the global political situation across Asia, particularly the trade war with China and the situation in North Korea, is expected to drive more Asian-Americans to vote. \"I think that it makes people more interested in voting because they're really concerned about what's going to happen with trade, what's going to happen with the relationships with [their] home country,\" she says. \"So you'll see more people participating.\"",

            "article_content": "A racially charged political ad in a close House race has ignited a debate about race and culture in upstate New York.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: One of the most competitive and expensive House races in the country is in New York's Hudson Valley. And it has turned into a debate about race. As reporter John O'Connor with member station WNYC explains, it all starts with a 12-year-old rap album. JOHN O'CONNOR, BYLINE: Before he ran for Congress, Antonio Delgado was a lawyer, graduate of Harvard Law School and a former Rhodes scholar. Back in 2006, he also cut a rap album. And that's the part of Delgado's past that national Republican groups are focusing on. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: But as a rapper, the real Antonio Delgado criticized democracy and mocked the war on terror. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"VENOM\") ANTONIO DELGADO: (Rapping) Contradicting Democratic precision in the name of a war against terrorism. O'CONNOR: The ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC, is one in a series from outside GOP groups focusing on Delgado's music, especially his songs protesting the war in Iraq. The ads include snippets of lyrics, dusky images of Delgado, who is black, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and refer to him as a, quote, \"big-city rapper.\" DELGADO: It's to otherize. It's to distract from the issues. It's divisive. O'CONNOR: That's Delgado. Delgado says on the campaign trail, voters ask him about health care and other issues, not his rap album. DELGADO: The opioid epidemic, Lyme disease - these are the things that I'm confronted with all across this district. And very little of it has anything to do with what we're hearing from Faso's side of the aisle. O'CONNOR: His opponent, first-term Congressman John Faso, is a former lobbyist and state lawmaker. He didn't respond to interview requests. But Steve Stivers, the Ohio Republican who runs the NRCC, said Delgado should have to answer for his lyrics. STEVE STIVERS: There are legitimate issues that come up in campaigns where you want to define your opponent for who and what they are. O'CONNOR: York's 19th District is considered a tossup and is crucial to both parties' efforts to control the House next year. The mostly rural district stretches from the Vermont border across the Catskills. It's about 90 percent white, and voters there backed President Trump in 2016. None of the voters I talked to would defend the ads. JOHN COREY: Anyone can see the clips they take out of lyrics are taken out of context. O'CONNOR: John Corey is a 63-year-old retired engineer who lives in the hamlet of Melrose. He's not registered with a political party, a crucial bloc in a district where a third of voters are Democrats, a third are Republicans and the rest something else. COREY: It feels racist. It feels crooked. It feels wrong on every level. O'CONNOR: Another voter, 25-year-old Peter Kiley-Bergen, says the ads don't reflect his priorities like health care and fighting climate change. He recently registered as a Democrat. Like Corey, he's enthusiastic about voting this fall. PETER KILEY-BERGEN: What Mr. Delgado said 12 years ago is not that relevant. What Congressman Faso has done over the past almost two years is much more relevant. O'CONNOR: So far, Republicans seem set to keep talking about Delgado's rapping. The latest NRCC ad in the race once again calls him a, quote, \"big-city rapper.\" For NPR News, I'm John O'Connor. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We incorrectly say in this report that Rep. John Faso had not responded to requests for an interview. In fact, reporter John O\u2019Connor did not make those requests to the congressman or his staff.] (SOUNDBITE OF DJ CAM QUARTET'S \"REBIRTH OF COOL\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Updated at 8:52 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a message for Republican voters who are celebrating the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: Get to the polls in November if you want more conservatives sitting on judicial benches. \"Lose the Senate, and the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years of President Trump,\" McConnell said in an interview with NPR in his Capitol Hill office. \"That, I think, is a scary prospect to the people who like what we've been doing on the judge project and I hope will help us hold on to our majority.\" McConnell said the raucous, sometimes aggressive fight over Kavanaugh's nomination came at a perfect time for Republicans. Polls showed GOP voter enthusiasm slumping over the summer as energy for Democrats spiked. All that turned around when Republicans grew frustrated with the protracted battle over Kavanaugh. The Kentucky Republican said it awakened them to the Supreme Court cause \u2014 an issue that inspired many of the same voters to back Trump in 2016. \"As of the last week or so the hottest issue in our races has [been the] Kavanaugh nomination,\" McConnell said, even outpacing tax reform, which the top Senate leader listed as a major legislative accomplishment. \"We knew the Democrats were fired up. They have been all year. No question about that.\" \"But what we are now seeing is that the enthusiasm and energy on the Republican side comes close to matching the Democratic side, and given the states that we're competing in, that's really good news for us,\" he said. McConnell also called activists opposing Kavanaugh a \"mob\" and criticized Democrats for encouraging their actions. He said Republicans were inundated with protesters in recent weeks and had their lives disrupted. \"We were literally under assault ourselves,\" McConnell said. \"Trailing members for their homes; getting in their faces here in the Capitol. An effort clearly to try and intimidate us. And one of the reasons I was so proud of the result last Saturday on Judge Kavanaugh is that we stood up for two things. We stood up to the mob and we also stood up for the presumption of innocence in this country.\" He also rejected any comparison between those protesters and the conservative Tea Party activists who protested the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act or the raucous crowds that chant \"lock her up\" and jeer at reporters at many of Trump's own campaign rallies. Democrats say the Kavanaugh fight was equally energizing for their voters and for women in particular. At the same time, Republicans are losing support among women in addition to already low numbers among Hispanic and African-American voters. All problems McConnell admits. \"We've always had something of a gender gap,\" McConnell said. \"It's never been as wide as it is now.\" He said he hopes electing qualified women to the Senate, like Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Martha McSally in Arizona, will help close that divide. He also pointed to Hispanic Republicans like Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as evidence of diversity within the GOP ranks, but he noted that attracting black voters has been a bigger challenge. \"I think we can improve our position with women voters and with Hispanic voters for sure,\" he said. \"With African-Americans, we haven't been able to make much headway.\" He did point to Sen. Tim Scott, the first African-American senator elected in South Carolina, as a \"noteworthy\" addition to the GOP conference. \"He's arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina,\" McConnell said. \"So there is hope with African-American voters as well. But I'm more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with Hispanics.\" Several key issues Republicans once touted as the central themes for the midterm elections have faded in recent weeks. McConnell says tax reform remains one of his top accomplishments, despite the fact that it is playing a smaller role in campaigns this year and has been eclipsed by the Supreme Court debate. The GOP message on health care has also shifted. Gone are the days of candidates vowing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Now Republicans are actively embracing protections for people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 a central tenet of the law they all opposed. McConnell said many Republicans are explicitly vowing to keep those protections, even as two GOP Senate candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are suing to weaken consumer protection provisions in the health care law. \"Every one of our candidates have been able to respond to it by saying that they are in favor of making sure that people with pre-existing conditions are covered,\" McConnell said. \"You can favor the lawsuit and still be in favor of maintaining coverage or adjusting conditions.\" McConnell sidestepped whether Republicans would take another run at rolling back Obamacare next year after failing to get the votes for their scaled-down repeal legislation. He called that failed effort \"the single biggest disappointment this Congress and really the only major disappointment\" after moving bills through \"on so many different fronts.\" The top Senate Republican distanced himself from the unusual public criticism that Trump leveled at the Federal Reserve Bank's economic policies. Trump said the Fed had \"gone crazy\" for raising interest rates. McConnell instead said of his own posture on monetary policy, \"I generally avoid commenting on the market. It goes up and it goes down. Or giving the Fed advice.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump has embraced the midterm elections as a referendum on his first two years in office. There's a lot on the line for him in November, from his agenda to the threat of impeachment.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Midterm elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party. Many presidents try to shy away from that idea. But not Donald Trump. He has a lot on the line next month, and he knows it, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: What does Donald Trump think is at stake on Election Day? Well, just about everything. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the Democrats get in, they're going to raise your taxes. You're going to have crime all over the place. You're going to have people pouring across the border. You will lose your right to those guns. Going to ruin your Medicare - watch. LIASSON: And that's not even the worst of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING MONTAGE) TRUMP: They want to turn America into Venezuela. Democrats want anarchy. They really do. LIASSON: Even for Trump, that's pretty alarmist. But according to Newt Gingrich, the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting. Gingrich, who became House speaker when a Democratic president lost a midterm election, knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House. NEWT GINGRICH: Losing the House is a problem. Losing the Senate's a catastrophe. LIASSON: Another way to put it - no Senate, no judges; no House, no legislation. GINGRICH: If you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar, you would get virtually no judge approved. In the House, the big problem will be that they'll just have endless investigations of everybody. LIASSON: Endless investigations, including possibly impeachment of everybody, meaning not just people in the West Wing but every Trump Cabinet official and agency head. Doug Heye is the former communications director for the Republican National Committee. DOUG HEYE: Democrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way that we've never seen before. And Republicans were pretty intense on Barack Obama. This will take it to a 2.0 pretty quickly. LIASSON: You mean like the Benghazi investigation on steroids? HEYE: This is Benghazi in every committee, affecting every department and agency and also means that Trump's eye is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to tout to voters. LIASSON: Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says, on the other hand, if the Republicans hang on, then Trump's style of leadership is validated, and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants. COREY LEWANDOWSKI: If the Republicans are re-elected to the majority, it's a continuation of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his \"America First\" agenda accomplished. LIASSON: Other presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition. Think Bill Clinton. Trump could try to do that, says former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove. But it will be harder now. KARL ROVE: It is possible to triangulate, which is another way of saying of working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues. But we're talking about a climate today that is much different than the climate that we had 20 years ago. And so no, if the Democrats were to take control, it would be, you know, an ugliness that the country would not find tolerable after the next two years. LIASSON: Some supporters of the president paint a different picture. If the Republicans lose the House, they say, Trump could use the Democratic speaker, Nancy Pelosi or her successor, as a foil and cruise to re-election the way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did. But Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it. LEWANDOWSKI: I've heard people say that. And whoever says that should be summarily fired because, clearly, they have no understanding of how politics works. I think this president and his agenda and what he's been able to accomplish, he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office. LIASSON: One thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing. Former Bill Clinton adviser Paul Begala says no White House really is. PAUL BEGALA: They have no idea what it feels like. I do. We lost 56 House seats. Go ask the Obama people what it felt like when they lost 63. It's a gut punch. There's a very real psychological and political price. LIASSON: Part of that price - the rock-solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken. BEGALA: Trump rules his party by fear. They're going to fear him a lot less if they get their butts kicked. He loses so much. LIASSON: So for Donald Trump, whose entire persona is about always winning, the November election could be the first time he's a loser - or not. Mara Liasson, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Beto O'Rourke makes a point as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz listens Friday during a debate at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. It was more duel than debate Friday night in Dallas as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O'Rourke went after each other from the start. Snappy and heavy on snark, Cruz and O'Rourke held nothing back in the first of three debates. Friday's focus was domestic policy, and the candidates sparred on immigration, health care, gun control and even their opinions on professional football players taking a knee during the national anthem. Cruz painted O'Rourke as part of a revolutionary fringe \u2014 placing him to the left of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. He characterized O'Rourke as a politician \"out of step with the people of Texas\" who wants to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, take away Texans' guns and impeach President Trump. \"We're seeing nationally, socialists like Bernie Sanders, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, indeed, Congressman Beto O'Rourke advocating for those same policies,\" Cruz said. O'Rourke accused Cruz of caring more about tax cuts for corporations than his constituents, saying he wanted \"to deport each and every single Dreamer\" and accusing him of being an absentee senator who spent more time campaigning in Iowa than working for Texas. \"In 2016, he missed half of the votes in the United States Senate,\" O'Rourke said. \"You tell me who can miss half of the days of work and still be rehired for the same job going forward. That's not what Texans want.\" The surprisingly competitive Senate race has become one of the most-watched and talked-about contests of the 2018 midterms. Once considered a safe seat for Cruz, recent polls show the candidates running within single digits of each other. Just this week, the Cook Political Report reclassified the race, calling it a toss-up. That is a big deal in Texas, which hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And it's a big deal nationally too: Democrats are likely to retake control of the House in November and, if they can sweep Cruz-O'Rourke and other close races, could wrest control of the Senate from Republicans too. Immigration and border security The vast differences between the two candidates on almost every hot topic were on display, particularly on immigration and border security. \"When it comes to immigration, we need to do everything humanly possible to secure the border,\" Cruz said. \"That means building the wall. That means technology. That means infrastructure. That means boots on the ground. And we can do that all at the same time that we are celebrating legal immigrants.\" O'Rourke says the U.S. needed to \"bring people out of the shadows, allow them to get right by law.\" O'Rourke chided Cruz for supporting legislation that would have allocated billions of dollars to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and called for an earned path to citizenship. \"The alternative, as Cruz has proposed, is to deport 11 million people from this country,\" O'Rourke said. \"Imagine the cost, imagine the stain on this country for generations moving forward.\" A Senate candidate gun fight The crowd watching the debate at Southern Methodist University on Friday was most animated when Cruz and O'Rourke took on guns, police violence and mass shootings. The Dallas debate comes as the area has grappled both with the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white Dallas police officer and the killing of a Fort Worth police officer who was shot trying to stop a robbery. A few weeks ago, a white former police officer from the Dallas suburbs was convicted of murdering a black teenager. A question about the shooting of 26-year-old Botham Jean pivoted into Cruz's chastising O'Rourke for calling for the officer's firing, using hateful rhetoric and \"turning people against the police.\" He raised the specter of the 2016 ambush killing of five Dallas officers by a troubled Army veteran who was reportedly upset by stories of police brutality. Cruz said O'Rourke wanted to get rid of the Second Amendment, prompting O'Rourke to say that wasn't the case. O'Rourke talked about learning to shoot as a kid but also said it's time for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. Cruz and O'Rourke will face off again Sept. 30 in Houston and Oct. 16 in San Antonio.",

Beto O'Rourke speaks during a campaign rally in Plano, Texas, on Saturday. O'Rourke is the Democratic challenger for the Senate seat currently held by Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The Texas Senate race wasn't supposed to be competitive this year. But thanks to an imaginative campaign, Beto O'Rourke has energized Democrats, drawing huge crowds and raising tens of millions of dollars in what was initially seen as a long-shot bid to defeat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While polls show a single-digit race, O'Rourke will need a transformed electorate in order to win in Texas, where no Democrat has prevailed in a statewide race in almost a quarter-century. Specifically, O'Rourke needs to get dramatically more Latinos to show up to the polls in a state where Latinos have far less political clout than their demographic weight would suggest. But as the two candidates prepare to meet for their first debate Friday night, voter registration data suggests O'Rourke's campaign and Texas Democrats may not be pulling in enough new voters to offset Republicans' structural advantages in the state. Texas has a history of very low voter participation. During the 2014 midterms, just 28 percent of the state's eligible voters cast a ballot \u2014 the very lowest rate in the country. In particular, racial minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats, are among the least likely to vote. \"For a couple of decades now there has been a 'demographics is destiny' narrative that has existed,\" said Manny Garcia with the Texas Democratic Party. \"And sadly for many of those years, it seems like base Democrats \u2014 communities of color \u2014 were taken for granted.\" Garcia said Texas Democrats are working harder these days to speak to the needs of Latinos \u2014 and immigrants, in particular. He said he thinks issues like family separation have provided an opening for Democrats. However, issues alone aren't changing the state's electoral math, despite a rapidly growing and diverse population. In Texas' urban counties and the heavily Latino counties in the Rio Grande Valley, there's no surge of new Latino voters, according to voter registration data. Since 2016, there have been single-digit-percentage increases in the number of new voters around the state's four biggest cities of Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin. In the heavily Latino Bexar County where San Antonio is located, voter registration totals have grown by less than 3 percent since 2016. While Latinos are expected to become the largest population group in Texas by 2020, whether this is the year Latinos cost Republicans a statewide election remains an open question. \"Questions\" about O'Rourke's appeal to Latinos Despite growing up in the border city of El Paso, speaking fluent Spanish and having a Spanish nickname, O'Rourke didn't start the Senate race with much support among Latinos. During the Texas Democratic primary in March, he lost most of the heavily Latino counties along the U.S.-Mexico border to political activist Sema Hernandez. \"There was a shock there,\" said Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a lecturer at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. \"So, from the get-go, back in March, there were questions about whether Beto O'Rourke was going to be able to capture the Latino vote.\" Soto believes the O'Rourke campaign is gaining some ground with a slew of radio ads that have been playing on Latino radio stations across Texas recently. The ads feature O'Rourke speaking in Spanish about health care, among other things. Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (left) poses with Gary Malcik following a campaign stop in Temple, Texas, last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Will Weissert/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (left) poses with Gary Malcik following a campaign stop in Temple, Texas, last month. Since the primary, O'Rourke has been traveling around Texas and busting fundraising records, so far bringing in more than $23 million for his bid. But Latino political groups say there's little evidence his campaign is spending much of that money or drawing on the energy he's generated to do the harder work of turning a large number of nonvoters into voters, which is a hard task for any Democratic candidate in Texas. \"The challenge with a candidate like Beto, as great as he is, is that there is so little infrastructure and resources spent in off-year election cycles,\" said Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, the founder of Jolt, a group working to mobilize young Latinos in Texas. O'Rourke's campaign didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Another challenge: Republican voters still dominate elections in the state. Half a million more Republicans voted than Democrats during the March primary. And while Texas Republicans in particular have taken a hard turn to the right in the past decade, they're still able to draw on a relatively deep well of Latino support. Only 54 percent of Hispanic voters backed O'Rourke, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, while 45 percent supported Cruz, whose father is Cuban although he doesn't speak Spanish. Ripples vs. waves Historically, there are several reasons Democrats and third parties haven't made deep investments in changing the state's electorate. One, the Latino population is very young and younger people are far less likely to vote than older people. Two, voter registration drives are especially labor intensive and expensive in Texas due to the state's election laws. Outside groups, Ramirez said, don't want to spend that kind of money in the country's second-most-populous state when it has been solidly Republican for almost a quarter-century. This November, Soto, the UT lecturer, thinks O'Rourke might get slightly more Latinos to vote for him, but she is cautious about whether it will be enough for him to win the Senate race. \"Patterns are patterns,\" she said. \"There is nothing I would like more than to be pleasantly surprised by an increase in voter turnout, but I think ... it's going to be a ripple rather than a wave.\" The fact that this race is closer than anyone thought, Soto continued, is a sign that the state's demographics are changing. It's just happening very slowly.",

Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Brett Kavanaugh is not the first presidential nominee to have his run to the Supreme Court frozen at the finish line by a woman's accusations. Throughout this week of turmoil in Washington, the historical backstory has been the 1991 confrontation between Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and a former colleague named Anita Hill. The classic clash of his and her testimony forced the reopening of Thomas' confirmation hearings and mesmerized a national TV audience for days. Hill won many believers with her powerful narrative of sexual harassment when she and Thomas were both lawyers at the Department of Education (and later at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). Thomas came back with a spirited defense, accusing \"white liberals\" on the Judiciary Committee of \"a high tech lynching\" to put \"uppity blacks\" in their place if they chose to be conservatives. Both Hill and Thomas were African-Americans, but Thomas' defense was an acknowledgement of race as a factor in the entire process. Indeed, race had been a factor in the Supreme Court process even before President George H.W. Bush chose Thomas to fill the vacancy left by Justice Thurgood Marshall \u2014 the only African-American who had ever served on the nation's highest court. Thomas became the second. His nomination was confirmed by the full Senate 52-48, the closest such vote since the 1800s. He is now the Supreme Court's longest-serving active member. But the repercussions of his confirmation fight roiled the next election \u2014 helping to make 1992 the \"Year of the Woman\" \u2014 and they've continued to roil the politics of race, gender and partisanship in America ever since. The electoral connection was critical throughout the Thomas nomination process, and not only in terms of female voters. Two elections that took place in the 1980s were not only preludes but determinants of the drama that would unfold. The first was the midterm of 1986, when several Senate Republicans who had been swept into office with President Ronald Reagan in 1980 were denied re-election. The Senate Democrats regained the majority largely by flipping nine seats the GOP had held, including five below the Mason-Dixon line. They also held seats in Arkansas and Kentucky. And in all these states they won on strong turnout among African-Americans. That reliance on black voters would be widely noted the following year, when Reagan tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with an appeals court judge named Robert Bork. A hero to many conservatives, Bork had questioned liberal landmarks such as the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade (which legalized abortion nationwide) and legislation considered vital to the civil rights movement. The head of the NAACP vowed to fight the nomination \"until hell freezes over, and then we will skate on the ice.\" In a famous denunciation of the nominee, Sen. Edward Kennedy said \"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions [and] blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters.\" Rejected in committee, Bork insisted on a floor vote and lost badly. Most of the Southern and border state senators were still Democrats at that time, and all but two joined their colleagues from the North and West in rejecting Bork. The sense that black voters mattered had never been stronger than in the fall of 1987. One year later, when the first President Bush was elected, he received just 11 percent of the vote among African-Americans, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. That was barely better than Reagan's 9 percent in 1984. Bush had always considered himself a moderate on race \u2014 if not a progressive \u2014 and he wanted to do better. In 1990, Bush got his first high court vacancy to fill and Thomas was on his short list with the sponsorship of Missouri Republican Sen. John Danforth, for whom Thomas had worked. Bush had already put Thomas on a federal appeals court months earlier and by some reports was ready to promote him. Advised that there would be other opportunities and that Thomas at 41 would be around a good long while, Bush named David Souter of New Hampshire instead. That did not please conservatives, who suspected (correctly) that Souter might prove unreliable (he eventually became part of the liberal wing). So pressure on the right converged with Bush's original inclination when the Marshall vacancy gave him the ideal moment in 1991. President George H.W. Bush met Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas on Oct. 9, 1991 in the White House. Bush reaffirmed his \"total confidence\" in Thomas.\n                \n                    \n                    J. David Ake/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President George H.W. Bush met Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas on Oct. 9, 1991 in the White House. Bush reaffirmed his \"total confidence\" in Thomas. Democrats, for their part, feared Thomas would be as conservative as Bork on abortion, police powers and a host of other issues. But he was far more careful than Bork had been in the confirmation process, especially in his public hearings before the Judiciary Committee. So despite their frustration at Thomas' answers about Roe and other matters, Democrats on Judiciary were loath to oppose him. In truth, it seemed every bit as improbable that the Democrats would reject a black nominee as that Bush would replace Marshall with anyone else. Despite his strong Republicanism and conservative views, Thomas had robust support in polls of African-American voters. And it was lost on no one that the same cohort of Democratic senators who had been elected in 1986 would be on the ballot again in 1992. And then Hill spoke up. Suddenly there were bumperstickers that said, \"I believe Anita.\" Women's organizations were incensed at the Democrats' weak defense of Hill in the face of scathing Republican comments about her veracity. But the conflict for the majority party was rubbed raw by Thomas' \"high-tech lynching\" remarks, and the polling among black voters remained supportive. Polling overall also favored Thomas' version of his relationship with Hill. In the end, the Judiciary Committee Democrats could not bring themselves to reprise their rejection of Bork. They sent the nomination to the Senate floor without a recommendation. He prevailed with 52 yea votes, including from 11 Democrats \u2014 all but a few from the South. One who was not from the South but had many African-American constituents was Sen. Alan Dixon, a two-termer from Illinois who had been in statewide office for more than two decades. The following year he would lose in the Democratic primary to Carol Mosely Braun, a relative newcomer from Chicago who ran against his vote for Thomas. Braun was not alone. The Senate's handling of Hill \u2014 and its cavalier dismissal of women from the House of Representatives who tried to show their support for her \u2014 became a flashpoint. Other targets of the backlash, such as Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, barely squeaked by in 1992. Specter had been the harshest of Hill's interrogators. Over time, the wounds of the Hill-Thomas hearings have faded but never healed. Both of the principals wrote moving autobiographies in which they stood by their testimony and criticized their antagonist. Thomas proved to be as conservative a justice as Bush or Reagan could have hoped, anchoring that wing of the court along with the late Antonin Scalia. Some have argued that Thomas' record is even more consistently conservative, as he crossed the aisle less often on specific cases. Hill continued her career as a legal scholar and professor, teaching at the University of Oklahoma and other schools. She is now university professor of social policy, law, and women's, gender and sexuality studies at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. This week, in the midst of the meltdown over Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, Hill published an op-ed in The New York Times. \"There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better,\" wrote Hill. \"To do better, the 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee must demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond.\" The committee should serve as \"fact-finders to better serve the American public, and the weight of the government should not be used to destroy the lives of witnesses who are called to testify.\" If lessons have not been taken from the experience of 1991, Hill writes, then the committee should learn from the #MeToo movement of the present day. The spectacle of powerful men brought down when their abuse of women has been brought to light in the past year has already led many to compare the 2018 elections to those of 1992. With all the primaries concluded, a record number of 257 women are still in the running for Congress this fall. And it can scarcely be lost on the present Senate majority that the majority of voters in American elections are women.",

House and Senate negotiators have agreed to a plan to avoid a shutdown fight weeks before the midterm elections in November. Members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees announced Thursday that they had a deal on a major funding package for the Defense and the Health and Human Services departments along with a short-term spending bill to fund agencies covered in separate legislation they are still negotiating. The funding would extend through Dec. 7.  Both chambers are expected to vote on the measure before the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown. If approved, the agreement would postpone the debate over money for President Trump's border wall until December, when a lame-duck Congress will be in place. House and Senate leaders worked closely with spending negotiators on the package, but the White House has not said whether Trump supports the bill. \"We look forward to reviewing the bill when it's released,\"said deputy White House press secretary Lindsay Walters. The bipartisan agreement was announced hours before the House voted 377 to 20 on a separate three-bill spending legislation that covers energy and water, the legislative branch, and military construction and Veterans Affairs programs. That package, known as a minibus, passed the Senate 92-5 on Wednesday, and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement afterwards saying the president would sign it. Some House conservatives voted against that bill and plan to oppose any upcoming spending agreements over concerns that Republicans gave too much away in the negotiations. Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker, R-N.C., was among those who have threatened to vote against any spending bills that don't cut spending and reflect other GOP priorities. \"House Republican priorities were shut out across the board,\" Walker said in a written statement hours before the vote. \"In the next round of appropriations, conservatives are looking for the conferenced legislation to reflect conservative policy riders such as the ones in the House bill. Unless this is done, many of our members will find it difficult to support this funding.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., dismissed the criticism Thursday, saying compromise was necessary to get a bill passed with bipartisan support. \"When you're negotiating with two parties in four corners, you're not going to get everything you want,\" Ryan said. \"That is how negotiations and compromise and legislation works.\" The spending bills are expected to pass easily without conservative support thanks to significant support from Democrats. It is unclear exactly when the House and Senate could vote, but leadership aides said they expect to send the bills to the president before the Sept. 30 deadline. The agreement includes the often-controversial labor, health and human services bill and funding for the Department of Defense. If passed, it will be the first time in more than a decade that Congress has reached an agreement on full-year versions of those bills ahead of a potential shutdown. In recent weeks, Trump has alternated between indicating he wanted to avoid a shutdown over money for a border wall and saying that a fight over the issue would be good politics before the midterms.",

            "article_content": "Several Democrats considering 2020 presidential bids have made some early moves to elevate their national profiles even before the 2018 midterm elections.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Former Vice President Joe Biden launched a new series on Instagram TV today. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) JOE BIDEN: It's no secret that our immigration system is broken, and for years, there's been a heated debate waged about how to fix it. SHAPIRO: And here's why this is getting attention. Even though the midterms are less than two months away, it's the latest sign that Biden and other possible Democratic presidential candidates are already thinking about the next big election. NPR's Scott Detrow has more. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: During last week's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, it was the two most junior Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who made the most headlines. New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker threatened to break confidentiality rules. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CORY BOOKER: I am going to release the email about racial profiling, and I understand that that - the penalty comes with a potential ousting from this Senate. DETROW: And California Democrat Kamala Harris probed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about whether he had discussed Robert Mueller's investigation with anyone tied to the law firm of one of President Trump's lawyers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: It's a really specific question. BRETT KAVANAUGH: I would like to know the person you're thinking of because what if there's... HARRIS: I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us. DETROW: Neither has said they're running, but both lawmakers are frequently on the list when it comes to possible 2020 presidential candidates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOOKER: This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment. DETROW: But it turns out it really wasn't a Spartacus moment. The emails had already been cleared for release and didn't reveal much about Kavanaugh. And Harris' questions about a mystery meeting never really went anywhere. Despite that, Republican political strategist Alex Conant thinks both Booker and Harris helped their potential 2020 campaigns more than they hurt them. ALEX CONANT: One way to break through is by fighting harder than anybody else. You certainly don't want to be flanked in terms of your energy and your willingness to fight on behalf of the base. DETROW: Conant would know. He was Marco Rubio's spokesman when the Florida Republican was in the same position as Booker and Harris - a high-profile senator viewed as a likely White House contender. CONANT: I don't think all of them have made up a final decision. But just to keep the option open, there are certain things that you have to be doing right now. DETROW: That to-do list includes generating buzz like Booker and Harris did last week, also showing up in key states like Ohio where Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti recently spoke to The City Club of Cleveland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: You know, it's funny. Sometimes people ask, could a mayor ever be a president? Could a Jew ever be president? A few years ago, could an African-American ever be a president? Even more shorter than that, could a reality star ever be president from television? DETROW: And since it's 2018, showing up on social media where Biden posted a new video today. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) BIDEN: Every country needs to control their border, but that does not require ripping infants and children from the arms of their parents. DETROW: There's one more thing on that to-do list, and it's very important. You need to deny that you're positioning yourself for a presidential run. Here's Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren after a major policy speech a couple weeks ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: I am not running for president in 2020. I'm running for the Senate in 2018. DETROW: Of course, all these possible candidates are talking about politics and policy, which isn't exactly how President Trump won in 2016. As they do their day jobs, one other possible candidate is taking a page from Trump even as he challenges him in court. That's Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, who's popping up on cable network after cable network to slam the president. One key choice that every Democrat will have to make - whether they think 2016 set the new normal or whether voters will want to go back to more traditional politics. Scott Detrow, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Just in the past few months, elections in the U.S. have been decided by hundreds of votes. The 2016 presidential election tilted to Donald Trump with fewer than 80,000 votes across three states, with a dramatic impact on the country. Yet, only about 6 in 10 eligible voters cast ballots in 2016. Loading... Among the other 4 in 10 who did not vote was Megan Davis. The 31-year-old massage therapist in Rhode Island never votes, and she's proud of her record. \"I feel like my voice doesn't matter,\" she said on a recent evening at a park in East Providence, R.I. \"People who suck still are in office, so it doesn't make a difference.\" Davis might sound contrarian, but she's not. Although these days more Americans say they're enthusiastic about voting in a midterm election than at any point in the last two decades, come Election Day, nonvoters like Davis will still probably be the norm. For every 10 adults eligible to vote, only about four cast a ballot in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. You have to go back to the turn of the 20th century to find a midterm election when a solid majority of people voted (of course, back then, the right to vote was far more limited, so the eligible voting pool was smaller, more male and more white). Every election cycle there's a lot of attention on who voted and why. But there's another important question: Who is not voting \u2014 and what impact does that have? The wealthy tend to vote more frequently. Nonvoters are more likely to be poor, young, Hispanic or Asian-American. Some research also indicates they're more likely to align with the Democratic Party. It's debatable whether election results would be different if the entire population voted, but voting determines more than which candidate wins or loses. It ultimately influences which policies elected officials enact and whose interests candidates ignore and acknowledge. \"The one consistent finding from 1972 up through 2008 and in subsequent elections are that voters and nonvoters have different preferences on economic policies,\" said Jan Leighley, co-author with Jonathan Nagler of the book Who Votes Now? Demographics, Issues, Inequality, and Turnout in the United States. Her research found that nonvoters are more likely, for example, to support a redistribution of wealth, housing bailouts and expanded social safety net programs. Hundreds of thousands of nonvoters want to vote, but can't. In 2016, 4 percent of registered voters did not vote because of \"registration problems,\" according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. Many would-be voters face a range of barriers: voter ID laws, registration difficulty or criminal records. An estimated 10 percent of adults in Florida, for example, can't vote because of a felony conviction. Some people who want to vote but can't have been removed from the voting rolls. Across the country, the rate at which people are being purged from the voting rolls, a process historically intended to keep records updated, has increased substantially compared to a decade ago, according to a report from the Brennan Center published this summer. The analysis found 4 million more people were purged between 2014 and 2016 than in the equivalent period between 2006 and 2008. Legal obstacles are an important part of the nonvoter story, but there are many millions of Americans who can vote and yet choose not to. Their reasons are vast: Some are apathetic or too busy. Others don't like their choices, they don't think their vote matters, they think the system is corrupt, or they don't think they know enough to vote. NPR traveled to four states where different factors affect why people aren't voting at high levels \u2014 age, income, education level, and habits. Shelby Mabis, a stocky blonde Marine corps veteran, remembers taking a government class in high school, but said he didn't learn anything about voting. \"From what all I know about voting is you show up to a poll place and you vote, but I don't know what I need to bring. I don't even know what happens during there,\" said Mabis, 23, outside of his mandatory political science class at a community college in North Las Vegas. And so he's never voted before. Mabis is not unusual. There's a high density of people in his area who don't vote, as in many places. Loading... \"Whenever young people are surveyed, there is a significant lack of knowledge about how exactly the government works, and, therefore, how their vote actually matters,\" said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the director of CIRCLE, an initiative at Tufts University that studies youth civic and political participation. She recently conducted a survey of working-class youth, and found that nearly 20 percent of young people said they don't think they know enough to be able to vote. Her research has found that a majority of young people don't think voting is an effective way to change society. They also have major misconceptions about voting. Some think getting a citation for driving under the influence meant they could no longer vote. But for Mabis, not voting is not just about education \u2014 it's about location. \"Right now, being away from home, I don't feel connected to the political system here at all,\" he said, referring to Nevada. \"Since I'm not from here, I really feel like this isn't my home.\" Mabis grew up in Missouri, and that's where he registered to vote. But he said it's not easy to stay connected to Missouri politics. Analysts say this is common - young people are more often transient and so they often feel less invested in local elections. Youth turnout nationwide for midterms is around 20 percent. For older adults, it's closer to 50 percent. When you look at who votes frequently over many years, the numbers look even starker. Loading... In over a dozen interviews, NPR heard similar reasons from young nonvoters for why they don't participate in politics: they don't feel their vote matters, they don't care, they're busy, or they don't feel like they know enough to vote. But in some cases, they're also particularly eager to choose individual candidates instead of a party label. In 2016, many said they felt uninspired by both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. So, like Jonas Rand, they didn't vote for president. \"I don't believe it is actually effective to vote as a main method of accomplishing political change,\" said Rand, a senior who studies anthropology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Rand follows the news closely, he considers himself a political activist, but he's not a fan of the current two-party political system. \"The system itself is stacked against the citizenry,\" he said. He thinks Trump is a \"fascist,\" but still he doesn't see how voting for Clinton would have changed anything, pointing out that Nevada's votes in the Electoral College went for Clinton anyhow. But if young people don't vote, they're less likely to be targeted by political campaigns. And that worries community activist Francisco Morales. \"It's no coincidence that politicians care a lot about Medicare and Social Security. Seniors vote all the time,\" said Morales, state director for the Center for Community Change Action. But, he says, issues that millennials care about, such as student debt, are often overlooked \"because politicians are not afraid of our voting bloc.\" Downtown Welch, W.Va., in McDowell County, which is one of the top regions in the U.S. where people don't vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Bruce for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Downtown Welch, W.Va., in McDowell County, which is one of the top regions in the U.S. where people don't vote. McDowell County, W.Va., is the county with the lowest voter turnout in a state that had one of the lowest turnout rates in the country in 2016. In Welch, W.Va., the county seat, median household income hovers around $25,000 a year. Sixty one percent of registered voters in McDowell County are nonvoters, people who have voted zero or one time in the last eight elections, according to a review of data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor. Tammy Lester, a 42-year-old fast food worker in McDowell County, W.Va., can't remember the last time she voted. \"We vote these people in and they don't help McDowell County,\" she said, as she walked along the deserted streets in the rundown downtown with her daughter. \"There's nothing ... there's no jobs when our kids graduate, they have to leave.\" Beyond a movie theater, a small pharmacy, and a couple of county offices, most of the storefronts are closed. A couple of years ago, the closest Walmart shut down, and now there's hardly anywhere locals can buy fresh produce. Lester said politicians always ignore her county. \"We are last on everything,\" she said. \"What good does it do, though, when they'll promise you anything and then it's a lie,\" she asked rhetorically. Lester, like many nonvoters, never went to college. She stopped going to school in eighth grade. Research has shown the biggest and most persistent difference between who votes and who doesn't is education and economics. Class is a more accurate predictor of voting behavior than race, ethnicity, gender or any other demographic factor, according to Jan Leighley. Leighley writes in her book Who Votes Now? that nearly 80 percent of high-income earners vote, compared to barely 50 percent of low-income Americans. \"I just don't think my vote matters,\" said Josh Mullins, as he pushed a stroller along the street in McDowell County. The last time Mullins, a 33-year-old unemployed former restaurant worker, remembers voting was in 2004 for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Nowadays, he sees no point, saying the system overrules what people want. \"Hillary [Clinton] won the popular vote and we still have Trump for president,\" he said. \"To me it says ... it was just the [Electoral College] that put Trump in office.\" Voters in each state determined the Electoral College outcome. Another major reason people say they don't vote is the time and effort taken away from other priorities. \"They're working several jobs, they're low-income, they're low-education, they're younger and they decide the costs are too high for them,\" explained Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who tracks turnout at the U.S. Elections Project. \"They decide they've got a lot of other things going on in their lives.\" Loading... At the Bowie Bakery, a popular institution in El Paso's Segundo Barrio, or second ward, Christina Rodriguez examined the glass cases filled with Mexican sweet breads, tres leches cakes, cupcakes, cookies and pastries. She ordered a batch of cookies for her 15-year-old's quincea\u00f1era and made her way to the door. Rodriguez, a 38-year-old single, working mom, is always on the go. It's why, she says, she doesn't vote. \"I don't even know who's running,'\" she said, laughing with a bit of embarrassment. \"I should look into it, but, honestly, I haven't given it more than a thought.\" The Bowie Bakery is a well-known, traditional establishment in El Paso. Most of the older bakers working here, like this man, are residents of the U.S., but not citizens. The younger bakers are citizens, but not residents \u2014 they live across the border with their families in Juarez. Neither vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Bruce for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Bowie Bakery is a well-known, traditional establishment in El Paso. Most of the older bakers working here, like this man, are residents of the U.S., but not citizens. The younger bakers are citizens, but not residents \u2014 they live across the border with their families in Juarez. Neither vote. She doesn't have time, she said, to look up the candidates, research their platforms and head to the polls. \"I'd rather not show up and do an uneducated guess,\" she said. \"I don't want to make a mistake.\" Growing up, her parents never voted either. Voting, she said, wasn't part of the culture in this border city where over 80 percent of residents identify as Latino. \"Voting is often taught and it may take a couple generations to become a habit,\" said Lisa Wise, the elections administrator in El Paso. Some immigrant families are still unfamiliar with voting. Experts suggest this might also explain why Asian-American voter participation is low, despite high education levels. The adult Asian-American population is largely still foreign-born. \"I do what I do to make my life better,\" said Rodriguez. \"I don't depend on (politicians) to change things for me.\" But analysts say low Latino turnout in Texas isn't occurring in a vacuum. Texas has long been home to one of the worst voter turnout rates in the country; 51.6 percent of Texans voted in 2016. Research has shown that competition energizes the electorate, and Texas is largely not seen as a competitive state, particularly in presidential years. Locals say they have a joke in El Paso that the only time a major presidential candidate passes through the city is when he's driving to New Mexico. Loading... \"Texas has not had the swing state machine that we've seen in other places around the country,\" said Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy. \"There aren't those resources, money, and investment coming into the state to get every voter.\" This is also an issue in California, the state with the largest Latino population. Broad political apathy seeps into local and statewide elections, too. At the Bowie Bakery in El Paso, most customers didn't know that their native son, Beto O'Rourke, is running in a closely watched Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. They didn't know that if O'Rourke wins he would be the first Democratic senator elected from Texas in a quarter century. It also doesn't help engage voters that El Paso has had a history of corrupt elected officials. Texas is undoubtedly one of the highest nonvoting states in the country, but poor Latino turnout goes far beyond the borders of Texas. Loading... More than half of eligible Latinos nationally don't vote. In the last presidential election, Latinos represented 12 percent of eligible voters nationwide, but only 9 percent of the overall electorate on Election Day. Many analysts predicted that Donald Trump's offensive rhetoric about Latinos would mobilize records numbers of Latino voters in 2016, but turnout remained relatively even with 2012. \"You may be upset about somebody like Donald Trump and what you're hearing,\" said Romero. \"But if you don't see how or why ... politicians and the political landscape matters for you ... you don't think you have agency,\" Romero points to two main reasons so many Latinos are nonvoters: the disconnect they feel with the political process and the anemic investment in outreach. But Romero doesn't blame the Latino community, she and Leighley both point out that candidates rarely try to reach new voters. \"This idyllic notion that campaigns are out there to get everyone to vote is simply not true,\" said Leighley. \"They need one more vote than their opponent, they will go to people based on those voter files that they know have voted before and they focus on them.\" It's more expensive and time consuming to chase down infrequent voters. NPR used data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor, to analyze and illustrate what differentiates nonvoters from frequent nonvoters. Because our data set is derived from a voter file, it's limited to registered nonvoters, as opposed to unregistered nonvoters. We defined a \"nonvoter\" as someone who voted in zero or one of the last eight elections, and a \"frequent voter\" as someone who voted in six, seven or eight of the last eight elections. Those eight elections includes both primary and general elections, which means the data goes back to approximately 2010 nationwide, varying slightly in some states like those with off-year elections. So, if someone voted one time in the last eight years, perhaps for Barack Obama in 2008 or Donald Trump in 2016, but did not participate in any other elections, they would be characterized as a \"nonvoter.\"",

Martha McSally of supporting \"amnesty\" for some immigrants in the U.S. illegally. At a campaign event in a restaurant northeast of Phoenix, Ariz., Republican Kelli Ward presented the crowd with a choice. \"Are we going to elect a senator that is cut from the same cloth as Jeff Flake and John McCain?\" Ward asked. The crowd of faithful supporters replied with a resounding \"No.\" Ward, a former Arizona state lawmaker, tried challenging GOP Sen. John McCain in a primary two years ago. She lost, but she never really stopped campaigning. Sen. Jeff Flake was already facing a challenge from Ward when he decided last year he couldn't win a Republican primary as a prominent critic of President Trump. Flake is now retiring from the Senate, leaving an open seat that Democrats are eyeing as part of their very narrow path to take control of the Senate. Republicans want to block them, and they can likely do that if they hold this seat in Arizona. But with less than three months before Election Day, the party first has to settle a bitter primary battle being fought largely over which candidate is Trump's best ally on immigration. Ward promises to be his strongest supporter when it comes to that issue. \"Leadership in Washington will pass a budget without funding for the wall if we let them,\" she said. \"And so, they have to know that there is a group of people, a powerful group of people who will not allow them to get away with it.\" There's another far-right candidate in the race, Joe Arpaio, the former county sheriff convicted of criminal contempt and later pardoned by Trump. Many Ward supporters think Arpaio, 86, is too old. They also reject the front-runner in the race, Rep. Martha McSally, a former fighter pilot and a more moderate member of the House of Representatives. Front-runner Martha McSally has the endorsement of the border patrol union and is tacking right on immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt York/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Front-runner Martha McSally has the endorsement of the border patrol union and is tacking right on immigration. Republican voter Teresa Mendoza said McSally is not a reliable conservative: \"Are we really going to elect another McCain in a dress? Oh, my God, just the thought!\" McSally criticized Trump in 2016, and although he hasn't endorsed her, he's talked about her in glowing terms a couple of times since taking office. McSally does have the endorsement of the border patrol union and is tacking right on immigration. \"Around Arizona, everywhere I go, whether people are registered as Democrats, independents or Republicans, they want our border secure,\" she said to reporters after the border patrol endorsement was announced. \"They want to stop the cartels coming through our communities. They want to stop the opioids coming in and killing people. They want to stop the gang activity. This is a unifying issue, and I am proud to be working with our president in order to get the mission done.\" McSally has, for better or worse, a congressional record to answer for that her primary opponents do not. She was an original co-sponsor of a conservative immigration bill in the House earlier this year. It would've provided limited legal status for some recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It wasn't a path to citizenship, but Ward derides it as \"amnesty.\" McSally also stepped back from a DACA bill she had co-sponsored that would have provided a path to citizenship. She said that wasn't to pander to conservatives, but to discourage a forced vote on it. \"A bill by itself coming up like that is not the appropriate thing for us to be doing, and I just wanted to make that clear,\" she said in an interview. But if McSally wins after taking a harder line in the primary, it's a tight pivot to the general election. Arizona's primary is next week, Aug. 28. Roughly six weeks later, mail-in ballots go out for November's election. \"Regardless of having to reframe her, maybe, in 30 days, I think they're willing to say, look, let's take that chance, but she's got to come out of the primary first and foremost,\" said Jaime Molera, a Republican political consultant in Phoenix. \"And that's why you're seeing a massive amount of resources that I didn't think was needed, but I think they'd rather be safe than sorry.\" The resources include over $3 million in Republican superPAC money. That's more than outside groups spent to boost McCain in his 2016 primary against Ward, who they fear is too extreme to win in November. Ward recently announced a bus tour, whose riders include a conspiracy theorist who promoted the false Pizzagate story. Meanwhile, Democratic groups have already spent millions opposing McSally. \"I guarantee you they're making sure that they have a lot of commercials ready to go the day after [the] primary that will be able to launch against whomever the Republican is,\" said Molera. The Republican winner will likely face Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a House member heavily favored to win her Senate primary.",

He said what he called a \"phony blue wave\" of Democratic wins would mean \"crime and open borders, not good.\" Trump singled out several ICE and Border Patrol agents during his remarks, including Border Patrol agent Adrian Anzaldua, who was responsible for discovering a tractor-trailer containing nearly 80 immigrants in Laredo, Texas. Trump asked Anzaldua to come up to the stage to recount his actions, saying, \"He speaks perfect English.\"",

The Democrat even raised the specter of impeachment after President Trump's Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin \u2014 although O'Rourke has since walked back that position some. Nevertheless, recent polls have him just 2 and 6 points behind Cruz. Compare that with the 20-point walloping state Sen. Wendy Davis endured in 2014 when she lost in a landslide to Republican Greg Abbott in the race for governor. But that recent history begs the question of whether someone running as far to the left as O'Rourke can actually win in a state like Texas. Former Texas agricultural commissioner and Democratic populist Jim Hightower sees something different in O'Rourke's campaign. \"You've got a Democratic constituency that is fed up, not just with Trump, but with the centrist, mealy-mouthed, do-nothing Democratic establishment,\" Hightower said. \"They're looking for some real change and Beto is representing that.\" Cruz says he is taking O'Rourke's candidacy very seriously. \"I think the decision he's made is run hard left and find every liberal in the state of Texas, and energize them enough that they show up and vote,\" Cruz said in an interview with NPR. \"And I think he's gambling on there are enough people on the left for whom defeating and destroying Donald Trump is their No. 1 issue, that he's hoping that's his path to victory. I don't see that in the state of Texas. In Texas, there are a whole lot more conservatives than liberals.\" GOP Sen.

Ted Cruz takes a photo with a supporter during a rally to launch his re-election campaign on April 2 in Stafford, Texas. Cruz says he's taking O'Rourke's campaign seriously. When it comes to the critical issue of immigration, the two Texas candidates for Senate couldn't be further apart. Last week in Temple, Cruz indicated he supports ending birthright citizenship telling the crowd, \"It doesn't make a lot of sense.\" O'Rourke is against building a wall along the border and favors a gradual path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally. Political observers in Texas say it's still too early to get a good read on the race, although it seems that O'Rourke's campaign is generating some momentum. Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, which does extensive statewide polling, says the key to O'Rourke's success thus far is that he began his campaign early. \"He's much more viable, he's been working harder, he's traveled all over the state. He started earlier than the statewide candidates that we've seen in recent years, and I think it's made a big difference,\" Henson said. Still, Henson believes an O'Rourke victory is probably a long shot, not for lack of effort or fundraising, but because of the advantage Republican candidates enjoy in Texas when it comes to the sheer numbers of voters. \"In a 100-yard dash, [O'Rourke] probably starts 10 to 15 yards behind,\" Henson said.

Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Texas, greets supporters at a cafe in San Antonio. At a caf\u00e9 in San Antonio where he has come for an interview, O'Rourke is mobbed by customers who recognize him and want a picture with him. The congressman patiently chats up everyone who approaches and agrees to pictures. He urges his fans to share the photos on social media, a likely unnecessary piece of advice. With the recent separations of immigrant children from their parents who are seeking asylum at the Texas border, immigration is hot topic of conversation. O'Rourke also supports protections for immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children, known as DREAMers. \"I think that this state, the most diverse state in the country, should lead on immigration,\" O'Rourke told NPR. \"Free DREAMers from the fear of deportation, but make them citizens today so they can contribute to their full potential. That is not a partisan value, that's our Texan identity and we should lead with it.\" O'Rourke seems to have no fear of sounding too progressive for Texas. He has no interest in moving toward the ideological center for the general election. He borrowed an old line from Jim Hightower as way of explanation. \"The only thing that you're going to find in the middle of the road are yellow lines and dead armadillos. You have to tell the people that you want to serve what it is you believe and what you are going to do on their behalf,\" O'Rourke said. \"We can either be governed by fear, fear of immigrants, fear of Muslims, call the press the enemy of the people, tear kids away from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, or we can be governed by our ambitions and our aspirations and our desire to make the most out of all of us. And that's America at its best.\"",

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: After a disputed presidential election, Zimbabwe has cracked down on the opposition. One of its leaders sought asylum in neighboring Zambia, but he was returned, then detained. Now he's out on bail. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: These seven seconds are what got Tendai Biti in a world of trouble. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TENDAI BITI: The results show beyond reasonable doubt that we have won this election. PERALTA: In fact, the electoral commission declared President Emmerson Mnangagwa, not Biti's opposition MDC-A party, the winner. And Biti was then hunted down by security forces, who charged him with fomenting violence and of announcing unofficial results. A video posted on Twitter shows Biti crossing the border into Zambia with the help of his supporters. Biti asked for asylum, but Zambia sent him back to Zimbabwe to face authorities. Dewa Mavhinga of Human Rights Watch says what happened to Biti is just a small example of what's happening to opposition supporters across Zimbabwe. DEWA MAVHINGA: We have documented groups of armed uniformed soldiers on a rampage, plainclothes police and also unidentified gunmen targeting senior opposition officials. PERALTA: Last week, at least six people were killed when the military opened fire on protesters. Maxwell Murieto was in downtown Harare when that happened. He says police found an opposition card in his car. Military guys, he says, blindfolded him and drove him to a building somewhere where they started hitting him. MAXWELL MURIETO: (Speaking Shona). PERALTA: He says they hit him with their guns, and they slapped the bottom of his feet with an electrical cable. I ask why he thinks they did that. MURIETO: (Speaking Shona). PERALTA: \"It's about protests,\" he says. \"They don't want dissent.\" Mavhinga of Human Rights Watch says this is a dangerous parallel to what happened after Zimbabwe's 2008 elections. Security forces unleashed systematic violence on the opposition and ended up displacing tens of thousands of people. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Rand Paul, center, and his communications director Sergio Gor, right, enter a hall during their meeting with Russian lawmakers in Moscow Monday. By now, practically everyone has seen that picture of the two guys at President Trump's weekend rally in Ohio wearing T-shirts that said: \"I'd Rather be a Russian than a Democrat!\" So I took this photo yesterday of two guys from Delaware, Ohio at a Trump rally. Learn more about them here. https://t.co/nEPZFvdCS0 pic.twitter.com/kzdcwWtXfm Many have also seen the visuals of Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul hobnobbing in Moscow this week with members of the Russian Council, sometimes called his \"counterparts.\" These included the chairman of the council's foreign policy panel, Konstantin Kosachev, who happens to be under official U.S. sanction for his government's actions against our government. But that didn't seem to bother Paul, who invited Kosachev and others to visit the USA. Indeed, this sanction and other tokens of disapproval imposed on Russian officials in the past year have not seemed to chill the enduring warmth between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump. Paul carried a handwritten note from Trump to Putin on his trip. A recent Gallup Poll showed some 40 percent of Republicans, a plurality of the self-identified category, now regard Russia as an ally or at least as a country friendly to the United States. That is double the percentage of Republicans who expressed that view to Gallup in 2014. One need not go far to find enthusiasts at any Trump rally who say they have no problem with Russians helping elect or re-elect him \u2014 so long as he fulfills his campaign promises to Americans such as themselves. Who cares? Countries interfere with the internal business of other countries all the time. Just after he took office in 2017, Trump was asked on Fox News about Putin's reputation as a \"killer.\" Trump shot back: \"You think we're so innocent?\" And the dominant image of America's posture toward the autocrat in Moscow is now the sight of the two presidents on stage in Helsinki last month for a news conference. Much of the world was shocked at their cordiality, at Trump's apparent acceptance of Putin's denials about 2016 election hacking and at Putin's open admission that he had favored Trump's election. This week, the U.S. did finally get around to issuing some new sanctions against the Russians for using a chemical agent (Novichok) to carry out an attack on foreign soil in violation of international law. The poisoning of a former Russian spy (Sergei Skripal) and his daughter in London in March had prompted widespread condemnation and sanctions from other countries. But months went by between the determination of Russian guilt in that incident and the formal response from the Trump administration this week. #Breaking: A second meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been delayed, according to a statement from national security adviser John Bolton. Trump also has grudgingly postponed a planned Washington visit by Putin, pushing it into the new year with the proviso that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election be finished first. But the real endpoint of that probe is far from certain. This week, in a related trial in federal court, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been shown to have extensive entanglements with Russians. These include debts to Oleg Deripaska, a member of Putin's inner circle of associates, who has sued him and his former associate Rick Gates for $25 million. How seriously should we take any of this? Some are asking whether Manafort's exposure to Russian pressure and influence might be a reflection of Trump's own. That spurs a defensive reaction from the presidents' staunchest supporters, such as the guys in the T-shirts, who may regard it all as a kind of joke. Or perhaps it was just their way of trolling the world or letting us know how much they disliked the Democrats. And if seeing that message was also a hoot for Putin, so be it. Paul speaks for the \"who cares?\" wing of the party by saying Russia did nothing that other countries don't do \"all the time.\" Like his father, the iconoclastic libertarian and frequent presidential candidate, Ron Paul, the Kentucky senator is quick to note the instances of U.S. interference in elections abroad. For those who take their cues directly from Trump, all tales of Russian influence and interference are distractions that border on being a conspiracy against the Trump regime. It has been called a \"coup in slow motion\" by more than one commentator on the right. Of course, many Republicans have not changed their view of Putin or his government. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain continues to call Putin \"a thug\" and denounces his \"vile attacks on democracy.\" The conventional view among congressional leaders is that Mueller's investigation of Russian interference should go forward and that Putin cannot be trusted. A phalanx of Trump officials came to the White House briefing room last week to pledge a vigorous defense against Russian efforts to hack the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 efforts they acknowledged were very much underway. Yet it is impossible to miss the shift in attitude in key parts of the conservative coalition. This was presaged by an undercurrent of admiration for Putin that had existed for years in some quarters of the conservative blogosphere. Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt Sarah Palin, the outspoken party nominee for vice president in 2008, had this to say to Sean Hannity on Fox News in 2014: \"Look, people are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil. They look at our president [Obama] as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates.\" Palin at the time seemed mostly interested in using Putin as a critique of Obama. That same year, a poll by the nonpartisan YouGov found only 10 percent of Republicans viewed the Soviet strongman favorably. But the implicit admiration Palin expressed for certain qualities perceived in Putin was present among some American conservatives \u2014 as it was in nationalist and populist elements of the political mix in other Western democracies \u2014 even before Trump's ascendance. But it was Trump who gave this strain of thought a massive steroid shot with his attitude toward the Russian autocrat throughout the primary and electoral season. Another YouGov.com poll late in 2016 found the percentage of Republicans viewing Putin favorably had nearly quadrupled in two years to a stunning 37%. Even more remarkable, perhaps, was the decline in those poll respondents who said they disapproved of Putin strongly. That response was chosen by an outright majority of Republicans (51%) in 2014 but by just 10% in late 2016. It must be said that a corresponding change has overtaken many Democrats in the Trump era. Many who were all in favor of the famous \"reset button\" policy when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state in 2009 are now suddenly wary of the Kremlin and all its works. They see nothing but evil. Part of that is experience. They have seen Putin seize Crimea and besiege parts of Eastern Ukraine. They remember the Dutch airliner that was shot down by a Russian missile in that region. Still, the spectacle of Republicans defending Russian interests while Democrats attack, represents a role reversal as striking as any in this era of irony. At bottom line, the idea of \"getting along better\" with Russia dates back to Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost era and the efforts at \"d\u00e9tente\" before that. Even before the \"Iron Curtain\" was lifted, the idea of nuclear war had receded and the poles of the Cold War had seemed less diametrically opposed. Henry Temple, also known as Lord Palmerston, was twice the British Prime Minister in the 1800s. But he may be best remembered in our time for these words: \"We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.\". These words are often quoted as a capsule of what we now call Realpolitik, an approach to foreign policy emphasizing a realistic assessment of each nation's selfish ends over any kind of idealism on the international stage. By Palmerston's dictum, any nation we have fought as an enemy may become an ally and friend \u2014 but only for the interval that history dictates. In the first half of the 1900s, the U.S. fought two wars in Europe in an alliance against Germany that included Russia. Since then, we have been resisting the Russians and busily building back Germany as the anchor of Europe's own defenses. A similar reversal has taken place in Asia, where we backed China and fought Japan in World War II, but have been close allies with Japan and antagonists of China for the last seven decades. Palmerston also said that \"the law of nature is stronger than even the law of nations,\" adding that \"the law of self-preservation\" is the only law a nation needs appeal to for justification. That dictum could apply as well to leading political parties and the individuals in them. None has permanent friends, only permanent interests. And for political parties by their nature, that permanent interest is in getting and holding power. Republicans may see nothing wrong in collaborating with Putin, whatever his acts and whatever his aims, so long as it serves their own sense of grievances and policy preferences. And those who do still fear Putin's intentions are at least equally wary of the power of this president. They have seen how quickly he can hide his face and blot out the sun for an aspiring candidate or a familiar figure struggling to survive. To cross him, as has often been observed, is to invite defeat in the next party primary or isolation in the next party caucus meeting. If maintaining the current Republican hold on the White House and Congress means justifying and defending President Trump's attitude towards Putin, then for many that is the party's mission.",

Marsha Blackburn won their party's nominations for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee. People went to the polls on Thursday to vote in both local and statewide elections, and in the gubernatorial race former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, a Democrat, and businessman Bill Lee, a Republican, captured their party's nominations. The elections hinge in part on support for President Trump. In the race for Senate, candidates were running to replace Republican Senator Bob Corker, who will retire at the end of his term; the election has become competitive for Democrats, despite Trump winning almost every county in the state in 2016. NPR's Jessica Taylor reported, \"In Tennessee, Phil Bredesen is trying to prove that national partisan divides can be overcome in the most surprising Senate battleground of 2018.\" In one of his campaign ads Bredesen said, \"Look, I'm not running against Donald Trump. I'm running for a Senate seat to represent the people of Tennessee. I learned a long time ago to separate the message from the messenger. \"There's a lot of things I don't personally like about Donald Trump, but he's the president of the United States and if he has an idea, and is pushing some things that I think are good for the people of Tennessee, I'm going to be for it. It doesn't matter where it came from. \"Likewise,\" Bredesen adds, \"if I think it's not going to be good for Tennessee, I'm going to be against it. I think that's what senators ought to do.\" During the race Republican candidate Blackburn said she strongly supports Trump's agenda. Trump endorsed Blackburn, and campaigned alongside her. .@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her! 66-year-old Blackburn has served in Congress since 2003, and is the first woman in the state to win a congressional seat without following a husband in the post. If elected, Blackburn would be the first woman from Tennessee to serve in the U.S. Senate.  NPR's Jessica Taylor reported on Blackburn, \"She has long been a loyal conservative foot soldier and ticks off in her video the ways she would stand with President Trump \u2014 repealing the Affordable Care Act, backing the president's immigration ban and his border wall and his feud with the NFL over kneeling during the national anthem.\" Blackburn released a statement after winning the nomination Thursday: \"Chuck and I are so grateful for the support shown to our campaign by so many volunteers from across the state. Today is a milestone and the beginning of the general election, and I am so grateful that you are entrusting me with the Republican nomination for United States Senate. We ask for your continued support as we work to earn every single vote and win in November,\" the statement read.\" In the election for governor, a candidate will replace Republican Governor Bill Haslam who was blocked from running for a third term due to term limits. According to The Tennessean, candidates have spent a record $51 million in the gubernatorial race. Six candidates competed for the Republican nomination, and three candidates ran against each other on the Democratic side. Lee won the GOP nomination over Representative Diane Black, who was backed by Vice President Mike Pence, and poured millions of dollars from her own personal fortune into the campaign, according to The Washington Post. .@DianeBlackTN is running for Governor of TN & a strong supporter of #MAGA agenda of tax cuts, military $$ & a champion of right to life policies. There are great candidates running but Diane has been my friend for years, we served together in the House, & she has my support! Black sought Trump's endorsement, but did not receive it. Axios reports, \"President Trump's endorsement is worth its weight in gold for Republican candidates in 2018...Four of the six who have won had Trump's blessing via endorsement \u2014 Lou Barletta in Pennsylvania, Jim Renacci in Ohio, Kevin Cramer in North Dakota and Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.\"",

And to tell the full story of what's happening on the U.S.-Mexico border, it helps to look at both sides. So during a reporting trip to South Texas this week, our co-host Ari Shapiro visited the Mexico border town of Matamoros, where people stream into the U.S. every day legally and illegally. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: It's 7 a.m. at the Casa Del Migrante, the House of the Migrants. Men wash laundry in the sink. Women cook breakfast - scrambled eggs with salsa, black beans, bread and coffee. This shelter is a respite from a violent city. The green courtyard is full of banana trees and flowering plants. Every bed here was full last night, almost 50 migrants. Most of them are heading south because they were recently deported. A few are going north hoping to enter the U.S. After breakfast, everyone gathers in the courtyard. JUAN ANTONIO SIERRA VARGAS: (Through interpreter) Welcome to the House of Migrants. I hope you had a good night. SHAPIRO: Juan Antonio Sierra Vargas is an engineer by training. And he's one of the volunteers who helps operate this shelter. He's dressed smartly with a crisp collared shirt and slacks. VARGAS: (Through interpreter) We come here to serve you with a lot of care and love. (APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: Vargas explains where people can pick up buses. He gives tips on getting the best price. When he finishes speaking, we sit down, and I ask him what increased immigration enforcement looks like from this side of the border. VARGAS: (Through interpreter) The enforcement effort works in the sense that people don't cross alone like they used to. Now they have to use organized crime to help them at least get to the border. And the cost for helping them get into the United States has just exploded. It used to cost a thousand dollars to take someone to Houston. Now it costs $10,000. SHAPIRO: There are people in the United States who will say you are helping people break the law. VARGAS: (Through interpreter) No, it's not breaking the law. It's asking for asylum. SHAPIRO: You're an engineer, and engineers like to solve problems. This is a problem that will never be solved. VARGAS: (Through interpreter) But over the course of a day we do resolve it. Here we've learned to guide people so whoever is crossing the border gets oriented. And more than a thousand people who've passed through here have entered the United States. SHAPIRO: When President Trump won the election, Vargas saw a flood of people come through this shelter trying to enter the U.S. before Inauguration Day. Vargas says the numbers fell on January 20 last year, and they've stayed low ever since. The people who are going north rely more heavily on the cartels, so they tend to be in stash houses these days instead of shelters like this one. But there are a few northbound people here. JULIO SANCHEZ PACAYO: Julio Sanchez. I'm 43. SHAPIRO: Julio Sanchez Pacayo is a small, wiry man from El Salvador with black eyes and black hair. He spent 12 years in the U.S. and has three kids there. He says four years ago, he got deported when police in Houston caught him driving without a license. Now he hopes to cross back into the U.S. again. And with President Trump in office, he plans to keep his head down if he makes it. SANCHEZ: (Through interpreter) I would only go from work to my house, from work to my house. You have to be a lot stricter now. Things are more repressive than they were under Obama. It was more free before. SHAPIRO: Different groups arrive at the shelter to help out over the course of the day. Barbers in training give free haircuts. Four people show up in matching white vests. They're from Doctors Without Borders. Psychologist Anneli Droste has worked with survivors of war, and she sees many of the same symptoms among these migrants. ANNELI DROSTE: You see a lot of them are very tense. We have people who show that they are trembling also. They have sleeping problems, concentration problems. SHAPIRO: If you have only one consultation with them, give me an example of something you can tell them or show them that might help. DROSTE: For example, relaxation exercises. There are different ones. There are breathing exercises to calm them down, to just - to help them in this stressful situation to relax a bit. SHAPIRO: By midday, many people have left the shelter. Most are catching buses farther into Mexico. The rest are headed north. The U.S. border is 4 miles from here. We drive to one of the bridges connecting Matamoros with Brownsville, Texas, and take our place in the slow crawl of vehicles. Even though it's a hundred degrees out, it's faster to walk. Cars were lined up for at least an hour to cross the bridge back into the U.S. And all along the line people are selling crickets, ice cream, whatever you're - whatever you could want to buy. We spot about a dozen people in their 20s and 30s sitting under a tarp. None of them will give us their names or do a one-on-one interview, but my producer Christina Cala asks them a few basic questions. Why is everybody waiting to present? CHRISTINA CALA, BYLINE: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). CALA: There's no capacity for them to pass. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). CALA: (Speaking Spanish). They've been right here for four days. SHAPIRO: Four days. CALA: Or longer. SHAPIRO: They're waiting to claim asylum. But when they try to present themselves, they get turned back by officials who say they can't process the claim right now. We asked several agencies involved with different parts of this process and couldn't get a clear answer on why there's a backlog. As we approach the midpoint of the bridge over the Rio Grande, we meet Alfonso Garcia. He arrived here on his 30th birthday a few days ago. And now he's sitting in the shade of a big umbrella writing names in a notebook. This is an ad hoc waiting list of people who want to claim asylum. Even though it's unofficial, people seem to take it seriously. ALFONSO GARCIA: (Through interpreter) The American police don't care, so it's better for me to keep this organized. That way there's some order. SHAPIRO: How many people right now are on your list? GARCIA: Twenty-three maybe. SHAPIRO: He says his wife is already in the U.S., and he's hoping to join her. A family of four arrives, and they put their names in the notebook. The father is William Moreno from Cuba. WILLIAM MORENO: (Through interpreter) There's nothing as important as freedom. And if there's one country that understands the importance of liberty, it's the United States. SHAPIRO: Did they tell you how long you might have to wait? MORENO: (Through interpreter) Two, three, four days. But it's very hot, and I have a small daughter. I don't know if she can wait that long. SHAPIRO: And if you are given an opportunity to claim asylum, most people are rejected. What will you do then? MORENO: (Through interpreter) I can't even think about the possibility that it won't happen. I have to believe that it will happen. After this long journey, I can't imagine that things would go wrong in the last inning. SHAPIRO: They turn back towards Mexico, and we walk in the other direction. There's a sign that says boundary of the United States of America. Hello. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hello. SHAPIRO: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Thank you. SHAPIRO: The border guard just glanced at our U.S. passport and waved us on through. That was it. And now we're in the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF MARC MOULIN'S \"HUMPTY DUMPTY\") SHAPIRO: Tomorrow we'll look at the business of immigration enforcement and who's making money off detaining immigrants. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: But the prisons, when they came into town, it really was a boost as far as the economy. It helped quite a bit.

            "article_content": "Pakistan heads to general elections on Wednesday. But voters are polarized and extremist groups are openly campaigning, despite pressure on Pakistan to crack down on militant organizations.  KORVA COLEMAN, HOST: Pakistan holds general elections on Wednesday. It's only the second time ever there's been a peaceful handover of power in the country's 70-year history. NPR's Diaa Hadid has been covering the campaign, and she joins us now from Islamabad. Good morning, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Good morning. COLEMAN: Diaa, what's the mood like ahead of elections? HADID: It's quite polarized right now in Pakistan. There's two main parties that are contesting these elections. And one is led by a man called Imran Khan. He's a legendary sportsman here. And he's rallying his followers to throw out the old corrupt elites. And there's a sense of exuberance among his followers, like they're riding a wave to victory. But among the rival party, the mood's pretty glum. They're the former ruling party, but in the past few months, there's been a slew of corruption cases against their party leader, the former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. There's been arrests of party workers, and there's been a crackdown on media that's perceived as being sympathetic to the Sharifs. And for all this, the party followers blame the military. It's Pakistan's most powerful institution, and it's had a tenacious relationship with Sharif and his party. COLEMAN: So one party is riding really high, and another seems like it's in the doldrums. Are these the only two parties that are running in this election, Diaa? HADID: If only. There's so many parties here, including a few extremist groups. And, in fact, one of the groups running in these elections is a front for a militant organization called Lashkar-e-Taiba. And its leader, Hafiz Saeed, is accused of masterminding attacks that happened about a decade ago in India that killed more than 160 people. His group is considered a terrorist organization by much of the West. The U.S. has put a $10 million bounty for his arrest. But his followers are openly campaigning in these elections. COLEMAN: But if they're a front for a militant group, why are they being allowed to run? HADID: Well, it's a valid question. I mean, certainly, the West and the Trump administration has accused Pakistan of harboring militants. And Pakistan was even censured in June by an international financial watchdog for not cracking down hard enough on terrorist financing. But analysts here say this is the work of the Pakistani military, which is trying to, quote, unquote, \"mainstream\" extremist groups. And the thinking is, if you throw radical groups into politics, they'll have to deradicalize because they'll have to appeal to a wider audience. COLEMAN: So are they becoming more mainstream? HADID: Some of them are trying to appeal to a wider audience. And I went to a village close to the border with India. It's about an hour away from the nearest town on bumpy roads flanked by green fields. And there were buffalos everywhere. And there I met a man called Mohammed Irfan. And he's political organizer for this front group of this militant organization. And when I got there, he was speaking to men in the sun who were just waiting to hear what he had to say. And what he had to say was interesting. MOHAMMED IRFAN: (Foreign language spoken). HADID: He was telling them that women in this area weren't getting maternity care, that women were dying during pregnancy. And he promised these men that they had a plan for women's health care. And the crowd just started clapping. He promised to end child labor. He promised to give interest-free loans to farmers. And we spoke to some of the men who had gathered there after the rally, and they said, yeah, they'd vote for this party because it was the only one that had ever taken the time to notice them and care about their issues. That doesn't mean they're not radical. It just means that's not how you can pitch to followers for an election. COLEMAN: Does the U.S. have skin in the game in this election? This country wants the Pakistani government to crack down on the Taliban there. Will any of these candidates do that? HADID: Well, among the two main parties, the party of Imran Khan has made deals in the past with the Taliban that exists in Pakistan, so it's hard to see how he's going to fight against them, but it may well change once he reaches power. The bigger question is, what do you do about the extremist groups that are now in the national Parliament or that will be in the national Parliament? COLEMAN: NPR's Diaa Hadid, thank you very much. HADID: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Pakistan heads to the polls next week. But critics allege the election campaign has been marred by interference to ensure one party's victory.  NOEL KING, HOST: It is a question asked so often around the world - is an election truly fair? That question will be asked yet again when people in Pakistan vote next week. NPR's Diaa Hadid explains why. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: There's a dusty field in the town of Narowal, near the border with India, where a political party's holding an election rally. The party's green and red flags snap in the wind. Men stand on chairs, straining to see the person they want for prime minister, Imran Khan. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) IMRAN KHAN: (Foreign language spoken). HADID: He was once a charismatic sports star. Now he wants to lead Pakistan. He urges his followers, throw out the old corrupt politicians, criminals. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) KHAN: (Foreign language spoken). HADID: It resonates with Khaled Majid, a retired government official. KHALED MAJID: Imran Khan - the only personality in this country now. He can shape the country. (SOUNDBITE OF SIRENS) HADID: As the rally ends, police escort Khan's convoy. But critics allege that Khan is getting more than just police protection. Many accuse him of being helped along by Pakistan's most powerful institution. RAZA RUMI: The department of agriculture, the aliens, angels. HADID: That's Raza Rumi. He's the editor in chief of a Pakistani newspaper, the Daily Times. He's listing slang words for the army. And he says... RUMI: To be honest, everybody knows that the PTI has been receiving a lot of support from the military establishment. HADID: PTI is the party that Khan leads. Critics make that claim because in the runup to elections, there's been a series of crackdowns targeting Khan's rivals. They say the chief target is former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his party. Sharif amassed a following by fixing roads and providing services but has being enmeshed in corruption scandals. Last year, the courts ousted him as prime minister and banned him from public office. Just weeks before the election, Sharif and his daughter were sentenced to lengthy jail terms. RUMI: That whole process appeared to be selective because only one family was being targeted, and that was the Nawaz Sharif family. HADID: They were in London when they were sentenced, and in a political gamble, Sharif and his daughter flew back to be arrested. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in foreign language). HADID: Thousands of their followers demonstrated in support of Sharif. Authorities cut phone lines to prevent them from coordinating. Police threw up roadblocks, beat people up. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in foreign language). HADID: The military denies interfering with the elections. As for Imran Khan, I asked him at a press conference if he thought the military was helping his campaign. He said, it's corruption that brought down his rival - simple. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) KHAN: How would a Western government react? Would they not put someone like that behind bars? HADID: Away from the political drama, residents said they'd vote on bread-and-butter issues. Roshan Abbas is a rickshaw driver. He supports Sharif's party. ROSHAN ABBAS: (Through interpreter) They have improved streetlights, sanitation and roads. HADID: But down the road, Mohammed Ishtiyaq, a wedding singer, says Sharif's people ignored his impoverished neighborhood. MOHAMMED ISHTIYAQ: (Through interpreter) The roads are broken. Sewage system is in shambles. HADID: The polls point to a close race, but some analysts worry that if Khan wins, many Pakistanis will see his victory as tainted. RUMI: There will be complaints of the legitimacy of electoral process. HADID: Rumi says this is something that Americans can relate to - a government whose legitimacy is questioned because of allegations of interference. But Pakistan is a fragile democracy. This is only the second-ever peaceful handover of power, so these elections, meant to be a victory for Pakistan's democratic process, might just undermine it. Diaa Hadid, NPR News, Narowal.

            "article_content": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won Mexico's presidential election and celebrated Sunday night with his supporters in Mexico City's Z\u00f3calo Square.\n                \n                    \n                    Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won Mexico's presidential election and celebrated Sunday night with his supporters in Mexico City's Z\u00f3calo Square. President Trump says he called Mexican President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador Monday and spoke for 30 minutes about trade, border security and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Although Trump has railed against Mexico since his campaign, the U.S. president said he came away upbeat after the talk with his incoming counterpart. \"I think the relationship will be a very good one,\" Trump said, during a meeting with the prime minister of the Netherlands. Recib\u00ed llamada de Donald Trump y conversamos durante media hora. Le propuse explorar un acuerdo integral; de proyectos de desarrollo que generen empleos en M\u00e9xico, y con ello, reducir la migraci\u00f3n y mejorar la seguridad. Hubo trato respetuoso y dialogar\u00e1n nuestros representantes. L\u00f3pez Obrador later said on Twitter their half-hour call was \"respectful,\" and that he raised the idea of development projects to create jobs in Mexico, help reduce migration and improve safety. The Mexican politician is known to criticize the U.S. president, including in a book he published last year called \"Oye, Trump\" (\"Listen Up, Trump\"). L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftist populist, celebrated an overwhelming victory in Sunday's vote, pledging to stamp out Mexico's corrosive corruption and rampant violence, while helping the poor and working class. That puts L\u00f3pez Obrador in the history books. His win \u2014 about 53 percent of the vote and as much as 30 points over his closest rival, according to official preliminary estimates \u2014 looks set to be the biggest percentage of any president since the 1990s. Not only did his 4-year-old Morena party take the presidency, but the party and its allies also look like they will capture a majority in the lower house, another first in modern Mexican politics. The party also grabbed as many as five governorships and a large number of mayoral posts. Since Mexico began its democratic opening in the late 1990s, no Mexican president has gained such a broad electoral mandate. Analysts say most voters were expressing their anger at the leading establishment parties that have taken turns governing for decades without solving the country's problems. \"Let's elect the principal opposition leader and, you know, let's give him enough power to gather enough political capital to push through a new agenda,\" says Carlos Bravo Regidor, who heads the journalism department at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, known by the Spanish initials CIDE. At a polling place Sunday in Ecatepec, a poor suburb outside Mexico City, voter Mario Ruiz Bacera, echoed that sentiment. He said he not only voted for but also for every other candidate running on the Morena ticket. \"You have to give him the whole car or they'll just put the brakes on his agenda,\" Ruiz said. His critics long have warned he is a leftist firebrand who will spell big trouble for Latin America's second-largest economy, with Venezuela-style socialist policies. In his speeches, the leader \u2014 commonly known by his acronym nickname \"AMLO\" \u2014 has consistently assailed elites he considers the \"mafia of power.\" He pledges to audit foreign energy contracts reached under outgoing President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and to review any future ones. But L\u00f3pez Obrador, who will assume office in December, has tempered his message on some issues in his third presidential run. He says he will not nationalize companies. And while he used to vow to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, now he says he will try to keep it. \"The new government will maintain fiscal and monetary discipline,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador told supporters packed into a downtown hotel ballroom. Minutes later, the president-elect added that he will double pensions for the elderly, give education scholarships to the young and aid the disabled. And he repeated what he called his basic political tenet: \"We will provide for the good of everyone, but the poor come first.\" The incoming president has a lot of different sectors of society to satisfy. To get elected this time, after failed presidential runs in 2006 and 2012, L\u00f3pez Obrador reached out to a disparate group of political interests \u2014 from veteran leftists and labor unionists to staunchly conservative evangelical Christians. He is aware of the fact that NAFTA hasn't been all roses and rainbows for Mexico. Carlos Bravo Regidor He will also have to balance Mexico's precarious relations with the United States and its president. That will be a difficult task, says Bravo Regidor of CIDE. He says that the president-elect at heart is an economic nationalist. \"That doesn't mean that he is against NAFTA or anti-globalization or anti-American. It just means that he is aware of the fact that NAFTA hasn't been all roses and rainbows for Mexico,\" says Bravo Regidor. L\u00f3pez Obrador insists he will be a tough negotiator with Trump and will get the respect from the U.S. president that his predecessor couldn't. Eric Olson, deputy director of the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., says Mexico's next president is in a tricky spot when it comes to balancing relations with the U.S. and appeasing critics at home. \"He has to walk the fine line between those who want a more assertive approach to Donald Trump and the pragmatic need to continue cooperation,\" Olson says. What's more, if Mexico's incoming president is to fulfill his primary campaign pledge to crack down on corruption, Olson adds, he'll need U.S. intelligence and cooperation to make that a reality.",

NOEL KING, HOST: Mexicans have elected a populist leftist as their new president. His anti-corruption, anti-establishment message struck a chord with an electorate that is angry over skyrocketing violence. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador beat out his top two rivals. Early counts show he won more than half of the vote. He promises to clean up Mexico's corruption, help the poor and the elderly and have a cooperative, respectful relationship with the United States. NPR's Carrie Kahn is with us now from Mexico City, where celebrations continued into the early hours of this morning. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi, good morning. KING: So this was Lopez Obrador's third time running for president. He was not successful in the past. And now he's got an overwhelming win. What changed? KAHN: I think two things changed. Mexico is very different - and so was candidate Lopez Obrador. First, Mexico is so much more violent than it was during his previous two runs for president. There were nearly 30,000 murders here last year. And this year looks even more violent. He was very different as a candidate this time around. He toned down some of his rhetoric. He was less confrontational. And he built this odd wider coalition. He had everything in there from leftists to the Worker's Party to this conservative evangelical party. And then more than that, he honed in on his message. His main message is just corruption is the number one problem in Mexico - causing everything from poverty, poor economic output, inequality - all of it. And it was a strong message, and it was very well received this time. KING: Well, you've been traveling the country talking to voters. Tell me. What did people say after his win last night? KAHN: Voters all day were just saying that they went to the polls for a change. I heard that over and over again. Everybody said that. You know, Lopez Obrador's win, I think, was a repudiation of this current administration. Just - if you would listen to these chants of the jubilant crowds that gathered all over downtown Mexico City last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Spanish). KAHN: They were shouting \"Mexico without the PRI.\" The ruling party here is so unpopular right now. It's been embroiled in countless corruption scandals, at the federal, the state level, local level, for the past six years. And I think more than voters wanting to bring in a leftist government, this was more about an anti-establishment vote - an electorate very angry over the corruption, violence and the impunity that's rampant in this country these days. KING: Lopez Obrador came out, and he gave a couple of different victory speeches last night, right? What did he say in those? KAHN: Well, he went back through his long list of promises. He says he's going to work hard. He's going to be honest. He repeated several times that he wants to go down in history as one of Mexico's greatest presidents. He spoke to this massive crowd in Mexico City's historic Zocalo Plaza. And he said he promised he would not let them down. He said that a couple times. I will not let you down, and I will live by these three basic tenants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT-ELECT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish). (APPLAUSE) KAHN: So he said \"no lying, no stealing and no betraying the people.\" \"Long live Mexico,\" he shouted to thunderous applause. KING: It sounds like something people really wanted to hear. KAHN: They did. KING: One big thing that remains to be seen is the relationship that Mexico will have under Lopez Obrador with the United States. What has he said about President Trump - about working with him or not? KAHN: Well, it really didn't come up that much during the campaign. Trump was not an issue during the campaign mainly because all of the three major candidates pretty much said the same thing. They all said they're going to demand respect from Trump. And yet, they're going to continue to cooperate with the United States. And that's what Lopez Obrador said last night. He said he wants a cooperative, respectful relationship with the U.S. You know, President Trump and the current president, Enrique Pena Nieto, have had a tense relationship - mostly over Trump's insistence that Mexico pay for a U.S. border wall. But President Trump did tweet his congratulations last night to the Mexican president-elect. KING: Carrie, let me get your 3,000-foot perspective on something. Given the depth of corruption in Mexico, do you think that this new president can actually make good on his promises to stamp it out? KAHN: Oh, it's a tall order. You know, I asked that of voters that were voting for him - the exact same question. Can he do all that? You know, I really feel like expectations are high but not really that high. People are - people know how terrible the situation is right now. And they're saying - one person even said, you know, if we could just get a little bit done, that would be better than nothing. So I think that expectations are sort of realistic - how difficult the problem is and how entrenched corruption and violence is in Mexican society right now. KING: NPR's Carrie Kahn in Mexico City. Carrie, thanks so much. KAHN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

It was a strong message, and it was very well-received this time. INSKEEP: And what are you hearing from voters? KAHN: Well, I talked to them in - all over the - I went to three states today - yesterday - I'm sorry. And they were just telling me - everybody said they wanted change. That's what they were really going for. Lopez Obrador's win, you know, was really a repudiation of the current administration. Just listen to these chants of the jubilant crowds that gathered all over Mexico City last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Spanish). KAHN: They're shouting Mexico without the PRI. The ruling party here is so unpopular. It has been embroiled in countless corruption scandals at the federal, the state level, for the past six years. And I think more than voters wanted to bring in a leftist government, this was more about an anti-establishment vote, an electorate very angry over the corruption, violence and impunity that's rampant in this country. INSKEEP: Yeah. When we look at the votes, as they've been counted as you and I are talking, the ruling party, the PRI, is not even in second place. They're in a very, very distant third place. KAHN: Right. INSKEEP: Now, I want to ask about one other thing, Carrie Kahn, because we mentioned that the winner here says he wants to work with President Trump. What does he mean by that? KAHN: Well, he said he wants a cooperative, respectful relationship with the U.S. That's what he said tonight. You know, President Trump and the current president, Enrique Pena Nieto, have had this tense relationship, mostly over Trump's insistence that Mexico pay for a U.S. border wall. But President Trump did tweet his congratulations last night to the new Mexican president-elect. INSKEEP: And has he been talking about this specifically, talking about Trump specifically? KAHN: In this election? In this campaign? No, he has not. He has a long, very long list of promises that he's been making. He says he wants to work hard. He's going to be honest, and he repeated several times that he wants to go down in history as one of Mexico's greatest presidents. He had this great line in his speech at the historic Zocalo plaza last night. He said he's going to live by - he's going to rule by three basic tenants - no lying, no stealing and no betraying the people. INSKEEP: OK Carrie, thanks very much. KAHN: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Carrie Kahn. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. In this country, President Trump says he will focus this week on selecting a Supreme Court nominee to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. KING: But the president is also facing the aftermath of some of his past decisions on other issues. This weekend, there were nationwide protests over the administration's immigration policies. It has been slow going reuniting more than 2,000 kids separated from their parents at the border. And America's longtime allies are hitting us back on trade and tariffs. INSKEEP: With us now is NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley, who's covering all this and more. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK. So the president told reporters the other day he's not going to ask his potential nominees about their position on Roe versus Wade, the historic ruling on abortion rights, but does he really need to ask? HORSLEY: No. You know, President Trump made it crystal clear during the 2016 campaign that if the opportunity presented itself, he'd plan to nominate Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn Roe. That was a big selling point for the president with social conservatives who otherwise might have been skeptical of this thrice-married billionaire from New York City. He famously published that list of potential nominees. There are now 25 names on that list, all of them vetted by conservative activists at The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation. Trump has said he will pick someone from that list. He expects to talk to six or seven candidates this week before a big showbiz-style reveal next Monday. And he repeated on an - in an interview with Fox Business Network that he would not be quizzing those candidates specifically on the question of Roe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think I'm going to be so specific in the questions I'll be answering (ph). And I'm actually told that I shouldn't be. HORSLEY: And he doesn't need to be. You know, the people who put together this list had a pretty good idea of what the president was looking for. INSKEEP: But then there's the question of whether he can get this person through the Senate because it's 51-49. Republicans just have one vote to spare. And there you have one Republican, Susan Collins, saying that she has some concerns. Let's listen to her from the weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUSAN COLLINS: I would not support a nominee who demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade. INSKEEP: OK. So they can lose one, but there is another Republican who supports abortion rights. Can they get a nominee through? HORSLEY: You know, I think right now it's the supporters of abortion rights who are more nervous about that. You heard Collins say she couldn't support a nominee with a demonstrated hostility to Roe. But the president can avoid that landmine by simply picking a nominee who's kept his or her hostility to Roe v. Wade under wraps. You already hear a lot of soft pedaling by conservative activists who suggest Roe is not in the crosshairs, even though they've spent years targeting the decision. But the president is on record saying what he wants, no matter what sort of bland packaging it might be wrapped up in. INSKEEP: The president, of course, is also on record with tariffs against Canada, and the Canadians have responded. HORSLEY: Yeah. You know, the president spoke on Friday night with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But in the terse, one-word readout we got from the White House, there's no sign they have reached any sort of accord. In fact, Trudeau is getting a little bit of a political boost at home for standing up to what Canadians see as Trump's bullying. The president has said that other countries have been approaching him about trying to negotiate a trade deal. But if that is true, and there's no evidence it is, those other countries aren't talking about it. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks. HORSLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. In Iraq, security forces have stepped up attacks on ISIS across the border into Syria. KING: That's right. They're aiming at fighters who were driven out of Iraq but who could come back in, and they are being helped by U.S. troops. INSKEEP: NPR's Jane Arraf went in with the U.S. military for a look at the U.S. base or a U.S. base near the border. Hey there, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi there. INSKEEP: So what are U.S. troops doing at this point along that Iraq-Syria border? ARRAF: So there's still ISIS along the border. They were driven out of Iraq, and the U.S. and Iraq fear that they could come back in. So mostly these U.S. troops are advising the Iraqis, and in some cases, they're assisting with the operations. The base we went to is an example. It's called a fire support base because U.S. soldiers, protected by Marines, are launching artillery. The big guns with a 10-mile range hit ISIS targets across the border, and that's where we spoke with Sergeant Jason Powell. He's from Louisville, Ky., now based in Fort Hood, Texas. He's 31. He's been out there almost a month. And he was standing near a rack of artillery shells, showing me how he's given a target, and then he directs his crew to load these huge rounds and fire them into Syria. JASON POWELL: It all starts with the forward observer. They're going to observe something that needs to be - maybe we're calling for fire to destroy the enemy or just terrain denial, a number of different reasons. ARRAF: So terrain denial means preventing ISIS from holding ground or coming back across that border. INSKEEP: So what is life like on this American base that you were able to visit? ARRAF: Well, it's not like the old bases, which were kind of like little cities. This is really austere. It's about a mile from the Syrian border in the desert; desert as far as you can see. There were no buildings, just tents. And it's about 100 degrees. There's no air conditioning. There's lots of sand, and there's scorpions and huge biting spiders. So on their time off, the guys say they play cards with the Iraqi soldiers on the base, and they play baseball. They don't have any bats, so they use the handles of pickaxes. INSKEEP: Do what they can and then go back to lobbing artillery shells at a distant enemy. I want to ask, Jane, because, of course, you cover Iraq all the time, these folks are on the Iraq-Syria border. This is far, far western Iraq. How is security like in the rest of the country, this country where ISIS used to have much more control? ARRAF: Probably you could sum it up by saying it's relatively secure but fragile. And a lot of that danger is in territory in between the seams, if you will, between, for instance, Kurdish security forces and Iraqi government forces, like in the disputed city of Kirkuk. There's a highway near there, and ISIS has been kidnapping and killing security forces, setting off suicide car bombs. So while ISIS has been defeated militarily, there's still quite a lot of concern that they're not entirely gone. INSKEEP: Appreciate that phrase in between the seams since you were just on a seam there in a sense between Iraq and Syria, a place where ISIS can still survive. ARRAF: Absolutely. INSKEEP: Jane, thanks very much. ARRAF: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Jane Arraf. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCAL NATIVES SONG, \"YOU AND I\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President-elect Trump's acceptance speech was broadcast in Times Square in New York City after his 2016 election. Nearly two years later, the partisan divide grows even wider.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President-elect Trump's acceptance speech was broadcast in Times Square in New York City after his 2016 election. Nearly two years later, the partisan divide grows even wider. Justice Anthony Kennedy, known as the man at the center of the U.S. Supreme Court, could not have chosen a more appropriate moment to retire. Kennedy had stood at the center of the court, with four colleagues predictably to his left and four predictably to his right. Sometimes he sided with one foursome; sometimes, with the other. His vote was the deciding one so often that other members of the court had joked, with minimal mirth, that they might as well stay home. But today, it is increasingly difficult to find, or even imagine, a true center on the high court \u2014 or in our national politics generally. Witness the fact that Kennedy himself came down consistently on the conservative side in the major cases announced in this Supreme Court term. Writing a cautionary note to President Trump while voting to uphold his travel ban does not a \"swing justice\" make. Kennedy's rightward tilt included several issues the justice had been anticipating when he decided not to retire last year. He was turning 80 at the time, celebrating his 30th year on the court. Many thought he was tarrying so he could settle some big ones, such as extreme partisan gerrymandering, or to defend his same-sex-marriage landmark ruling from 2015. As it turned out, Kennedy's ultimate year on the bench served mostly to arm those critics who said his reputation as a swing vote had always been exaggerated \u2014 based primarily in his support for gay rights and at least some degree of abortion rights. Yet how fitting for him pick up his \"decider\" credentials and hit the exit in a week when evidence of our national polarization is all around us. Incidents of Trump staff and Cabinet officers being hounded or refused service in restaurants have become a flashpoint between partisans, especially in the electronic and social media. But in fact, the decline in civility in our national political life has been evident for months, if not years. And it is not just a war of words. Both parties are making decisions in this atmosphere that will shape national policy and politics for years. A plea for support On Wednesday, House lawmakers defeated what had been called a \"compromise bill\" on immigration. It did not represent a compromise between the parties but between the rival factions of the House Republican majority. It tried to address the contentious issues of family separation, legal status for DREAMers (brought to the U.S. illegally as minors) and the president's border wall all at once. The bill had the strong backing of Speaker Paul Ryan and other House leaders. It was endorsed by President Trump, who put out an eleventh-hour plea for support. But fewer than half the Republicans in the House voted for it \u2014 an even more ignominious defeat than was dealt to a yet more conservative bill a week ago. Ryan is leaving the House this year, but the collapse of his efforts on immigration confirmed his lame-duck status. On the same day, a key panel within the Democratic National Committee voted to restrict the power of superdelegates \u2014 voting delegates at the presidential nominating convention who hold that privilege as elected officials or party officers. It's been a pillar of establishment power in the system since the 1970s and was bitterly resented by supporters of frustrated candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016. Both the House and DNC were voting as the news media were parsing and picking over the primary votes tallied the night before in eight states. From New York to South Carolina to Colorado, the big winners among Democrats were generally champions of the party's progressive left and its most loyal identity groups \u2014 including African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. The breakout star was clearly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Sanders insurgent whose platform and persona inspired turnout in a Queens-Bronx district long dominated by the local Democratic machine. She defeated the county chairman, Joe Crowley, who had been in Congress for 20 years and who had stood a good chance of being the next Democratic leader in the House.

The 28-year-old political newcomer upset U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley in New York's Democrat primary on Monday. But there was also room in the liberal spotlight for former NAACP head Ben Jealous, nominated for governor in Maryland, and Jared Polis, a four-term Colorado congressman who could become the nation's first openly gay governor. On the Republican side, the primary winners were nearly always those who had been loudest in their praise for the president or who had arm-wrestled rivals for Trump's support. Exhibit A was South Carolina's Henry McMaster, who as lieutenant governor in 2015 had been the first statewide-elected official anywhere to endorse Trump. Last year, he succeeded Nikki Haley as governor when Trump appointed her ambassador to the United Nations. Monday night, Trump was in South Carolina, embracing McMaster at a rally on the eve of a vote that saw McMaster hold off a strong primary challenger, 53 percent to 47 percent. Trump rallied with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster on Monday. McMaster, one of Trump's earliest and most loyal supporters, won a key runoff Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Shiro/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump rallied with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster on Monday. McMaster, one of Trump's earliest and most loyal supporters, won a key runoff Tuesday. One exception to the Trump rule was Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a sometime Trump antagonist who did not have a primary opponent. More typically, those who had not been fans of the president found ways to make peace with him or at least back off. That included Mitt Romney, who won the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate in Utah. Romney had been a major leader of the NeverTrump movement in 2016 and has since criticized him sharply at times. But even he took pains in the campaign's last weekend to mend fences. His op-ed in a statewide newspaper dampened the notion he would lead intraparty opposition to Trump once in Washington. Whither the middle? Far from subsiding, the political animosities stirred by the tumultuous presidential cycle of 2015-16 have grown more disruptive. Whether you call the agents of change activists or populists, they are remaking both our major parties and altering our public life as a nation. At times at least, such voters tell pollsters they want compromise. But the candidates they actually vote for are promising something else. No surprise, then, that as activists displace the traditional or establishment elements of each party, the two parties are moving further apart. The middle \u2014 the political center where most Americans have tended to feel comfortable \u2014 is fast being abandoned. That matters because the center is where past generations of leaders have been able to find consensus and effectuate change that lasts.",

Pence is playing a big role in Republicans' midterm election campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Pence speaks during a campaign event for Pennsylvania congressional candidate Rick Saccone in February. Pence is playing a big role in Republicans' midterm election campaign. In the shadow of President Trump's raucous campaign rallies this midterm election season are dozens of quieter campaign events and fundraisers headlined by Vice President Pence. He's working to get Republicans elected this year, while quietly earning political capital that could help his own future. At a weekend rally for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ahead of Tuesday's GOP primary runoff, Pence touted Trump's achievements in the same breath that he stumped for Republican candidates. \"You look at the last year-and-a-half of this administration and I gotta tell you, there's only one way you can describe it,\" Pence said, going on to sum up the administration's record: \"Promises made and promises kept.\" In front of the crowd gathered on a college campus near Myrtle Beach, Pence talked about tax cuts and job growth, issues Republican leaders want to focus on this year. But amid a heated debate over the separation of families crossing the U.S. border illegally, Pence only briefly alluded to immigration, prompting familiar chants of \"build that wall!\" Unlike the president, who has sent mixed messages on immigration policy in recent days and often veers away from Republican talking points to embrace border security as a \"good issue\" for the GOP, Pence is known for being disciplined. That means avoiding anything that might steal the spotlight from Trump. He has been traveling the country, fundraising for Republican candidates and organizations, sometimes drawing several million dollars in a single trip. He's also holding events to urge GOP voters to turn out in November and maintain their congressional majorities. \"Republicans are very energetic right now,\" said Marc Lotter, a consultant to the Republican National Committee and Pence aide. \"They see the positive momentum going on with the economy. They see the leadership that's being shown by the president on the world stage; they want to keep that.\" As the election draws closer, Lotter said, the vice president will spend more time holding campaign rallies in strategically important areas, both for members of Congress and for Republican governors, several of whom face tough races this fall. Much of Pence's midterm campaign travel is funded by his leadership PAC, the Great America Committee. Its creation has fueled speculation about Pence's own political ambitions. Lotter said the vice president is focused on promoting President Trump and electing Republicans this year, allowing that it could benefit Pence in the long run. \"Any vice president, regardless of party, their political future \u2014 whatever that may or may not be \u2014 solely lies on the success of the president they serve,\" Lotter said. \"And so in this case, the vice president is solely focused on the president and the president's agenda. And that success will determine everything for the vice president.\" Pence has plenty to gain from the reputation and relationships he's building while stumping for Republicans across the country, said GOP pollster Chris Wilson. \"I think anytime somebody who's in elected office says they're not thinking about their political future, they probably should go to penance or make a donation to the church or something,\" Wilson said. \"It's not likely that that calculation doesn't enter into the back of someone's mind. Whether it's making an endorsement, who they campaign for, or a dollar that they raise and a donor that they meet.\" Pence unfailingly praises the president's success \u2014 no matter where he's campaigning, no matter for whom he's trying to energize a crowd or donors. Marjorie Hershey, a political scientist at Indiana University, notes that Trump is known for demanding loyalty \u2014 and so are GOP voters: \"That isn't a choice for Vice President Pence to make; he either is wholly loyal to the president or he doesn't have a future within the Trump party,\" Hershey said. Whatever his long-term ambitions may be, Hershey said Pence has shown a skill for falling in line and staying on message \u2014 and not stepping too far out of Trump's shadow.",

Luna lives in Mexico City and, as a political activist, he sees himself as someone who has a voice on both sides of the border. Mexican actor Diego Luna first shot to fame in the United States after 2001's Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n. Since then, he's starred in a handful of blockbusters \u2014 including, recently, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story \u2014 and he's about to play the leader of a drug cartel in the upcoming season of Netflix's Narcos. Luna could have happily continued to live a successful life in Hollywood, but he missed Mexico. At a caf\u00e9 near his kids' school in Mexico City, he explains why. \"I have all my love stories here, I grew up here, I decided to do theater here,\" he says. \"But most importantly, I have kids, and I have to say there's something quite interesting in living this time of their lives in Mexico versus the States.\" Luna moved home a few years ago. He says there's a \"richness\" he feels in Mexico City, and as a political activist, he sees himself as someone who has a voice on both sides of the border. \"Right now, I feel that I'm useful here and that I want my kids seeing [their] dad getting involved with the place he lives in.\" On the current migrant family crisis It's quite painful to see what's happening these days, the indifference around a community that is suffering so much, you know. I can't believe that cruelty and that indifference, that lack of compassion, you know. I mean, even though there is, starting now, a reaction [to] the conditions of all these kids today ... I didn't wake up in a country that was completely indignant about this issue, you know. The government was still celebrating the triumph of Mexico in the World Cup on their Twitter. It's like, \"OK, this issue matters this much.\" On how Mexican society views migrant families We don't give a f*** about what happens to migrants going through Mexico from Central America trying to get to the States or wanting to stay in Mexico. And the way our government treats them, the stuff they have to go through, the amount of abuse is ridiculous, it's insane. And no one seems to get affected by these things. So it's fighting indifference [that], to me, is a priority ... because we are getting used to this kind of injustice. There is something I heard recently, you know: If the rights I have are not the same rights everyone has, then my rights are privilege. On what drew him to activism It's my education. I think it's all about my father. It's what I saw my father doing. I remember my father always reading the newspaper and commenting on what was there; and how important was that debate that could happen after lunch in the house; how important [it] was to engage with the issues. On Mexico's upcoming presidential election (which happens every six years) I think there is an awakening happening, a social awakening happening from these terrible six years we just lived and a [drug] war that has been happening for 12 years, since [former President Felipe] Calder\u00f3n started to fight the [drug] traffickers. Then we had an earthquake also that reminded us how weak we are, you know, how weak our institutions are. All these corruption scandals where we started to get an idea of how much they were stealing from us, you know. And all of this, I think it's creating an awakening. There is a need to say, \"Ya basta,\" you know, enough is enough. And I think the people [are] already there. The problem is we are living in a very dangerous country. It's an election that is happening in a country where [more than 100] candidates [and election workers] have been killed. ... We have normalized violence and we have accepted this is the Mexico we live in. ... We have this privileged part of society that doesn't have to interact with that violence. ... \"Well, whatever. You know, it's not our issue because it's the war on drugs and because there's a market in the States and it's never going to stop, so what can we do?\" And you go, \"No, there's a lot we should be doing,\" because this violence is [rising] ... and I don't believe we have to wait until it happens to us. You know, I still believe in stories and I still think we are, most of us are people that can feel for the others. And I think this election is that one where people are starting to vote not just for themselves but for the others. On his decision to appear on Narcos, a show some have criticized for glorifying the late Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar I think it's important to understand how did we get here. I remember when we did Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, the first time we opened the film in Mexico, we received so many messages going, like, \"But why do you show that Mexico? It's so dirty, that area. Why you didn't go here or there?\" You go, like, \"Because that area is there.\" And I do think that when you hear a story about how Mexico became such a crucial place in terms of the drug trafficking, it might be important for someone in India to understand why [there is so much] news about violence and how can you connect with this. You know, [Narcos is] not a documentary, obviously, but it's definitely an issue that I care about, that it matters to me. ... And if one of every 100 people watching it decide to go a little deeper and find out what's not being said, I think that'll be good. On the initiative he helped launch called El D\u00eda Despu\u00e9s, or \"the day after\" It's just a platform where we are talking to other citizens. This election, it's bringing a fracture to society, you know, and there's violence and the candidates are normalizing this violence. So what we're doing is we're saying, \"It doesn't matter who you vote for, the next day we're all going to wake up in the same country and this country has to include all of us.\" So we're also putting out videos that explain how this violence [rose] and how much this violence can become a problem for the next six years of our lives. ... I am worried also because we have to understand that democracy demands of you your actions to last for the whole six years [of a Mexican presidential term]. You know, we tend to think that democracy is going to vote, and then wait six years to see what happened. And what we're trying to say here is we have to work every day to bring the change this country needs, otherwise no one's going to be able to do it, and we have to shape the people in power. We have to tell them who we want, how [we] want them to behave. But to do that, we have to make sure we're behaving the same way. On whether he's considered running for office No. ... I have the role of being a citizen, which demands a lot from me. ... I think there's a lot that can be done from the perspective of the citizens, and a lot that we have to teach them.

While Democrats are fired up for these midterms, so are his voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump's supporters cheer as he speaks at a rally in Nashville, Tenn., in May. While Democrats are fired up for these midterms, so are his voters. The battle lines are being drawn five months ahead of the midterms, with more Americans than at any point in at least the last two decades saying they're enthusiastic about voting \u2014 and record numbers of voters say President Trump and which party controls Congress are big factors in their vote, according to a new Pew Research Center survey released Wednesday. Voters also are saying they want candidates to talk more about immigration and health care, two hot-button issues that have no simple solutions or easily navigable middle grounds. Just Wednesday, the president backed down from his \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of families, while adults who crossed the border illegally are held for adjudication. A long-term comprehensive solution, however, remains out of reach. On healthcare, Republicans have failed so far to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Care Act, but they did strip out the mandate to buy insurance, which policy experts warn could raise the prices of premiums in October, a month before this fall's elections. Enthusiasm is at record levels Overall, slightly more than half of Americans (51 percent) told Pew they are \"more enthusiastic about voting than usual,\" the highest share saying so in at least the last 20 years since Pew has been asking the question. Democrats are more enthusiastic than Republicans, but not by much \u2014 55 percent of Democrats said they are more enthusiastic than usual, but 50 percent of GOP voters said the same. Those are both very high numbers overall for midterms. Generally, in midterms, the party out of power is far more fired up. That's been the case in each of the last three midterms \u2014 which have all been wave elections resulting in control of at least one chamber of Congress changing hands. In 2006, when Democrats benefited from the spiraling Iraq war and President George W. Bush's declining approval numbers to take control of Congress, a slightly lower number of Democrats than today said they were more enthusiastic than usual (47 percent). But they far outnumbered Republicans in who said they were more enthusiastic in 2006 (30 percent), a 17-point advantage. In 2010, when Republicans won a whopping 63 seats in the House and regained control of that chamber, the GOP was ahead on this question by 13 points (55 to 42 percent). And in 2014, when Republicans won back the Senate, they had an 8-point overall advantage (45 to 37 percent). So the bottom line is Democrats today are as enthusiastic about voting as Republicans were in 2010, but Republicans are also fired up, which could mitigate GOP losses in the House and help them protect their slim Senate majority. Both parties also see who controls Congress as consequential, with a record 68 percent saying so. That number has been steadily on the rise in the past two decades, evidence that elections have become far more nationalized since the Bill Clinton impeachment and through Bush v. Gore, 9/11, the Iraq war, Obamacare and Trump. Politics just isn't so local anymore. Democrats need to win nearly two dozen seats to take control of the House. They are facing a very difficult map in the Senate, defending seats in 26 states, many of which Trump won handily in 2016. Republicans are defending just nine Senate seats. The double-edged Trump sword Three-fifths of Americans (60 percent) said that their vote is essentially a vote for or against the president. That is the highest percentage of voters saying that in at least three decades, Pew found. What's more, a strong majority of Democrats (61 percent) see their vote as one against Trump and a majority of Republicans (52 percent) see it as one for him. Putting those numbers in context again shows Republicans' support for Trump to be pretty strong. Consider that that 52 percent seeing their vote as one for Trump is nearly 20 points higher than the percentage of the GOP who saw their vote as one for Bush in 2006 and is also higher than the percentage of Democrats who said their votes in 2010 and 2014 were to support Obama. That could further insulate Republicans from massive losses this year. Roiling all of this is a strong anti-incumbent sentiment. Two-thirds of Americans say they do not want to see most representatives elected. Majorities are concerned about how either party will deal with Trump after the election \u2014 58 percent of voters think Democrats will spend too much time investigating Trump if they win, and an equal but different 58 percent think Republicans would not focus enough on oversight of the Trump administration. On the issues If it's the economy, stupid, Republicans are in pretty good shape this fall. Pew found Democrats have advantages, sometimes sweeping, on almost all issues \u2014 but not on dealing with the economy. Republicans maintain an advantage over Democrats on doing a better job dealing with a terrorist threat and the economy. They also have smaller advantages on dealing with the budget deficit, taxes and trade, but they have relinquished their advantages on dealing with gun policy, immigration and health care. Americans also say they prefer Democrats to deal with foreign policy, drug addiction (something the president and the GOP have talked about a lot), abortion and contraception, race and ethnicity issues and the environment. Still, the GOP advantage on the economy could be Democrats' biggest problem heading into the midterms. The country is in a time of relative peace and prosperity, with the lowest unemployment numbers since the turn of the century and Trump stepping off of a nuclear standoff with North Korea and putting on a show of diplomacy. That could be why Democrats' advantage on the question of who Americans want to control Congress is only 5 points (48-to-43 percent) in this poll. Democratic strategists would feel far more comfortable with a larger lead on that question, as they had in past wave years.",

From left to right: Reps. Joseph Crowley, Luis Gutierrez, Pramila Jayapal, John Lewis and Judy Chu. President Trump and administration officials are walking a fine line on family separation at the border. They argue they don't like the policy, but that their hands are tied \u2014 and instead are pointing fingers at Congress to \"fix\" it. There may be good reason for that \u2014 the policy (and it is a Trump administration policy, despite the Homeland Security secretary's claims to the contrary) is unpopular. #CHANGETHELAWS   Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security. The president on Tuesday called on Congress to come up with a \"third option\": for the legal authority to detain and promptly remove families together as a unit. This is similar to a practice used during the Obama administration, when some families were detained together. That, too, was criticized, but it is emerging now as a preferred alternative. Some immigrants under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush were released while they awaited adjudication, but that approach is one Trump and conservative critics chafe at, calling it \"catch and release.\" Trump White House officials say that's not an option this president wants to consider since their stated policy is \"zero tolerance\" for people who cross the border illegally. A hard line on immigration was a fundamental ideological underpinning of Trump's candidacy. Now, the country is seeing the practical implementation of that ideology, especially after a year in which little got done legislatively on immigration. Trump, though, appears to be looking for a way out of the bad optics and bad politics \u2014 without looking like he's compromising his principles. Putting Republicans in a jam The president huddled with House Republicans Tuesday afternoon. They're considering several bills, but the strings attached, as always, will be what determines if they pass. Hard-liners and the Trump administration want to see what they can get on the president's other immigration priorities. But there's only so much moderates and Democrats are willing to give on this. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants a narrow bill that deals strictly with family separation. \"In order to fix this problem you can't fix all the problems,\" he told reporters. \"We've wrestled with this issue for a decade.\" The reality is, you don't need to look very far to see which way the wind is blowing on this issue. Not only is the president declining to take full ownership of the policy, but Democrats see no political reason to capitulate, and that leaves moderate Republicans feeling the most heat. Congressional Republicans, especially those in vulnerable House districts, are the ones who most want this issue off the table quickly. That's why Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, came out against the policy. He encouraged the Trump administration to \"stop needlessly separating children from their parents,\" he said in a statement on his Facebook page. \"If the policy is not changed, I will support other means to stop unnecessary separation of children from their parents.\" (If you want to see how divided people are on this, just read the comments on Stivers' Facebook post.) House Republicans see the numbers (the public and private ones). Four public polls were released on the subject over the last couple of days \u2014 from CBS News, CNN/SSRS, Ipsos/Daily Beast and Quinnipiac. And they all show big majorities, around two-thirds of Americans, disapproving of separating families at the border. But there's a catch: they mostly show more Republicans approve than disapprove of the policy. That puts Republicans, especially those still facing primaries, in a predicament \u2014 break with the president and risk facing a tough challenge over a cultural issue that fires up the base, or agree with him and risk losing in a general election in swing districts, where moderate Republicans and independents, who disapprove of the policy, are key to their re-election. (Not) a \"Democrat law\" Trump has, of course, argued that this is all the fault of the Democrats. \"I hate the children being taken away,\" Trump told reporters Friday outside the White House. \"The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law.\" Back at the end of May, Trump also blamed Democrats for their \"horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once the cross the Border\" and encouraged people to \"put pressure\" on them. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS. And on Monday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen took to the podium in the White House briefing room and said, \"[I]t's a law passed by the United States Congress. Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law. It's not an answer. The answer is to fix the laws.\" Nielsen leaned hard on talking about \"the law\" or \"laws\" \u2014 34 times, in fact, in a 25-minute briefing. But it's neither Democrats' law nor a law at all. So what is the Trump administration talking about? The heart of their argument is based on a legal settlement, the Flores Settlement Agreement. The lawsuit against the former Immigration and Naturalization Service began in 1985 and was finally settled under the Clinton administration in 1997. Human Rights First, an international human-rights nonprofit, notes the suit was brought \"on behalf of immigrant children who had been detained\" seeking better treatment. Doris Meissner, who was head of INS at the time and signed the settlement, talked to NPR's Michel Martin on Saturday's All Things Considered. She explained that Flores is not a law, that it does have the \"force of law,\" but it's a \"judgment\" on the part of the Trump administration on \"how to implement that court decision.\" \"[T]his implementation of the court decision that says children need to be separated from their parents because their parent is being prosecuted \u2014 that has never happened before in the past from the time that this settlement took place through other administrations, both Democratic and Republican administrations,\" Meissner said. \"Everybody has recognized that this issue is a balancing act \u2014 that we, of course, have a responsibility to enforce the laws at the border. But to those who are especially vulnerable \u2014 young people and families \u2014 there are other measures that can be taken that, of course, enforce the law but are not so excessively harsh as to violate a principle so fundamental as young children being in detention for long periods of time.\" Trump and his officials in the administration show no signs of backing down. But Republicans, worried about their own re-elections, want to get this out of the way quickly. Judging by his tweets and messaging, so does the president. But it's not his job on the line this year.",

            "article_content": "President Trump will huddle with GOP lawmakers Tuesday as they pursue immigration legislation. It comes as Trump faces heat for separating immigrant children from parents at the border.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump is expected to meet Republican members of Congress today to talk about immigration legislation. The administration faces fierce criticism for a border policy that separates children from their parents when they are apprehended crossing the border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who announced this policy, responded to claims that the zero-tolerance policy echoes Nazi Germany, in an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\") JEFF SESSIONS: Well, it's a real exaggeration, of course. In Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country. But this is a serious matter. We need to think it through, be rational and thoughtful about it. We want to allow asylum for people who qualify for it. INSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson has been following the debate. Hi there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Do Republicans broadly agree with the president's direction here? LIASSON: No, they don't. There are tremendous splits inside the party. There are members from competitive seats in the House that are desperate to vote on something that will show they disagree with this policy. You've got the chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, Steve Stivers, calling on the administration to change the policy - stop separating children from their families. Ted Cruz, who's up for re-election - he's the conservative senator from Texas - he has a bill that would change this policy. And it's even been called by a conservative commentator Trump's Katrina. So the president still wants credit for being tough on the border. But he does not want to take responsibility for the more unpopular consequence of his policy, which is if you have zero tolerance, and you prosecute every illegal border crosser, you have to separate kids from their parents. INSKEEP: And let's remember. This is a publicly announced policy - publicly announced by Jeff Sessions, publicly affirmed by other officials - although officials have now begun to deny it's a policy at all. And the president has been putting this on Democrats. Let's listen to some of that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Immigration is the fault - and all of the problems that we're having because we cannot get them to sign legislation. We can not get them even to the negotiating table. And I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault. INSKEEP: Can I just mention one other thing here, Mara Liasson. Anthony Scaramucci - friend to the president, supporter of the president, briefly the communications director - wrote on Twitter yesterday about the administration response to this. Quote, \"you can't simultaneously argue that family separation isn't happening, that it is being used as a deterrent, that the Bible justifies it and that it's the Democrats' fault. The president is not being served well by his advisers on this issue.\" That's what Scaramucci says. LIASSON: Yes, but I think the president maybe is not being served well by his instincts because his instincts are to blame the Democrats - or blame somebody else for things that he's doing that are unpopular. And he's been repeating this - it's the Democrats' fault - over and over again. And his strategy is to repeat something and to make an argument or a phrase dominate the media to try to change the terms of the debate and bend them to his point of view. It hasn't worked yet. INSKEEP: Now, another thing the administration is claiming is they're helpless to do anything about this policy that they announced and implemented and that Congress needs to change the law. And there is some legislation on the table, right? LIASSON: Yes, there is legislation on the table although several Republicans have said that the White House could fix it with one phone call if they wanted to because this is the result of an administration policy not a law. But there is legislation - will be considered in the House when the president goes to Capitol Hill today to talk to Republicans. He's going to be talking about that legislation. It's unclear - there are two bills. It's unclear whether either of them could pass. But one of them, a compromise bill being pushed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, includes four of the things - the four pillars that the president wants - money for the wall, path to citizenship for the DREAMers, big cuts in legal immigration, and they're trying to put some language in there that would also allow families to be detained together. INSKEEP: Very briefly - is family separation as unpopular as many lawmakers seem to think it is? LIASSON: It is with the broad public. Sixty-six to 27 percent in the latest Quinnipiac poll disapprove of it. But among Republicans, 55 to 35 percent approve. And that's the problem for the president. His base loves this. The broader population of voters do not. INSKEEP: Thanks, NPR's Mara Liasson. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 5:43 p.m. ET President Trump took Capitol Hill by surprise on Friday morning when he said that he would not sign a House GOP immigration bill \u2014 only to reverse course later in the day. \"I'm looking at both of them. I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one,\" Trump told Fox News in a previously unannounced interview on the White House lawn. The comment created a frenzy on Capitol Hill, where House GOP leaders have been working for weeks on legislation aimed at meeting the so-called four pillars of Trump's policy demands on any bill to provide a path to legal status to people brought to the U.S. as children. House Republicans had been working with top White House aides including Marc Short and Stephen Miller to ensure the president's support in the event it reached his desk. By late afternoon, the White House indicated to House Republicans that the president \"just misunderstood\" the question and supports the compromise, according to a House GOP source. Then in the early evening, White House spokesman Raj Shah released a written statement publicly pledging support for two House Republican bills and explaining the mix-up. \"The President fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill. In this morning's interview, he was commenting on the discharge petition in the House, and not the new package. He would sign either the Goodlatte or the leadership bills,\" Shah said. Leaders were negotiating two versions: a conservative proposal crafted by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and backed by members on the right of the GOP conference, and a bill negotiated by top House Republicans that attempts to bridge the divide between conservatives and centrists. Several members involved in those talks say they plan to continue negotiations with a goal of voting on both legislative proposals next week. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters Friday that he believes Trump has an accurate understanding of what is in the draft compromise and is simply pushing for the most conservative bill and not for ending the talks. \"I know there's been ongoing conversations with the administration as early as this morning on the bill,\" Meadows said. \"Listen, you're taking one comment that the president said that he preferred a more conservative bill. That's a consistent theme. At the same time, if a conservative bill can't pass, then everything gets renegotiated.\" Members are particularly confused by Trump's statement because Miller had offered conservatives private assurances of Trump's support during a closed-door meeting on Wednesday. Afterward, he told reporters: \"The president has been extremely supportive of what [GOP Reps.] Raul Labrador and Bob Goodlatte and Steve Scalise are doing to unify the Republican Conference. I think both the bills are being finalized right now, but we strongly support what they're doing.\" Moderates, in particular, were frustrated by the seeming change of heart. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart told reporters that they would have \"serious problems\" if Trump's statement stands. He said the legislation is likely the only chance Republicans will have to pass a bill to fund the border wall and protect immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children, known as DREAMers. \"I think this the only shot at it,\" Diaz-Balart said. \"It's the only shot I believe to legalize the DREAMers, to stop the deportation of the DREAMers.\" Adding to the chaos was Trump's insistence on Fox News that any bill would need to include provisions like money for a border wall and tougher border enforcement. The legislation includes both. In separate remarks to reporters at the White House, Trump also insisted he wanted to see Congress pass legislation that would end his administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border. \"I hate the children being taken away,\" he said. \"The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law.\" The president once again put the blame on the Democrats in a tweet on Friday afternoon, which listed the items he wants included in an immigration bill. The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN! There is no federal law that requires family separation. As part of a Justice Department crackdown on immigration, the Trump administration has imposed tougher border enforcement that now includes separating parents and their children into different detention facilities. The president reiterated his election-year message that more Republicans will be needed in Congress to enact his immigration policies, which he believes most Americans support. \"We need more Republicans, frankly, and that's why I think we're going to do so well in the midterms,\" he said.",

Updated at 9:27 a.m. ET President Trump tried out his own midterm playbook Tuesday at a campaign rally in Tennessee by ramping up his rhetoric on illegal immigration and gang-related crimes. The president's main goal with the Nashville event was to campaign for GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who finds herself in a close Senate contest with former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen that could be pivotal in deciding control of the Senate. \"I've never heard of this guy \u2014 who is he?\" Trump chided Bredesen. \"He's an absolute tool of Chuck Schumer, and of course the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi.\" It was a new moniker for the House minority leader, and Trump doubled down on controversial comments he'd made earlier this month about the drug gang. \"What was the name?\" the president prodded the crowd, who yelled back \"Animals!\" \"They're not human beings,\" Trump added, saying that they use \"glaring loopholes in our immigration laws\" in order \"to infiltrate our country\" and rape, murder and \"cut people up into little pieces.\" Trump did touch briefly on other issues that Republicans want to be a focus of their midterm messaging, such as the GOP's tax cuts and the economy, but it was immigration that was the overarching focus of his speech. Meanwhile, congressional leaders have been working to avoid a fight on immigration as moderates have been pushing for action on the Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump defended his hardline immigration rhetoric, central to his 2016 campaign, as an asset for the midterms. \"And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a great issue, not a bad issue.\" The White House has repeatedly highlighted victims of gang violence as evidence that the U.S. needs more stringent immigration laws, including rolling back some forms of legal immigration. Critics, however, say the administration is simply exploiting such tragedies for political gain and to disparage Hispanic immigrants. It's a campaign tactic that GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie tried in last year's Virginia elections \u2014 and lost handily. But Trump ramped up his original rhetoric on immigration and MS-13 on Thursday night, nonetheless, even returning to some of his tried and true favorites from the presidential campaign trail. On his prized southern U.S. border wall \u2014 which he's struggled to get congressional funding for \u2014 Trump promised the crowd that \"in the end Mexico's gonna pay for the wall,\" implying it would be done via renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \"They're gonna pay for the wall, and they're going to enjoy it,\" the president went on to claim. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, however, had a very different response later via Twitter. President @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us). Trump carried Tennessee in 2016 by 26 points, so his efforts on behalf of Blackburn can greatly buoy her in the state against Bredesen, a popular former two-term governor who was easily re-elected last in 2006. Trump was largely on message Tuesday night, not even veering off to talk about the news of the day \u2014 ABC's cancellation of Roseanne after its star Roseanne Barr went on a racist Twitter rant. Earlier this year, the president had called the comedian, whose character was a Trump supporter, to congratulate her on its ratings dominance. Instead, Trump did try to tie \"Phil Whatever-The-Hell-His-Name-Is,\" \u2014 who's tried to campaign on bipartisanship and pragmatism \u2014 to the national Democratic Party as a whole. \"If Bredesen were ever to get elected, he would do whatever Chuck and Nancy\" want, Trump said. \"They don't want the wall, they want open borders, they're more interested in taking care of criminals than they are of taking care of you \u2014 Bredesen donated a lot of money to the campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\" \"Crooked Hillary!\" Trump added gleefully, as the crowd predictably returned to the routine campaign trail chant of \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\" The full-throated endorsement of Blackburn was important for her, as she struggled early on to unify some of the state GOP behind her in her quest to succeed retiring Sen. Bob Corker, who briefly flirted with reversing his decision not to seek re-election. However, the sometimes Trump critic would have likely lost to Blackburn in the primary. After saying he wouldn't run, in a CNN interview Corker made glowing remarks about Bredesen but only muted, general comments about Blackburn without using her name. Blackburn has long been a vocal Trump backer, and in brief remarks to the crowd she promised she'd be a stalwart ally for the president if elected. \"Tennessee needs a senator who is going to support President Donald Trump and I am going to be there to stand with President Donald Trump to take your Tennessee values to Washington, D.C.,\" Blackburn pledged. Corker has tried to mend fences with Trump after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman questioned the president's fitness for office and diplomatic approaches last year. While Corker and the state's senior senator, Lamar Alexander, were in attendance Tuesday night, the very pro-Trump crowd wasn't shy in expressing their displeasure. When Trump ticked off Corker's name while listing other GOP officials, attendees loudly booed.",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (left) confers with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy during a May 16 news conference. Updated at 3:15 p.m. ET House GOP leaders promised Republicans Tuesday they will bring up immigration legislation in June, even though that pledge threatens to divide the party and undermine the staying power of House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"What we're trying to do is find where the consensus sweet spot is,\" Ryan told reporters. \"It's a very difficult issue. Immigration is an issue that has a lot of passionate positions, a lot of passionate thoughts, and our members come from various different perspectives.\" Those passions took down unrelated farm legislation on Friday, when a bloc of House conservatives voted against a measure they support as leverage to force the House to vote on a hard-line immigration bill authored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. The farm bill is now on hold until a path forward on immigration is clear. At the same time, a competing group of more moderate Republicans continues to advance a discharge petition \u2014 over the vocal opposition of the speaker \u2014 to force the House to vote on a competing series of immigration proposals. The goal is to ultimately pass a more centrist bill that Democrats can support. \"I think that it's important to have something that will get 60 votes in the Senate; that means getting Democrats on board. We will have Democrats on board in the House as well,\" said GOP Rep. Jeff Denham of California, one of the discharge petition advocates who said he expects more lawmakers to sign on to the effort Tuesday. A discharge petition is a rarely used parliamentary tool that can force a vote on legislation if at least 218 lawmakers sign on to the maneuver. If successful, it requires a short waiting period and can only be voted on in the House on the second or fourth Monday in a month the chamber is in session. It rarely succeeds because, by design, it undercuts the will of the majority party, and Ryan reiterated Tuesday he opposes that effort. \"I can guarantee you a discharge petition will not make law, so what's the point?\" the speaker said. To a growing number of lawmakers, the point is that inaction on immigration is worse than taking tough votes in an election year. Retiring Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Ryan Costello signed the petition and said good policy isn't nullified just because it has support from Democrats. \"If you get 200 Republicans and 100 Democrats or 50 Democrats, is that all of a sudden a bad bill?\" Costello said. \"I don't think so.\" Leaders say the moderates control far fewer than 200 votes, meaning Democrats would have to provide the vast majority of the votes to pass any bipartisan immigration bill. But the petition is attracting support from more than just a small cadre of moderates. New York Republican Chris Collins was one of President Trump's earliest supporters in Congress and a backer of the conservative Goodlatte bill \u2014 and he signed the petition. Collins told reporters he signed with the hope that Republicans will rally around Goodlatte, even if the evidence suggests they won't. \"It's a risk,\" Collins said. \"For those of us who told our constituents we're going to fight for them, we can go back and say, 'While I'm disappointed something didn't pass, I'm fighting the good fight. I'm doing my best. I'm going to keep fighting the good fight.' \" House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer told reporters Tuesday he expects they will be able to do just that. \"Every Democrat, I think, is supportive of bringing a bill to the floor that would fix and protect DACA,\" Hoyer said. \"I'm hoping that we can get sufficient signatures to discharge a rule which allows for four different alternatives and allows the speaker to offer anything he wants. How much more open and fair and transparent can you be?\" That may be enough for Republicans who are frustrated with months of inaction from GOP leaders. \"I'm tired of defending nothing. Even if nothing passes, you've got to put forth the effort so you know where people are. Now that may be an entirely ludicrous thought but that's where I'm at,\" said Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., who has signed the discharge petition. \"Guess what: I'm not trying to sow discontentment or mutiny \u2014 I've just frankly run out of patience with, 'Yeah, we'll get to it.' \" Costello also rejected the political argument that pushing an immigration debate could further threaten the GOP's grip on the House majority. \"I just don't agree with that because there's a lot of members in districts similar to mine, middle-of-the-road districts, where they're just looking for people to solve problems, and when you're willing to just have the courage to just go solve problems, voters reward you for that,\" Costello said. House Republicans have never been able to come up with an immigration bill that can pass with GOP votes alone, although that is clearly the continued preference of conservatives like Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., one of the Republicans who took down the farm bill last week. \"It's going to have to be something that garners 218 votes. I won't get everything I want; moderate members won't get everything they want. Hopefully in the end we'll find a compromise,\" Meadows told reporters. While lawmakers, including Meadows, continue to voice support for Ryan's leadership, the immigration debate may test not only his ability to stay on as speaker through the election as he plans but also the ambitions of the Republicans who want to move up the leadership ladder when he is gone: Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. Republican leadership elections are determined solely by sitting lawmakers, but outside conservative activists' groups are already calling for Ryan to step aside to let a new leadership team lead the House GOP through the elections. \"Lame-duck leaders never help much. I think it's time for new leadership,\" said conservative activist Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, a frequent critic of House and Senate GOP leaders. Bozell signed a public letter along with more than 100 conservative leaders on Monday calling for leadership elections now and throwing their support behind Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus. Conservative activists are closely watching the upcoming immigration debate. \"I don't want to be overly dramatic here but it's not just consequential; I think it might be existential,\" he said. It may be up to members to decide whether he stays in power, but Ryan said Tuesday that he believes most Republicans still support him. \"Obviously, I serve at the pleasure of the members,\" Ryan said. \"Those are the people who drafted me into this job in the first place, but I think we all agree the best thing for us is to complete our agenda and not wedge into the middle of the completion of our agenda a divisive leadership election.\" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the conference stands behind Ryan, but he acknowledged that the immigration debate is one of the toughest issues members can confront in an election year. \"I think it's precarious for the conference, it's not for him. It's extremely difficult. It's hard to come together around and we have different opinions, but you just have to keep working the issue and get there,\" he said. Cole, a former campaign chairman, said he thinks the political risk will be affected by whether Republicans allow a bill to pass without the support of a majority of Republican lawmakers. \"Depends. If it's a majority of Republicans, no. If it's a minority of Republicans, yes,\" he said.",

Updated at 11:47 p.m. ET Tuesday was another big night for Democratic women and political newcomers in the party, with a historic nomination in Georgia, an intra-party squabble settled in Texas and an upset victory in a Kentucky House race. The day's contests featured Democratic ideological and stylistic battles, but in the end the national party largely got the candidates they wanted \u2014 especially in critical Texas \u2014 that they believe will be the most competitive general election nominees. Stacey Abrams easily won the Democratic nod for governor in Georgia, beating fellow former state legislator Stacey Evans with her argument that firing up the base is the best way to win in a conservative state, instead of primarily focusing on flipping moderates. Abrams still faces a tough general election, but if she wins in November she'd be the first African-American female governor in U.S. history. With her primary win, she's already the first black woman ever to be nominated for governor by a major political party. The progressive vs. pragmatic divide framed a big race in Texas, where activists had placed their hopes in Laura Moser. She was targeted by national Democrats who thought she was too liberal to flip a swing district in the Houston suburbs. The populist left had tried to to score more wins after finally bringing the fight to party leaders by defeating their favored candidate in a Nebraska primary last week, but ultimately they came up short this week with Moser losing handily to Lizzie Fletcher, herself a first-time candidate. Democrats are hoping to target a suburban House seat in Kentucky, and it's another woman \u2014 Marine combat veteran Amy McGrath \u2014 who nabbed her party's nomination in yet another example of Democratic women prevailing in their primaries. She's a political newcomer who beat a long-time elected official backed by some establishment Democrats. Georgia: Abrams wins Democratic nomination big by appealing to party base Democrats have struggled for years to win statewide in Georgia, despite the state's changing demographics. Abrams' argument about playing to the base and working to turn out minority voters gave the former state House minority leader a commanding win on Tuesday. Abrams is running to become the first African-American woman elected governor in U.S. history. Her candidacy drew plenty of national support from women's groups like EMILY's List, plus endorsements from both Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. As NPR's Asma Khalid reported, Abrams believed that \"the only way a Democrat can win is by engaging with untapped minority voters, particularly those in rural communities, who've often been overlooked\" instead of trying to woo disaffected GOP voters. Her opponent Stacey Evans, who is white, said she would largely hew to the traditional Southern Democratic strategy of trying to win over centrists and independents, while also campaigning in black communities. But Democratic voters in the state overwhelmingly chose the approach by Abrams instead. Abrams still starts as the underdog against the Republican nominee, who wasn't chosen yet on Tuesday. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp will advance to a July runoff in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Nathan Deal. Texas: Lone Star liberals vs. centrists The most high-profile Democratic fight was in the runoff in the Texas 7th Congressional District. The suburban Houston seat fits the mold of Democratic top-tier targets: High-income and highly-educated voters who narrowly backed Hillary Clinton over President Trump in 2016, while also reelecting Republican Rep. John Culberson. Because the seat is so high on their list of targets, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made the unusual decision to plop itself right in the middle of the crowded primary ahead of the March ballot. The DCCC unloaded an opposition research memo on candidate Laura Moser, a progressive activist who party leaders worry would lose a fall campaign against Culberson. The move backfired at first and Moser advanced to the runoff against attorney Lizzie Fletcher, who most party leaders prefer. Both candidates said the DCCC drama had minimal impact on Houston voters, but Moser was able to raise money off the party's hardball tactics. She became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and Exhibit A for progressive candidates across the country who have felt squeezed by party leaders looking for general election candidates who can appeal to Republicans and independents. But in the end, it was Fletcher who prevailed. Culberson's district is probably Democrats' best chance to flip a district in Texas, but there are other contests on their radar too. The DCCC got their favored candidate in former NFL player Colin Allred. He'll challenge GOP Rep. Pete Sessions in a suburban Dallas district that also voted narrowly for Clinton. Allred beat out fellow former Obama administration official Lillian Salerno in the 32nd District in one of the rare losses for a female candidate. In the 23rd District, the DCCC also got their favored candidate with Iraq War veteran Gina Ortiz Jones beating former Sanders activist Rick Trevino. Ortiz Jones, an openly gay first-generation Filipina-American, will face Will Hurd in the expansive border district that also voted for Clinton. Texas Democrats will have a woman as their nominee for governor too \u2014 though she faces an uphill climb in the conservative state. Former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, another openly gay woman, won her runoff over Andrew White, the son of a former governor. Kentucky: Fighter pilot beats the mayor Three-term GOP Rep. Andy Barr is rising atop Democratic target lists, and he will face retired Marine Lt. Colonel Amy McGrath, who won her primary over Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. McGrath drew national attention last year when she released an ad that quickly went viral showing the Iraq and Afghanistan veteran talking about when she was younger and politicians told her that she shouldn't be a fighter pilot \u2014 but went on to become one anyway. Despite McGrath's national surge and fundraising pull following her entrance, Gray also joined the race soon after, encouraged by some national Democrats who have long eyed him as an ideal challenger to Barr. He's an openly gay Southern Democrat who carried the 6th District in the 2016 Senate race, when he challenged Republican Sen. Rand Paul. Democratic strategists were split on who would be the stronger challenger, and there were no clear progressive vs. centrist divides in this contest, though McGrath has probably drawn more liberal support. She painted Gray as part of the political establishment, but the DCCC didn't weigh in for either candidate. Some Republicans, however, were more worried about Gray's proven ability to win crossover voters if he had become the nominee. The race turned negative in its final days as Gray aired an ad criticizing McGrath for just recently moving to the district from the east coast to run for Congress \u2014 a clear sign he was worried about her strength in the contest. McGrath responded on Facebook, calling it \"an attack against any American citizen who chooses to serve their country in times of war and then come home to continue their service in another way.\" Ultimately, that ad could have backfired against Gray and pushed voters to McGrath. She was also possibly buoyed by the surge in female candidates across the country. DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n called McGrath \"battle-tested in more ways than one\" in a statement and argued that the primary had only made her stronger. \" \"Amy has built a formidable campaign, and voters across the district have responded to her message of leadership and standing up for affordable health care,\"  Luj\u00e1n said. \"With her inspiring record of service and all of the momentum at her back, there is no question that Amy McGrath is ready to flip this key district.\" But Congressional Leadership Fund executive director Corry Bliss, who directs the House GOP's main outside superPAC, argued that the divisive primary had ended with the more progressive candidate winning. \"Once again, the DCCC meddled in a primary and failed,\" Bliss said. \"Now, Democrats are stuck with an ultra-liberal candidate who can't even name the counties she wants to represent in Congress. As this race continues, CLF looks forward to informing Kentucky voters of McGrath's ultra-liberal political views, including her support for single-payer health care and her opposition to a $2,052 tax cut for hardworking families.\" Arkansas: Wave watching National Democrats' recruit state Rep. Clarke Tucker won his primary outright to challenge GOP Rep. French Hill in the only closely-watched race in the state. All three of his opponents ran to Tucker's left by touting a more progressive platform, but Tucker handily outpaced them all and topped the 50 percent he needed to avoid a runoff. Democrats probably only had a chance here if Tucker won, and it's still not an easy climb \u2014 the state's once-Democratic heavy congressional delegation has been wiped extinct since 2010.",

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro may have won the vote count but in the process lost the legitimacy to govern, one expert writes. Ted Piccone (@piccone_ted) is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Venezuela's latest electoral affair only worsened the country's continued slide from a relatively stable middle-income democracy to a socialist authoritarian system stricken with hyperinflation, rising poverty, declining oil production and record levels of violent crime. Rather than boost President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's standing after five years in power, the low voter turnout \u2014 down from 80 percent in 2013 to 46 percent on Sunday \u2014 coupled with a clear rejection of the results by the United States, Canada and a group of 13 Latin American nations, leaves the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez with a crisis of governability. Maduro may have won the vote count but in the process lost the legitimacy to govern. Venezuela's deterioration toward despotism and despair comes as little surprise. For years, experts have warned that increasing executive control of the country's democratic institutions alongside gross mismanagement of its oil-dominated economy would lead to worsening conditions for its 30 million citizens. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have left the country in the past two years, many of them desperate to escape the confluence of food and medicine shortages, lack of decent jobs, terrible crime and political repression. The situation today is a tragic reversal of the heady days when Ch\u00e1vez first launched his Bolivarian revolution in 1998, promising to spread Venezuela's vast petroleum wealth more fairly among the majority poor. For years, the charismatic revolutionary rode the wave of high oil prices to deliver social benefits to his constituents, helping him not only to overcome general strikes, mass protests and a coup attempt, but also to win relatively free and fair elections multiple times. He abused that electoral popularity and government largesse to rewrite the constitution in his favor, create paramilitary \"Bolivarian circles,\" stack the courts and electoral council with his loyalists, control the state-owned oil firm, and stifle free media. Ch\u00e1vez also effectively used the country's oil reserves, the world's largest, to insulate his regime from U.S. pressure, securing favorable loans from China and new military equipment and energy deals from Russia. By the time Ch\u00e1vez died in March 2013, the winning formula for an elected authoritarian was well-entrenched. His hand-picked successor, Maduro, narrowly won elections a month later and quickly consolidated control by digging even deeper into the trough of state resources to buy off the military, nationalize industries and woo enough voters to stave off electoral defeat. This strategy, however, has probably run its course. With mounting foreign debt, falling oil production, increased sanctions, diplomatic isolation and a spreading humanitarian crisis on his hands, Maduro can survive only by taking painful steps to reform a system that fuels his regime's authority. Since this is unlikely, we should expect to see an increasingly desperate hardening of his administration's tactics against his opponents, domestic and foreign, and an intensified reliance on China and Russia for support. The goals are relatively clear \u2014 weaken Maduro enough to force him to negotiate a peaceful exit while preventing a worsening humanitarian crisis. Washington, however, is not well-positioned politically to lead the charge. For the United States and the international community, Venezuela presents a particularly tricky case. The goals are relatively clear \u2014 weaken Maduro enough to force him to negotiate a peaceful exit while preventing a worsening humanitarian crisis that is already destabilizing neighboring Colombia and fragile Caribbean states and could bring thousands of desperate Venezuelans to U.S. borders. Washington, however, is not well-positioned politically to lead the charge. Threats of military intervention, already uttered by President Trump, are a non-starter. Support for a military coup likewise would seriously set back U.S. standing in the region. For the past three decades, the U.S. has mostly stood firm in support of democratic and negotiated solutions to the Latin America's internal political crises. That leaves expanding the list of targeted economic sanctions, coordinated with partners in the region and Europe, to pressure Maduro and his allies to come to the negotiating table in a serious way. Up until now, Maduro has managed to avoid such a negotiated pact with the opposition, which remains divided and demoralized. They are not, however, defeated. They will likely return to the streets to protest the government's abuses and economic malfeasance. As the country becomes more ungovernable, moderates in the ruling socialist party may realize that the benefits of the current system can only be preserved through compromise. A new mediation process should be launched as soon as possible, facilitated by the United Nations under the secretary-general's banner of conflict prevention, and supported by a coalition of states that includes not only key South American countries like Peru, Chile and Argentina, but also the United States, France, Germany, China and the Vatican. An early agreement should be reached to allow international agencies to deliver humanitarian assistance to malnourished and sick Venezuelans before they attempt to leave the country. And a package of economic incentives should be assembled to prepare for a post-Maduro scenario. In sum, while Maduro may claim a historic victory that solidifies his hold on power, the reality is just the opposite. If the domestic opposition can rally, it will signal to the international community that a coordinated plan of increased sanctions and facilitated talks is feasible.",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., confers with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. At a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., urged House Republicans to resist the urge to sign on to a discharge petition to force the House to vote on contentious immigration legislation. \"I think it's futile to bring a discharge through which would guarantee nothing goes into law,\" Ryan told reporters this week, outlining his message to the rank-and-file. \"The point I keep making is if we're going to advance immigration legislation, let's advance immigration legislation that could get a presidential signature. Not one that would get a presidential veto. That's the point we keep trying to make.\" Despite those efforts, two Republicans \u2014 Rep. John Katko of New York and Dave Trott of Michigan \u2014 signed on to the petition in a move that highlighted both the weakening political muscle of a lame duck speaker, and just how eager a growing number of rank-and-file Republicans are to have an immigration debate. GOP leaders' immigration problems are compounded by a competing bloc of conservatives that are threatening passage of the farm bill this week unless they extract concessions to vote on a hard-line immigration bill popular among the party's base. The discharge petition is a little used and rarely successful legislative gambit in which lawmakers can force a vote in the House if they get 218 signatures. Last week, GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida introduced a discharge petition that, if successful, would trigger votes on four competing immigration measures that run the ideological spectrum from bipartisan to hard-line immigration proposals. Curbelo is one of the House GOP's most vulnerable incumbents, running for re-election in a district carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race. He supports bipartisan efforts on immigration that would include a path to citizenship for certain people, and he has been a harsh critic of President Trump's hard-line immigration stances and rhetoric. So far, 20 Republicans \u2014 mostly moderates in competitive districts \u2014 have signed on and only five more signatures could clinch it, assuming all 193 House Democrats join them. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that was a safe bet. \"Ninety-nine percent of our members will be signing on,\" she told reporters, calling the discharge petition fight \"something very beautiful.\" The maneuver is challenging Ryan and McCarthy's leadership. The two met privately with President Trump this week at the White House in an effort to come up with a unified strategy for a path forward on immigration that doesn't expose the sharp divides within the GOP on the issue. Ryan told reporters the purpose of the meeting was to \"advance a strategy that addresses the issues that our members have, the concerns they have, but doing it in a way where we actually have a process that can get a presidential signature, and not a presidential veto.\" However, it's not clear the White House shares their concerns. President Trump and senior administration officials including chief of staff John Kelly have never let up on their frustration with congressional inaction on immigration. The prospect of a forced showdown on the House floor may not be as unappealing on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \"We have the worst laws anywhere in the world for illegal immigration,\" Trump vented Wednesday at an immigration event at the White House. \"There's no place in the world that has laws like we do.\" The president has not weighed in on the discharge petition, but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was given an opportunity to give the speaker some rhetorical back up on Thursday when asked if the president supports the petition, and she did not echo Ryan's argument. \"The president definitely supports border security as he's laid out multiple times and again talked about some yesterday,\" she said, \"He would like to see the border secured, he would like to see the loopholes closed. Our priorities have not changed in the immigration conversation at all.\" The immigration pressure in the House is not coming just from moderates and Democrats. Many conservatives, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, likewise want to have an immigration debate too, but they're approaching it from a different negotiating tactic that is also squeezing GOP leaders. A bloc of conservatives, including Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., are threatening to hold up passage of a farm bill if they don't extract an agreement to vote on conservative immigration legislation by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. His proposal is opposed by Democrats and would require passage on the strength of GOP votes alone \u2014 a level of support that GOP leaders insist the Goodlatte bill does not have on the House floor. The competing pressure from the moderate and conservative wings alike is fueling expectations that the House will have to take some kind of action on immigration, whether GOP leaders like it or not. Pelosi told reporters Ryan would be better served by allowing votes on legislation outlined in the discharge petition. \"The speaker should maintain control of the floor by just bringing the bill up,\" she said. Discharge petitions are governed by a set of procedural rules that dictate that after 218 signatures are reached, a mandatory seven-legislative-day layover must occur and then a vote can only happen on the second or fourth Monday of the month. If so, the House could find itself in an immigration debate with no clear endgame in the thick of primary season and a midterm election year in which the GOP majority is at stake \u2014 exactly the scenario Ryan is trying to avoid.",

With Vice President Pence as the tie-breaker in the Senate, Democrats need to flip a net of two seats in 2018 to win back the majority.\n                \n                    \n                    Renee Klahr/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republicans currently have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with two independents caucusing with Democrats. With Vice President Pence as the tie-breaker in the Senate, Democrats need to flip a net of two seats in 2018 to win back the majority. Democrats are going into the 2018 elections with the wind at their backs, which could even be enough to flip a Senate map heavily stacked for Republicans come November. In conversations with several top GOP strategists, nearly all conceded that the overwhelming Democratic enthusiasm they're facing this November is incredibly worrisome. Most still think it's a better than even chance that they do keep the Senate \u2014 albeit narrowly \u2014 but it's no longer out of the realm of possibility that the upper chamber could change hands, especially given the volatility of the GOP's two-seat majority. \"Generally speaking, close races aren't won by the party with the wind in their face. That's not the way it works,\" said one top GOP Senate race veteran. \"If we lose 40 to 50 seats in the House, you can't pick up three to four Senate seats.\" \"If we hold the Senate, I think it will be close. It will be closer than it should be when the cycle started,\" said another longtime Republican Senate operative. \"There's no question it's far more in play than it was a year ago.\" Moreover, lackluster fundraising as of late from GOP challengers and stronger-than-expected hauls from Democratic incumbents has further stoked worry among Republicans. Loading... Many Republicans are already beginning to make the argument in some surprisingly volatile states like Tennessee that the Senate majority is on the line \u2014 hoping to woo voters to the polls by hammering home the implication that something as important as another Supreme Court vacancy could be left in the hands of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. Still, Senate Leadership Fund President and CEO Steven Law, who runs the superPAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, recently noted that the last time the House flipped in 2010, Democrats lost the House and still managed to hold on to their Senate majority because those statewide races were more insulated from national trends. While Republicans started this election cycle as favorites to hold the Senate, it's increasingly up in the air as to whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will hold his gavel next year.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption While Republicans started this election cycle as favorites to hold the Senate, it's increasingly up in the air as to whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will hold his gavel next year. \"The political train in the Senate is a lot more favorable for Republicans than it is in all these House districts that were carried by Hillary Clinton ... I think we've got a lot more terrain to play with that makes the task of defending the Senate majority, I wouldn't say easy, but a task that we think we can undertake and win,\" Law said last month on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily. However, one reason Republicans were unable to flip some of those Senate seats was because of problematic nominees from their own party, and as the Senate primaries begin in earnest, they're hoping to avoid disasters. Overall though, Republican fortunes in keeping the Senate aren't as good as they should be, especially given the near-perfect map they were gifted this cycle. Democrats are defending 26 seats \u2014 10 of which are in states that President Trump carried \u2014 while Republicans have nine seats on the ballot, and only one (Nevada) in a state that Hillary Clinton carried. Most Republicans believe Sens. Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri are their best chances to win seats currently held by Democrats. In recent weeks, one of the best bits of news for Republicans was when Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced that he would challenge Sen. Bill Nelson. The billionaire Scott can give freely to his own campaign, forcing Democrats to perhaps divert resources from other contests. In the next tier are Democratic incumbents in states President Trump won by more than 20 points \u2014 North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Montana's Jon Tester. But even Republicans admit all three have strong political identities distinct from the national Democratic Party and that they won't be as easy to knock off as once thought. In addition, once-competitive states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania have slipped from being realistic opportunities, according to multiple GOP sources, both in part because Republicans have struggled to attract strong candidates. Some Republicans still mention Wisconsin as a possible sleeper race, where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is running for re-election. Meanwhile, Republicans are at risk of losing as many as three of their own seats. The most endangered is Sen. Dean Heller's seat in Nevada, a state won twice by Barack Obama and by Hillary Clinton in 2016. The contest to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake in Arizona worries many Republicans because a late unsettled primary contest could weaken the party's nominee in a state that's changing rapidly. And what should be a safe seat in Tennessee is becoming anything but a sure thing, rocketing up the list of GOP concerns. All in all, everything has to go right for Democrats to flip the two seats they need to win control of the Senate, including hanging on to most of their own endangered incumbents. But Republicans are growing increasingly pessimistic about their chances come November \u2014 and as many privately note, the environment is probably going to get worse for them before it gets better. Hoosier and Mountaineer brawls Contests on Tuesday will determine GOP nominees in two critical contests. West Virginia is the biggest test yet as to whether Republicans could forgo a winnable opportunity due to primary squabbles. A nasty three-way race there pits Rep. Evan Jenkins (the establishment favorite), Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (who argues he's the true conservative candidate in the race) and coal CEO and Don Blankenship (who's the most Trump-like figure) against each other. Blankenship is giving Republicans the most heartburn with a racially charged campaign that's focused as much on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as it is on Sen. Joe Manchin. The former CEO of Massey Energy was convicted  in 2015 on a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards after a 2010 explosion killed 29 miners. He served a year in prison and is still on probation, but has painted himself as the scapegoat of federal prosecutions run amok. If Blankenship wins the nomination, Republicans fear their chances of winning would evaporate. The GOP nomination is also up for grabs in Indiana in another bitter three-way race, this time between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and businessman Mike Braun. Braun, who's funding his own campaign, has styled himself the outsider in the contest, and in a memorable ad even carried around cardboard cutouts of both Rokita and Messer \u2014 who dressed similarly for an early debate \u2014 to underscore the similarities of the two congressmen. Republicans say they'd be happy with any nominee against Donnelly, who benefited in 2012 from a gaffe-prone GOP nominee. However, in both Indiana and West Virginia, Democrats are ready to repurpose the same attacks the Republicans have been using against each other for their fall campaigns. \"Republicans are airing all this dirty laundry for us, and they've been doing it pretty rampantly,\" said one Democratic operative involved in several Senate races this cycle. Can Republicans overcome Democratic incumbents' independent brands? Donnelly and McCaskill are regarded as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as of now. In Missouri, McCaskill is likely to face state Attorney General Josh Hawley, who has been thrust in the unwelcome position of investigating Gov. Eric Greitens, a fellow Republican, in an increasingly messy sex and campaign finance scandal that could lead to Greitens' impeachment. While Republicans got a break in North Dakota earlier this year when GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer decided eventually to run for Senate, Heitkamp has made overtures to the Trump White House and still seen as an independent figure in the state. Veterans of past Senate campaigns caution she won't be as easy as some think to knock off. The same is true for Tester in neighboring Montana, who recently raised multiple allegations of wrongdoing against Ronny Jackson, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, which ultimately sank his nomination. Trump has fired back against Tester repeatedly over those actions and some Republicans think the Jackson issue could hurt Tester at home. But in a state where nearly 1 in 10 residents are veterans, Tester is betting that the episode won't have an impact on his race this fall. Republicans find themselves on defense The two most vulnerable seats for Republicans are in the Southwest. In Nevada, the White House maneuvered to head off a primary challenge against Dean Heller in Nevada, the most endangered GOP incumbent in the country. But in anticipation of a primary, Heller, who was once critical of Trump, also embraced Trump in a way that could have a lasting impact on his race against likely Democratic nominee, Rep. Jacky Rosen, come this fall. But Republicans counter that Trump's numbers in Nevada, which he lost to Clinton by 2 points, have rebounded. Loading... In neighboring Arizona, Republicans are defending the open seat of retiring Sen. Jeff Flake. There's a three-way late August primary there, between establishment favorite Rep. Martha McSally, conservative Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a prominent birther who Trump controversially pardoned after he was convicted of criminal contempt for defying a judge's order to stop detaining immigrants without legal status. McSally turned in a strong fundraising haul, even besting likely Democratic nominee, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. Republicans believe that McSally, a former Air Force fighter pilot, has just the profile needed to hold this seat and she's widely favored to win the primary. But the question is whether conservatives will launch an all-out assault that will damage her in the general election. And like Heller, McSally has had to embrace Trump after refusing to endorse him in 2016. National Republicans think this race will be lost if anyone other than McSally wins, and question what Trump \u2014 who's been complimentary of Ward and is downright chummy with Arpaio \u2014 will do. Vice President Pence's remarks last week in favor of Arpaio when he visited the border certainly didn't help the primary situation, either. Volunteer majority maker? Tennessee has emerged as the biggest wildcard that could make or break the Senate majority for both parties. Democrats scored a major coup by convincing former Gov. Phil Bredesen to enter the race after frequent Trump critic and GOP Sen. Bob Corker announced he wouldn't run for re-election. In recent weeks, Corker has made glowing remarks about Bredesen, whom he worked closely with when the Democrat was governor and Corker was the mayor of Chattanooga, while not even mentioning the name of the Republican, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, other than to note she would be the GOP nominee and he had donated to her campaign. Early polls show Bredesen with a lead, but Republicans argue that he has statewide name recognition, which Blackburn does not and that the race will tighten over time. Republicans are also left hoping that their voters will come out if they know their vote means the difference between a Democratic or a Republican-controlled Senate. Still, this contest has more than a few national strategists worried. Tennessee is more likely to flip than is Texas, despite Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke's strong fundraising over GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. The only other wildcard could be the special election in Mississippi to replace Sen. Thad Cochran, who resigned last month due to failing health. There's some conservative skepticism about newly appointed Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, a former Democrat. Conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel \u2014 who nearly ousted Cochran in a nasty 2012 primary \u2014 switched to this race and is challenging Hyde-Smith in an all-party open primary on Nov. 6. If no candidate gets 50 percent on Election Day, the race will go to a Nov. 27 runoff. Meanwhile, former U.S. Agriculture Secretary and ex-congressman Mike Espy is the Democrats' best-known candidate.",

The final Indiana Senate Republican debate ahead of Tuesday's primary election was not exactly a battle of ideas because, as the moderator noted at the top, there isn't much ideological diversity between the three candidates in the race. \"They agree that when it comes to immigration that a wall should be built along the border with Mexico. They also agree that the Russia investigation is quote a 'witch hunt' and must end now,\" said moderator Abdul Hakim-Shabazz. \"And they're also strong supporters of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and they support arming teachers in the classroom. So we will not spend any time on those issues in the questioning.\" The number one question from Hoosiers was about the candidates' support for President Trump, and they wanted specifics on where they disagreed with him. Much like job candidates asked by a prospective employer what their weaknesses are, they couldn't identify any. Rep. Todd Rokita touted his support for Trump during the 2016 campaign. \"The president knows that I had his back when he needed it most: against crooked Hillary Clinton,\" he said. Rival Rep. Luke Messer praised Trump's North Korea strategy. \"President Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize,\" he said. While businessman Mike Braun highlighted his parallel to Trump as the political outsider in the race. \"I'm on record saying President Trump was the inspiration for why I ran and he needs more reinforcements like me,\" he said. Rokita, Messer and Braun are locked in a tight battle for the GOP nomination to face off against incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly in November. Echoes of this primary dynamic are playing out in GOP primaries in congressional and gubernatorial races all over the country right now, where Republican candidates are in lockstep with Trump's agenda and waging campaigns over the more nuanced question of which candidate voters believe will be the most loyal fighter for President Trump. Despite low national approval ratings, a steady stream of administration controversies and the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election led by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, nothing has shaken President Trump's enduring popularity among Republicans, where his approval ratings hover around 90 percent. Veteran House and Senate campaign strategist Andrea Bozek says in 2018 Republicans are less concerned with the old, familiar metrics that used to drive primary campaigns, like conservative vote ratings, or whether candidates had signed an anti-tax pledge. \"I think now it's how much support have you given the president in the past, and what can you do to support his agenda going forward?\" she said.  The conservative groups that used to drive those wedges in primary campaign debates, like the anti-tax Club for Growth, agree that the politics of Trump's personality are a more decisive factor in this political environment. The group's president, David McIntosh, says Republicans primary voters see a president under siege, by Democrats and the media, and they are motivated above all else to vote for the candidate who will fight on his behalf.

Club for Growth is engaged in more than a dozen House and Senate primaries, and even where the attack ads involve policy issues like health care, the message is centered on where the candidate is in relation to the president. For instance, in an open Ohio House race, the Club's latest attack ad hits their opponent as someone who is \"Not on Trump's side--or yours.\" Ohio also holds primary elections on Tuesday, May 8. In the gubernatorial race, Republicans Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor are engaged in another contentious primary in which their campaign attack ads highlight the others' lack of support for Trump. \"She claims she's conservative but Taylor refused to endorse Donald Trump for president over Hillary Clinton,\" states one DeWine line of attack. Democrats also face an open gubernatorial primary, with former Ohio Attorney General and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Richard Cordray and former Rep. Dennis Kucinich competing for the nomination. In West Virginia's three-way Republican Senate primary, also taking place Tuesday, Rep. Evan Jenkins is hoping the fact that he was the first to endorse Trump back in the 2016 campaign will help him edge out rivals. He's up against state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former coal executive Don Blankenship, who served a year in prison after being convicted in 2015 on a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate federal mine-safety laws.Jenkins pointed to his support for Trump during a Fox News debate this week. \"Who did you vote for in the May primary in West Virginia, I endorsed and voted for Donald Trump. Who did you vote for?\" Jenkins said to Morrisey during this week's Fox News debate. \"I support the president,\" Morrisey responded. The winner of Tuesday's primary will take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November. This entire GOP strategy of aligning tightly with Trump on his agenda and mirroring his rhetoric is bucking the conventional wisdom of midterm elections, where the president's party historically loses seats in Congress and candidates traditionally look to keep their distance from the White House.  GOP pollster John McLaughlin, who worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, says if Republican candidates want to get the Trump voter to turn out this year, it makes sense to run as close to Trump as possible. \"The Democrats organically are getting out their anti-Trump vote, and the Republicans need to get out that pro-Trump voter who didn't vote in 2014, but came out in 2016 because of Donald Trump.\" That strategy is not without risks. Republicans running as mini-Trumps in primaries could be making themselves more vulnerable in the November general election where a more competitive and diverse electorate will decide the winner. Operatives like McIntosh say Republicans have made a different calculation about 2018. \"I think the old formula is that you want the purple-y candidate or the squishy candidate so he can appeal to both sides in the general election is a recipe for failure for Republicans this year,\" he said.",

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called new presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, more than a year earlier than scheduled. The change announced Wednesday by Erdogan speeds the implementation of the constitutional changes approved last year, which will give the president broad new powers upon completion of the next national election. Just hours after Erdogan's televised address Wednesday, Turkish lawmakers voted to extend the country's state of emergency through July \u2014 the seventh such extension since Ankara first implemented it after an attempted coup in July 2016. Speaking at the presidential palace in Ankara before the parliamentary vote, Erdogan told the country that, with political uncertainty rampant in the region, there was simply no time to lose in scheduling new elections. \"Even though the president and government are working in unison, the diseases of the old system confront us at every step we take,\" Erdogan said, as translated by The Guardian. \"Developments in Syria and elsewhere have made it urgent to switch to the new executive system in order to take steps for our country's future in a stronger way.\" Turkey launched a military operation in northwest Syria earlier this year, aimed at dislodging Kurdish fighters from the region just across the Turkish border. Ankara views the People's Protection Units, or YPG, a Kurdish militia operating in that area, as a terrorist group allied with Kurdish separatists inside its own borders \u2014 and just last month, the Turkish military seized the Syrian city of Afrin from the Kurds. As NPR's Peter Kenyon noted at the time, Erdogan has been riding a wave of domestic support for the operation, which \"has analysts concluding that Erdogan's political support is on the rise.\" At the same time, Erdogan said his decision to call the vote came not solely of his own accord, but partly at the suggestion of a political ally: Devlet Bah\u00e7eli, head of the nationalist MHP party, who proposed the idea Tuesday. Bah\u00e7eli said there's little reason to prolong the wait to implement those constitutional changes passed last year, which exchange the country's parliamentary form of government for one that concentrates most of the power with the president. Erdogan added during his speech that his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, has entered a political alliance with Bah\u00e7eli's party for the coming elections. Other parties, however, have resisted the proposition \u2014 at least as long as the nearly 2-year-old state of emergency remains in place. \"There cannot be an election under emergency rule,\" said Bulent Tezcan, spokesman for the main opposition party, according to Reuters. \"The country needs to brought out of the emergency rule regime starting today.\" Elections held under the state of emergency are likely to hasten Erdogan's consolidation of power \u2014 and are unlikely to come as welcome news to the European Union, which Turkey has been seeking to join. Just one day earlier, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, expressed dismay at the recent political developments in Turkey. \"Most worryingly, in the crucial area of fundamental rights, Turkey has taken significant steps backwards,\" Johannes Hahn, the commissioner considering potential new members, said while introducing a new report on Turkey's EU bid Tuesday. Conceding that the 2016 coup attempt \"fundamentally changed the security situation\" in Turkey, Hahn said Ankara's response has been disproportionate. \"Journalists, human rights activists, members of civil society are still being imprisoned,\" he added. \"Since the introduction of the state of emergency, more than 150,000 people have been taken into custody, and many are still detained.\" The lengthy report itself made the matter even more plain: \"Turkey should lift the state of emergency without delay.\" \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7Video message by #EU-Commissioner @JHahnEU on the 2018 report on #Turkey.Full report\u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/SFgSqaHwRsInfos on the #EU Enlargement package 2018\u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/LYLMJBfCEc pic.twitter.com/fPB8dA7IPA The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for its part, rejected the report's conclusions in a lengthy rebuttal, citing its continuing fight against multiple terrorist organizations. \"Unfortunately, the European Commission showed that it was once again unwilling to understand the difficulties of the period we are passing through,\" the ministry said in its statement. \"Although we have explained these issues repeatedly supported by documentation, the Commission was unable to be objective and balanced.\" Regardless of the EU's concerns about the state of emergency, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced Wednesday that they are proceeding without delay, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. \"The process has officially started,\" he said.",

Pledging to impeach President Trump would backfire on Democrats hoping to take back the House of Representatives this fall, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. The survey finds that 47 percent of registered voters would definitely vote against a candidate who wanted to remove Trump from office, while 42 percent would definitely vote for a candidate who would make such a promise. Forty-seven percent of independent voters \u2014 whose opinions could be decisive \u2014 also say they would vote against candidates favoring impeachment. Loading... Unsurprisingly, impeachment is a nonstarter with 84 percent of GOP voters. And Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, said arguing to voters that Democrats would try to stymie Trump and remove him from office could be one of the most salient messages for Republicans this fall, especially given Trump's low approval ratings and rising frustrations with Congress. \"The threat of impeachment provides Republicans their best point of attack looking toward the midterm elections, and I think we're going to hear a lot more about it from their arsenal as they try to isolate the Robert Mueller investigation and delegitimize it,\" said Miringoff. \"If there's a silver lining for Republicans in this data, it's the impeachment question.\" It's Democrats from more liberal districts who have been making noise about impeaching Trump, while members in more competitive swing districts \u2014 which Democrats will need to win to reach the 23 seats required to take back the House \u2014 have generally opposed such an idea. Democratic leaders don't want to make impeachment a central tenet of their pitch to voters and are fearful it could backfire with voters, just as this new poll suggests, but major donor and California billionaire Tom Steyer has launched a major campaign pushing to oust Trump. Democrats would need only a simple majority in the House to impeach Trump \u2014 something that's happened to only two other presidents in the country's history. To remove him from the Oval Office, which has never been done before, would take a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict him of any articles of impeachment, which could theoretically arise from Mueller's investigation. The promise of impeachment isn't a winning one even with all Democrats, either. While 70 percent of Democratic voters would back a candidate who favors impeachment, 3 in 10 would either vote against such a candidate (18 percent) or are unsure (12 percent). There's also a major age gap in those who want to remove Trump through the most extreme measures versus those who don't \u2014 57 percent of voters under 30 support impeachment, but 55 percent of those 60 and older oppose it. Democrats don't have a huge edge in polling either when it comes to November's midterm election, but they still have a consistent advantage. On the generic ballot question, which measures whether voters would prefer a Democratic- or GOP-controlled Congress, Democrats have a 5-point edge, 44 percent to 39 percent. Independents break for Democrats by a 6-point margin, 38 percent to 32 percent, with 16 percent still undecided. Democrats had an advantage as high as 11 points at the beginning of February \u2014 which exceeded the edge of about 7 to 8 points most analysts believe Democrats need to hit to retake the House, though polling later in the summer may be more predictive. Still, the 5-point edge for Democrats is the same as they held last month.

Trump's approval remains underwater The better predictor for Democratic fortunes in the midterms may be Trump's approval rating, which has remained stagnant at 38 percent in this poll: 54 percent of all adults disapprove of the job he has done, including 40 percent who strongly disapprove. Miringoff noted that in the 18 polls Marist has conducted since Trump was inaugurated, his approval rating has been somewhere between 35 and 42 percent \u2014 not an encouraging sign for an incumbent president ahead of his first midterm, when the president's party typically loses seats. \"It's not a good number for members of Congress in competitive seats to be looking at when they're planning their re-election strategy,\" he said. \"They can't attack Trump for fear of turning off their base, but they still have to reach out to voters who are turned off by the president.\" Trump's approval rating is still strong with Republicans at 79 percent, with 13 percent disapproving. And 53 percent of white men approve of Trump's job performance, including 31 percent who strongly approve. But with some of the important subgroups Republicans will need to win this November, Trump remains underwater. Fifty-five percent of independents disapprove of the job Trump has done, including 40 percent who strongly disapprove. Sixty-one percent of women disapprove, including 55 percent of white women who disapprove \u2014 and that includes 44 percent of white women who strongly disapprove. Trump also lags across the board with all age groups, including even older voters. Middle-age voters between the ages of 45 and 59 are nearly evenly split on the president, with 48 percent disapproving and 47 percent approving. But with voters 60 and older, half say they disapprove of the job he has been doing, with 42 percent approving. And of those senior citizens who disapprove, a 39 percent plurality say they strongly disapprove. Fifty-six percent of adults also say the country is moving in the wrong direction, with just 36 percent saying it is moving in the right direction. With Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, those pessimistic numbers could also prompt voters who want a change to vote for Democrats, perhaps acting as a check on Trump. Americans want Congress to focus on health care, not a border wall One of the president's top legislative priorities doesn't garner much support among the public, either. Just over half of Americans (55 percent) said building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico should not be a priority for Congress at all, with just under a quarter saying it should be an immediate priority. Roughly half of Republicans say it should be an immediate priority, though 20 percent still say it shouldn't be a priority at all. There is a groundswell for Congress to act to change gun laws, reform health insurance and protect DREAMers, who were brought to the U.S. as children illegally. Health insurance is the biggest priority Americans want their legislators to address, with 72 percent saying Congress should take immediate action on it. There's some rare bipartisan agreement here too, with 73 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of independents all wanting Congress to immediately address the issue. Loading... Just over half of Americans (52 percent) also say stricter gun laws should be an immediate priority, with 27 percent saying it shouldn't be a priority at all. Unsurprisingly, there's a big partisan divide underlying those numbers \u2014 about half of GOP voters (47 percent) say stricter gun laws shouldn't be a priority at all, while three-quarters of Democrats and half of independents say it should be an immediate priority. Fifty-four percent of Americans also say granting legal status to DREAMers should be an immediate priority \u2014 72 percent of Democrats agree along with 51 percent of independents, but only 32 percent of Republicans say the same thing. Instead, 35 percent of GOP voters say it shouldn't be an immediate priority while 29 percent say it shouldn't be a priority at all. This poll continues to show a decline in confidence in all major democratic institutions, from the presidency to the media. Seven in 10 Americans say they don't trust the media at all or have any confidence in them, while 28 percent have either a great deal of confidence in the press or quite a lot. About half of Democrats (52 percent) say they trust the press and have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in it, but 91 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of independents say they have not very much or no confidence at all in the media. A lack of confidence in Congress is more consistent across party lines. Seventy-eight percent of Americans say they don't have very much or any confidence at all in the legislative branch. Those who share that view include 81 percent of Democrats, 82 percent of independents and even 76 percent of Republicans (whose party controls both the House and the Senate). The presidency, as an institution, fares better. Just 39 percent of Americans have either a great deal or a lot of confidence in the executive branch, with 59 percent not having any or having just very little confidence in it. Eighty-four percent of Democrats have not very much or no confidence at all in it, though; the same is true for 61 percent of independents. But just over three-quarters of Republicans \u2014 seemingly tying this question to Trump \u2014 say they do have confidence in the presidency, including 44 percent who say they have a great deal of confidence in it. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll surveyed 1,011 U.S. adults from April 10-13 with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points. A subsample of 827 registered voters resulted in a margin of error of  +/- 3.9 percentage points.",

People here are part of a national trend among progressive-tilting voters. They appear energized and eager to vote in November's midterm election. Many say they hope to tip the balance of power in Congress away from Republicans, away from the party of President Trump. But millions of those Americans live in places like Vermont that already has a congressional delegation that sides with the Democrats. They can't vote for any more national Democrats until the 2020 presidential election. So activists and donors here have begun looking beyond Vermont's borders. A major focus is the race for New York's 21st District, right across Lake Champlain. \"It is really energizing to us on the Vermont side to become involved in whatever way we can,\" said Susan Kavanagh, who co-hosted this gathering in the liberal college town Middlebury, Vt. That means \"financially supporting a candidate or literally going door to door to help tell the story,\" Kavanagh added. We're still in primary season, and New York's 21st District has seven Democratic candidates vying for the nomination. Katie Wilson from Keene, N.Y., has made the pilgrimage today. She is hoping to find support and dollars that will help her challenge Republican incumbent Elise Stefanik. Candidate Katie Wilson from Keene, N.Y. made the pilgrimage to Middlebury, Vt. hoping to find support and raise money.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Mann/NCPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Candidate Katie Wilson from Keene, N.Y. made the pilgrimage to Middlebury, Vt. hoping to find support and raise money. \"There are people who just want to flip the House,\" Wilson says, pointing out that she also has support from Democrats in other \"safe\" districts across the country. One of the country's leading environmental activists, Bill McKibben, also turned up at this event. He said his fellow Vermonters know money will be a big factor this November. \"There will be millions of dollars from the Koch brothers and the RNC [supporting GOP incumbents],\" he said. \"Vermont kind of always has its heart for the scrappy underdog.\" Beating Stefanik, a rising star in the GOP, won't be easy. New York's 21st District is just as rural as Vermont but a lot more conservative. Donald Trump did really well there, and Stefanik won in a landslide. She has already raised more than a million dollars for her re-election campaign, with roughly 90 percent of her war chest coming from outside her district, from industry groups and PACs. Of course, this fundraiser too is happening outside the 21st District, but McKibben argues that there is a real difference between this kind of organizing and the big money that shapes so much of American politics.  People at this gathering, he said were \"coming up with 50 or 100 bucks to try to help our neighbor's campaign 10 miles away across the lake.\" \"The other end of the spectrum is they gather fellow billionaires for a retreat,\" McKibben added. This grass-roots dynamic isn't new, and it can be effective.  In Pennsylvania a few weeks ago, Democrat Conor Lamb raised more than $3 million for his special election House victory, with much of that cash coming from small donors from across the country.  It was enough to help turn a House race that didn't look competitive into a real contest. That's what donors and activists in Vermont say they're trying to do. They want to expand the map and help put more Republican House seats in play.",

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen called a 200 percent spike in illegal border crossings in March compared with a year ago \"a dangerous story\" as she pressed lawmakers Wednesday to provide funding for President Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Nielsen appeared before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security to push for approval of the Trump administration's $47.5 billion FY 2019 budget request for her department, which includes $18 billion for the border wall. She said the number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border was up over 800 percent in March 2018 compared with 2017, and the number of families apprehended increased more than 680 percent. While the increases are dramatic, they are also not unexpected. The number of illegal border crossings has traditionally increased in the spring, and the total for March of this year remains below peak levels, according to Customs and Border Protection. Nielsen said that while the numbers \"are at times higher or lower than in years past, it makes little difference.\" She called the latest count of illegal crossings unacceptable and said \"we must do more to secure our borders against threats and illegal entry, and close dangerous loopholes that are making our country vulnerable.\" Nielsen was questioned by lawmakers on several issues relating to her sprawling agency. On DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program President Trump allowed to expire that allows qualified immigrants brought here illegally as children to get a work permit and remain in the country \u2014 Nielsen said the administration has been reaching out to congressional leaders to restart talks aimed at renewing the program through legislation. \"We would like to get this done,\" she said of DACA. \"We should get this done. We need to get this done.\" Citing court rulings that have blocked the administration from halting the program, Nielsen said people who are currently registered as part of DACA should not be worried about their status within the immigration system, given court proceedings and the need to negotiate with Congress. Additionally, she said she had taken the step to ensure that those who have an application in to become part of the DACA program will not be an enforcement priority and \"will not be deported,\" provided they have not been convicted of any crimes nor pose a national security threat. On the issue of election security, Nielsen says the proposed FY 2019 budget would also allow DHS to support state and local officials \"in defending the integrity of our election systems.\" She called that task the \"very heart of our democracy\" and said all Americans have the right to know that their vote is \"counted and counted correctly.\" She said DHS has \"done a tremendous amount\" working with state and local government and pulling resources from the security of other sectors to assist states with securing their elections systems, a concern given Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the upcoming midterm elections.",

            "article_content": "Hungary's right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban could be heading to a third term after elections on Sunday, unless the fractured opposition can unite against him.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Hungarians are voting on Sunday. National elections will determine whether Prime Minister Viktor Orban gets a third term to pursue his campaigns against migrants and against what's known as civil society - you know, journalists, activists, people outside his control. Opinion polls show the prime minister to be ahead, although not by the margin that Hungarian voters gave his party during the last election. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in a small Hungarian town which recently sent a message of sorts to the prime minister. And, Soraya, what's this town? SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: This town is called Hodmezovasarhely, and that translates to beaver field marketplace. And what's significant here is that the town is a - very much a Fidesz stronghold. Fidesz, of course, is the party that Viktor Orban is in charge of. And what happened was that the mayoral candidate of Fidesz lost to an independent candidate in February. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. So we have a sort of preliminary election in a way or a local election, and the party in power lost. How'd that happen? NELSON: Well, the opposition parties here did something that's pretty unusual for Hungary. They agreed to not field their own candidates and instead unite behind a conservative independent by the name of Peter Marki-Zay. PETER MARKI-ZAY: People are actually fed up with corruption and intimidation. Everybody in Hungary, including my town specifically, just imagine that if somebody is working for the municipality or any state institutions, then they could be threatened with losing their job if they put a like to my - an opposition candidate's Facebook page. NELSON: But this kind of cooperation that we saw here in this town is rare because the Hungarian opposition is just too fractured across the country. Plus, there's the other issue of Orban and Fidesz controlling most of Hungarian media, which means that if you're an opposition candidate, you're not going to get on air or in the papers. In fact, only five minutes was allotted to each opposition candidate during this whole campaign season and, frankly, during the whole four years. INSKEEP: Just to remind you, we've got a democratic country that's becoming less and less democratic. There are still elections, but everything else about democracy seems to be under threat. And then there are migrants, who, of course, have come into Europe in great numbers and have come through Hungary in some numbers. What role has that played in the election? NELSON: Well, if you listen to Viktor Orban, you'd think that this was a - the greatest threat facing Europe that will bring with it colonization and terrorism basically. But there is one thing that we should note here, and that is that only two migrants are getting in through the controlled border crossings at the moment each day, people who are seeking asylum. So he's playing... INSKEEP: Can I just stop you there, Soraya? NELSON: Yeah, sure. INSKEEP: Did you say two - two migrants per day? NELSON: Yes. INSKEEP: OK. NELSON: Yes, I discovered this on a recent reporting trip, which was just astounding. But even so, xenophobia plays well here in Hungary. This is a problem across Central Europe at the moment. And Viktor Orban has added a new layer by making the American billionaire - Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros sort of the vehicle for which these migrants are coming. Basically, Orban accuses him of - and his - the NGOs that his organizations have helped fund of being - like trying to basically overthrow Hungary and his government. INSKEEP: OK. And just a sentence or so. What if Orban should win? NELSON: Well, then it's pretty clear that the attacks on democratic institutions that he and his government have been carrying out will continue. His spokesman confirmed that they're going to clamp down on NGOs as they've been doing. INSKEEP: Soraya, thanks as always. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson.

More information is out about Facebook's handling of its user data.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump has ordered the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, the president yesterday directed the Department of Defense and also the Department of Homeland Security to work with border state governors to come up with a plan here. The administration is not providing many details, but they did emphasize that they think extra security is needed to stop immigrants from entering the country illegally. And it is worth saying here that last year, arrests for illegal border crossings were actually at their lowest level since 1971. MARTIN: All right, let's bring in NPR's John Burnett, who's been covering immigration for a long time at the border. He joins us from member station KRTS in Marfa, Texas. Hey, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So this is something other presidents have done - right? - deployed the National Guard to the border when the situation's really urgent. But just as David pointed out, and as you have reported before, border crossings - illegal border crossings and those arrests are actually down. So what's the urgency? BURNETT: Well, Trump said the troops are needed on the border until more of the wall can be built. Yesterday, his homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, gave this explanation in a briefing to reporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: We continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity, transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration flow across our border. This threatens not only the safety of our communities and children, but also our very rule of law. BURNETT: The administration has been really frustrated. The so-called Trump effect is wearing off. Remember, right after he came into office, immigrants were afraid to come, and apprehensions, which are a rough measure of illegal crossings, dropped sharply. Trump bragged at the time that he'd finally gotten the border under control, and now the numbers are creeping back up, not necessarily among Mexican men who cross the border to find work, but among family groups and even children traveling alone that are coming up from Central America. They say they're fleeing... MARTIN: So numbers are rising a little bit, at least. BURNETT: They absolutely are. And they say they're fleeing murderous gangs, and they've taken - that they have taken over these neighborhoods in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The administration says that they're using pretexts to ask for asylum, that they're actually scamming the system. MARTIN: What have you heard from people on the border? BURNETT: Well, you know, today, fewer people are being apprehended than in the last 47 years. They're far lower than when George Bush or Barack Obama called out the National Guard to the border when they were presidents. But that being said, the Border Patrol - the agents tell me that the crossers are more emboldened than in the - in the last few months. They - because the Trump effect is wearing off, they're seeing these large groups of women with children, of unaccompanied kids. And both of them get special treatment under the law. The Border Patrol calls it catch and release. Under the law, they detain the immigrants for a while. Then they have to release them until they wait for their day in immigration court. And the administration says they want to change the laws, speed up the deportation process and narrow the door to asylum. But, of course, this is the law. They can present themselves at the border, and they can ask for asylum. MARTIN: Right. All right, so based on the other times that this has happened, what do we expect the deployment to look like? BURNETT: Well, if the past is a guide, the previous Guard deployments cost the federal government well over a billion dollars. Soldiers were used for surveillance. They put them in towers with night vision goggles. They assisted in narcotics interdictions. They helped process undocumented crossers and allowed the Border Patrol to get back to the line. MARTIN: Right. BURNETT: And what the National Guard cannot do is arrest people who cross the border illegally. That's the job of federal immigration agents. MARTIN: OK. NPR's John Burnett for us. Thanks so much John. BURNETT: You bet, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, it looks like the firm Cambridge Analytica took data from more Facebook users than we previously thought. GREENE: More as in 87 million. That is how many people may have had their information compromised here. Facebook says malicious actors took advantage of the platform's search tools to get their hands on this data. Now, if Cambridge Analytica, this data analytics firm contracted by President Trump's 2016 campaign, held this much information, it just really is a lot more than first reported. MARTIN: Right. And now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to testify before Congress. Here he is in a conference call with reporters yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ZUCKERBERG: It's clear now that we didn't do enough. We didn't focus enough on preventing abuse and thinking through how people could use these tools to do harm as well. And that goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, hate speech in addition to developers and data privacy. MARTIN: All right, I am joined now by David Ingram. He's a tech correspondent for Reuters. So David, Zuckerberg spoke to reporters yesterday on that conference call, as we just heard. He's saying, hey, we're sorry; we didn't focus enough on this abuse. What else did you learn from that call? DAVID INGRAM: Well, one of the main interesting things here is that Facebook has stepped up how much they're engaging with the media. So this call yesterday that Zuckerberg had with hundreds of reporters is something that's very unusual for the company. And he answered a wide range of questions, saying that he thought he was still the right person to lead Facebook, and he talked... MARTIN: Because people had questioned whether or not that was true? INGRAM: That's true, yeah. I mean, he has been - he was the founder of Facebook. He's been in charge of it since the beginning. And the question is lingering about whether, given all of the scandals that have consumed Facebook over the last year, year and a half, he is really the best person to lead the company. MARTIN: So they are trying to be more transparent, sounds like. But what concrete steps are they taking, if any, to actually secure this data? INGRAM: So a few things. And let's be clear that once data leaves a company as happened here, it's really difficult, according to experts, for - if not impossible for it to be recovered. So this data went to Cambridge Analytica in 2014, 2015, and it is probably going to be difficult or impossible for Facebook to track down where that is now. But they are cracking down on third-party app developers and the data that they have access to now. So the rules were much more lax at Facebook from 2010 to 2015. They're tightening up those rules now. MARTIN: In part because of pressure in Europe, right? For all the users over there, the privacy rules are stricter. INGRAM: That's a big part of it. There's a big, new privacy law that is taking effect in Europe next month that is prompting Facebook to change the way it does business all over the world. And it's going to be much more pro-consumer. MARTIN: What is Mark Zuckerberg going to say that will satisfy lawmakers on Capitol Hill who want a lot of answers right now? INGRAM: Well, I think we're going to hear lots of different perspectives from lawmakers next week. There are going to be members of Congress who push for a European-style privacy law in the United States. I think there are also going to be lawmakers who are going to be very skeptical of any kind of regulation like that, that they might trust the companies to regulate themselves. But I think there'll be a general sense that Facebook has become so enormous and there's been so little oversight that there needs to be accountability from somewhere. MARTIN: And lawmakers want - right. And they want to figure out what that looks like. Reuters' David Ingram. We reached him on Skype. David, thank you so much. INGRAM: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. Yet another member of President Trump's Cabinet is forced to defend himself against allegations that he broke ethics rules. GREENE: Yeah. This time, we're talking about Scott Pruitt. He's heading - he's the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. He's facing a lot of scrutiny about a condo he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist. He was paying $50 a night, which is a pretty good deal, especially in the nation's capital. And just the optics, from an ethics standpoint, do not look good here. Pruitt went on Fox News last night to explain himself. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) SCOTT PRUITT: It was like an Airbnb situation. When I was not there, the landlord, they had access to the entirety of the facility. When I was there, I only had access to a room. There were common areas. They used the facility at the same time that I was there. So this was... ED HENRY: So you only paid for the nights you rent that you were there. PRUITT: That's exactly right. HENRY: So - but that's kind of a sweetheart deal because, like, your house... PRUITT: No, it's not. MARTIN: All right, we're joined by NPR's Domenico Montanaro on this. So Domenico, the rub here is that this condo is owned - at least, in part - by an energy lobbyist. And is there some kind of suggestion that Pruitt may have greenlighted some kind of deal that would've benefited her? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, look, this lobbyist had some business before the EPA, first of all. But second of all, it's just the appearance of the fact that he's getting this cut-rate deal. And it's not the only controversy, you know? There's a series of controversy from significant pay raises given to two of his political appointees that are close to him - that the White House, by the way, Rachel, rejected, and then it was done anyway. He says he didn't know about that and that it was done without his knowledge. And there's news overnight that the EPA's ethics chief now says he did not have all the information on the details of Pruitt's lease on that apartment rental before ethics officials' review was released last month. That review seemed to clear Pruitt of wrongdoing but now looks like it's going to be opened back up. MARTIN: But the White House says it still supports him, right? MONTANARO: Eh, kind of. MARTIN: Kind of? (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: What's going on? MONTANARO: I mean, if you define support as not fired yet... MARTIN: OK, well... MONTANARO: ...Then yes, because... MARTIN: For now. MONTANARO: Yesterday, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, was asked about this and said that the president is not happy with the behavior of Pruitt, that the president's not OK with it, that we're reviewing the situation, and we've had a chance to have a deeper - when we've had a chance to take a deeper dive on it, we'll let you know the outcome. Now, Rachel, if your boss said that, you know, she's not sure if she has confidence in you and they're reviewing the situation, that's a problem. MARTIN: Right. And just to take a step back, I mean, there's been turmoil at many of these agencies. I mean, there have been several Cabinet secretaries who've been embroiled in these ethics violations. It affects the people who are doing the work, I imagine. MONTANARO: Absolutely, undermining the missions at a lot of these agencies from the EPA to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, HUD, and on and on. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Domenico Montanaro for us this morning. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF PHILANTHROPE'S \"FLOAT\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The House passed the $1.3 trillion spending bill despite concerns from fiscal conservatives. Updated at 12:55 a.m. ET Friday The Senate voted early Friday to pass a roughly $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through Sept. 3. The move avoided a government shutdown. The massive spending package easily passed in both the House and the Senate. The Senate vote was 65-32. The House approved it hours earlier 256-167. President Trump is expected to sign the measure. The Senate's vote wrapped up what may be the last major legislative achievement ahead of the midterm elections in November. But the 2,232-page spending bill remained mired in controversy after leaders rushed the measure through rounds of speedy votes. Well here it is, all 2,232 budget-busting pages. The House already started votes on it. The Senate is expected to soon. No one has read it. Congress is broken... pic.twitter.com/izvJlUEgUM The massive spending measure includes significant boosts to U.S. military spending supported by the president and congressional Republicans, while Democrats secured boosts to domestic spending that most Republicans oppose. Congressional leaders celebrated the legislation publicly while they worked behind the scenes to persuade skeptics to back the legislation. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined other Republicans in highlighting the military spending increases. \"With the biggest increase in defense funding in 15 years,\" Ryan said in a statement Wednesday. \"This critical legislation begins to reverse the damage of the last decade and allows us to create a 21st-century fighting force.\" He is working to tamp down anger among conservatives over spending increases as well as changes to gun policy. Among their chief concerns, the legislation would usher in a period of trillion-dollar deficits at a time when Republicans have complete control of the federal government. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said Wednesday that they plan to oppose the bill over those concerns. \"That is not in any way close what the election was about, close to what we campaigned on,\" said Ohio Republican Jim Jordan. \"Not close to what we told the American people we were going to accomplish if they gave us the privilege to serve and be in power.\" Democrats are facing a separate set of frustrations from the left flank of their party. Many immigration advocates are angry that the legislation includes $1.6 billion in border security money without corresponding protections for immigrants currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., focused instead on spending increases for domestic programs. \"Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included,\" Schumer said. \"From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first.\" The agreement is loaded with dozens of unrelated policies, known as \"riders,\" ranging from gun control to election security aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal. Adding riders is a common \u2014 if sometimes controversial \u2014 practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill. The fight over border security and immigration became a major drag on negotiations in recent weeks with both sides refusing to negotiate. The White House initially wanted $25 billion, but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent. The final $1.6 billion agreement would fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. The bill also includes nearly $700 million for election security, including additional money for the FBI to conduct counter-intelligence to fight Russian cyberattacks. States would benefit from an infusion of money for election technology grants to keep elections systems safe. Negotiators included several bipartisan items, like $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high-speed broadband development. But what isn't included is nearly as significant as what made it in the bill. The spending measure is widely expected to be one of the last must-pass bills to come up for a vote this year, meaning immigration has few opportunities for consideration in the coming months. Looming midterm election and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any major legislation before Election Day. Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration. Many immigration advocates worry that DACA cannot pass if it is not included in a broader bipartisan bill. Republicans also struck down a push to include subsidy payments that would help shore up the individual market places under the Affordable Care Act and partially subsidize premiums for some low-income workers.",

Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., campaigns for re-election in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District at a commuter train station back in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Kersey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., campaigns for re-election in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District at a commuter train station back in 2008. Updated at 2:25 p.m. ET Wednesday Incumbents on both sides of the aisle prevailed in their contested races, as Tuesday's Illinois primaries set the stage for competitive House and gubernatorial races this fall that could be key to Democratic comeback efforts in 2018. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner only narrowly eked out a primary victory over a conservative challenger. Still, Rauner is probably the most endangered GOP gubernatorial incumbent in the country. This fall he'll face billionaire venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker, who easily won the Democratic nomination for governor. Centrist Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski narrowly beat progressive activist Marie Newman in the 3rd District. That contest became a proxy war for the discordant wings of the Democratic Party. And in several targeted House races, national Democrats look like they will land their preferred candidates, with EMILY's List having a mixed night in races. As Democrats eye the 23 seats they need to take back the House, there are several districts in Illinois that could be essential paths to that goal, and Democrats got good news in some of those districts Tuesday night. Overall, the primaries also further showcased an enthusiasm gap between Democratic and Republican voters. Not only were more Democratic candidates on the ballot than Republicans, and Democratic hopefuls raked in more in small-dollar donations, but Democratic primary turnout also swamped the GOP vote. Though, there was a competitive gubernatorial race on the Democratic side as well. Here's a rundown of key takeaways from Illinois on Tuesday: Could Illinois be the Democrats' path to the majority? There are four GOP House seats in Illinois that could be in play come November. Democrats have seen a surge in fundraising and in candidates running across the state so far \u2014 just some of the potential signs that could portend a blue wave. National Democrats avoided electoral disasters in all their targeted races as well. Loading... The Cook Political Report rates the contests against Rep. Peter Roskam in the 6th Congressional District and Mike Bost in the southwest Illinois 12th Congressional District as toss-ups. Roskam's suburban Chicago district is one of 23 Republican districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 and this could be his toughest race since winning the seat in 2006. Scientist and clean energy advocate Sean Casten edged past financial adviser Kelly Mazeski, who was endorsed by EMILY's List, to claim the Democratic nomination. The next best target for Democrats is Bost's southwest district along the Missouri border. St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, who Democrats had wooed to jump in for several cycles, easily won the nomination Tuesday night. Trump won downstate areas like Bost's district and Rep. Rodney Davis' central Illinois district by appealing to white, working-class voters there, but Democrats believe these areas have soured on the president and they could have a shot at these seats. Davis' 13th Congressional District is rated \"likely\" Republican by Cook, and he'll face Illinois senior Sen. Dick Durbin's former fundraiser Betsy Dirksen Londrigan in the fall. Londrigan got about 45 percent of the vote in the five-way Democratic primary. The 14th Congressional District, represented by GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren, which is rated likely Republican by Cook, could become a contest as well, though it's still a reach. Former Health and Human Services official Lauren Underwood defeated engineer Matt Brolley for the Democratic nomination. Looking ahead to what could come in the Fall, Democrats are putting the GOP on the defensive by running more candidates, including in safe GOP territory. They are also getting the lion's share of small-dollar donations to House candidates this year, a sign of voter enthusiasm. Loading... Illinois 3rd District: Lipinski hangs on Seven-term Rep. Dan Lipinski has never been a typical Democrat \u2014 he opposed the Affordable Care Act, has voted with President Trump on some immigration measures and is anti-abortion rights. Until now, the former political science professor breezed through to re-election in this southwest Chicago district he essentially inherited after his father, Bill Lipinski, retired from Congress in 2004. Lipinski managed to narrowly survive a tough scare from progressive activist Marie Newman, likely helped across the finish line by his family name, union support and help from some typically conservative groups. Newman had the backing of two Illinois incumbent members \u2014 Reps. Jan Schakowsky and Luis Gutierrez. Newman also had support from major liberal groups, such as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice, EMILY's List, MoveOn.org and the Human Rights Campaign. Democrat Marie Newman speaks with supporters at a campaign event in La Grange, Ill.\n                \n                    \n                    Sara Burnett/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Marie Newman speaks with supporters at a campaign event in La Grange, Ill. Lipinski, a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, declined to endorse former President Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign, and former top Obama aides such as David Axelrod also weighed in for Newman. But Lipinski still had the backing of some top labor groups, and Democratic House leaders, including House Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, all stood behind the incumbent. Meanwhile, some conservative and middle-of-the-road groups helped Lipinski. The anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List, which usually supports Republicans, sent in canvassers, while the bipartisan group No Labels  funded a superPAC to help him. This will be a safe Democratic seat in November. Republicans have their own headache on the ballot \u2014 the only GOP candidate who filed to run is a white supremacist and former leader of the American Nazi Party. Illinois governor: Rauner escapes while Pritzker rolls Gov. Bruce Rauner, R-Ill., speaks to members of the media in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after a hearing earlier this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gov. Bruce Rauner will arguably be the most endangered GOP governor this fall, and his slim primary win underscored that he has major problems within the Republican base. Rauner faced a stiff challenge from state Rep. Jeanne Ives, a staunch conservative who received favorable coverage from Breitbart News. With nearly all the votes counted, the AP declared Rauner the winner, though he defeated Ives by just over three points. Ives hit the incumbent as being too liberal, particularly on abortion after he signed a bill last fall to expand abortion coverage for women on Medicaid. Rauner, the wealthy former venture capitalist, spent over $50 million of his own money already. He had been figured to win comfortably, but there are reports of concern among Republicans in Illinois that the race could end up closer than expected. As Politico noted, he's tried to woo different factions, first in the primary and then looking ahead to the general, which has caused him some headaches. The governor vetoed a gun store licensing bill. That could help him win over conservatives, but will surely come back to haunt him in November's election. The Democratic Governors Association, seeing Ives as the weaker candidate, also tried to meddle in the primary, running ads calling the challenger \"too conservative\" but then listing off her anti-abortion and pro-gun credentials in hopes of motivating her supporters to go to the polls. Polling has shown Rauner's approval ratings are even lower than President Trump's in the state, and last year the conservative National Review called him the \"worst Republican governor in America.\" He also came under fire for how he handled a Legionnaires' disease outbreak at veterans facility in the state that killed 13 people. Billionaire J.B. Pritzker spent over $70 million of his own money to secure the Democratic nomination, which was a new primary record \u2014 and the pricey gambit paid off. With about 36 percent of precincts reporting, the Associated Press called the race for Pritzker, who led with 44 percent of the vote. Businessman Chris Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, was getting 27 percent, while state Sen. Daniel Biss, who tried to claim the progressive mantle in the race, was netting 25 percent. Pritzker's family founded the Hyatt hotel chain and he's the brother of former Obama Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. Top Democrats rallied around his campaign, with both Illinois Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin endorsing him, along with major labor groups. But Pritzker has come under fire over his family's use of offshore accounts to reportedly avoid taxes, and he's only released the first two pages of his personal returns. Pritzker also had to apologize after wiretaps of a 2008 conversation he had with disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich revealed he made disparaging remarks about African-American politicians as they weighed who to appoint to finish the Senate term of Obama once he was elected president. Those are just some of the issues his rivals seized upon in the primary, which are sure to become general election topics as well. In fact, Rauner has already run ads against Pritzker hitting him over his comments to Blagojevich. Democrats running for Illinois governor from left, billionaire J.B. Pritzker, businessman Chris Kennedy, and state Sen. Daniel Biss take their podium positions before a televised forum in January.\n                \n                    \n                    John J.

Luis Gutierrez in this majority Latino district. The AP called the race for Garcia, who was taking over two-thirds of the vote. Nonprofit executive Sol Flores, who was backed by EMILY's List, was a distant second, with Chicago police officer Richard Gonzalez in third. Garcia was endorsed by Gutierrez and also benefited from plenty of name identification after unsuccessfully challenging Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2015. He was eyeing another bid next year, but after Gutierrez made his announcement, Garcia shifted his focus to Congress instead. He claimed the progressive mantle in the race, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held a rally last month on his behalf. Garcia will be the favorite in this solidly Democratic district this fall.",

The sign says, \"Strong president \u2014 Strong Russia.\" As Vladimir Putin won a fourth term on Sunday, reports have surfaced of election observers being harassed and intimidated that day and in the days leading up to the vote. More than 1,300 foreigners reportedly served as election monitors in the presidential election, which took place on March 18 and yielded a predicted win for Putin. Many observers came from places and political backgrounds that are friendly to the Russian government in an attempt \"to create an international stamp of approval for the vote,\" reported The Guardian. Sputnik, a Kremlin-backed news outlet, reported that observers judged the election to be \"fair and transparent.\" But numerous independent media outlets found observers who said they saw violations. A month before Russia's presidential election, observer David Kankiya was informed by the police that his car might have been used to commit a crime, Reuters reported. He was detained, charged with disobeying police and sent to jail for five days. \"I was detained and charged on a false pretext,\" Kankiya told the news agency. \"It's political pressure.\" Police say Kankiya didn't produce identification during a routine check. As the presidential election drew closer, Kankiya's car tires were slashed and pro-Kremlin journalists accosted him in two separate incidents, he told Reuters. Kankiya is a coordinator at Golos, a nongovernmental election watchdog that was labeled a \"foreign agent\" because it received foreign aid. Volunteers from Golos \u2014 a word that translates to both \"vote\" and \"voice\" \u2014 say when entering or leaving Russia, they are often stopped by border staff who accuse them of having terrorist links, according to Reuters. Before the election, a Golos representative told The Guardian that police ripped up a contract to lease office space. The location was supposed to be a call center to receive reports of election violations. The representative said that police officers threatened the landlord of the building: \"You shouldn't hold this event here or you'll have trouble.\" The Russian government denied involvement. Police also attempted to stop activist observers from visiting polling stations, The Guardian reported. The officers raided headquarters of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who was banned from the election, and they tried to seize documents that would give observers access to polling locations. On the day of the election, indications that some observers were targeted cropped up. \"Spoke to more observers who got beaten up by a mobile gang of toughs at polling stations,\" tweeted Financial Times Moscow correspondent Max Seddon. He described some of the election observers who were harmed: Zukhrab Omarov, 28, an election observer in Dagestan, tried to complain about the sudden appearance of 40 goons at his polling station, whom he suspected were part of a \u201ccarousel.\u201d They dragged him outside in full view of the cops and beat him up pic.twitter.com/1obWCSMpIn Marat Ismailov, the Dagestan election observer, is finally out after the cops tried to arrest him for stopping ballot stuffing and some goons showed up to beat him up. He says while this was going on the polling station workers cranked up turnout from 30% to 55% pic.twitter.com/iU8xNZkyCK By the end of the day, Golos said it had registered more than 1,500 violations. There were ballot boxes that had papers in them before polls officially opened and video footage of ballot boxes being stuffed, according to Golos. There were also reports that concerned the treatment of observers, including denying them access to polling stations, restricting them from taking photos and videos, limiting their ability to move around premises and removing them from polling stations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which requested 420 short-term observers to monitor polling stations, voting, ballot counts and results, will issue a final report of the entire electoral process in about eight weeks. At a conference in Moscow on Monday, an OSCE election monitor described the presidential election as \"overly controlled.\" \"Where the legal framework restricts many fundamental freedoms and the outcome is not in doubt, elections almost lose their purpose,\" said Michael Georg Link, director of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights who led OSCE observers.",

The controversial move to take Crimea became a proud event for some voters who handed Vladimir Putin a broad election win, timed for the same date as the anniversary.\n                \n                    \n                    Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People attend a rally and a concert celebrating the fourth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea at Manezhnaya Square in Moscow on Sunday. The controversial move to take Crimea became a proud event for some voters who handed Vladimir Putin a broad election win, timed for the same date as the anniversary. Vladimir Putin won a fourth term as Russia's president on Sunday in a vote designed to be more of a referendum on his 18 years in power than a competitive election. According to official results as of Monday morning, Putin swept up almost 77 percent of the vote, with Communist candidate Pavel Grudinin trailing in a distant second with less than 12 percent. None of the other six pre-approved candidates rose above the single digits. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running after organizing nationwide anti-government protests, had called for a boycott of the election and vigorous vote monitoring to uncover any irregularities. But in a country dominated by state media that have helped generate a loyal following, the Putin juggernaut plowed over any obstacles, including accusations of ballot stuffing and other violations. \"Putin is great. We trust and love him. There aren't any other candidates as of yet,\" said Roza Yarulina, 64, a retired economics teacher who was voting at a polling station in a vocational school in Yekaterinburg, 900 miles east of Moscow, on the geographical border between Europe and Asia. As a former Communist Party member, Yarulina said she cast her ballot for Grudinin because she was sure Putin would win and wanted to support her second choice.

Tatyana Ovchinnikova, 65, a retired college instructor dressed in a fur coat, said she respected the incumbent but was voting for Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who ended up with 1 percent of the vote. \"I've had a dream since I was a kid to put a check mark next to a candidate's name, but it hasn't come true,\" said first-time voter Grigory Dementyanov, who intentionally spoiled his ballot so someone else couldn't fill it out. The 21-year-old music student said he opposed all the candidates, and that he didn't think Navalny would have been up to the task of leading Russia. Like other large Russian cities, Yekaterinburg, with a population of 1.4 million, is more supportive of opposition candidates. But in multiple interviews across the country, voters voiced a combination of anxiety and frustration over the lack alternatives to Putin. After garnering a record election win with more than 55 million votes in his fourth presidential run, Putin, 65, now has a strong mandate to rule Russia for another six years. For many Russians, the predictability of Putin's reign is preferable to new political upheavals. \"We Russians just don't want things to get any worse. You Americans always expect things to get better,\" said Anton Volkhin, 36, a distributor in Yekaterinburg for a national sausage company and the father of two. \"Too many people have too much to lose.

In a country that has experienced a revolution, civil war, slave labor camps, a Nazi invasion and the collapse of an empire all within the past century, many Russians express relief that at least war hasn't reached their territory. Putin's military intervention in Ukraine is widely seen by Russians as a defensive move against encroachment by the United States, while Russia's 2 \u00bd-year participation in Syria's civil war barely registers with ordinary people. \"Honestly, I'm afraid, very afraid, that war will break out,\" said Yelena Okhotenko, 36, who serves in the Russian military. \"There's constantly this aggression toward us, and we're constantly holding back. I don't know how long our country can hold out.\" The mother of two children, Okhotenko said she has been supporting Putin since she first could vote, in 2000. \"This president did very much for Russia and my town and personally for me and my family,\" she said, standing on the refurbished embankment in the city Nizhny Tagil. \"He raised up our country, and he raised our quality of life.\" Niznhy Tagil, a two-hour drive north of Yekaterinburg, has been nicknamed \"Putingrad\" for the president's visits to the city's giant tank factory. \"You can't talk about Putin's level of support, but the level of fear,\" said Pavel Sergienya, 35, the founder of an independent trade union. \"People are afraid to openly express their opinion except in their kitchens, just like in the Soviet Union.\" Andrei Antropov is an exception. The 36-year-old volunteer for opposition leader Navalny was called in by the police three days before the election for a \"conversation\" with criminal investigators. \"I can't rule out that there will be consequences for me at work, but I'm going to continue my activism,\" said Antropov, a manager for a telecommunications company. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny holds a briefing on the presidential election at his office in Moscow on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Maxim Zmeyev/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny holds a briefing on the presidential election at his office in Moscow on Sunday. Navalny, who spent a year building a nationwide network of campaign offices and volunteers before his candidacy was denied, focused on domestic issues such as economic stagnation and government corruption. Putin, on the other hand, highlighted Russia's return to the world stage as an independent actor that could stand up to U.S. hegemony. \"Strange as it may seem, in Russia economic problems don't convert well into political decisions,\" said Dmitry Kolezev, 33, the deputy editor of Yekaterinburg's independent news site znak.com. \"People will tighten their belts, but they won't hold the Russian government responsible for their problems as much as, say, the United States, which imposed sanctions on Russia.\" The U.S. and European Union hit Russia with economic sanctions for annexing Crimea and backing an armed uprising in Ukraine's Donbas region in 2014. That year marked the start of a downward spiral in relations between Russia and the West. In the week before the presidential election, those tensions increased. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after accusing Moscow of being behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russians suspected of being behind election interference and cyberattacks. Far from hurting Putin, the news added to the Kremlin's narrative that Western countries are unfairly targeting Russia for unproven transgressions. In the runup to the vote, Putin played up his decisiveness in seizing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, and the election date was scheduled to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the annexation. Given that many Russians vacation in Crimea or have family there, the association was supposed to evoke a sense of pride and defiance. \"I'm voting for Putin for the first time in my life. Russia is the kind of country that always rallies around its leader in tough times,\" said Dmitry Ardanov, 41, an office security guard in Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. \"Putin did one important thing, and after that I understood he's a real man: He took back Crimea and supported Donbas.\" A recent poll by the independent Levada Center shows 86 percent of Russians support the annexation of Crimea, and opposition figures such as Navalny turned off voters by questioning the legitimacy of the controversial separatist referendum, which was held after Russian troops had occupied the peninsula. What unites Putin's most ardent supporters and vociferous foes is uncertainty over what comes next. \"We're in a situation where there aren't any worthy alternatives, so all that's left is the hope that Putin can accomplish something in domestic politics,\" said Rim Averyanov, 27. He quit his job as a school teacher in the provincial town of Vladimir because of his low salary and is going into the private sector in Moscow. Averyanov, who opposes Putin, said he's afraid a new revolution could break out if the Kremlin fails to address pressing economic issues that are impoverishing the population. But like many government critics, Averyanov said he doesn't view Navalny as a leader tough enough to take on Russia's myriad problems. Even before preliminary election results were in Sunday evening, Navalny appeared on his YouTube channel debating Ksenia Sobchak, a pro-Western candidate who picked up less than 2 percent of the vote. Navalny rejected her offer to join forces, calling her a Kremlin tool and a \"champion of hypocrisy\" for participating in the elections. Squabbles inside Russia's fractured opposition hardly raise their profile as a viable alternative to Putin. Sofia Kastilo, a 28-year-old English teacher in Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow, called Navalny and Sobchak \"clowns.\" Kastilo said she didn't believe that Navalny, who has built his popularity as an anti-corruption campaigner, could uproot graft. \"Speaking about corruption: well it existed, it exists, and it will exist,\" Kastilo said. \"If Navalny becomes president, where is the guarantee that there won't be any corruption? There is no guarantee.\" Like many Russians, Kastilo voiced concern about who will come after Putin when his fourth term comes to an end in 2024. According to Russia's constitution, no president can serve more than two consecutive terms. Asked after his victory if he wants to change the law, Putin said he had no such plans \u2014 yet.",

            "article_content": "For the first time since he was elected, President Trump is visiting California to review progress on border wall prototypes, address service personnel at a Marine base and attend a fundraiser in the Los Angeles area.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump is in California today, where he visited prototypes for his border wall with Mexico. He also met with immigration enforcement officers and criticized California's immigration policies and the state's governor, Jerry Brown. This was the first time Trump visited California as president. The last president to wait this long to visit the state was Franklin Roosevelt. NPR's Nathan Rott has been following President Trump's trip and joins us now. Hi, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: President Trump spent about an hour at the border looking at prototypes for the border wall. What'd you learn from his visit there? ROTT: Well, Trump has said that he's wanted to look at those eight towering prototypes that have been built down there to choose which one makes the most sense. As far as we can tell he didn't pick a winner. He did say that some looked more effective than others. But I think the real takeaway from his visit there wasn't so much about the wall but the bigger debate over immigration that it's come to represent. Trump took the opportunity to bash sanctuary cities and California efforts to shield people who are in the country illegally. Let's listen to a little tape of that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: California's sanctuary policies put the entire nation at risk. They're the best friend of the criminal. That's what exactly is happening. The criminals take refuge in these sanctuary cities. ROTT: He echoed that at a later rally at a Marine base in San Diego in front of a hangar full of uniformed troops. SHAPIRO: We were expecting rallies from both critics and supporters of President Trump's immigration policies. What was the reception like today? ROTT: Well, the reception here at the military base was very warm, as you might imagine. It was even a little bit raucous. There was a lot of cheering as the president praised troops and promised to deliver more money and resources to the armed forces. The president's reception outside of here was mixed, as you might expect. There were protests against the border wall and the president's visit here today. His motorcade passed a few protesters on its way to the border while holding signs saying, no wall, no hate, no Trump. There were also supporters of Trump gathered to wave flags and cheer him on, so to speak. Here's Jeff Schwilk at a rally for President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF SCHWILK: We want that border secured. (CHEERING) SCHWILK: We are getting really close to having President Trump's wall (inaudible) really close. This is the next step. He's inspecting them. They will choose one. Let's get the contract out and let's get some wall up. SHAPIRO: So how close is he to getting some wall up? ROTT: Well, that's the $18-some billion question. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). ROTT: There's no real clear timeframe for construction still. Funding for the wall has stalled in Congress. And there are other environmental and political challenge the president still has to navigate, including getting cities like San Diego, which has formally moved to denounce the wall, on board. SHAPIRO: It seems like California has opposed President Trump on nearly every major issue. Is this visit going to affect that dynamic in any way? ROTT: I'd say that's a strong no. California Governor Jerry Brown definitely took a less combative tone yesterday, saying he wanted to build bridges, not walls during the president's visit. But Trump lashed out at Brown today, saying the Democrat is managing the state terribly. He's raising taxes, driving people away. So, yeah, I don't think it's going to - it doesn't equate to being an olive branch by any stretch of the imagination. SHAPIRO: And President Trump is also attending a fundraiser in Beverly Hills for his re-election campaign. We're not even in the midterms yet. Tell us about this event. ROTT: So it's a private event. I'm not sure who's going to be on the guest list. I do know that it's an expensive dinner at a minimum of $35,000 per plate. The Republican Party is helping to organize the event, and it should be pretty well-attended. I know California is a blue state, but there are a lot of wealthy conservative pockets here, and Trump has had success raising money here before. Remember; he owns a house in Beverly Hills. So he could always posit it as helping out a neighbor. SHAPIRO: NPR's Nathan Rott covering President Trump's first visit to California. Thanks, Nate. ROTT: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Updated at 2:56 p.m. ET President Trump is holding a campaign rally outside of Pittsburgh on Saturday night to boost Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone, who has been struggling to lock up a special election in a district Trump won by nearly 20 points in the 2016 election. Republicans have poured millions of dollars into Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, a House district on the western edge of the state that borders West Virginia, in an attempt to ensure this bit of Trump country doesn't slip away in a special election Tuesday. Their investment comes despite the fact that the district as currently drawn will cease to exist by this November because of a gerrymandering case that requires the state's districts be redrawn. In addition to Trump, who previously visited the region in January and gave Saccone a shoutout, the White House has also sent Vice President Mike Pence, first daughter Ivanka Trump and top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway to help him. It's all a sign of how concerned Republicans are about a potential loss that could give Republicans a demoralizing loss in a midterm election season already full of Democratic enthusiasm. Saccone, a Pennsylvania state representative, will face former federal prosecutor Conor Lamb, the Democratic nominee, in a special election March 13 to replace former Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican, who resigned in October because of a sex scandal. Hours before Saturday's rally, the president said on Twitter that Saccone is \"a really good person.\" Trump added: \"Rick will help me a lot. Also, tough on crime & border. Loves 2nd A & VETS.\" Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress. Big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). Rick will help me a lot. Also, tough on crime & border. Loves 2nd A & VETS Although Trump won the district by huge margins, and Murphy convincingly won re-election multiple times, most recent polls suggest the Lamb-Saccone race is nearly tied. The Cook Political Report rates the contest as a \"toss up.\" And analysts say even a closer-than-expected loss for Lamb in a district so heavily tilted toward Trump could symbolically translate into a win for Democrats \u2014 evidence that with the right candidate and the right message they can make inroads into Trump country. \"A win or a narrow loss here, either way, should really strike fear in the hearts of pretty much every Republican,\" said a Democratic party operative familiar with the race, \"because there are a hundred districts that are structurally more advantageous than this one.\" But Republicans reject the idea that this race is somehow indicative of broader political trends. Instead, they insist this race is unique because of the specific candidates running. \"Democrats fielded a candidate who's willing to run as a watered-down version of a typical Republican,\" said one GOP operative familiar with the race, pointing to Lamb's support for gun rights. But, it's also about Lamb's style and charisma, Republicans say. Lamb, a 33-year-old telegenic veteran of the Marine Corps is a stark contrast to the 60-year-old Saccone with a graying mustache. \"Lamb is a candidate who has a background, really, out of central casting \u2014 military service, prosecutor, young, energetic,\" said Mike DeVanney, a GOP consultant based in Pittsburgh. Republicans say Democrats are benefiting from an \"A+ candidate,\" whereas they have a lackluster option, who's struggled to raise money. Loading... \"Candidate quality and quality campaigns matter,\" said Courtney Alexander, a spokeswoman with the Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP superPAC close to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that has invested $3.5 million into the race. The PAC has two field offices in western Pennsylvania and 50 people on the ground, knocking on doors on behalf of Saccone, an enormous investment for a single House race. Short on campaign cash, Saccone has relied almost entirely on outside groups like CLF and the national party desperate to keep the House seat red. In contrast, Lamb has raised over $3 million directly and has largely operated without the support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which some operatives admit could have been a liability for him. Supporters cheer for Conor Lamb, Democratic congressional candidate for Pennsylvania's 18th District, at a rally at the United Steelworkers Building, March 9, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters cheer for Conor Lamb, Democratic congressional candidate for Pennsylvania's 18th District, at a rally at the United Steelworkers Building, March 9, 2018, in Pittsburgh. \"One thing Conor Lamb has done is appeal to moderate voters while maintaining enthusiasm among the Democratic base,\" said Mike Mukis, a Democratic consultant from the 18th District. Lamb is running as a Democrat who is keen to separate himself from Democrats in Washington. In fact, in a recent TV ad, he explicitly sent that message about his differences with the top Democrat in the House. \"I've already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don't support Nancy Pelosi,\" Lamb says in the ad. \"The real issues are the ones that affect your lives.\" The other major factor in this race is the role of labor unions. There are over 80,000 union members in the district, according to the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Former Rep. Murphy had courted and supported union voters during his time in office. In the last election, the local AFL-CIO endorsed him for re-election. This time around, the organization is supporting Lamb, and not just because it sees him as a union supporter, but because Saccone is seen as an anti-union politician. \"We have eight years of Saccone's record in the statehouse,\" said Rick Bloomingdale, president of Pennsylvania's AFL-CIO. \"He's consistently voted against fair pensions... workers' rights and workers' comp. \" The local AFL-CIO is calling members and going door-to-door to ensure they vote for Lamb on Tuesday. \"I think the one thing that has put this race in play is that it is a heavily unionized district,\" said Mukis. \"And if Lamb is able to win this race, it's partly gonna be because labor unions organized and turned their members out who voted overwhelmingly for him.\" \"He reminds me of my son Beau\" Democratic congressional candidate Conor Lamb listens as former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a rally on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 in Pittsburgh.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic congressional candidate Conor Lamb listens as former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a rally on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 in Pittsburgh. Although Lamb has tried to localize his campaign message and set himself apart from national Democrats, there's one high-profile politician whose support he's specifically enlisted \u2014 native Pennsylvanian Joe Biden, who came to the district this week to stump for him. And while campaigning for him, the former vice president paid Lamb the ultimate compliment: \"He reminds me of my son Beau,\" Biden said, referring to his eldest son who died of brain cancer in 2015. \"He believes in hard work, he believes in labor,\" Biden said, referring to Lamb's working-class credentials. Lamb is walking a tightrope in a district where the president remains popular. He's trying to appeal to moderates, and he's publicly backed the idea of steel and aluminum tariffs, which the president formally ordered on Thursday. In some ways, Lamb is trying to run independent of the president, rather than as a referendum on him, and it seems to be resonating. \"When you look at just money raised, volunteer efforts that have been put forth, the Democrats are running the most energized campaign that I've ever seen in this seat in near history,\" said DeVanney, who worked as a consultant for former Rep. Murphy. As for Saccone, GOP operatives say his strategy is to appeal directly to Trump's base. \"The president and his policies are popular in PA-18,\" said Alexander. \"And I would think it's certainly helpful that he's coming up this weekend.\" And if this race is as close as people are predicting, a little boost from the president could make the difference, and, Republicans hope, prevent a political embarrassment heading into the midterms.",

Updated at 1:45 a.m. ET Wednesday Texans cast their votes in primaries Tuesday, the first contests of the 2018 election cycle. Democrats turned out in numbers not seen in more than a decade \u2014 with outcomes in various races bringing about both history and controversy \u2014 though far more Republican voters showed up at the polls across the deep red state. Driven by anti-President Trump fervor, there were plenty of positive signs for a once-latent Democratic Party in Texas. Early vote turnout for the minority party over the past two weeks had surpassed GOP totals \u2014 and even bested their own 2016 numbers. Democrats fielded a record number of candidates in all 36 congressional districts, and there's the potential to flip maybe three or more seats come November. By the early hours of Wednesday, Democratic vote totals neared 1 million, nearly doubling totals from 2014 and reaching a level not seen in a midterm primary for the party since 2002. Republican vote totals exceeded 1.4 million, a modest increase from 2014, nearing a midterm record for the Texas GOP as well. Tuesday's totals do not bring the end of the primaries in Texas, with several races headed for runoffs \u2014 including several Democratic races where the party establishment is being frustrated by progressives and political newcomers. In a race in the Houston suburbs, national Democrats tried to push a progressive candidate out of the race. Now, the backlash to that move will make the runoff later this spring a high-profile skirmish within the party, in the type of vulnerable GOP district where Democrats are hoping to find their path to a House majority this November. The state's U.S. Senate race is now set, with incumbent GOP Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke easily winning their primaries. Cruz still has the edge for re-election, but O'Rourke has been mounting a surprisingly strong campaign and gaining attention. Cruz rallied about 85 percent of the Republican vote, while O'Rourke received just over 60 percent of the Democratic vote. A lesser known Democratic candidate, Sema Hernandez, surprised some Texas political observers by leading the front-runner in some border counties. Cruz quickly released a radio ad attempting to define O'Rourke as too liberal for Texas -- in a country jingle. \"Beto wants those open borders, and wants to take our guns,\" says one line. While O'Rourke has been drawing crowds and small donors, recent polling shows that a plurality of Texans don't know much about him. Successful fundraising can help the Democrat define himself, but Cruz is wasting no time. There are eight open House seats in Texas this year \u2014 six held by retiring Republicans and two by Democrats who also are retiring. In both Democratic districts, candidates cleared the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff. Sylvia Garcia in the 29th Congressional District in Houston and Veronica Escobar in the 16th Congressional District in El Paso are poised to become the first Latinas to represent Texas in Congress. Escobar is running in the safe Democratic district to replace O'Rourke, as he runs for Senate. The majority of the open seats will stay in the same party's hands. In nearly all of the GOP districts, nominees will not be known in those crowded races until May 22. In five of the six open Republican districts, no candidates were topping 50 percent to avoid a runoff in two months. Loading... The same is true in what will be some of the most watched races this fall \u2014 Democratic challenges to GOP Reps. John Culberson, Pete Sessions and Will Hurd \u2014 in the three congressional districts held by Republicans but won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Those Democratic primaries all appeared poised to go to runoffs on May 22 as well. Loading... A political scion with a familiar name overcame a primary challenge on Tuesday \u2014 yet another George Bush, this one George P., son of none other than Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate. Despite Jeb Bush's feuds with President Trump, Trump endorsed George P. Bush for re-election for land commissioner. The Associated Press projected that Bush would defeat a former land commissioner who wanted the job back. Heat turns up on establishment Democrats Enthusiasm on Democrats' side yielded a record number of 111 candidates, competing in all 36 congressional districts for the first time in 25 years. But that cuts another way \u2014 some of those crowded primaries turned particularly nasty in the final stretch, highlighting a Democratic divide between centrists and progressives. The outcomes of these primaries could have consequences for flipping crucial races come November. There's possibly no more intriguing race to watch than the Democratic primary in the 7th District for the right to face Culberson, a Republican who represents the Houston suburbs. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee caused controversy by wading into the race a little more than a week ago against progressive activist Laura Moser. The committee, responsible for trying to elect Democratic House members nationwide, cited derisive comments she had made about a more rural part of the state when she was a writer living in Washington, D.C. That was before she moved home to run for Congress. (The committee also cited other controversial language she has used in her writing.) The DCCC's decision to use opposition research against Moser drew backlash from many progressive groups, and even Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said it was an action he wouldn't have taken. The DCCC's maneuvers \u2014 the very embodiment of \"the establishment\" that many voters hate \u2014 may have had the opposite of the intended effect and appear to be propelling Moser into the May runoff, facing off against attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, who is backed by EMILY's List. The DCCC would prefer Fletcher over Moser, thinking the chance to oust Culberson in a rapidly changing district might be lost if she is the candidate. Because of the controversy over the DCCC's involvement, the May runoff will now become a focus of the split between establishment Democrats and the progressive wing of the party. Other Democratic hopefuls to watch The other two Clinton-won districts \u2014 Sessions' suburban Dallas 32nd District and Hurd's expansive 23rd District, which runs along the Mexican border from El Paso to San Antonio \u2014 both had primaries of note, too. The Texas Tribune's Abby Livingston writes that in the 32nd District, it's former State Department official and ex-Clinton staffer Ed Meier who has raised the most money and was expected to secure a spot in the May runoff. He could be joined by Brett Shipp, a former journalist who has name recognition in the area; former Obama official Lillian Salerno; or former NFL player Colin Allred, who also served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Obama. With more than half the vote in, Allred had 40 percent of the vote. Shipp and Salerno were jockeying for the second-place slot to proceed to the May runoff against Allred. In the five-way race to take on Hurd, former intelligence officer Gina Ortiz Jones appeared to secure a place in the runoff. Former Obama agriculture appointee Judy Canales and former high school teacher Rick Trevi\u00f1o, who has tried to seize the progressive mantle, were jockeying for the second runoff slot with about two-thirds of the vote in. Former federal prosecutor Jay Hulings, who had the backing of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and his brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, was running fourth. Open seat chaos The House seats open because of retirements are all likely to stay in their current party's hands, but there is some rising interest in the race to replace retiring Republican Rep. Lamar Smith in the San Antonio and Austin suburbs. There was a massive 18-way primary happening in the 21st District, and if a far-right candidate wins the nod, Democrats are hopeful they can compete for it in the general election. They are encouraged by some generic-ballot polling. For Republicans, former Ted Cruz chief of staff Chip Roy was leading the pack but will face a runoff. On the Democratic side, tech entrepreneur Joseph Kopser was seen as the front-runner. He raised the most money and got the endorsement of House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. With nearly all the vote counted, however, Kopser was being edged out by political novice Mary Street Wilson, a pastor and former math instructor. They appear headed for a runoff in May. The Bush factor As member station KUT's Ben Philpott reported, the last Bush currently holding office in the country \u2014 George P. Bush, the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush \u2014 faced a primary challenge in his race to remain the Texas land commissioner. The Associated Press projected that Bush won his primary, overcoming some resistance within the GOP, just over two years after his father, Jeb Bush, succumbed to the challenge from Trump. Bush celebrated the results with supporters \u2014 including his father. For the younger Bush, after winning election in 2014, the \"realities of holding office began to sink in,\" Philpott writes. \"There are questions about how well his office has handled Hurricane Harvey relief. He's also received bad press over his handling of the Alamo. You know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. Those issues brought criticism from some in the party, and motivated Bush's predecessor, former land commissioner Jerry Patterson, to challenge him in the GOP primary. Patterson had left the office in 2014 in a failed attempt to run for lieutenant governor.\" To help him this time around and, in the end, avoid a runoff with Patterson, Bush turned to the man who vanquished his father \u2014 and he got it. Last week the president tweeted his support, writing, \"Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.\"",

Early voting in Texas ran through last Friday, March 2. Updated on March 5 at 7:13 p.m. ET The 2018 primary elections kick off this week, and Democrats are already seeing reasons to be excited deep in the red, beating heart of Texas. The Lone Star State holds the nation's first primary on Tuesday, and in the 11 days of early voting Democrats reached record levels in a midterm year. They surpassed GOP early voting turnout this year and their own party's numbers during the same period in 2016, a presidential election year where voting numbers are typically much higher, and more than doubled their turnout from the last midterm election in 2014. Loading... The rising Democratic enthusiasm mirrors what the party has already seen across the country in the nearly year and a half since President Trump was elected \u2014 more than three dozen state legislature seats changing hands, important wins in Virginia and New Jersey last year and mobilization through rallies and protests. Texas's primary brings the first actual voting in the 2018 midterm cycle, giving both parties a chance for a more concrete measure ahead of November's elections. Early signs of such a swell in a bulwark red state could be an even more ominous sign for Republicans nationally this fall if it's borne out by Tuesday's results. \"Texas is the nation's bellwether right now,\" said Tariq Thowfeek, the communications director for the Texas Democratic Party. \"It's a good gauge of the incredible progressive energy we have across the country in a state that is ranked at the bottom of the barrel in voter turnout.\" The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman found that in the top 15 counties in the state, the Democratic early vote had spiked 105 percent over 2014 numbers. On the Republican side, there had been only a 15 percent uptick. A surge in Democrats on the ballot It's not just an uptick in Democratic voters happening in Texas, but an increase in candidates putting their names on the ballot, too. Democrats are fielding a modern-day record number of candidates across the state. There are 111 U.S. House candidates running for the minority party, and they are spread across all 36 Texas congressional districts \u2014 the first time that's happened in 25 years, and a departure from two years ago when Democrats didn't run candidates in eight seats. On a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year. That includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012. Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said that the Democratic surge is even more impressive given that it's usually GOP voters, not Democrats, who have been reliable in non-presidential years. \"It's one word \u2014 enthusiasm. In a midterm election like this, what you normally expect to see is the Republicans' primary turnout might be twice what the Democratic turnout is, so to have the Democrats even with, and even slightly ahead, of Republicans in this midterm election is really extraordinary,\" Jillson said. Key suburban swing districts are likely to determine control of the House in 2018. There are several GOP-held districts like that which could be at play in Texas, such as Rep. Pete Sessions's suburban Dallas seat and Rep. John Culberson's suburban Houston district, which, along with Rep. Will Hurd's expansive border district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso, all voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. Loading... \"Going into this year, there was an expectation following the Women's March, in the wake of the elections in New Jersey and Virginia and all these special elections that something similar was likely to happen in the first-in-the-nation Texas primary, and I think it has,\" SMU's Jillson said. \"It signals a Democratic electorate that is motivated to make a statement against Donald Trump, and that motivation is nowhere more powerful than in female voters.\" There's been a downside to the Democrats' surge of candidates in some places, however. In the primary to face Culberson, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently lobbed attacks against one candidate they didn't feel would be a strong challenger given past derisive comments about places in the state. That move prompted a backlash from some progressive groups and criticism from the head of the Democratic National Committee. Matt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist and director of the Lone Star Project, said the sheer number of candidates was still a positive thing for Democrats in a state where they've had trouble recruiting in the past, and noted that other primaries have been more civil. Those are encouraging signs, he said, for the way the state is trending politically. \"Make no mistake \u2014 it's a tough lift in Texas. It's a state still that is a right of center state, but I'm very encouraged,\" Angle said. \"The excitement being generated now among candidates will not only build, it will consolidate.\" Backlash to Trump President Trump under-performed past GOP presidential nominees in the state, carrying it in 2016 by only single digits, and a Gallup poll released at the end of January showed that the president's approval rating in Texas had dropped below 40 percent. While Trump's approval among Republican base voters remains strong, that dissatisfaction with the president is certainly driving Democratic turnout and convincing more disaffected voters to turn blue, Angle argued. For example, that has helped Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his upstart campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke still remains an underdog, he's been drawing large crowds and has even outraised Cruz recently with the help of small-dollar donors. \"In Texas, I think what you do have a chance to do is build a really strong coalition of Democrats, independents and fair-minded Republicans who are disillusioned with the type of leadership they're getting,\" Angle said. Texas GOP strategist Derek Ryan pointed out that Democrats do have some major statewide primaries, such as the gubernatorial race, that could be driving some turnout, but admitted that Democrats have done a good job of recruiting candidates across the board, thus making those competitive races more appealing to some voters. Ryan also acknowledged that the rise in Democratic enthusiasm is worrisome for Republicans \u2014 especially because Democrats have gotten many low propensity voters to the polls. He's been diving into the early voting data, and his analysis found that many of those primary voters are ones that voted in 2016 \u2014 but haven't had a proclivity to vote yet in a midterm year when turnout typically drops off. And nearly a quarter of Democrats who cast early ballots were new voters who just registered in the past two years. On the GOP side, Ryan found that first-time primary voters only made up about 11 percent of the early vote share, which is a dip from the 2014 midterm primaries. However, on the Democratic side, first time primary voters comprise over nearly a quarter of the early vote \u2014 way up from the 14 percent four years ago. \"While I don't think that Texas is going to turn blue this cycle, I do think with these turnout numbers, it could have a significant impact in some races, and some leaning Republican races in November,\" Ryan said. Matt Mackowiak, another Republican strategist in the state and chairman of the Travis County GOP, argued that the true test of Democratic enthusiasm will be on Tuesday night. He pointed out that early voting numbers also looked strong for Clinton back in 2016, but that was her high watermark and Election Day voting couldn't match Republican totals. \"For Republicans, if this is evidence of a significant enthusiasm gap, then that would be something to worry about,\" Mackowiak said. \"I'm not sure that it is yet, and just because you have stronger turnout in the primary doesn't mean it translates into Election Day vote in November.\" But he admitted that the early numbers should give Republicans some pause and they certainly don't hold any good news if the trend continues on Tuesday. \"There's no way to look at this as positive for Republicans \u2014 it's either inconsequential, or it's bad,\" Mackowiak said.",

Less than two years after Donald Trump won a western Pennsylvania congressional district by double digits, a special election race between a young Democrat and a deeply conservative Republican is now closer than either side had expected. The congressional race is being run in Pennsylvania's 18th district, but the March 13 election is expected to offer clues about how voters will turn out in the November midterms. Rick Saccone, the Republican, and Conor Lamb, his Democratic opponent are vying for a seat that opened in October when eight-term Congressman Tim Murphy resigned following a personal scandal. As NPR's Two-Way blog reported, Murphy allegedly asked a woman with whom he had an extramarital affair to get an abortion. Murphy's old district stretches from the mostly liberal suburbs of Pittsburgh, south into conservative, rural areas that are dominated by the energy industry. For more than a decade, Murphy maintained support from across the district, but while this is a regional race, polarized national politics loom large and the two campaigns are using very different strategies to woo voters. \"This race has national implications,\" says Terry Madonna, a political scientist in Pennsylvania. \"Can Lamb eat into the margins that Murphy won in the past, and of course, the margin that President Trump carried?\" That question is especially important to Republicans. A loss in this district would not only be deeply embarrassing for the party, but might show an erosion of support among voters who supported Trump in 2016. Canonsburg, just south of Pittsburgh, is one of the areas where Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are fighting for votes.\n                \n                    \n                    Cheryl Diaz Meyer for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Canonsburg, just south of Pittsburgh, is one of the areas where Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are fighting for votes.

Rick Saccone took the mic and prompted the crowd with a question: \"Is this Trump Country?\" The answer: loud cheers and applause. That's good news for Saccone because, as he told WESA in November, he was, \"Trump before Trump was Trump.\" It is a comment meant to underscore his conservative bona fides \u2014 Saccone spent his tenure in the Pennsylvania state legislature, pushing an agenda that was conservative even by conservative standards. He tried to get public schools to teach the Bible and wanted to make gun owners a protected class against discrimination. Now, Saccone is promising voters he will go to Washington, D.C. to support the president's agenda \u2013 rolling back government regulations, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting taxes. \"He's getting beat up, he's getting some resistance,\" Saccone said of President Trump, \"He needs some wingmen down there to help him.\" The White House and the Republican Party have pulled out all the stops for the Saccone campaign: The president and vice president have both visited the area. This past week, at that country club fundraiser, Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta was on hand to stump for the president \u2013 and for Saccone. The gist of his message: ignore the media and look at the stock market. \"I'd ask all of you when you go home tonight, check your retirement accounts,\" Acosta told the crowd. \"That is not a theoretical increase, that is real money.\" Meanwhile, the Republican Party machine and billionaire Joe Ricketts have poured millions of their own money into the race, filling local airwaves with ads attacking Conor Lamb. The Saccone camp seems to be banking on this strategy, take all the help he can get from big donors and politicians, and constantly reminding constituents that a vote for Saccone is a vote for President Trump's agenda.

One TV spot plays off the opponent's last name: \"His name is Conor Lamb but in Washington, he'd be one of Nancy Pelosi's sheep.\" It is a charge the Lamb campaign takes seriously, and part of their strategy is to keep this race local. While Saccone is eager to tie himself to the president, Lamb is just as quick to distance himself from national Democratic leadership, which is unpopular with many voters here. He isn't taking money from corporate PACs and wants voters to know that he's a \"Pennsylvania Democrat.\" That means appealing to blue-collar workers in the union-heavy state and walking a fine line on sensitive issues like gun control and abortion. Lamb is Catholic and pro-life, but says that is a personal view, not a political stance. \"I'm running for Congress, not cardinal,\" Lamb said. \"So I support a woman's right to choose because that's the law of the land, and I will defend and uphold that.\" If Lamb harnesses the energy of President Trump's critics, while managing not to alienate conservative Democrats, he could be the first Democrat in 15 years to win this seat. 1 of 4 The voters Dave Ball is the vice chairman of the Washington County Republican party, but he knows that parties only mean so much in this part of Pennsylvania. \"I think that people here are probably more willing than in a lot of places to vote their conscience,\" Ball said, pointing to relatively low numbers of straight-party ballots. \"It's an independent place.\" But working class voters will likely not be deciding the outcome of this election, says Terry Madonna who runs the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College. Those voters generally support the president and Rick Saccone. Madonna predicts Lamb's path to an upset boils down to one question: \"Does he pick up white, college-educated women?\" Women like 70-year old Kyle Tomer, who lives in Lamb's hometown of Mt. Lebanon. She's voted Republican for much of her life, but is supporting Lamb in this election and thinks there is excitement around his campaign. \"I think our grassroots around here are pretty effective,\" said Tomer. \"People that haven't been interested in politics, especially women \u2014 I see them organizing.\" The importance of this race to the national political landscape is reflected in the juggernauts who are coming to the area before the election: There's Pennsylvania-native Joe Biden, one of the few national democrats whose blue-collar appeal could help a democrat running in a conservative-leaning district. And on the other side, President Trump will hold a rally in the area before the vote on March 13.",

Durbin was in the mix on multiple bipartisan deals in recent months, as the clock ticked toward a March 5 expiration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Trump decided in September 2017 to end. But with Congress still gridlocked on DACA and the Supreme Court refusing to intervene in two federal cases negating that deadline, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat seems to be throwing in the towel. \"This election, the election of new members to the House and Senate, will decide the fate of this issue,\" Durbin told NPR's All Things Considered on Wednesday. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court rejected a Trump administration request that it take up DACA. Two lower courts have blocked the government from ending the DACA program. With the cases likely to take months, if not more than a year, to possibly make their way back to the highest court, DACA will remain in place for the extended future. Until the lower courts had blocked DACA's expiration, Congress had been working to make DACA permanent by the March 5 deadline. While the program itself enjoys broad support among Democrats and Republicans, Trump and GOP leaders had insisted that any measure making it permanent also include money for a border wall, as well as restrictions on future legal immigration. Two weeks ago, multiple immigration measures were brought to the Senate floor for votes, but all failed to earn the 60 votes needed to stay alive. Two narrow measures came close, but President Trump tanked their chances by threatening to veto any immigration measure that did not include his legal immigration demands. Trump's preferred measure got less support than anything else the Senate voted on that week. \"We learned something during the course of this [debate], and it was unsettling,\" Durbin told NPR. \"We learned what the president's real priorities were. The president said, 'Let's help these young people. We need to do something to fix DACA.' And yet given that opportunity, he rejected it. It turns out this debate wasn't about a wall, it was about a new immigration policy in America; it was about rejecting the notion that we are a nation of immigrants.\" Durbin was one of the lawmakers in the Oval Office when Trump used vulgar language to refer to African countries during a meeting about a bipartisan DACA fix. Anger over that statement \u2014 and over Trump's refusal to consider a narrow DACA bill \u2014 led to a brief partial federal government shutdown, when Democrats voted down a short-term spending bill. \"Who knew when we got into Trump presidency that we would reach a point where Sen. McConnell would feel compelled to bring this matter to the floor and give us a week's time,\" Durbin said of the promise the majority leader made to Democrats to end the stalemate. \"We managed to reach that point and so we had our chance \u2014 we came close but not close enough to win.\"",

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., speaks at the 2018 California Democrats State Convention on Saturday in San Diego. Updated at 1:10 p.m. ET A version of this story was originally posted by member station KQED. Before U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein could finish her speech at the California Democratic Party convention Saturday, the music began playing to indicate she had used her allotted time. She kept talking. The music got louder. \"I guess my time is up,\" Feinstein conceded as what sounded like a 1940s movie score continued playing. Without missing a beat, supporters of her opponent, state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n echoed her statement in a chant: \"Your time is up! Your time is up!\" \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to Feinstein's 25 years in the U.S. Senate. It was a sign of things to come. The grass-roots Democratic activists gathered at the party's annual convention in San Diego this weekend implicitly rebuked the state's senior U.S. senator by denying her the party's endorsement for her re-election bid. Feinstein finished far behind de Le\u00f3n, the top Democrat in the state Senate. De Le\u00f3n received 54 percent of delegates' votes to just 37 percent for Feinstein. It takes 60 percent to receive an endorsement. While the lack of an endorsement certainly won't keep Feinstein off the ballot, it's a sign that grass-roots Democrats are eager to supplant leaders who are seen as too moderate and willing to compromise. Democratic Party activists have never really been Feinstein's people. In 1990, when she was running for governor, she came to the party convention and expressed her support for the death penalty, eliciting boos from the liberal crowd. She lost the party endorsement to John Van de Kamp but got the nomination anyway, ultimately losing the November election to Pete Wilson. Feinstein has always been a little to the right of where the party's activists are. Now, at age 84 and in her final campaign, Feinstein is once again at odds with progressives, despite her efforts to move left by more strongly opposing President Trump's agenda. She said the Senate Appropriations Committee, which she sits on, would never approve $25 billion for Trump's wall along the Mexico border. But minutes later, de Le\u00f3n's team sent texts noting that Feinstein had just voted for exactly that as part of the \"Common Sense Coalition\" immigration plan that failed to get through the Senate. The bill would not only have provided a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, but it also included $25 billion for the wall. Feinstein also reminded the crowd of her longstanding leadership on gun control, including her success against long odds at getting an assault weapons ban signed into law in 1994. In his speech to the convention, de Le\u00f3n reminded the crowd that his opponent hasn't always been a reliable liberal. \"Democrats, you'll never have to guess where I stand,\" de Le\u00f3n said before noting that he has championed issues such as raising the minimum wage, single-payer health care and the environment. \"Moral clarity is always doing the right thing when no one is watching,\" he said. \"And it should never take a primary challenge to stand up for California values.\" As leader of the state Senate, De Le\u00f3n has had his own problems of late, most notably criticism of his slow response to the sexual harassment scandal in Sacramento. And while an endorsement from the Democratic Party would have provided a boost, his campaign is also overshadowed by Feinstein's huge advantages in name recognition and campaign cash. A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California had her leading de Le\u00f3n by 46 percent to 17 percent. Despite the boost for De Le\u008f\u00f3n, the vote is in some ways a loss for him. Democratic campaign strategist Katie Merrill says he needed the endorsement much more than Feinstein. \"He was such a narrow path to the Senate, and he had to have this Democratic Party endorsement,\" she said. \"This was the one strategic thing he need to accomplish here and he did not accomplish it.\"",

For a company that's all about the future of communication, Facebook is looking to the past to solve at least some of its problems. After months of intense scrutiny over the role the company played in the 2016 presidential election, the social network giant announced it wants to use postcards to verify the identity of advertising buyers to prevent future foreign meddling. In advance of November's midterm elections, anyone interested in buying political ads for a specific candidate will receive a physical piece of correspondence along with a special code to confirm that they really do live in the U.S. \"If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States,\" Katie Harbath, Facebook's director of global politics and government outreach, said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State. Only after entering that code into Facebook can a person or organization purchase an ad. Federal election laws prohibit foreign nationals from contributing or donating money to any state or national races. \"It won't solve everything,\" Harbath told Reuters following her remarks at the meeting, where executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google also spoke. The old system simply required an email address and a fee in exchange for influence on the website. Investigations have found Russian agents bought political advertisements on the site to create political discord and spread \"fake news.\" The company's plan was announced a day after special counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian entities with interfering in the 2016 election by stealing social security numbers and other information to buy online ads. The Associate Press reports, \"Facebook has uncovered about 3,000 Russian-linked ads on the site and Instagram bought before and after the November 2016 election that it says may have been seen by as many as 150 million users.\" Mueller's indictments described how Russian agents also set up fake pages with names such as \"Secured Borders,\" \"Blacktivist\" and \"United Muslims of America\" \u2014 each of which gained hundreds of thousands of followers \u2014 to pit American against American. As NPR's Phillip Ewing reported, at least three Russian operatives physically traveled to the United States to do reconnaissance for their active measures campaign, according to the indictment: \"Russian operatives also bought space on computer servers within the United States. That enabled them to connect from their headquarters in St. Petersburg and, using a virtual private network, post on Facebook and Twitter while appearing to be inside the United States. \" Facebook officials did not say how the company would stop foreign agents from setting up fraudulent mailing addresses or hiring people in the U.S. to check them.",

            "article_content": "New Yorker writer Jonathan Blitzer says President Trump uses the notorious gang to paint a portrait of rampant criminality among immigrants \u2014 and to frame the broader immigration debate.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably heard President Trump say terrifying things about the predominantly Salvadoran gang MS-13 and how it's terrorizing people in some communities in the U.S. Here's the president six months after taking office, speaking at Suffolk County Community College on Long Island. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Since January 16 - think of this - MS-13 gang members have brutally murdered 17 beautiful young lives in this area - on Long Island alone. Think of it. They butchered those little girls. They kidnap. They extort. They rape and they rob. They prey on children. They shouldn't be here. They stomp on their victims. They beat them with clubs. They slash them with machetes, and they stab them with knives. They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into blood-stained killing fields. They're animals. GROSS: In Trump's State of the Union address, he said that many MS-13 gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors. That led into his description of his plan to overhaul the immigration system. My guest Jonathan Blitzer writes that the president has become obsessed with MS-13 But he might actually be strengthening the gang by talking about how menacing it is. And the anti-immigration policies Trump's administration is putting into effect are hurting many of the same people who were targeted by MS-13. Blitzer is a staff writer for The New Yorker who covers immigration. We're going to talk about the history of MS-13, who the gang members are, who the victims are and where this gang fits in the current story of American immigration. We're also going to talk about the uncertain future of DACA and this week's Senate debate about overhauling the immigration system. Jonathan Blitzer, welcome to FRESH AIR. Do you know how MS-13 became such an obsession of Donald Trump's? JONATHAN BLITZER: It's an interesting question. I followed Donald Trump on Long Island during the Republican primaries in the spring of 2016. And you'd think that MS-13 would have been an issue for him then if he was so fixated on a gang. I mean, MS-13 has been on Long Island since the '90s. But all throughout the primary campaign and during all of these very dramatic public appearances that he made on Long Island to different towns, he never once mentioned MS-13 at the time. So the question of sort of when it burst onto his consciousness seems to have been with the murder of two girls in September of 2016. It kind of lined up all of Trump's favorite obsessions on the immigration issue. The girls were American citizens. They were sort of sympathetic teenagers. They were brutally, brutally killed. And it wasn't until after the election - there was kind of this very dramatic moment during an interview he gave with Time magazine as the Person of the Year when he was sitting at his desk in Trump Tower and kind of cut away and grabbed a copy of Newsday, the Long Island newspaper. And on the cover of Newsday was more information about this grisly set of murders. And that seems to be the moment when he embraced this issue, the issue of MS-13 violence as a major talking point that would define how he sort of framed the immigration debate from that point forward. GROSS: So how has he used MS-13 to frame the debate on immigration? BLITZER: I mean, MS-13, for him, solves all kinds of rhetorical problems. So first of all, he wants to portray immigrants nationwide as being criminals. And that's obviously empirically untrue. But also statistically, that's wildly inaccurate. Crime in immigrant communities tends to be much lower. Immigrants tend to be much more law abiding than citizens. And so he needs - in order to kind of drum up this menace of immigrant criminality, he needs to just find individual examples that are particularly bracing. And the murders at the hands of MS-13 members are really horrific acts. I mean, people are killed with baseball bats, bludgeoned with machetes. I mean, it really is nightmarish kind of stuff. And so that helps him, for one thing, paint this portrait of rampant criminality at the hands of immigrants; the need to crack down on immigrants generally as an issue of public safety. So MS-13 helps him frame questions about sanctuary cities, which is like a particular bete noire for him. He feels that sanctuary cities threaten to undermine the rule of law. They're an affront to the citizen population. It helps him shape the debate on DREAMers and recipients of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is kind of a big congressional issue now ever since Trump canceled the program in September of 2017. He often mentions the two in the same sentence as a way of trying to sell wholesale draconian overhauls of border security measures and interior enforcement measures. MS-13 is useful for him there. And it also allows him to continue to prop up officers at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, who for years have had a series of guidelines dictating how they do their jobs, who they go after for arrests. And he has systematically removed all of those guidelines. And by mentioning MS-13 and by mentioning the sort of public safety threat that's rampant across America, as he describes it, ICE agents and officers are meant to have more leeway in combating this threat. So it kind - it's sort of a useful - it's a useful talking point for him because it almost touches on every issue that he wants to press. GROSS: OK. So MS-13 is a great talking point for Donald Trump to serve his mission of cracking down on immigration. What is MS-13? It's described as a gang. But it's not like it's a street gang like the Crips or the Bloods. It's much larger than that. Like, what - who are they? What are they? BLITZER: Actually, it is more like the Bloods or the Crips than it is like, you know, Mexican cartels or Colombian cartels that have this transnational reach. The gang began in Los Angeles in the 1980s. And what led to the rise of the gang was that there was a massive civil war in El Salvador. The U.S. weighed in on the side of the military government at the time in El Salvador. A very brutal war - 75,000 civilians were killed. And there was a massive refugee crisis. I mean, close to a quarter of the population of El Salvador fled to the United States. And a lot of these people arrived in inner cities, particularly in Los Angeles on the West Coast. And they found themselves in a climate where there actually were rampant street gangs - black street gangs, Mexican street gangs - and these Salvadoran refugees were brutalized by them. And so they started to form groups of their own, essentially as a kind of self-defense. And with time, these groups grew more and more violent. They were thrown into prisons across the state. And in prison, their identity further coalesced. And eventually, in the mid-1990s, the U.S. started emptying prisons in California and deporting these gangsters en masse back to El Salvador. And this is... GROSS: And how... BLITZER: Yeah. GROSS: ...Did the gang change once these MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador? BLITZER: Well, for one thing, it took a local gang problem that was festering on the streets of Los Angeles, and it turned it into an international crisis. El Salvador, at the time, had been decimated by more than 12 years of civil war. The police force had essentially been dismantled. You had armed ex-guerrillas who were kind of ranging around parts of the country. And these guys start to arrive. They have money because a lot of them had been living in the U.S. They have a sense of style; they listen to rap music; they had a fashion - all of these things that were sort of hallmarks of Los Angeles gang culture at the time. And that culture quickly took root on the streets of El Salvador. And over time - over the next several years, it started to fan out across Central America - so Honduras, Guatemala - and increasingly made those countries very, very dangerous and led to separate refugee crises that were the result of people fleeing violence there. GROSS: So how did the nature of MS-13 change as it became international? BLITZER: I don't know that the character of the gang changed much. And this is a really interesting question about the gang's formation - and its current strength. MS-13 is often portrayed as a kind of transnational criminal organization, and that puts it in the company of Mexican drug cartels, Colombian drug cartels. MS-13 definitely doesn't have that kind of reach. In fact, they don't have that much sway over the drug trade for one thing. They don't do great international business. There was a study recently that looked at the revenues of MS-13 in El Salvador. So there are about 60,000 gang members in El Salvador, and there's no question that the country is sort of routed by this gang. But the gang itself, for the control that it exerts over that entire country, doesn't have revenue streams that are that striking. It's something like $30 million a year. I mean, you compare that to the cartels - the Mexican cartels that are trafficking in tens of billions of dollars a year - I mean, these are sort of small, kind of local territorial kind of mafias. GROSS: Do you know why MS-13's violence is often very gruesome, such as chopping up a body with a machete? BLITZER: I mean, I think dating back to its origins, I think it was a matter of proving their toughness, proving that they could hang with some very violent gangs that at the time were brutalizing Salvadoran refugees in Los Angeles. And I think it's mainly their - it's their strength as a recruitment tool. I mean, the more menacing and dangerous and scary they seem, the more they can pressure people to join its ranks. Recruitment often is a form of coercion. And so the more scared people are of the gang, the more likely they are to join it. And the more brutal its reputation, the more marginalized people whom the gang typically fixates on both to recruit and to victimize, tend to feel like, well, we have no really other choice other than to cooperate with these gang members. GROSS: Let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Blitzer, and he writes about immigration for The New Yorker. He's a staff writer there. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BOMBINO'S \"AZAMANE (MY BROTHERS UNITED)\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Blitzer, who writes about immigration for The New Yorker. He's a staff writer there. And we've been talking about the gang MS-13, which is one of Trump's big anti-immigration talking points. So you described how MS-13 got started in California, then when a lot of the members were deported back to El Salvador, it became more international. So why does Long Island have such a large - relatively large population of people in MS-13? BLITZER: Well, typically, the gang thrives in areas where there are large enclaves of Central Americans. And there are a lot of Salvadorans on Long Island. You know, it's a funny thing to talk about because in some senses, given how gruesome the violence is and given how much attention the gang is getting now, you'd think that we're talking about huge numbers of people who are involved. The numbers are relatively small when you really dig into them. I mean, in Suffolk County, for example, on Long Island - and this is the county that so obsesses Donald Trump - you're talking about roughly 400 suspected MS-13 members. And so that number is relatively low when you think about the fact that, you know, there are close to 60,000 Salvadorans on Long Island. One of the issues that's come up recently, and this adds a whole layer of complexity, is that over the years, as more and more Central American kids have fled the gangs in Central America, the U.S. has had a kind of refugee crisis. It's known as the unaccompanied minors crisis. And so a lot of these kids - we're talking about kids between the ages of 6 and 17 - have started showing up at the U.S. border seeking some form of asylum essentially. And between, you know, 2014 and the current moment, we're talking about, you know, over 150,000 kids. These are kids who came without their parents who are fleeing violence and trying to reunite with family members who are living in the U.S. And what the U.S. government does when these kids show up at the border is they briefly take them into detention. They do a kind of quick form of vetting, and then they place them with family members across the U.S. And this is where your question gets to kind of how the gang and certain immigrant enclaves kind of tend to come together. A lot of these kids have wound up on Long Island because they have family members there. And so between 2014 and now, there were something like 8,600 unaccompanied kids who were placed on Long Island. And while that's happening, gang violence in the area tends to sort of flare up because you have suddenly more victims, more people who are socially marginalized who have just arrived in towns they don't know. Their parents are working multiple jobs. They feel isolated. They feel scared. They don't speak the language. These are easy targets for the gang both as victims and as recruits. And again, it's complex because the people the gang targets as recruits are often coerced into joining. And so you kind of have all these different overlays now. And it makes it very, very hard to solve this problem when law enforcement and when the federal government use MS-13 as a way of portraying immigrant communities writ large as being crime ridden because the victims are stuck in these communities. And they end up being trapped between law enforcement on the one hand and the gangs that are victimizing them on the other. GROSS: So these are kids who feel they have to protect themselves from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and that they have to protect themselves from MS-13, so they're very vulnerable. BLITZER: You think about what these kids face every day. They go to schools where there's some gang members in their classes. They live on streets and in sort of small hamlets where gang members are their neighbors. Everywhere they look, gang members are part of their world. And, you know, they're trapped because, for example, if you look at what standards ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - uses to arrest someone suspected of gang activity that the standards are extremely nebulous. So we're talking about things like, OK, you were seen in the company of known gangsters. OK, well, if you go to school with someone like that, well, there you are. You're in the company of a known gangster. Oftentimes, clothes that kids wear are used against them as proof that they might be involved in the gangs. So certain kinds of clothes - for a time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, in conjunction with local police, were picking up kids who were wearing Chicago Bulls shirts and jerseys because, for a time, the gang - there was some crossover between gang members and that kind of garb because the horns on the Bulls insignia resembled the gang sign. But imagine showing up at a place not knowing better. The schools don't specify what clothes you can and can't wear. And then the next thing you know, you're wearing a shirt that somehow triggers the suspicion of immigration authorities and you end up in detention. So the standards are extremely low for what gets you on ICE's radar in these kinds of contexts. And oftentimes these are the victims of gang activity. And so they're scared to report crime because they're seeing that immigration authorities are kind of cracking down in general on the undocumented population. So they're scared to come forward. They're scared to share tips that they see. There are probably - people living in these communities alongside these gangsters probably have the best information of anyone as to how the gang is operating, but they're increasingly driven into the shadows by this indiscriminate policing that is the result of all of this political rhetoric and kind of this new fixation on cracking down on the gang. GROSS: So MS-13 is a gang that really is a menace. They really are dangerous. They really are putting other people at risk, most especially Salvadorans who are immigrants here legally or illegally. So what do you think are President Trump's biggest misrepresentations or exaggerations when he's using MS-13 as a talking point for his anti-immigration policies? BLITZER: I think there's a lot of slippage in his language between talking about gang members and talking about immigrants. And so I would say that's the first big misrepresentation, that the president is using MS-13 as a stand in for immigrants generally. And so when he talks about the gang, it is generally understood that he's talking about immigrants. And that obviously completely misrepresents the situation. GROSS: What else? BLITZER: I think that his description of how the gang operates misrepresents the actual structure of the gang and misrepresents the specific ways in which the gang is dangerous. What makes MS-13 so hard to deal with is the fact that it's extremely decentralized. It tends to operate in these kind of almost autonomous local cliques that follow their own directives, that have their own sort of mini leadership structure. And so the more the president acts as though this is a carefully coordinated and highly sophisticated international - transnational operation, I think the more - the law enforcement response tends to misplay the way in which this gang takes root in communities. So it would be a lot more useful, quite honestly, if law enforcement invested money and time in doing anti-gang outreach, improving counseling services at local schools, trying to provide avenues for people who are involved in the gang to transition out of the gang. You know, one thing, for example, that the president is so obsessed with - and this would be another answer to the question - is that the solution to solving the MS-13 problem if you were to believe Trump is you have to deport everyone. You cannot deport away this problem. In fact, deporting gang members in the first place is what created the problem. And second of all, there is a critical mass of MS-13 members in the U.S. who are citizens. And so the gang itself is never going to go away unless you try to address the root causes of it, unless you try to address why certain marginalized members of the community end up joining this gang. You're always going to have this threat. And this threat has existed since well before Trump came into power. And you can watch over the years as the violence has spiked and then kind of ebbed. And oftentimes it's been the quieter, longer-term enforcement strategies that tend to curb the gang's spread. But all of the president's hyperbole about the gang makes it worse. And I will also say that the more the president talks about how brutal and murderous the gang is - and the gang is brutal and the gang is murderous - but he is so obsessed with playing up the violence of the gang, the easier it is for the gang to recruit, the easier it is for the gang to intimidate people into joining or into being acquiescent.

He's written extensively about the predominantly-Salvadoran gang MS-13 which carries out gruesome acts of violence and tries to recruit teenagers who are undocumented. But Blitzer says President Trump, who often talks about MS-13 in his speeches, is using the gang as a stand-in for all immigrants, which misrepresents the situation. Blitzer has also been writing about DACA and the president's decision to terminate the program March 5 unless Congress passes legislation extending it. This week, the Senate has been debating overhauling the immigration system. So if DACA is extended or if DACA is totally cancelled, what impact would that have on MS-13? BLITZER: There is no relationship between DACA and MS-13. And that's, you know, that's another thing that the administration has done. And it's interesting. When the Trump administration canceled DACA in September of last year, the person who came out to make the announcement, it wasn't the president, who I think was too nervous about delivering a highly unpopular message because a lot of Americans are behind DACA recipients. And it wasn't the head of DHS - the Department of Homeland Security - which is the department in charge of administering DACA. It was Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, who represents the kind of ideological nerve center of the Trump administration on immigration. And one of the things that Jeff Sessions said was that we are canceling DACA because the program has lured people from Central America, these unaccompanied kids, to the U.S. because they see that there's a chance for them to get legalized through this program. Now, that is wrong. All of the studies, all of the evidence, every form of research on this subject makes the case pretty clearly that people are fleeing to the U.S. not because they're lured by something like DACA, which none of them have ever heard of, but because they're fleeing gangs. But you hear the administration's effort to link the two issues. They're trying because there's really no justification for ending DACA, certainly no justification that, you know, helps the public interest in any way. It's a program that benefits close to a million kids who have no criminal records at all, who have gone to school in the U.S., who have been living in the U.S. since they were small children. There is no connection whatsoever between DACA and MS-13. But the more the administration can kind of create this sort of general haziness over the issue of immigration writ large, I think the more they feel they have political capital to push off this DACA decision further. GROSS: This would be a good time to ask you to explain what DACA is and who it applies to. BLITZER: Sure. In 2012, President Obama issued an executive action creating this policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which is DACA. And there were roughly 1.8 million people who were eligible for this program. The idea was to protect people - immigrants - who were undocumented who came to the country as kids, who came illegally with their parents who were too young to have been kind of conscious of what the legal stakes of their entry into the U.S. were and who had made the U.S. their home ever since. And there were very strict eligibility requirements, basically, for how you qualified for DACA. So you couldn't have any sort of criminal record. You had to have either been in school or had graduated from high school. And then there were a series of more specific requirements about how old you were at the time of the program, when you came to the U.S., those kinds of things designed to really hone the population that this protected. And what DACA itself did was it gave its recipients what was called this kind of weird ad hoc legal status known as lawful presence. It established lawful presence for these people. And basically, what that meant was you can get work authorization so you can work legally. Now, that opens up all kinds of doors for people. That means they can qualify for bank loans. That means they can take out mortgages. For kids whose families were partly undocumented or who lived in mixed-status homes where some members were undocumented, others were citizens and some now had DACA, that meant that these kids could help support members of their family. And importantly, it said Homeland Security, which is in charge of ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - the Department of Homeland Security will not try to arrest you for deportation. So essentially, what DACA was a kind of elaborate form of prosecutorial discretion that the Obama administration created in 2012 to make sure that this population of people who are broadly sympathetic, who are American in every respect except for their legal status, could be sort of left alone and allowed to resume semi-normal lives. GROSS: The reason why we're in this DACA crisis now is because President Trump created a March 5 deadline for DACA legislation, and if legislation isn't passed, the program would just end. It would be terminated. What was his stated goal for doing that? BLITZER: My read on the situation is basically that the president wanted to appease his base in canceling DACA but that he himself had trouble doing something that was so obviously inhumane, for one thing, and that was so obviously unpopular for another. So he tried to kind of defer the decision. And the first thing he did was he canceled the program, but then he tried to force (ph) the issue onto Congress and say, look, this isn't my problem. The reason we're in this bind is because Congress never passed a law in the first place to handle this population. And so the first thing he had to do was... GROSS: This was an executive decision. BLITZER: Exactly. It was an executive action under President Obama. And so he creates this deadline ostensibly as a way to give Congress time to act. But that deadline itself is artificial. I mean, it's totally arbitrary that he's picked March 5. But there are also another set of deadlines that get a lot less publicity that have already passed and that already affect the lives of DACA recipients. So he cancels the program on September 5. He then says, look, for everyone who has DACA and whose DACA status expires before March 5, you now have starting September 5 one month to apply to renew your status. Now, the administration doesn't make this particularly clear. A lot of people are uninformed about how little time they have to renew if their status were to expire before this March 5 deadline. So the first deadline the administration really creates is October 5. There are about 154,000 DACA recipients whose status expires before March 5. So of that population, they had to apply within a month's time to renew their status. It's costly to apply. It's close to $500 to apply to renew your status. Some people don't have that money just off the cuff like that. I think some people were scared that this administration kind of didn't really mean what it said in terms of offering this opportunity to extend. People had problems - I mean, administrative problems having to process their application so quickly. So someone maybe - I spoke to a girl who signed her form in the wrong place. And by the time she got notice that she needed to refile that signature, that October deadline had already passed. So after October 5, there were 20,000 people who had DACA before who now didn't have it. So already you're talking about 120 people a day who are losing status. And what do I mean by status? I mean the ability to work legally. And I also mean the ability to be sort of free of this fear of deportation. And so people are already losing their DACA status every day. GROSS: On Tuesday of this week, a second federal judge ruled that President Trump hadn't offered sufficient legal reasons for ending DACA. What is that ruling about, and how is it affecting DREAMers? BLITZER: Yeah. So right now, because of the injunction by a judge in California in January and now this judge in New York, the cancellation of DACA has been temporarily blocked. And so for DACA recipients who at the time the Trump administration canceled the program had status, they can reapply for the time being. It's unclear exactly what will happen. So later this week on Friday, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge brought by the Justice Department to try to lift that injunction and continue with the cancellation of DACA. But for the time being, what it means is if you had DACA before, you know, at the time that it was canceled, you can apply to renew your status. And people are scared at this point of doing so just because, you know, say you changed your address in the last year, I don't know that you want this administration to have all of the details of where you live, especially given how aggressive ICE has been. But I think for the most part, it makes sense for people to apply to renew because every two years, essentially, you have to apply to renew your DACA status. And so this buys people some time. So that's kind of the state of play right now. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Blitzer, and he writes about immigration for The New Yorker, where he's a staff writer. We're going to talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Blitzer, who covers immigration for The New Yorker, where he's a staff writer. So the possible outcomes for DACA are that it will be settled in Congress or in the courts or it will just end on March 5, President Trump's date to end the program. As part of a deal not to shut down the government a second time over the budget, Mitch McConnell agreed to allow one week of debate on DACA in which the Senate could write a bill from scratch. But President Trump has promised to veto any bill that doesn't address what he describes as his four pillars - building the wall, ending what he calls chain migration, which is basically allowing immigrants to bring in family members, ending the diversity visa lottery program and providing a path to citizenship for DREAMers. So President Trump is saying no room for compromise; these four things or nothing; these four things or I veto it. You've said that at this point the debate really isn't about DACA. It's about legal immigration. What do you mean? BLITZER: I think what's so striking about the turn the conversation has taken in Congress is that, you know, we're really no longer talking about whether or not it is fair or makes sense to legalize the so-called DREAMers. We're not talking about whether or not it makes sense to come up with a specific raft of border security measures. Instead, the real sticking point - and this is something the White House has pushed very aggressively from the start - is making major changes to the legal immigration system, a system that's been in place since 1965. And so the cost essentially that's being proposed for any negotiation on the status and future of DREAMers has become how far you're willing to go to overhaul certain aspects of the family-based immigration system. And that's something that I really - I can't overstate how significant a shift that is in how these immigration debates are playing out. That is the result of Donald Trump and hard-liners in the White House really changing the terms of the debate in a profound way. It's a pretty significant revisioning of what immigration is about. And I think it has a lot to do with changing the composition of who comes to this country. I mean, it is nothing less profound than that. GROSS: And how do you think the president wants to change the composition of who comes? BLITZER: Well, I think since 1965, the people who have tended to come to the U.S. have less and less come - tended to come from, say, Western Europe. They tend to have come from Asia, from Latin America. And I think there is a certain racial composition to the new face of immigration to this country. And I think it's something that the White House ideologues and hard-liners have had a really hard time swallowing. And this is - you know, this is a battle that they've fought on the political fringes for years. And they've kind of been left out of the room. Now they actually have their hands on sort of the levers of power, and they can really drive the congressional debate around this issue. So they're teaming up with people in the Senate who - you know, people like Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas, David Perdue of Georgia - who have proposed legislation that would essentially halve legal immigration as we know it. And these guys in the past have proposed things that seemed totally outlandish, that seemed like a total lark to have introduced into Congress because there'd be no support for it in either political party. But now, that really seems to be the kind of centerpiece of this new push. And the Trump administration has effectively taken DREAMers hostage as a way of trying to bargain and negotiate this particular position. GROSS: Are there people in the Trump administration who are behind this no-compromise position that the president has taken? BLITZER: I think this is all pretty clearly leading back to one person in particular, and that is the White House senior adviser, Stephen Miller. This is a vision that Stephen Miller has propounded from the start of his political career. It's something that he - you know, Stephen Miller began working in Jeff Sessions' office back when Jeff Sessions was the senator from Alabama. And the view of Miller, of Sessions, of other people of their ilk - that kind of small cadre of nativists who grew out of the Sessions office - is that, you know, nothing short of redrawing the legal immigration system would be sufficient in the way of reform, that we have to significantly ramp up enforcement measures. The cancellation of DACA leads back to these guys. They're - it's quite incredible the power they now wield. GROSS: So because of DACA hanging in the balance here, because the Senate has a week to debate a bill and because we have the March 5 deadline for DACA that President Trump laid down, the president is basically saying here's a few days to revamp the whole immigration system. BLITZER: Yeah. I mean, it's... GROSS: I mean, it's a huge thing to do in a few days, and there's so much at stake. BLITZER: Yeah. And, you know, it's interesting. In the past, the thinking on this was - and this was establishment wisdom in actually the Republican Party most specifically - if you're going to make changes to the immigration system, if you're going to attempt any form of revamping or overhauling the immigration system, particularly with regard to a population as sympathetic as the DREAMers, you need to propose incremental revamping or overhauling the immigration system, particularly with regard to a population as sympathetic as the DREAMers, you need to propose incremental solutions. So in the past, it would be, OK, pair legalization of DREAMers with an increase in border security measures. You know, the idea was, on the one hand, something that sort of seemed more liberalizing, on the other, something that kind of tightened enforcement. It was always very narrowly drawn. Now what's on the table is nothing short of a complete overhaul of our immigration system. And the idea that this would somehow take place in a week's time after months of stalled negotiations on an even narrower question is ridiculous. GROSS: Any guesses what the outcome's going to be? BLITZER: It does not seem likely that any of the proposals on the table have enough support to clear the 60-vote threshold that is necessary for a bill to basically overcome debate in the Senate and move on to the House. I think some of the plans might actually come close to getting that kind of number. I think there is a growing kind of coalition of bipartisan senators who are offering an alternative to the White House plan. It's hard to see that group getting to 60, which is the threshold, precisely because the White House has been so aggressive in denouncing that approach. But I certainly think it's fair to say - in fact, arguably, the surest thing that can be said at this point is that the White House-Chuck Grassley-Tom Cotton plan - this kind of harder-line vision - absolutely does not have enough votes to pass at the Senate. The question is whether by proposing in the first place they've effectively sunk any prospect of a deal. GROSS: So I guess if Congress doesn't move forward with legislation on DACA, then one of two things can happen. The Supreme Court can uphold the two federal judges' injunction against President Trump's termination of DACA, or President Trump's termination of DACA could hold, and, like, that's it on March 5. BLITZER: That's right. And I think the Supreme Court decision this week - it's largely, I think, a procedural question. So the issue before the Supreme Court is, you know, can the Supreme Court issue a stay and lift the injunction of these federal judges? Certainly, the Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to say that. I think the Supreme Court most likely will say, look, you have skipped over the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In this case, what kind of gave rise to the Supreme Court's hearing of this issue was that judge in California issuing the injunction, and so the relevant body then that the administration would have to go to in order to reverse that injunction would be a court of appeals, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration tried to skip that step, and so the Supreme Court most likely will say, look, you have to go to the 9th Circuit, and this issue will have to play out kind of in the courts first before we weigh in. That's what I expect will happen. It's conceivable that because Congress has reached this impasse on how to deal with the situation, there will be a kind of temporary measure that, you know, maybe extends DACA for, you know, a few years, probably until after the 2018 midterms. But it's not clear even what the political will is to get behind that. So we really are in a kind of dangerous position with regard to DACA. GROSS: So if DACA ends on March 5, what happens? BLITZER: So if there's no solution, if Congress just strikes out, what will start to happen is on March 6, you'll have every day from that moment forward - people who have DACA will start to lose their status. And so... GROSS: Because they have two-year status, and when that two years expires, they'll lose their status. BLITZER: Exactly. And it wasn't like everyone applied for DACA at the same time, too, so it's all staggered. And so, you know, you'll have roughly the pace of a thousand people a day. You will have people for every day there on out losing their status. GROSS: Jonathan Blitzer, thank you so much for talking with us. BLITZER: Thanks for having me, Terry.

Gen. Robert Ashley, NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo testify before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday. Updated at 3:52 p.m. ET Russian influence operations in the United States will continue through this year's midterm elections and beyond, the nation's top spies warned Congress on Tuesday. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the Senate intelligence committee that Moscow viewed its attack on the 2016 election as decidedly worthwhile given the chaos it has sown compared with its relatively low cost. \"There should be no doubt that Russia perceived that its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian midterm operations,\" Coats said. The top intelligence officials in America were on Capitol Hill Tuesday because the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence convened its annual hearing on \"worldwide threats.\" The hearing takes place every year, but this year's installment convened amid an ongoing Department of Justice and FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether President Trump's campaign might have conspired with the Russians who attacked the 2016 election. It also followed reports about the losses of U.S. agents overseas, the theft of the NSA's secret spying software and other major setbacks in the intelligence business. More broadly, the world itself is also getting more dangerous, as senators heard. \"The risk of inter-state conflict is higher than any time since the Cold War,\" Coats told senators in his opening statement. Along with Coats, also answering questions from lawmakers were CIA Director Mike Pompeo, FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, as well as the heads of the Defense Intelligence Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley and Robert Cardillo, respectively. The intelligence bosses were asked to restate their support for the 2017 report that concluded Russia had waged a campaign of what spies call \"active measures\" against the 2016 election. All of them did. President Trump goes back and forth about whether he accepts there was such an attack or whether it was a \"hoax\" waged by sore-loser Democrats. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he was frustrated at trying to warn his constituents about the threat from foreign interference when voters were able to point to Trump's comments and question whether it was actually happening. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as the intelligence officials, spoke to the importance of at least speaking clearly about the Russian threat, even as the issue of whether the president's campaign colluded with the Russians remains an open question under investigation by DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller. \"We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to be happening, and the resilience needed for us to stand up and say we're not going to allow some Russian to tell us how to vote, how we ought to run our country,\" Coats said, in response to questions from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. \"I think there needs to be a national cry for that.\" Members of the Senate committee differed on how well they thought the United States is preparing for continued influence operations against the democratic process. Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said he was frustrated by what he called a lack of action and a lack of coordination inside the intelligence agencies. \"We've had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter further attacks,\" Warner said. \"But I believe we still don't have a comprehensive plan.\" Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, on the other hand, said extensive discussions in Congress and in the press since 2016 meant that Americans now know better what to expect. \"I think the American people are ready for this,\" Risch said. \"I think they're going to look askance a lot more at the information attempting to be passed out through social media.\" Facebook and Twitter and other online platforms have become key conduits for disinformation that originates in Russia and attempts to amplify political division between Americans. Credit:  AP \"It's been ridiculous\" Pompeo used part of the hearing to try to correct the record. He faulted stories in the New York Times and The Intercept last week that said American intelligence officials paid $100,000 to a \"shadowy Russian\" in an effort to get back stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons. Not only did American spies want to recover stolen secrets but they also were offered material described as compromising about Trump, according to the stories. That didn't happen, the CIA director said. \"Reporting on this matter has been atrocious, it's been ridiculous, it's been totally inaccurate,\" Pompeo said, adding that the CIA did not \"provide any resources, no money\" for what he called \"phony information.\" There was no information as to whether another intelligence agency or government department might have paid to try to recover the NSA material. The Senate committee also discussed the nuclear missile threat from North Korea and the \"instability,\" as Coats described it, of that country's leader, Kim Jong Un. North Korea staged a massive military parade last week, showcasing its tanks and missiles, ahead of the Winter Olympics' opening ceremony in South Korea. It also has sent a contingent of athletes and cheerleaders to the Olympics, but DIA's Ashley said nothing has changed about the North's dangerous aims toward its neighbors or the United States. \"Decision time is becoming ever closer in terms of how we respond to this,\" Coats said. \"We have to face the fact that this is a potentially existential problem for the United States.\" Intellectual property theft by China, terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaida, and drugs crossing the Southern border from Mexico also came up, but the hearing kept coming back to the broad peril involved with cyberattacks. \"Cyber is clearly the most challenging threat vector this country faces,\" said Senate intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C. \"It's also the most concerning, given how many aspects of our daily lives in the United States can be disrupted by a well-planned, well-executed cyberattack.\" King complained that the United States doesn't have a formal strategy to deter cyberattackers. Instead, \"all we do is patch our software and try to defend ourselves,\" he said. \"We are trying to fight a global battle with our hands tied behind our back,\" he added. The Porter matter Two FBI-related storylines also continued to pop up: One involved the timeline of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter's resignation. The other involved accusations by Trump and other Republicans that the intelligence community is biased against them. Wray was asked on Tuesday by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., for a more complete order of events in terms of when the White House knew about domestic violence allegations against Porter as part of his background check process \u2014 allegations Porter has denied. The White House has been ambiguous about when senior officials knew about the allegations of abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives, which could have affected his ability to get a full security clearance. Wray said the FBI followed protocol and turned in an initial report in late July 2017. Wray declined to say what was in the report, but he said that his agency received requests for a follow-up and responded to that by November and closed the file in January 2018. That differed from some accounts of events given by the White House. And, as has been the case at many hearings on Capitol Hill in the past few months, Wray also was given the chance to respond to criticism from Trump that the FBI is \"in tatters.\" More recently, the FBI has come under more criticism after the release of a Republican memo that alleged bias against Trump. Wray repeated that he has \"grave concerns\" about omissions in the memo by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House intelligence committee, which both the FBI and the Justice Department have denounced. \"There's no shortage of opinions about our agency. ... My experience has been that every office I go to, every division I go to, has patriots. People who could do anything else with their careers but they've chosen to work for the FBI because they believe in serving others,\" Wray said. \"I encourage our folks not to get too hung up on what I consider to be the noise on TV and social media.\"",

            "article_content": "Political turmoil in the communities of Colorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah, have resulted in the resignations of nearly a dozen city and utility board employees. The communities are the longtime home of a polygamous sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which has been the target of state and federal investigations and lawsuits. FLDS leader Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence for sexual assault of children. The resignations follow the historic election last year of non-FLDS followers to vacant Hildale city council seats and the mayor's office. One of the employees cited conflict of religion as the reason for his resignation. He said in his resignation letter that it is against his faith to follow a woman or to work with \"apostates,\" which is the FLDS word for those who have left or been kicked out of the church. FLDS faithful typically do not associate with apostates. Those who leave the church, whether by their own choice or by the decree of church leaders, are shunned. The adjacent communities are essentially one town and share services. The newly elected Hildale mayor is Donia Jessop, who left the FLDS church about four years ago with her family. Jessop is the first woman, and also the first \"apostate\" to be mayor of Hildale and said she respects those who have resigned for following their beliefs. Still, the resignations suddenly leave the town with empty municipal jobs. Jessop and others on the council were not caught completely off guard. There had been rumors in the communities of the mass resignations. Jessop said she is working on filling the positions with the guidance of a court-appointed monitor named Roger Carter, who is the city manager of Washington, Utah, which is about 45 minutes away from Hildale. The monitor was appointed as a result of a 2016 Justice Department lawsuit alleging institutionalized religious discrimination in the community. Non-members complained that they were denied access to city services because they were not part of the FLDS faith. In 2016, the towns were found guilty of religious discrimination by a federal court jury. The towns and FLDS church leaders have been the subject of lawsuits and prosecutions ranging from food stamp fraud to sexual abuse for years. Officials in Arizona and Utah have also successfully challenged FLDS dominance of the school system, town marshal's office and a religious trust that once controlled nearly all the land and homes in the border towns. Hildale and Colorado City have undergone significant changes in the last few years, particularly as population demographics continue to shift with people leaving the FLDS church, which has always been the dominant cultural and political force in the towns. While the faithful still follow Jeffs' edicts from prison, there is work being done in the community to provide resources and services from those leaving the extremely strict and insular church, as well as efforts to open up the community and make it more welcoming to outsiders. KJZZ chronicled a number of these changes in a series about the community, known collectively as Short Creek. NPR's Howard Berkes contributed reporting for this story.",

Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Donald Trump  speaks as Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan listens during a lunch at the 2018 House & Senate Republican retreat Feb. 1 at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. Updated at 3:06 p.m. Republicans are gathered at the storied Greenbrier Resort \u2014 home to a Cold War-era bunker once meant to house Congress in the event of a nuclear attack \u2014 to plot the party's legislative agenda for 2018 and strategize for what could be a bruising midterm election. President Trump spoke to Republicans in a noon address that echoed his State of the Union speech and advised his party that in order to advance an agenda in 2018, compromise is a necessity. \"We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot,\" he said. However, Trump suggested that the four pillars in his administration's immigration proposal were non-negotiable despite strong opposition from Democrats over White House demands to reduce family-based immigration and eliminate the visa lottery program. \"We'll either have something that's fair and equitable and good and secure, or we're going to have nothing at all,\" Trump said. The president did not take questions from lawmakers. For Republicans this year, it may be easier to look back than to plan for what's to come. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence lauded 2017 as \"the most accomplished year for the conservative agenda in 30 years.\" Pence touted the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, confirmation of a record number of conservative lower-court judges in the Trump administration's first year, regulation rollbacks and a $1 trillion tax cut package. President Trump's State of the Union address provided a familiar list of proposals, but lawmakers haven't rallied around an agenda in the same way Republicans did in 2017 on health care and taxes. Much of what President Trump outlined Tuesday night \u2014 paid family leave, overhauling the criminal justice system's sentencing laws and reducing the cost of prescription drugs \u2014 are proposals loaded with opposition from the conservative wing of the party and are unlikely to find GOP champions on Capitol Hill. Even Trump's immigration proposal has received a lukewarm reception from Republicans in Congress because it includes a path to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million people residing in the U.S. illegally. On Thursday morning, Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters that the path forward might need to be a pared-down immigration bill that only includes a legislative fix to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and money for border security. That proposal would eliminate any changes to legal immigration sought by conservatives. \"That may be the best we can hope for,\" Thune said. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called a more limited bill a \"non-starter\" in the House. \"Sen. Thune represents a state that is a long ways from the southern border, and so making a suggestion that a two pillar answer is going to get support in the House is a non-starter.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that he intends to make good on his promise to begin an open debate on immigration if Congress fails to reach a deal on immigration by Feb. 8. \"I'm perfectly happy, provided the government is still open on Feb. 8, to go to the subject and to treat it in a fair way, not try to tilt the playing field in anyone's direction and we'll see who can get 60 votes,\" he said. Congress is quickly coming up on the Feb. 8 deadline that will require another stopgap funding measure. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.., said Congress will need to approve the fifth stopgap measure since September because a long-term spending deal remains elusive. Democrats are withholding support for a final budget deal as leverage over the immigration talks. Lawmakers have just three legislative days to act, as the House is only scheduled to be in session through Tuesday next week in order to adjourn so House Democrats can hold their annual three-day retreat. Infrastructure is a popular proposal with theoretical bipartisan support, but there's no consensus on the hardest part \u2014 how to pay for it. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao met with Republicans Thursday to discuss strategy. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., told reporters that he brought up \"the elephant in the room\" on transportation-- raising the gas tax to help pay for a bill--but that reaction was \"mixed.\" The president appears to have walked away from the GOP's failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The GOP tax bill zeroed out the tax penalty designed to compel individuals to buy health insurance, and that policy victory seems to have satisfied Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has likewise said he's ready to move on from the health care fight after the Alabama Senate special election loss narrowed his majority to a razor-thin 51-49 margin. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., voiced hopes of overhauling social welfare programs in 2018, but he's been given little rhetorical backup from the White House or the Senate. The president made no mention of overhauling entitlement programs in his Tuesday address. The three-day retreat is designed to help lawmakers figure out what, exactly, they can agree on and when they plan to act on it. The legislative pipeline so far this year has been clogged by the impasses over immigration legislation to determine the fate of those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, and a budget deal necessary for Congress to pass this fiscal year's spending bills, which are already four months overdue. The Treasury Department threw Congress another curveball this week after it informed lawmakers the deadline has been moved up to vote to raise the debt ceiling --the nation's borrowing authority \u2014 to Feb. 28.

Election-year politics are already at the forefront of lawmakers' minds here. Another prominent Republican, South Carolina's Trey Gowdy, announced his decision to retire this year. He is the 34th Republican and ninth committee chairman to retire ahead of the 2018 midterm elections where Republicans are facing historically brutal headwinds with their House majority at stake. Pence assured Republicans that he and the president would hit the campaign trail hard for down-ballot Republicans. He also said the party under Trump has already defied the \"conventional wisdom\" of elections and forecast that Republicans majorities would hold come November. Pence also took advantage of the location to launch an attack on West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who is up for re-election in a state Trump won by more than 40 percentage points. \"When it came to cutting your taxes, Joe voted no,\" Pence told employees at an event at a local manufacturing company, adding that Manchin \"has voted no time and again on the policies that West Virginia needs.\" Pence continued that attack in a series of tweets with the hashtag #JoeVotedNo highlighting Manchin's opposition to Trump's priorities, including GOP efforts to cut funds for Planned Parenthood. Manchin responded in a statement: \"The vice president's comments are exactly why Washington Sucks.\" Congressional Democrats likewise hold annual policy retreats, but House and Senate Democrats meet separately. House Democrats next week will head to the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to give the keynote address.",

Two months later, he was shunned by the president and out of a job at Breitbart News.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Trump, speaks in Warren, Mich., in November. Two months later, he was shunned by the president and out of a job at Breitbart News. Previous presidents tended to have a public-facing political strategist and confidante: George W. Bush had Karl Rove, Barack Obama had David Axelrod. And, for a time, Steve Bannon might have filled that role for President Trump. But with Bannon estranged from the president, Trump is entering a midterm campaign \u2014 which tends to be politically perilous for a new president \u2014 without such a nationally recognized proxy, who instinctively understands his base and has put in the time on the campaign trail with him. It's also a Bannon-shaped void in the conservative populist movement. \"Right now it's just the president. Steve Bannon was emerging as the guy who you could say, 'This guy's agenda is the president's agenda.' ... A lot of us would be more comfortable if additional leaders would emerge, field-grade officers,\" said Michael Caputo, a longtime Republican strategist and former Trump campaign aide. Bannon had planned an ambitious anti-establishment campaign to challenge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with candidates who ran on a populist, economic nationalist brand \u2014 and perhaps funded by former Bannon patron Rebekah Mercer. However, Bannon found himself on the outs earlier this month after he was quoted in a book saying that a meeting Donald Trump Jr. and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner had with a group of Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign was \"treasonous.\" They were promised incriminating information about Hillary Clinton in the meeting. The president himself weighed in to say that Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist for the first seven months Trump was in office, had \"lost his mind\" and had \"nothing to do with me or my presidency.\" Mercer quickly put out a statement siding with the president. \"I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected. My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements,\" Mercer said. Within a week, Bannon had resigned as chairman of Breitbart News, the conservative website that had served as a key bullhorn for the populist right and which Bannon once referred to as part of his arsenal of \"weapons.\" In October, Bloomberg reported that Bannon planned primary challengers to almost every GOP senator who was up for re-election, in a bid to weaken McConnell. Without Bannon at the helm \u2014 and the Mercers having distanced themselves from him \u2014 much of that anti-establishment organizational energy has disintegrated. \"Without a figurehead to mobilize and organize it, where [does that movement] go? These candidates were part of the movement because they believe that they would be funded by the Mercers and aligned with Trump. That's why they signed up,\" said Kurt Bardella, the former Breitbart spokesman. And there is a legitimate question to be asked about how successful Bannon would have been. His 2018 political effort was in its infancy, with no formal organizing to speak of at the time of his estrangement with the president. \"This is a guy who is basically leading a movement that doesn't exist,\" Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff, told ABC News after Bannon's preferred candidate, Roy Moore, lost the Alabama Senate election last year. \"Steve Bannon is sort of the emperor who had no clothes here.\" Bannon did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Supporters of the president insist that Trump still has a finger on the pulse of the Breitbart wing of his base \u2014 and that he can serve as president of the United States and movement leader, all in one. \"Bannon's self-destruction will have no impact on the Trump movement or the president's base. No voters know who Sloppy Steve is and they don't care,\" longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone told NPR, using a moniker for Bannon that Trump created after their falling out. \"It's all inside-the-Beltway nonsense that no real people care about.\" \"The president has an instinctual connection with his base. No staffer can possibly replicate that,\" added Ed Brookover, a former senior Trump campaign adviser. \"He understands their overwhelming desire to change how Washington [works]. His instincts are driving his agenda.\" Trump allies point to individuals like former campaign hands Dave Bossie, Corey Lewandowski and Kellyanne Conway as people who could step up to Bannon's prior role \u2014 figures who remain in the loop, but are admittedly less antagonistic and less ideological. Bossie, who first introduced Bannon and Trump years ago, pointed to White House aide Stephen Miller as a strong voice in the administration. Miller, who cut his teeth working for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, was known as an immigration hardliner in the Senate. \"Stephen Miller is a tremendous leader inside the White House and out, on immigration issues going back many years \u2014 [in him] the president has someone who understands his position and is able to articulate that to Capitol Hill,\" Bossie told NPR. However, there are already signs that Bannon's populist revolt is steadily diminishing in importance. The same week that Bannon was ejected from Trump's trusted circle of advisers, the White House announced that the president would be attending the annual World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, a glitzy gathering of the world's elite. Following the Republican Party's embarrassing loss in the Alabama Senate race, the president announced he would not be supporting insurgents seeking to challenge incumbent Republican members of Congress. \"I don't see that happening,\" the president told reporters, after being asked if he would still be supporting challengers. This week, Breitbart took the White House to task for not moving as quickly as it says they should have to secure the border. Bannon had planned for 2018 to be a midterm season filled with a \"League of Extraordinary Candidates,\" a slate of conservative, economic nationalists led by Bannon and others to challenge McConnell and other Republicans in Washington, D.C. There is little threat of that now. \"There is no narrative of McConnell in jeopardy. Once [Republicans] got tax reform done, there was nowhere to go with the 'take McConnell out' narrative. There is no one else driving that other than Steve Bannon,\" Bardella said. The Washington Post reported that the president even paid McConnell the ultimate Trump compliment as he managed the shutdown confrontation with Democrats. After McConnell advised him not to reach out to Democratic leaders and instead wait for them to come to him, according to the Post, Trump told the majority leader, \"You are a good negotiator.\"",

Republicans say Democrats manufactured the crisis over immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Saturday, arguing that the shutdown is mainly President Trump's fault. Republicans say Democrats manufactured the crisis over immigration. While a lot of furious negotiation has been going on behind the scenes on Capitol Hill to end a partial government shutdown, to voters and cable news viewers it may look like most of the work in Washington is going into pointing fingers. As the countdown to shutdown hit zero, an official White House statement called Democrats \"obstructionist losers.\" Democrats pointed to President Trump's inconsistent statements on immigration to say he's an unreliable negotiating partner. But even if voters side with one party or the other, neither side may fear any lasting political damage. Republicans' approval ratings tanked after they were blamed for engineering the last government shutdown in 2013. A little more than a year later, voters delivered the GOP a Senate majority. And in the Trump era, the news cycle has only accelerated, giving crises a shorter and shorter half-life. Still, President Trump was tweeting before dawn on Saturday. \"Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border,\" the president offered in his first volley. Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess! Democrats are seizing on a rare moment of leverage, with a spending bill that needs their votes, to try to make permanent the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Obama-era policy shields about 700,000 immigrants from deportation, those in the country illegally who were brought to the U.S. as children. But Republicans point out that DACA won't really expire until March. \"The federal government is needlessly shut down because of Senate Democrats. One party, in one house of this Congress, is deliberately holding our government hostage,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said during a floor speech on Saturday. The GOP included a six-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program in their government funding bill, making it harder for Democrats to oppose. But Democrats tanked the bill anyway, and Republicans accused them of pulling a stunt that put needy children at risk. Democrats had an answer for that. \"They're using the kids as an excuse. They're using the children of CHIP as an excuse, and the children of the DREAMers as an excuse,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Saturday after huddling with her caucus behind closed doors. \"Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in floor remarks a day after a meeting with Trump that both sides said was favorable. Whatever progress they made at the White House on Friday obviously didn't lead to a deal. Meanwhile, the Democrats are not going to let anyone forget when Trump tweeted last year, \"Our country needs a good 'shutdown.' \" It's too early to tell who the public will decide is at fault, or if they'll even assign blame. There were polls before the shutdown started warning Republicans that they would shoulder the blame. And while the public broadly supports making DACA permanent, as Democrats are insisting on in current talks, pollsters also found that the public thought avoiding a shutdown was more important. There is shared outrage about how broken the whole system is, so it's possible that means neither side will feel much of a consequence from this debacle. There are other reasons, too. First is the little room that exists for these public servants' public image to drop. Last week's NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll showed that just 36 percent of Americans have trust in the Democratic Party and 29 percent in the Republican Party. The only institution with a lower level of trust is the Congress itself. Also, many of the current players, save the president himself, were in Washington for the last shutdown in 2013. It was viewed as driven by conservative Republicans, chiefly Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. And you know what happened after that? In addition to Republicans winning control of the Senate and expanding their House majority, Cruz became a grassroots hero. He built a large army of supporters and donors who helped him launch a presidential campaign in 2016 that outlasted almost every other GOP candidate who took on Donald Trump. OK, lesson learned. Shut it down? In this era of tribal politics, the focus is often on firing up the party faithful, far more than trying to win over voters in the middle. Democrats have been taking heat from their base, and particularly from immigration activists, for not pushing the DACA issue to the brink in December when government funding was last extended. In the final hours before this shutdown, Democratic lawmakers \u2014 including some thinking about a presidential run against Trump in 2020 \u2014 held a rally with so-called dreamers on Capitol Hill and then went inside to vote against funding the government. Among Republicans, the president's hard line on immigration appears to be spreading. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, often criticized as more concerned than anything with protecting that Senate majority, has ratcheted up his tone recently, as more in the party say Democrats are prioritizing people in the country illegally over American citizens. While the Republican base certainly doesn't want the president to give in and make a DACA deal with Democrats, there are signs that the Trump Administration may be worried about taking heat for a lasting shutdown. Before it took hold, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, \"We're going to manage the shutdown differently.\" He briefed reporters Saturday on how operations such as the Environmental Protection Agency, mine safety, cyber security, trade negotiations and the government response to the flu outbreak were moving ahead with minimal disruption. The National Parks Service is also doing everything it can to avoid the images from the last shutdown of veterans locked out of the World War II memorial, or spoiled family vacations in Yosemite. It may work, but that would only make this a more forgettable shutdown than we've seen in the past. What's also different about this shutdown is that everything is more forgettable in the frenetic news cycle of the Trump era. We've already moved from arguments over the size of a nuclear button, to a false alarm about a nuclear attack on Hawaii; from #Oprah2020, to \"girthers\" questioning President Trump's height and weight. There's a porn star talking about an alleged affair with the chief executive, and the onward march of the #metoo movement. And that's just the first three weeks of 2018. A month's worth of news feels like a full year. So by that measure, we've got about a decade to get through before the midterm elections \u2014 before any real political consequences could be felt from the shutdown.",

Growing up with a Mexican father and an American mother, author Luis Alberto Urrea often felt like there was a border wall running through his family's San Diego apartment. \"The kitchen was the United States; the living room was Mexico,\" Urrea says. \"One side was struggling with all her might to make me an American boy, and the other side, with all of his might, was trying to keep me a Mexican boy.\" As a child, Urrea was often confused by his own dual culture, which he describes as a \"super-American look\" combined with a \"super-Mexican outlook and accent.\" But as an adult, Urrea realized that he could draw on his heritage in his work. \"All those things that as a kid seem so painful and were such a liability to me ended up being the strength of everything,\" he says. Urrea's latest novel, The House of Broken Angels, borrows from the real story of his older brother, Juan, who was dying of cancer when Urrea's mother died. by Luis Alberto Urrea Hardcover, 336 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On celebrating Juan's birthday with a big party when he was dying of cancer I spent the day laughing and then weeping. It was whiplash all day long. As I described in [The House of Broken Angels] with the character Big Angel, my brother was greatly physically reduced. He was in a lot of physical pain. He couldn't stand very well by himself anymore. He spent a lot of time in his bed. But he would come forth to this insane gathering of every kind of person all at once, all the stories going at once, all of the romantic and erotic hookups, all of the feuds, all of the jokes, all of the weeping, all of the strangers sitting in corners kind of baffled about what was going on, a DJ playing weird mash-up music that people were dancing to \u2014 all happening at once. ... I think the book came out of two moments, one of them directly quoted in the novel, when I told him, watching [people] kiss his hand, \"You're like Don Corleone.\" And he said, \"I am Don Corleone.\" And the other: His having to go to bed and asking me to lie in bed with him at several junctures of the day. ... We had every kind of talk. ... It was the moment of reconnection and farewell. On his father's death after an encounter with the Mexican police My father wanted to celebrate [me getting into college] somehow, even though he and my mom were long separated by that point. So he drove alone down to his hometown in Sinaloa, [Mexico,] ... to retrieve money, because he, like so many immigrants, was sending remittance money home. ... He retrieved $1,000 from the bank \u2014 U.S. bills, 20s \u2014 and then he drove back. And he was trying to get home and ... he got to a [Mexican] town south of Yuma, Ariz., and ran afoul of the police. It's very nebulous what exactly happened with them, but he ended up extremely hurt physically and they took a lot of his belongings. They took everything. They took his shoes, his luggage, all of his belongings. And the injuries to his abdomen particularly made him wet himself, and they never reached into his pockets, so they didn't find the money. The doctor who came did find it because he was wearing rubber gloves and he knew if he said anything that they would take it, so he hid it. Essentially, my father waited eight hours in this state: naked on a table, waiting for an ambulance to take him to the American border so he could be saved. The calculation, I believe, is that he would die, and he did. So, the doctor passed that money to relatives who passed it on down the border to me. I was waiting in the funeral home in Tijuana, and the police brought the body and made me buy it. They said if I didn't purchase my father, they would keep him. So I spent that money to buy him. On how his father's death inspired him to write I felt everything crashing down and I didn't know what to do. It was such a harrowing experience being with his body. I sat in a room with him all night, his body, dealing with the police. And then I had to go to the border and deal with immigration and have all of his papers. I didn't know what I was doing. By the time I got back to San Diego, I had forgotten English. It took me a minute to get back into being an American. I had only one way to deal with it, which was writing. I had been writing since high school, and so I wrote about it. The happy ending to that story is that Ursula Le Guin came to my college and she found me and helped me become an author. On how the Trump presidency influenced The House of Broken Angels It definitely affected my rewrite of the novel. The novel started out as a kind of a slim memoir inspired by the events of my brother's death and final birthday party on Earth before his death, and it was kind of what I call the Mexican Finnegans Wake. ... But then as I expanded it, ... it started taking on more of a cultural statement and turned into a novel, which seemed to want to become epic. I couldn't shake my growing sense of rage and astonishment at the tone. People I loved facing horrible fear with DACA, and people I loved and knew being confronted by good Americans spewing demented vitriol at them. I'm telling you, this wall is a boondoggle. It's a joke. Luis Alberto Urrea On the Trump administration's proposed border wall, which Urrea wrote about in The New York Times I try to be respectful, and one of the points for me is to listen to people and hear them, because I think sometimes people get more and more outrageous because they feel insulted or looked down on. So I'll listen, but sometimes it's really hard. I'm telling you, this wall is a boondoggle. It's a joke. And ... the eight new [prototypes] of wall that President Trump claims he's finally going to go see, I'm telling you, one day it's going to be a kitschy tourist stop for ironic hipsters. It's going to be spray-painted. It's going to look like Cadillac Ranch and people are going to take selfies at it. But it's not going to start a multibillion-dollar Great Wall of China project. I promise you. There's no way to build it. Sam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Nicole Cohen adapted it for the Web.",

            "article_content": "On election night hundreds of LGBTQ candidates ran for office and many made history, including the first openly gay governor in Colorado and the first lesbian Native American congresswoman in Kansas.  NOEL KING, HOST: This midterm season, nearly 400 LGBTQ candidates ran for state, local and federal offices. Many of them made history. Advocacy groups see the wins as a reaction to hostility from Washington and statehouses in recent years. NPR's Leila Fadel has the story. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Kansas elected its first openly LGBTQ person to Congress. Sharice Davids gave her victory speech after her win against the Republican incumbent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHARICE DAVIDS: Because the time for people to not be heard and not be seen and not be listened to or represented well changes now. (CHEERING) FADEL: Michigan got its first openly lesbian attorney general with Dana Nessel. Chris Pappas will be New Hampshire's first openly gay congressman. And in Colorado, Jared Polis becomes the first openly gay man elected governor in what advocates are calling a rainbow wave. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JARED POLIS: For the LGBTQ pioneers for equality in the generations before me, who endured so much hardship and hurt to make it possible for so many of us, myself included, to live and to love openly and proudly... FADEL: And Polis isn't the first LGBTQ governor. That was Oregon's Kate Brown, who got re-elected this week. Every LGBTQ incumbent for Congress kept their seat on Tuesday night, and the overall number grew. One win came in Minnesota, where Democrat Angie Craig unseated Republican Jason Lewis, who'd called trans student bathroom access an abomination. Chad Griffin is the president of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. CHAD GRIFFIN: What happened was a resounding victory for equality and a rejection of those who choose to attack us and truly sending the message - attack the LGBTQ community, and you do so at your own peril. FADEL: After Tuesday, there are only four states in the whole country that have never elected an openly LGBTQ person to their state legislature. That's according to Annise Parker, the president of the Victory Fund, an organization that supports openly LGBTQ candidates. The former Houston mayor says, building on past gains was one factor in these wins, but anxiety also drove voters. ANNISE PARKER: We feel we're under assault across the country, particularly from our state legislators. FADEL: Parker says in the last two years, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills surfaced in statehouses across the country. PARKER: Anti-adoption bills, conversion therapy bills, so-called religious freedom bills, anti-transgender bathroom access bills - on and on and on. FADEL: Back in Kansas, where Sharice Davids won, Hailee Bland Walsh says she's relieved. HAILEE BLAND WALSH: It's not only hopeful; frankly, it's lifesaving. FADEL: Walsh and her wife never imagined that they'd see an open lesbian serve in their district. She's been afraid as a minority in an America that's becoming more and more uncivil. BLAND WALSH: There's something really fundamental about feeling safe. And today, for the first time in couple of years - I'm getting emotional about it, but I feel safe. FADEL: These candidates, though, aren't winning on votes from LGBTQ communities alone. In Colorado, Zack Katz, a straight white man, voted for Governor-elect Jared Polis. ZACK KATZ: I voted for him without remembering that he was gay. FADEL: Katz says what he voted for was Polis' stance on guns, health care and education - concerns on the minds of many American voters. Leila Fadel, NPR News.

Mia Love and her Democratic challenger, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, shake hands during a debate on Monday in Sandy, Utah.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott G Winterton/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Utah Republican Rep. Mia Love and her Democratic challenger, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, shake hands during a debate on Monday in Sandy, Utah. In his very first answer in the recent debate between the candidates for Utah's 4th Congressional District, Ben McAdams launched into a political origin story about his first encounter with burdensome government regulations. The mayor of Salt Lake County told the audience about how he worked four jobs one summer during college to earn some extra income. \"Imagine my disappointment the following year when I was notified that I was denied federal student aid because I made too much money,\" he said. \"Government regulations and rules, they don't always make sense. And they don't always reward us for doing the right thing.\" These kinds of anecdotes are common. It's just that they usually come from Republicans. McAdams is a Democrat and, according to a recent poll from the Salt Lake Tribune, he is locked in a dead heat with Republican Rep. Mia Love. For all the attention that the Democratic Party's national leftward lurch has gotten over the past two years, it's moderates like McAdams, running in Republican-leaning districts, who could put the party back in control of the House of Representatives. Democratic candidate stresses he will work with Trump In an interview with NPR, McAdams said he would give the Trump administration \"mixed reviews.\" He paused for a few moments before continuing. \"I will work with the Trump administration when I think it's good for this country, when it's good for Utah,\" he said. \"I'll be there. I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in local roads and bridges. I want to be part of that.\" McAdams criticizes Trump, for sure \u2014 on immigration policy, health care and other fronts. But like many Democratic candidates running in close contests this year, he is not regularly railing on Trump on the campaign trail. He is leery about pushing for impeachment, wanting to wait for not only the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but for a bipartisan consensus on any congressional response. \"When you're considering overturning the results of an election, that is a very serious thing,\" McAdams said. \"And it should be an issue of last resort, and it shouldn't be done on a partisan basis.\" All of this is no accident. The county official and former state senator knows that while Democrats in other competitive House races have debated the tactical merits of working to energize and turn out the liberal base, compared with appealing to Republican voters to switch sides, he has no choice. Republicans have a 13-point advantage in this suburban Salt Lake district, and he needs to get them to cross the partisan divide. \"The votes I need to win this election I've gotten twice before,\" he argued, pointing to county election results. \"I just need to reassure those people that I'm not going to change. I'm going to be the same person as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor.\" Love argues she is an independent voice McAdams also has to persuade voters to dump Love, a two-term lawmaker who gained immediate national attention by being the first-ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican. Love is conservative, but running in a tight race, she has repeatedly framed herself as a pragmatist and an independent voice. \"I have built relationships on both sides of the aisle,\" she recently told the Salt Lake Chamber at a candidate forum. \"I'm the only one in this delegation who has stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and have worked with him when he's done something right,\" she proclaimed during the debate with McAdams. The approach reflects Utah Republicans' continued uneasiness about  Trump. (Trump won the district's vote in 2016, but with only 39 percent; 22 percent of the 4th District broke for independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin.) While Love repeatedly voted for Republican priorities in the House, and aggressively defends the Trump-signed GOP tax overhaul and last year's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, she has highlighted the times she criticized Trump's statements or actions. When Trump memorably referred to African nations and Haiti with a vulgar term during an Oval Office meeting on immigration, Love demanded an apology, calling the statement \"unkind, divisive, elitist, and [flying] in the face of our nation's values.\" She was one of the first Republicans to try to force a House vote on a measure providing a permanent solution for the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 a move Trump repeatedly blocked by demanding legal immigration changes Democrats won't support. During the debate she called Trump's policy of separating the families of people who enter the country illegally \"absolutely horrific.\" Occasional statements from congressional Republicans chiding Trump's tweets, comments and, less frequently, policies are, of course, a common theme of the past two years. All the while the House and Senate have gone along with the president's policy pushes and declined to provide any significant oversight of the Trump administration. But as the party becomes more and more Trumpcentric, occasional criticism from another Republican on the campaign trail is rare. Indeed, many of the other GOP lawmakers who publicly split with Trump or criticized him opted to retire this year, rather than run again. Others, like Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have shifted gears to become close Trump allies. Given all that, Love's campaign is one of a handful of test cases on whether voters will reward a lawmaker for an arms-length embrace of the White House. McAdams has repeatedly dismissed and criticized Love's balancing act. \"Words are one thing. Actions and outcomes are another,\" he said again and again during their debate. \"I don't get credit for what I try to do or what I say I want to do,\" he told NPR. \"I'm judged based on what I accomplish. And we need to hold the same standards to our representatives in Congress.\" McAdams' centrist message at odds with left-leaning caucus As the race has tightened, Love has utilized the Republican strategy of arguing that a vote for McAdams is a proxy vote for a Nancy Pelosi speakership. That's despite the fact McAdams has promised to oppose Pelosi, if he makes it to Congress. \"If this seat turns over and they win the House, Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the House,\" Love argued, while also pointing out that an anti-Pelosi vote could cost McAdams choice committee assignments in Congress. McAdams is a vague on whom he would support for Democratic leader \u2014 \"we need leadership that's going to prioritize healing,\" he said \u2014 but argued a Democratic takeover would shift the party's internal dynamics. \"If the Democrats do take back the House it's because a lot of people like me win their elections,\" he argued, adding, \"and these are people for who party does not come first, but solutions come first.\" As Democrats lost election after election during the Obama era, the main casualties were moderates like McAdams. The centrist Blue Dog caucus shrank to near-extinction, while the remaining Democrats in office were pulled to the left along with the national party. But while a majority of the current House Democratic caucus supports single-payer health care, the majority-making candidates who could flip Republican districts very likely will not. That could lead to some tense intraparty dynamics in the next Congress, on everything from who should lead the Democratic caucus to how aggressively to investigate the Trump administration and what sort of stands to take on must-pass spending bills. McAdam's suggestion for navigating all of that, should he end up in Washington: listen. \"Public-policy making is complex. It doesn't lend itself to a hashtag, per se,\" he argued. \"Ultimately, solutions are going to come from consensus building.\"",

            "article_content": "The battle for control of the House could be decided in places like Utah's 4th congressional district where moderate Dem. Ben McAdams touts centrist messages against GOP Rep. Mia Love.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now for all the focus on how the Democratic Party is shifting to the left nationally - if Democrats take control of the House, it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts. Take Utah's 4th Congressional District. It is deep red. And according to a recent poll, Republican Congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat Ben McAdams are in a dead heat. NPR's Scott Detrow reports. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: In this year of deep partisan splits, it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: How do you view how the Trump administration is doing right now? BEN MCADAMS: You know, I think mixed reviews. DETROW: The mayor of Salt Lake County, Utah, criticizes Trump, for sure, on immigration policy, health care and other fronts. But he's a lot more measured and cautious about it than most Democrats running for Congress this year. In a year where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single-payer health care, he likes to talk about burdensome regulations. MCADAMS: I will work with the Trump administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for Utah. I'll be there. You know, I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in local roads and bridges, and I want to be part of that. DETROW: That's all no accident. The county official and former state senator knows that while other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides, he's got no choice. Republicans have a 13-point advantage in this district. MCADAMS: The votes I need to win this election, I've gotten twice before - just need to reassure those people that, you know, I'm not going to change. I'm going to be the same person as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor. DETROW: He's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love, a two-term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first-ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican. Love is conservative. But running in a tight race, she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIA LOVE: Going into Washington, I know exactly who I'm working with. I have built relationships on both sides of the aisle. DETROW: Love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She's also quick to point out that in several high-profile moments, she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration, where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during a White House meeting on immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOVE: As a matter of fact, I'm the only one in this delegation that has stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and have worked with him when he has done something right. DETROW: Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements then backing him on policy has been a major theme over the past two years. That's something McAdams keeps pointing out, saying that voters should look at Love's votes and actions, not her occasional statements. MCADAMS: I don't get credit for what I try to do or what I say I want to do. I'm judged based on what I accomplish, and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress. DETROW: As the race has tightened, Love has done what many other Republicans are doing, framing a vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi. That's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for Pelosi to be speaker. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOVE: Now my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi. But if you watch what's going on there, if she - if this seat turns over and they win the House, Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the House. DETROW: McAdams insists he'd keep his independence in Washington. MCADAMS: What I see is - if the Democrats do take back the House, it's because a lot of people like me will win their elections. And these are people for whom party does not come first, but solutions comes first. DETROW: As Democrats last election after election in recent years, the main casualties were moderates like McAdams. But many of the candidates in the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats' national leftward shift. They aren't calling for single-payer health care or impeachment. So if election night goes well for the party, the next big question is how the return of more moderates shifts party dynamics, especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power.

Ted Cruz as he tries to regain traction in the last weeks of the campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Loren Elliott/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, seen campaigning in Houston this month, has launched his first attack ads on Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as he tries to regain traction in the last weeks of the campaign. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's re-election campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent, Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, on television. Straight out of the GOP playbook, Cruz's ads have tried to paint his opponent as a radical, left-wing extremist. In one attack ad, which eventually seemed to backfire, Cruz's campaign misleadingly edited videotape to make it appear as though O'Rourke had said he supported flag burning, which he did not say. O'Rourke said he supported Americans' right to protest anytime, anywhere, including NFL players on Sundays, launching that and other ads from Cruz. Until now, O'Rourke has declined to participate in negative campaigning. But with polls showing Cruz with anywhere from a 6- to 9-point lead, the congressman relented and has gone on the attack. O'Rourke's latest ads, released Wednesday, attack Cruz as being heartless and obstructionist on immigration reform, targeting DREAMers for deportation and sowing fear instead of the seeds of compromise. In their debate in San Antonio on Tuesday, this trend continued. Cruz painted O'Rourke as a dangerous extremist: \"If you work in energy, if you work in oil and gas, Congressman O'Rourke's record on this is extreme. He didn't just vote for a $10-a-barrel tax on oil. He's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking.\" Unlike in their first debate, O'Rourke hit back: \"This is what you can expect over the course of this debate. Sen. Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. It's why the president called him 'Lying Ted,' and it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true.\" Although Cruz would force a laugh when O'Rourke attacked him, his face revealed his true emotions; the senator didn't like it. O'Rourke and Cruz debate in San Antonio on Tuesday. O'Rourke responded to attacks from Cruz in kind, embracing negative campaigning in the final weeks of the campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption O'Rourke and Cruz debate in San Antonio on Tuesday. O'Rourke responded to attacks from Cruz in kind, embracing negative campaigning in the final weeks of the campaign. But the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle. It was substantive, too. Cruz has the numbers on his side; there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas than Democrats. As a result, Cruz spoke mostly to his base. \"The state of Texas is booming,\" Cruz said \"We've got right now the lowest unemployment in 49 years. Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and low regulations, and Congressman O'Rourke's position is always, always, always in favor of higher taxes.\" If Cruz generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power, O'Rourke tended to speak to voters' better angels. \"Whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now,\" O'Rourke said. \"Walls, Muslim bans, the press as the enemy of the people, taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying 2,000-mile journey seeking asylum here in this country. The bitterness, the partisanship, the pettiness, the dishonesty that defined so much of the national conversation. We are in desperate need right now of inspiration.\" Although O'Rourke is running way ahead of other Texas statewide Democrats, close still gets you no cigar, says Cal Jillson, political science professor at Southern Methodist University. \"I think that a very good Democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through,\" said Jillson. \"That's why O'Rourke came up so strong on Cruz. Cruz is an acquired taste. People respect him as a conservative fighter. They don't necessarily like him. They gave O'Rourke a look.\" Jillson throws caution on the idea that Texas is about to turn blue: \"Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out. It's not two years, it's not four years, it's longer than that because demographic change is very slow.\"",

President Trump will speak at the National Rifle Association's annual convention on Friday, a little more than two months after he pledged to stand up to the gun rights organization in the aftermath of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. In the days after the shooting that killed 17 people, Trump called out lawmakers for being \"afraid\" of the NRA, saying the group had \"less power\" over him. He even publicly backed raising the minimum age to buy long guns and supported imposing more expansive background checks \u2014 positions strongly opposed by the NRA. But when the White House actually announced its proposals to improve school safety, the approach was much more narrow and pretty much in line with NRA policy stances. The mismatch between Trump's rhetoric on gun laws and the legislative actions he ultimately ended up backing fits a larger pattern for Trump. He has repeatedly floated ideas publicly, seemingly off the cuff, before pulling back to conform with more mainstream Republican principles. \"It often seems that Trump pivots to more traditional positions once longtime actors in the policy process are able to brief him about why Republicans hold positions at odds with the ones he just espoused,\" said Justin Vaughn, director of the Center for Idaho History and Politics at Boise State University. Vaughn said the result is that Trump ends up falling in line with his base, but he may get fewer policy \"wins.\" The president was able to sign into law some measures that address deficiencies in the current national background check system, although those provisions fell short of calls for requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Trump had similar moments on immigration. In January, during a televised bipartisan meeting with lawmakers, he expressed openness to backing a bill that would protect young immigrants from deportation without including funding for a wall on the southern border. The White House wound up putting out a proposal that included a path to citizenship for those young immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and $25 billion for a border wall. Congress has yet to pass legislation addressing DACA. By showing a willingness to take positions that buck his party's line without following through, Trump is able to play up his independence without dealing with the consequences of actually enacting policy. \"When he does tough talk like, 'I'm not afraid of the NRA' ... it says more about his persona, his image and his core supporters love that,\" said Robert Denton, head of the department of communication at Virginia Tech. But there are some risks to vacillating between various viewpoints. \"These inconsistent policy positions leave allies and foes alike unsure where he stands and uncertain about him keeping his word after they leave the negotiating table,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. The White House defended the president's decision to speak at the NRA, despite the intense criticism the group has faced since the Parkland shooting. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a briefing on Tuesday that safety is a priority for the Trump administration. \"But we also support the Second Amendment, and strongly support it, and don't see there to be a problem with speaking at the National Rifle Association's meeting,\" Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire is throwing House Republicans into chaos at a time when the party is deeply worried about losing control of that chamber.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: House Speaker Paul Ryan gave Washington a jolt this morning. He announced he would leave Congress at the end of the year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: I have accomplished much of what I came here to do. And my kids aren't getting any younger. And if I stay, they're only going to know me as a weekend dad. And that's just something I consciously can't do. CORNISH: The news started a scramble among House Republicans over who might succeed Ryan. It also raises questions about their party's identity and what it can accomplish before the midterm elections in November. We've got NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell here to break it all down. Hey there, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So you were in the Capitol today as Paul Ryan made this announcement. Can you tell us more about why he's leaving now? Do people really believe it's all about his family? SNELL: Obviously the timing was a huge shock, but the idea of him leaving wasn't such a huge shock. There've been rumors for months about his future. And there weren't really any fresh signs of - leading up to today that he would be headed for the door. Part of that is because it's kind of remarkable that Ryan, who's only 48 years old and has only been Speaker for less than three years, would even be leaving. As far as we know, everything that his staff and he has said leads us to think that, yes, he does really want to go spend more time with them. But it really does raise a lot of questions about how confident Republicans really are about keeping their House majority after the election. His decision to leave is part of a wave of retirements. And often, retirements in a year leading up to an election like this indicate that there are a lot of members who just don't feel confident that their party can win. And they don't want to go through the really difficult re-election process and getting beat up on the campaign trail only to lose. CORNISH: So how are Republicans on the Hill responding? SNELL: They really didn't know that this was coming. And like I said, most of them said they weren't surprised. And there has been a mix of public support for Ryan's decision and private fears about what might happen in the election in November. A lot of them say they respect his decision to be more than a weekend parent who has young kids. But they say they're worried that it sends a bad message to donors in particular that the Republican party just isn't ready to win. There are other people, like retiring Republican Charlie Dent, who says that none of that really matters and that if Republicans have a bad year this year, it's all because of President Trump. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLIE DENT: I believe each member's going to be running in their district, you know, in a pretty damn toxic political environment. We all know that. It's going to be a referendum on the president of the United States and his conduct in office. It's not about Paul Ryan. So I don't think Paul's decision is going to have an impact on anyone in this election. CORNISH: At the same time, Kelsey, this is an important leadership position, right? SNELL: Right. CORNISH: I mean, what does this say about the leadership of the Republican Party? And I don't know if there's anyone waiting in the wings to kind of take over that job, come January. SNELL: Ryan doesn't have a handpicked successor, though I'm told that he has thoughts on how this should all play out. He just not willing to share that information yet, in part because he wants to give people time to kind of make their case to their colleagues about why they should be in charge. At least two members of House Republican leadership are already jockeying for the job - Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who kind of gained public prominence after he was injured during the congressional baseball game shooting last summer, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who's notable because he's a close confidant of President Trump. But they're not the only ones who may have an eye on the gavel. Conservative Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows says leadership isn't, quote, \"on his bucket list,\" but he also refused to say he wouldn't run. And (laughter) so that has a lot of people questioning whether or not there's going to be a power grab from conservatives. People say they don't want to have a long, protracted fight because it would cause something like the TMZ effect. CORNISH: In the meantime, any idea whether Ryan would start working with Democrats in his final weeks? SNELL: Sure. That's something that his predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, did on his way out. They cut a big deal with Democrats on spending. There really isn't that kind of deal to be cut right now. The only thing that's left outstanding is immigration - Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. And that is actually a really big thing that's being held over Ryan's head and something that a lot of people are watching as a potential space for one last big piece of legislation before he goes. CORNISH: That's NPR's Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thank you. SNELL: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World by Jennifer Palmieri Hardcover, 180 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? It's hard to imagine a day when we all stop talking about Election 2016. It may be even harder when you're Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton's last presidential campaign. Palmieri is out with a new book called Dear Madam President. The book is full of advice for a future woman world leader, but it also serves as an extremely revealing retrospective on Election 2016, posing big and lingering questions on the presidential race we just can't leave behind. And it paints a picture of Palmieri as a woman who just can't stop working. Since starting in politics in the early 1990's, she's built a career full of movement, with few breaks. \"You know I joined the [2016 Clinton] campaign from the Obama White House,\" she tells NPR. \"I'd been the communications director there and I literally stopped on a Friday and started on a Monday, and people said \"Well, that's crazy! You need a break,\" and I was like, \"No, you know what I'm? I'm in fighting shape.\"\" Talking with Sam Sanders of NPR's It's Been A Minute, Palmieri goes deep on how high-level staffers like herself may have done Hillary Clinton some disservice at pivotal moments during the campaign, and how they all should have trusted the candidate's instincts a little more. \"She'd been Hillary Clinton her whole life,\" Palmieri told NPR. \"She [Clinton] knew, she anticipated a lot of how the public would likely to react to her.\" And Palmieri talks about what it was like running a woman for president, and how hard that was to do, saying, \"I felt like Hillary was running for president with half her humanity tied behind her back.\" But Palmieri also says she has no regrets. \"I do not believe there was any other path for the campaign or for her, other than to undertake this the way that we did,\" she said, \"which was A) prove that she could do the job and B) try to express her ambition and make people comfortable with it as best as we could. And I think that this was just the process the first woman had to go through.\" On the difficulties a woman faces in running for President Jennifer Palmieri waits for  Hillary Clinton to speak during a rally in North Carolina in September, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jennifer Palmieri waits for  Hillary Clinton to speak during a rally in North Carolina in September, 2016. Our biggest problem for women trying to lead in politics is there's not a model that people are used to seeing that they can compare that woman to and be comfortable with her in that role. Our only model that we have for anyone who runs America, who is the head of the United States, is a man. So, I had a moment where I realized in October during the campaign, I thought \"Wow, what we have done is made Hillary a female facsimile of the qualities that we look for in a male president.\" And ... it was a gut punch ... realizing there was a fundamental design \u2014 in October! \u2014 and you can't go back and fix it ... And I think that people's distrust of her isn't that everybody is sexist or misogynist; she vexes people and they don't know what to make of her... because I think they don't know what a woman in charge looks like. We were trying to present her with these qualities that you're used to seeing in a male president: That she's strong enough, that she can handle national security, that she's tough enough that Donald Trump can come after her and try to humiliate her and she's never going to let it show. And I think she had to do that. I do think that the first woman nominee had to prove that she could do the job the way a man would, but that robbed her of a lot of her own authenticity. On the moment she thought Clinton might lose The one time I thought that we were going to lose was actually in early September of 2016. We had had a bad August ... and then Hillary came down with pneumonia herself. Trump had just kind of hit his stride. Bannon had been named CEO, he [Trump] was being more disciplined. This was before the debates started. And I thought, \"Why do we think that we're going to be the ones that can stop this guy?\" He just rolled over 16, 17 candidates on the Republican side. It seemed to me, we're going to look back in 2016 and say the only possible outcome with Trump wins. On why you should cry at work It's your party and you can cry if you want to ... I think that crying is a way women and men express frustration anger or passion. And we should not feel compelled to mute those emotions ... You know, I wrote in the book that I felt like Hillary was running for president have her humanity tied behind her back. I think that all men and women both, particularly women, hold back on parts of ourselves because they don't fit into the traditional workplace model ... For me anyway, and I think for a lot of women, it was the election of Donald Trump that made me realize, \"Okay, this is not working right. We got to create a new path.\" We have to do this embracing all of our own qualities and emotions. And for me, I am a big crier and this is us. I think that people's distrust of her isn't that everybody is sexist or misogynist ... I think they don't know what a woman in charge looks like. Jennifer Palmieri You hear people say, \"Well, I was going to say this, but I knew I couldn't get through it without crying.\" Well like think of all the great things we didn't hear because of that ... You'll reach some sort of equilibrium at work when is as acceptable for a woman to cry as it is for a man to raise their voice. On whether Democrats are as divided as Republicans I do not accept that my party is as divided as the Republican Party. They don't know if they want to deport 800,000 DREAMers or make them citizens. They have enormous divides in their party. And I don't think that party is strong enough to have the kind of fights and policy debates that we have within our own party. The Democratic Party is always going to be a diverse group of people who are yelling at each other and fighting over what's the best way to do something. I get so frustrated when people say, \"We need to be like the Republicans, and they just they have one line and everybody repeats it.\" My friends, my friends: We are never going to be like that. We are never going to be like the Republicans. We are never going to say the same things ... We care about the details and we care about how we get there. We care about all of it and it's messy.

            "article_content": "President Trump's election in 2016 reshuffled the political map with some white, working-class Democrats backing him. In 2018, a big question is whether this same group has shifted to completely supporting the GOP.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Today marks the start of the 2018 midterms. It is primary day in Texas. The big question in this year's elections is what sort of aftershocks we'll see from the political earthquake that came with Donald Trump's 2016 victory. Trump won the presidency on huge support from white working-class voters, including many Democrats. Key to this year's election outcome is whether they'll cross over to vote GOP again this year. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid went to eastern Ohio to hear from voters there. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: In this area halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, it's not hard to find folks who voted for President Obama in 2008 or 2012 but then voted for President Trump in 2016. I'm eating breakfast at the Yankee Kitchen near Youngstown when I meet Jeff Zatchok. In between bites of egg he tells me the Democrats have become too extreme. JEFF ZATCHOK: To me, the Democrats used to be kind of middle America. And it seems they've gotten away from that. Either my views or the Democratic Party views changed. KHALID: And so after voting for Obama, he decided to give Trump a try. And like a lot of people I meet, he's happy with that choice. ZATCHOK: Hundred percent satisfied. And I would do it again tomorrow. And I'll do it again in three years if that (laughter) - if that happens. KHALID: Zatchok says these days he's feeling more like a Republican. And that's a big deal because this area is dominated by the Democratic Party. The Democrats hold almost every local office. People tell me they're Democrats because it's in their blood. CONNIE KESSLER: My whole family was Democrat. I was born and raised in a Democrat home. KHALID: That's Connie Kessler. She's a retired hairdresser who now spends nearly every day at the local Republican Party headquarters answering the phone. KESSLER: I'm going to send you some more information. KHALID: She started volunteering here because of Trump. KESSLER: If Trump wasn't running, I'd probably still be a Democrat. He made me be what I am today. KHALID: Become a Republican. KESSLER: Yes. Yes. KHALID: Kessler worries about Democrats obstructing the president, so she's working to elect local Republicans. She's had a full-on conversion, and now she's trying to spread the Republican gospel to anyone willing to listen. She wants God back in schools, and she thinks the Democrats have lost their way on immigration. KESSLER: I think our immigration system is terrible. The DACA system is terrible. The DREAMers are terrible. I don't believe they should be here. I think they should all go back where they came from. KHALID: When you listen to Kessler, it's a reminder that when it comes to religion, abortion and immigration, Democrats here are often conservative. One woman I met thumbed through a prayer book as we talked politics under a giant painting of the Last Supper on her dining room wall. Still, a lot of these Trump voters are loyal Democrats reluctant to abandon the party completely. I meet John Schultz as he's wrapping up a cigar break. He's an attorney who voted for Trump. He tells me it's the first time he voted Republican in his 66-year-old life. And so I ask him, what is he? Is he no longer a Democrat? JOHN SCHULTZ: No, I'm a Democrat. I'm a registered Democrat. I will vote for Democrat candidates. KHALID: And then he repeats himself and insists he is not converting. SCHULTZ: No, I'm a Democrat. I'm a Democrat who voted for Donald Trump. KHALID: Schultz says people like him still believe in the basic economic values of the Democratic Party. He says people here need jobs and the national Democratic Party is ignoring them or, worse, doesn't understand them anymore. SCHULTZ: I was offended when Nancy Pelosi made a remark, well, oh, they're going to get a thousand dollars tax refund or - and that those are crumbs. No, those aren't crumbs. A thousand dollars is a hell of a lot of crumbs. KHALID: A major question in 2018 is whether the Midwest is going through a tectonic political shift and deserting the Democratic Party. Schultz dismisses that idea. And he might be right. The other night, a few hundred people came out to hear from Democrats running for governor. SCHULTZ: I don't think it's realigning. I do think that this area is maybe rebelling. KHALID: But if this is a rebellion, it's not clear national Democrats are listening - at least if you ask local Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan. He says his party keeps getting distracted from the economy. TIM RYAN: And that we may win in spite of that, but I don't think we're going to be in the majority for a long time if we don't get back to a message that unites everybody around their economic aspirations. KHALID: He says some local Democrats are setting an example, showing why an economic message could be so effective for the party. RYAN: People, whether they're white, black, brown, gay, straight - they want a job. They want high wages and a secure pension and secure health care. That's it. KHALID: Republicans believe they'll keep control of Congress this fall if people feel good about the economy and the GOP tax cuts. Democrats have enthusiasm on their side. It's coming from an anti-Trump anger. The question is how many of these Democratic Trump voters will stick with their party's candidates. Asma Khalid, NPR News, Youngstown, Ohio.

A significant majority of Americans favor outlawing the attachment, according to the latest NPR/Ipsos poll. An increasing number of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, want more gun regulation, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll that surveyed people in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting. Three-quarters of people polled said gun laws should be stricter than they are today. That's an increase \u2014 in a short period of time \u2014 from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were. Loading... The poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including: The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump \u2014 the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools. ....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT! The poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers. There was a clear-cut partisan gulf \u2014 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats. Loading... Trump's in sync with his base The president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies \u2014 and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation. \"We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,\" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. \"And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.\" Although Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns. In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions. \"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,\" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, \"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.\" Trump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll). \"President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,\" Jackson said. \"And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.\" Of course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation. Americans want Congress to act Any hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence. But the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats \u2014 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans. Loading... Jackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism). The shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well. And the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so. Traditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate \u2014 an energized group of committed gun-rights activists. But the political winds may be shifting. \"This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,\" Jackson said. And \"given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.\" And there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views \u2014 just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October. Loading... Guns are still partisan There are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country. On the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example \u2014 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats. Loading... And likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun \u2014 there was a split along partisan lines \u2014 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats. The split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives \u2014 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats. The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

Updated at 6 p.m. ET The Senate voted to begin debate on immigration Monday, launching an unusual process that could lead to a bipartisan immigration fix \u2014 or leave Congress with no solution for the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who stand to lose legal protections by March 5. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is leading the chamber down an unpredictable path. The goal is for the Senate to vote on immigration proposals and amendments from every corner of the political spectrum. Anything that can get 60 votes will pass; everything else will fall by the wayside. Many in Congress have been craving such an open debate because it will give senators a chance to put their concepts and proposals to the ultimate legislative test. The plan carries a significant political risk that none of the ideas will have enough votes to pass, leaving Congress unable to fulfill its pledge to protect the roughly 700,000 people enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"Whoever gets to 60 wins,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference on Feb. 6. He added, \"There's no secret plan here to try to push this in any direction. The Senate is going to work its will, and I hope that we will end up passing something.\" The hazy Senate process is expected to include votes on a wide range of proposals, including a version of a framework released in January by the White House. On Monday, McConnell threw his support behind that outline, which is being introduced in a bill by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; John Cornyn, R-Texas; and others. \"This legislation is a fair compromise that addresses the stated priorities of all sides,\" McConnell said. That framework set out four pillars that the White House wants to see addressed in any legislation: legal status for DACA recipients, more spending on border security, ending the visa program that lets immigrants in the U.S. bring their family members over, and eliminating the diversity visa lottery. Grassley called his bill a \"compassionate compromise\" and said if Democrats and others want to protect DACA recipients, they would support this plan endorsed by Trump. \"Are you interested in actually getting something done, in actually providing a path to citizenship for these DACA kids, or are you interested in a political issue for the 2018 elections?\" Grassley posited on the Senate floor to his colleagues. Even those senators who haven't supported the White House's position were optimistic about the process that was going to begin playing out. \"We're going to have something in the Senate that we haven't had in a while,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \"It's a real debate on an issue where we really don't know what the outcome is going to be.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday on the floor that \"the key is to find a consensus bill, largely acceptable to a significant number of members of both parties\" and cautioned Republicans against pressing for too much as they're up against such a critical DACA deadline. \"Democrats are fully committed to protecting the DREAMers, and we have long supported effective border security. Many Republicans are in the same boat. The only enemy to this process is overreach,\" Schumer said. \"Now is not the time nor the place to reform the entire legal immigration system. Rather, this is the moment for a narrow bill. And every ounce of our energy is going into finding one that can pass.\" Still, the outcome remains particularly uncertain because the Senate debate is just the start of a longer process of passing an immigration package. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has not yet said how the House will proceed beyond promising to vote on an immigration bill, so long as it has the support of President Trump. That promise has Democrats and other critics worried that the House could block whatever the Senate is able to pass. Ryan addressed those critics last week, telling reporters that he plans to hold a vote on immigration. \"To anyone who doubts my intention to solve this problem and bring up a DACA and immigration reform bill, do not,\" Ryan said. \"We will bring a solution to the floor, one the president will sign.\" The White House has not weighed in on any of the legislative options, but Trump has insisted that any immigration bill also include funding for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! The legislative rush comes after months of congressional inaction following Trump's announcement in September that the administration would stop renewing DACA applications in March. The program was created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama to provide legal protections to immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children. The program is currently caught in a court battle, but Congress has vowed to act before the deadline \u2014 giving it just three weeks to pass a bill.",

Russian-backed efforts attempting to interfere in U.S. politics appear to be evolving.\n                \n                    \n                    Yuri Kochetkov/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech in Moscow's Red Square last May. Russian-backed efforts attempting to interfere in U.S. politics appear to be evolving. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sounded an alarm this week: The Russians are already meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. \"The point is that if their intention is to interfere, they're going to find ways to do that,\" Tillerson told Fox News. \"I think it's important we just continue to say to Russia, look, you think we don't see what you're doing. We do see it, and you need to stop.\" A new poll shows that a clear majority of Americans believe Russia will try to meddle in the next U.S. election. But Tillerson also noted that Russia's tactics for interfering in U.S. politics are constantly changing. A bipartisan effort is shedding new light on how Russian methods evolve. Hamilton 68 is a project that has been tracking Russian influence networks on Twitter for more than six months, watching as Kremlin-linked bots and social media amplifiers seek to inject themselves into national controversies, like #ReleaseTheMemo, the Charlottesville white nationalist rally and the NFL kneeling controversy. Bots are automated accounts that repeatedly churn out tweets. They can be used to support a narrative or retweet other messages to falsely amplify a message. This project has identified and monitors 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations and continuously updates the results through an online dashboard. The tracking effort is part of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. After more than half a year of tracking Russian influence on Twitter, the project's staff members have seen deeper trends that reveal how the Russian government tries to get its own message out to more Americans. In addition to fanning controversies, Hamilton 68 noticed that the bots are trying to expand American exposure to Russian foreign policy propaganda, in part by slipping it into innocuous conversations. Amplifying #ReleaseTheMemo and #TakeAKnee The bread and butter of Russia information operations remains an effort to divide Americans. Russian bots weren't commenting on the NFL, Charlottesville or DACA because they had a stake in the outcome of the political debate, according to those tracking the activity. \"These are not networks that are necessarily always traditional propaganda. ... A lot of it is just trying to rip apart Americans, to sow chaos within our political system, to pit Americans of both parties against each other,\" said Jamie Fly, a director for the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former foreign policy aide for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \"And so a lot of the issues that we see these networks push are actually part of our day-to-day domestic political debates and often have nothing to do with foreign policy.\" There has also been a massive increase in the amount of chatter that promotes mistrust of American institutions, especially the idea of an American \"deep state,\" the idea that there is a conspiracy of government officials working to undercut the president. The deep state narrative was the focus of between 5 and 10 percent of the weekly content on the Russia-linked influence network in October, when Hamilton 68 began its tracking. Last week, it represented 38 percent of the articles linked to by those accounts. \"That's gone from being a sort-of ripple beneath the surface to now that's risen up to where it's typically the top thing we're seeing week to week,\" said Bret Schafer, the analyst for the project who updates the dashboard each day. Recruiting eyeballs for Russian propaganda Looking a little deeper, the Russian influence networks are using intriguing techniques to amplify their reach and change the types of content that Americans read. \"If you look at the dashboard day to day, it tends to follow the topic du jour that's in the general news cycle. So you'll see conversations about DACA or 'release the memo' or NFL protests, so you get caught at looking at the granular level and lose focus of the big-picture narratives,\" Schafer said. \"But when you zoom out and look at what's happened over the past six months, you start seeing some patterns start to emerge.\" Oftentimes bots will begin tweeting about totally innocent topics, such as a sporting event or a trending Twitter topic, as a means for expanding their audience. Schafer said he noticed the trend when he saw a number of their monitored accounts start tweeting about #MondayMotivation and #WednesdayWisdom, popular hashtags used by many American Twitter users, mixed in with content about Syria and Ukraine that Russian bots frequently discuss in defense of Russia's interventions in those countries. \"We look at that as being the recruitment topic,\" Schafer told NPR. \"If they started shouting about Syria and Ukraine ... less people would see it, and it would be less effective.\" Still searching for solutions Still, the bots don't have a unified partisan slant, even though U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian influence operations were aimed at supporting President Trump in the 2016 campaign. \"The reality is that they also turn against Republicans,\" Fly said. \"They have gone after administration officials like [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster. They've attacked [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell. They've attacked Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, [Jeff] Flake, Sen. [John] McCain on a regular basis. No one in American politics is immune from the reach of these networks.\" And so this is why Fly has teamed up with Laura Rosenberger, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during the 2016 presidential campaign. Together, they're co-directors for the Alliance for Securing Democracy's efforts to track and push back against Russian meddling in the American political system. \"The bipartisan aspect of what we're doing is actually strategically important,\" Rosenberger said, pointing to the apparent Russian goal of increasing political division. Even on Capitol Hill, where bipartisanship is the exception rather than the rule, there's a bipartisan understanding that Russia meddled in the American political process during the 2016 presidential election. Rosenberger pointed to the \"nearly unanimous\" vote in Congress to impose sanctions on Russia as evidence, although the White House recently said it will not implement Russia-related sanctions that Congress required because it was not necessary at this point. Still, those on both sides of the aisle understand that there has been no letup. \"The Russian effort to undermine our democracy did not end with Election Day in 2016 \u2014 these tools, whether creation of fake accounts, or the use of automated bots, continues on an ongoing basis,\" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told NPR. \"This is not just an elections issue,\" added Fly, the former Rubio aide. \"The reality is that Russian interference never stopped.\" But even Warner, who has a front row seat at briefings by the intelligence community, acknowledges that there are as yet no clear legislative answers for how to address Russian influence operations on social media networks. He has proposed legislation that requires social media networks to disclose the source of paid political ads. But he admits that represents a small part of how Russia influences the American political debate \u2014 and puts the onus on tech companies to disrupt automated bots. \"This is really an ongoing national security issue, and I don't think we have come up with a legislative or policy solution yet that fully gets it right,\" Warner said. \"The social media companies really need to work in partnership with us in a way that we get this right, that people can know if an account is being manipulated by a foreign entity. And if it's being pushed by automated bots, I think a user has the right to know that information.\"",

Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET A little after 10 a.m. on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., began a one-minute speech on the House floor. Just over eight hours later, she concluded her record-breaking remarks. According to the House historian's office, she delivered the longest floor speech since 1909 \u2014 and possibly ever. Pelosi's marathon Senate-filibuster-style speech was a protest against the fact that negotiations over the future of the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program have stalled. \"Our DREAMers hang in limbo, with a cruel cloud of fear and uncertainty above them. The Republican moral cowardness must end,\" Pelosi said near the beginning of the speech. \"So I'm going to go on as long as my leadership minute allows.\" (Leaders such as Pelosi are granted the courtesy of speaking beyond \u2014 in this case well beyond \u2014 the usual minute allotted to House members for floor remarks.) Hour after hour as she spoke, Pelosi read statements from people in the country illegally who were brought here as children. Most of the statements described the security and opportunities DACA has provided, or the careers or educational paths of people soon at risk for deportation. Pelosi also repeatedly framed the immigration debate in moral terms, at times reading directly from the Gospel of Matthew. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has promised Senate debate on immigration, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has made no such commitment. On Tuesday, Ryan said, \"We're not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn't support.\" Throughout the speech, Pelosi asked Ryan to change his mind and promise floor debate. Pelosi's marathon came the same day her Senate counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., struck a budget deal with McConnell. The agreement is broad and includes increased military and domestic spending, raising the debt ceiling and providing expanded disaster relief funding. But it does not include any DACA extension. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had initially promised to secure a DACA extension by the end of 2017; then, when December 31 came and went, by a mid-January deadline to fund the federal government. House Democrats repeatedly voted against short-term-spending bills that did not include protections for people in the program. Senate Democrats joined them in January, blocking a funding measure and forcing a government shutdown. But many Senate Democrats immediately viewed the move as a mistake, and the Friday night shutdown ended by Monday afternoon, affecting just one workday for most federal employees. By telegraphing their hesitance to force another shutdown, and then agreeing to a long-term budget deal, Democrats gave up the one source of leverage that the minority party held to force a DACA fix. In that context, Pelosi's marathon speech can be viewed as a signal to the progressive base that Democrats aren't quitting on DREAMers. But the high-profile move came as Republicans are once again making Pelosi a centerpiece of their House campaigns. In an upcoming Western Pennsylvania special election, conservative groups are running ads tying Democrat Conor Lamb to Pelosi, despite Lamb's having told reporters he wouldn't vote for her as Democratic leader. At a rally for Republican candidate Rick Saccone last week, speaker after speaker warned a vote for Lamb was a vote to return Pelosi to the speakership. Still, Pelosi shows no signs of stepping aside or giving up on efforts to secure a DACA deal. McConnell, Ryan and President Trump have all said they want to find a permanent fix for the roughly 700,000 people enrolled in the DACA program, which is set to expire March 5 under terms set by Trump last year. Pelosi sounded increasingly skeptical that Republicans will act. \"We do not deserve any right \u2014 any of us \u2014 to say we love DREAMers, or anything like that, unless we have an intention of doing anything about it,\" Pelosi said, more than four hours into the speech.",

President Trump delivered one of the longest State of the Union speeches in history. Clocking in at one hour and 20 minutes, it was the third longest, behind two from President Bill Clinton in 2000 and 1995. If you missed the speech, we promise to catch you up in far less time than that (so, you're welcome). Here are eight key moments and themes: 1. Not much new policy Among the policy issues mentioned in the State of the Union was a call for the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to remain open.\n                \n                    \n                    Ben Fox/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Among the policy issues mentioned in the State of the Union was a call for the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to remain open. State of the Union addresses tend to be a healthy dose of touting accomplishments (there was plenty of that) and laundry lists of policy proposals the president would like to see Congress take up in the next year. Trump addressed some policy: calling for the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to remain open, vowing to lower prescription drug costs, again dangling infrastructure as something both parties could work on, looking to rebuild America's nuclear weapons arsenal, and flirting with cutting off foreign aid to countries that don't move in lockstep with the United States. But there wasn't much new policy in the speech. 2. Call for bipartisanship \"Tonight, I call upon on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.\" Tonally, the president seemed more relaxed, comfortable and less stilted reading from a teleprompter this year than last, when he gave an address to a joint session of Congress not long after his inauguration. There was a lot more \"you\" than \"me\" in Tuesday's speech. And that's always a good thing for a president. Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington state listen to the president's address.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington state listen to the president's address. But the president was making a clear calculation \u2014 he was talking past the media filter to maybe the biggest audience he will have all year. In 2017, his address to Congress drew 47.7 million viewers. That's more than double NBC's Sunday Night Football (20 million), CBS's Big Bang Theory (19 million) and the finale for HBO's Game of Thrones (16.5 million with streaming and apps). In other words, if the past is prologue, the likelihood of actual bipartisanship pursued by Trump isn't very good. 3. \"Americans are dreamers, too\" \"My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream \u2014 because Americans are dreamers, too.\" That last line was one that upset many Democrats and advocates of a solution for getting people brought to the United States as children some road to legalization. Those DREAMers see themselves as every bit American. Trump subverted that idea with this line. Undocumented immigrant Victor Guzman watches the State of Union from Chicago. President  Trump's statement: \"Americans are dreamers, too\" upset some immigration advocates.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Undocumented immigrant Victor Guzman watches the State of Union from Chicago. President  Trump's statement: \"Americans are dreamers, too\" upset some immigration advocates. The president also brought in some other divisive themes, including leaning into his pro-police message that was wrapped in with the military. And he even alluded to the controversy he pushed with the NFL over standing for the national anthem. \"Together, we are rediscovering the American way,\" Trump said. \"In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is 'In God We Trust.' And we celebrate our police, our military and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\" Mentioning Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old from California who planted flags at veterans' graves on Veterans Day, Trump said: \"Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\" The military and standing for the anthem poll well, and the White House knows it. 4. Surprise Skutniks \"Today, he has a new leg, but Seong Ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\" What's a Skutnik, you ask? The name comes from Lenny Skutnik, a government employee who dove into the Potomac River to save a plane crash victim. He was invited to the State of the Union and sat next to then-first lady Nancy Reagan. His story was mentioned by President Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address. North Korean defector Ji Seong Ho holds up his crutches after his introduction by Trump. He was one of 16 audience members acknowledged by the president.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

He was one of 16 audience members acknowledged by the president. Sound pretty routine for a president to include that? Not back then. Skutnik was the first \"regular person\" story used in a State of the Union. On Tuesday, Trump took the use of the device to a new level. He acknowledged a whopping 16 people sitting in the audience, such as North Korean defector Ji Seong Ho, at the State of the Union as invited guests and integrated their stories into his speech. It was an emotional high point of Trump's 2017 address to Congress when he mentioned Carryn Owens, the widow of Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed in a raid in Yemen. It proved a strong device for Trump then, and his team decided to go all out with their use in this speech, weaving these stories throughout his speech. 5. Trump wades into Russia investigation No, he didn't do it in the speech, but afterward Trump was overheard telling a Republican lawmaker that he is 100 percent in favor of releasing a classified memo that reportedly has explosive information on the FBI. It was gathered by the controversial Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes of California. NEWS ALERT via @AP: Trump overheard telling GOP lawmaker he's \"100 percent\" for releasing Republican intelligence memo. Conservatives believe the memo could undermine the FBI and Justice Department's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and prove bias. The House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines Monday night to release the memo. That vote triggered a process that gives Trump five days to object to the memo's release, an objection that looks increasingly unlikely given Trump's comment Tuesday night. 6. Melania's winter white Getting all the attention at the beginning of the speech was first lady Melania Trump's white pantsuit and blouse. It had people asking: What message is she sending? Democratic women were in all black for Trump's speech. Hillary Clinton wore white to accept the Democratic nomination for president as a tribute to the suffragettes. First lady Melania Trump's all-white outfit had many wondering: What message is she sending?\n                \n                    \n                    J.

Mrs. Trump also got attention for whom she didn't show up with to the speech \u2014 her husband. CNN's Kate Bennett noted: \"The motorcade ride, from the White House south lawn to the Capitol building, is just a handful of minutes, but for a first couple who has not been publicly seen together since New Year's Eve, the separate cars were another in a string of isolated movements from a very independent first lady.\" 7. Another Kennedy takes a star turn Joe Kennedy III, the 37-year-old congressman from Massachusetts, delivered the official Democratic response. He is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, who was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president 50 years ago this year. Kennedy delivered a sharp, on-message performance, except for one thing \u2013 the lip gloss. What is going on here? https://t.co/Yt6CXnUDJn 8. Hillary Clinton's #MeToo play At 8:45 p.m., 15 minutes before the State of the Union, Hillary Clinton dropped a 1,573-word statement on Facebook backtracking on a controversial decision she made not to fire a senior campaign official accused of sexual harassment during her 2008 presidential campaign. The staffer joined a pro-Clinton outside group in 2016, where he was fired for \"workplace issues, including allegations that he harassed a young female aide,\" The New York Times reported. \"I very much understand the question I'm being asked as to why I let an employee on my 2008 campaign keep his job despite his inappropriate workplace behavior,\" Clinton wrote in her Facebook statement. \"The short answer is this: If I had it to do again, I wouldn't.\" Politicians do this kind of thing when they want to bury something they don't want getting a lot of attention. The thing is: Hillary Clinton says she isn't running for anything anymore. And she told NPR's Tamara Keith after the 2016 election that she has the \"responsibility to speak out.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump said he'd talk to special counsel Robert Mueller, who's investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. He also said he'd support a path to citizenship for DACA recipients.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Reporters were talking with a White House official when the boss walked in. President Trump unexpectedly took questions. And in response to those questions, he said he is willing to meet with Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia's participation in the 2016 presidential campaign. The president added he would do that under oath. The apparent confidence matches his insistence that he's done nothing wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There's been no collusion whatsoever. There's no obstruction whatsoever. And I'm looking forward to it. INSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson was in the room. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess we should mention this happens with a lot of presidents. Reporters - you're are in the White House. The president just unexpectedly drops in. How's the room change when he walks into a room? LIASSON: Well, the room changes. You don't want to talk to that senior White House official. You want... INSKEEP: (Laughter). LIASSON: ...To talk about the guy himself. And there becomes a scrum, and everybody kind of presses in to hear what he has to say. And with Donald Trump, you never know what he has to say. So a lot of suspense. INSKEEP: Well, in this case, he is asked about Robert Mueller. Did he mean it when he said he would take questions under oath? LIASSON: I have no idea whether he meant it or not. I can tell you what he said. He said, I would do it under oath. He said, quote, \"I'm looking forward to it.\" He said, I would love to do that. And then, of course, he said subject to my lawyers and all of that. And later on, one of his lawyers, Ty Cobb, did issue a statement saying that Trump was not volunteering to go before a grand jury. So... INSKEEP: Oh. LIASSON: ...We'll see. INSKEEP: So in other words, his personal lawyers will still want to negotiate the terms under which he says anything.. LIASSON: Yes, yes. INSKEEP: ...That he may have said. LIASSON: But the president was pretty emphatic - I would do it under oath. INSKEEP: What else did the president say? LIASSON: Well, the other thing that I thought was interesting is he began to defend himself against obstruction charges in a new way. He suggested that just fighting back, or defending himself, against the allegations is being misinterpreted as obstruction. He said, did he fight back? You fight back, and they say, oh, it's obstruction. So presumably, he's talking about firing Jim Comey. INSKEEP: Yeah, exactly. The question is, how did you fight back? That's what.. LIASSON: Right. INSKEEP: ...The special counsel may want to know. I should mention, Mara, that you were originally in the room talking with a White House official about immigration. And it seems that reporters also asked the president about that since, of course, it's a very big deal right now. LIASSON: And he made a lot of news. He said he was open to a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Over a period of 10 to 12 years, somebody does a great job, they've worked hard - it gives incentive to do a great job. But they've worked hard. They've done terrifically, whether they have a little company or whether they work. Or - whatever they're doing, if they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen. INSKEEP: DACA recipients, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the people brought here as children whose protected status is about to expire - he wants them to be able to stay here as citizens perhaps. LIASSON: Right. He said, quote, \"it's going to happen at some point in the future.\" He made news on other elements of a deal. He said on the issue of family migration - what he calls chain migration - he wants a new standard. He said, you can't bring everyone you've ever met into the country, but he said you'd have wives, husbands, sons and daughters allowed to come in. He said he wanted a new standard on that. He said he wanted the visa lottery system either gone or replaced. That's a little more flexible. He wants $25 billion for 800 miles of wall. All of those things are very similar to what the bipartisan group of senators is talking about on Capitol Hill. INSKEEP: Although that last point, the wall - Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, at one point said he was willing to at least start paying for that but says that's now off the table after the president backed away of his parts of the deal. LIASSON: Right. But he said that's because the president didn't take the deal he was offering him. But that will be part of any final deal. And what's interesting is the president got some praise from Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham and criticism from Steve King, the hard-liner in the House. So you can see what the president is going to have to do if he is going to truly make this deal. INSKEEP: NPR's Mara Liasson - thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "Americans give President Trump relatively positive marks on his handling of ISIS and the state of the economy.\n                \n                    \n                    Olivier Douliery/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Americans give President Trump relatively positive marks on his handling of ISIS and the state of the economy. As President Trump approaches the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, a majority of Americans think that his first year in office has been a failure and that he has divided the nation. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll data released Thursday finds that Americans deemed Trump's first year a failure, 53 percent to 40 percent. And by an almost 2-to-1 ratio (61 percent to 32 percent), Americans said they believe Trump has divided the country since his election. Americans give Trump relatively positive marks on his handling of ISIS and the state of the economy \u2014 no small things. But they disapprove of his handling of just about every other issue or think things have gotten worse \u2014 from their views of the tax plan to the state of race relations and women's rights to immigration, health care, the deficit and foreign policy, including his approach to North Korea. Seven in 10 Americans are now concerned about the possibility of war breaking out with the rogue nuclear nation. \"The first-year grades for Trump are not good,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. \"He remains with his base intact and not much else. People remain doubtful in the institutions of our government, doubtful in how he's communicating things and how he's handling things. It's not a pretty picture for the president after the first year.\" A majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the job Trump is doing overall (53 percent), think the country is headed in the wrong direction (57 percent), overwhelmingly believe his policies are directed toward helping the wealthy (60 percent) as opposed to the middle class (25 percent), and see his use of Twitter as a risky way to communicate (78 percent) that isn't sending the right message. Trump still enjoys loyal support from his core and unwavering base \u2014 but not many others. He has slipped with independents, for example, a group he won in 2016. None of that bodes well for Republicans in this year's midterms. Not meeting expectations Nearly half of Americans (46 percent) said Trump's presidency has fallen below their expectations. A third said he has met their expectations, while just 15 percent said he has exceeded them. A third of Americans said Trump's first year was a \"major failure.\" Just 15 percent described it as a \"major success.\" Notably, half of independents called Trump's first year in office a failure, including a 30 percent plurality who said it was a \"major failure.\" Loading... Forty-four percent of independents said Trump had fallen below their expectations as president in his first year, while 36 percent said he had met them. Just 16 percent said he had exceeded. Unsurprisingly, there is a sharp partisan divide \u2014 87 percent of Democrats called Trump's first year a failure and 71 percent said he had fallen below their expectations as president. On the other hand, 87 percent of Republicans called his first year a success, with 37 percent saying it was a major success. Among core Trump supporters, 91 percent also said it was successful, with 40 percent saying it was a major success. Continued steady and historically low approval Trump's approval ratings also remain low \u2014 with just 37 percent approving of the job he is doing as president overall while 39 percent strongly disapprove. Those numbers are virtually unchanged from the past several months, as Trump's base remains in his corner \u2014 85 percent of Republicans approve of the job he is doing, along with 90 percent of Trump supporters. But again problems with independents show up for Trump \u2014 just 38 percent of them approve of his job performance. Better or worse? Americans overall are pessimistic about the general direction of the country under Trump. Forty-two percent said the country has changed for the worse under this president, just 36 percent said it has been changed for the better, and 21 percent said they've seen no real change at all. Loading... Once again, though, those opinions are split along partisan lines. Almost three-fourths of Democrats said the country has changed for the worse over the past year. Republicans say the country has changed for the better 79 percent to 7 percent. Independents are nearly evenly split on the question \u2014 with 40 percent saying things have gotten worse and 38 percent saying they are better. It's worth pointing out that those splits come despite the economy's continuing to improve. A nation divided? Nearly all Democrats (90 percent) and a majority of independents (59 percent) said they believe the president has divided the nation over the past year. Trump's numbers with Republicans are a bit softer here, but still, they overwhelmingly (70 percent to 21 percent) said they think he has united the country. The good: ISIS and the economy Trump gets his best marks for his handling of ISIS and the state of the economy, but not by overwhelming margins. Almost half (48 percent) approve of how his administration has worked to defeat the terrorist organization, although 40 percent disapprove. The strong economy is the where Americans see Trump as having the most impact. Twenty-one percent singled out that issue, followed closely by 20 percent who said taxes \u2014 just on the heels of the tax overhaul that Congress passed last month. Forty-four percent of Americans said the economy has improved under Trump, while 35 percent say it has stayed about the same. On trade, Americans are divided, with 44 percent disapproving of how he has handled the issue and 43 percent approving. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal after he was elected, and he wanted to renegotiate NAFTA or even end it. That is a winning issue with independents by a 6-point margin, and over three-fourths of Republicans like how he has handled trade. Loading... The bad: everything else On a host of issues, from race relations to women's rights to foreign policy, Americans think things have gotten worse under this president. Some 56 percent said race relations have worsened under Trump during the past year. (This survey was conducted before Trump reportedly used vulgar language in a meeting to disparage African nations and wondered why the United States continues to admit people from impoverished countries like Haiti rather than places like \u2014 overwhelmingly white \u2014 Norway.) While Republicans support Trump overwhelmingly on almost every other issue including his job performance, his handling of race relations is the one area in which they are split \u2014 24 percent of Republicans believe they have gotten better, 24 percent say they've gotten worse and another 48 percent say they've stayed about the same. When it comes to women's rights, 37 percent of Americans think things have worsened, 40 percent believe the issue has stayed about the same and 18 percent believe it has improved. But there is a significant gender gap. Nearly half of women (46 percent) believe the problem has worsened (15 percent think it has gotten better). Men, on the other hand, overwhelmingly think women's rights have stayed about the same (45 percent). One in 5 men (21 percent) think they've gotten better; 29 percent think they've gotten worse. Loading... Trump also gets low marks for how he has handled immigration and health care, with 58 percent disapproving of his handling of both issues. Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And Congress is trying to find a way forward on how to deal with so-called DREAMers, immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Some 700,000 had received temporary protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or the DACA program set up by President Barack Obama. Trump rescinded the executive order last year, and protections for DACA recipients expire March 5. Trump has maintained he wants funding for a wall along the southern border with Mexico, which he touted repeatedly on the campaign trail, in exchange for a reprieve from deportation for DACA recipients. The wall, getting rid of the health care mandate and paying for the tax bill all cost money \u2014 and on the deficit, 53 percent of Americans disapprove of how Trump has handled it. Just a third approve. Major worries about North Korea On his overall handling of foreign policy, over half (54 percent) of Americans say it has gotten worse over the past year, with a quarter saying it has gotten better. Trump has gotten into a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, threatening military action and even disparagingly tweeting about him, nicknaming Kim \"Little Rocket Man.\" None of that has helped Trump in the eyes of Americans. Overwhelming numbers say they are concerned about the possibility of war with North Korea. Seventy-one percent said so, with 44 percent saying they are very concerned. More than half (58 percent) disapprove of how Trump has handled the rising tensions with the nuclear power, and just over a third approve. Half of Americans believe North Korea is a major threat to U.S. security \u2014 a number that has actually decreased since April, when 61 percent saw it as a major threat. Now, 39 percent classify the country as a minor threat while only 8 percent said it poses no threat at all. Republicans are the least concerned of any political party subgroup, but a majority (57 percent) still say they are concerned in some way. About a quarter of GOP voters aren't very concerned, with 21 percent saying they aren't concerned at all. Public remains unconvinced on tax bill That tax bill is opposed by 46 percent of Americans, with 36 percent saying they approved of the bill. Again, that is split largely along partisan lines, with three-quarters of Republicans favoring the bill, and independents liking it by a 4-point margin. Seventy-nine percent of Democrats opposed the bill. The problem for Trump and congressional Republicans is that the public overwhelmingly sees the bill as largely helping business over working people nearly 3 to 1 (64 percent to 22 percent). Even Republicans are soft on it, with 47 percent saying it will help working people and 31 percent believing it largely helps businesses. Still, Americans are nearly evenly split as to whether the bill will hurt their family financially (40 percent) or help them (39 percent.) Sixty-nine percent of Republicans think it will help their family, while 65 percent of Democrats think it will do more harm than good. By a 4-point margin, independent voters think the bill will mostly help them (40 percent) rather than hurt (36 percent). Overall, Americans think that Trump's policies overwhelmingly support wealthy Americans (60 percent) over the middle class (25 percent) by a 35-point margin. Independents divide along similar lines, while 59 percent of Republicans think his policies help middle-class Americans. Loading... Looking ahead to 2018 Trump's inability to widen his coalition, especially by continuing to alienate independent voters, could be a major detriment in this year's looming midterm elections. Given where his approval ratings are and the fact that the first midterm of a president's term is typically a referendum on his job so far, there area plenty of signs of a possible wave that could flip control of the House \u2014 and, in a much longer shot, the Senate. Congressional Republicans have even lower ratings than Trump, with only 28 percent of Americans approving of the job they're doing, while 61 percent disapprove. However, the news isn't much better for Democrats, who find themselves in virtually the same position \u2014 28 percent approval with 57 percent disapproval. When asked who they would vote for in November, Democrats have a 6-point edge over Republicans, 46 percent to 40 percent. That is a shift since Marist last polled in December, finding a 13-point advantage for Democrats. Other recent polling has also given Democrats a double-digit edge \u2014 another harbinger of a possible wave that could swing control of the House. Miringoff attributed the swing \u2014 which has also tightened in past polls \u2014 to a shift in independent voters moving to uncertain. In this survey, they preferred Republicans by a 2-point margin, 38 percent to 36 percent, with 11 percent undecided. The survey was done when a potential immigration compromise looked possible, as Trump led a bipartisan group of lawmakers in conversation at the White House. \"Democrats and Republicans are mostly locked into supporting their respective party's candidates for Congress. Independents are swayed by what is happening at the time of the survey,\" Miringoff said. \"So, when President Trump is in Asia or his tweeting is less frequent or Congress gets its act together and gets things done, the government looks less dysfunctional. When this happens, the GOP brand is viewed less negatively and the gap between the parties on the congressional generic narrows. \" Loading... But when Trump becomes more unpredictable \u2014 especially on Twitter \u2014 those numbers could shift and harm the GOP. An overwhelming 78 percent majority think that the president's use of Twitter is a risky way to communicate, with just 15 percent saying it sends the right message. Even 57 percent of Republicans think his tweets are often risky, while 31 percent of GOP voters think it sends the right message. Partisan divide remains strong over past decade One bit of solace for the Trump White House may be that Obama's numbers on some of those same measures weren't stellar either after his first year. A December 2009 Marist poll found 47 percent said Obama had fallen below their expectations, 42 percent said he had met them and only 7 percent said he had exceeded them. But he also had a majority on his side when Americans were asked about the direction Obama was taking the country. Trump doesn't have that. Only 44 percent said the country was changing for the better, while 35 percent said it was changing for the worse. The direction of the country has stayed consistent \u2014 on the surface \u2014 with Americans appearing to be pessimistic in similar numbers. But inside the numbers, they have shifted in a big way. In September 2016, 58 percent of Democrats thought the country was moving in the right direction, while 85 percent of Republicans thought it was going in the wrong direction. Fast-forward to today, and it's the opposite \u2014 three-quarters (73 percent) of Republicans think the country is going in the right direction and 84 percent of Democrats think it's the opposite.",

Dean Heller's, R-Nev., office in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), programs on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. President Trump and congressional Democrats appear no closer to a deal on protecting \"Dreamers\" from deportation, but GOP lawmakers are working on a Plan B that would \u2014 if approved \u2014 prevent an election-year shutdown of the government, extending funding at least another month. A continuing resolution is due to expire this Friday, but Republicans have proposed kicking the can down the road once more with an extension on stop-gap funding through Feb. 16. Democrats have threatened a no-vote on any spending resolution that does not include an extension of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. However, Republicans hope that by including a two-year delay on implementation of unpopular taxes on medical devices and high-end employer-subsidized health care plans and a six-year reauthorization of the children's health program, or CHIP, they can get enough Democrats to come on board. Rank-and-file Republicans seem to like the deal and are hoping for a vote on Thursday, just ahead of the Friday deadline. As NPR's Susan Davis reports, \"The general consensus among members is this is simply a vote to buy time to continue negotiations on immigration and budget talks, and they want to cast the vote as a vote for/against a shutdown.\" Susan reports that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has taken the lead negotiating role for House Republicans. He is planning a meeting Wednesday with Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn as well as Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Stenny Hoyer. \"We don't want to shut down the government. ...We want to keep the government open,\" Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters. \"But we're not going to be held hostage to do things that we think are going to be contrary to the best interests of the American people.\" Hoyer's remarks echoed those of many Democrats, who said they are unlikely to support any measure without a deal on DACA, which has been thrown into question by the president's vulgar remarks last week about immigrants from African countries. As The Associated Press notes, \"Democrats appeared to see scant reason to bargain with a president many in their party view as holding racist views on immigration.\" The AP reports: \"Republicans have enough votes to push a measure through the House if they stay largely united. But some House GOP defense hawks could vote no because they want lawmakers to approve long-term spending for the Pentagon. Conservatives were also threatening to balk.\"",

            "article_content": "Lawmakers and President Trump are returning to town after prospects for an immigration deal dimmed at the end of last week. Congress also faces a Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump doesn't sound very optimistic about an immigration deal. He tweeted yesterday that, quote, \"deals can't get made when there is no trust.\" He was talking about the top Democrat in immigration negotiations. This is Senator Dick Durbin, who stands by his account of the president using vulgar language to describe African nations in a meeting last week about immigration. The president is blaming Democrats for the standoff on an immigration deal, but Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says it is on the president to make this happen. (SOUNDBITE OF WIS TELEVSION BROADCAST) LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mr. President, close the deal. Eighty percent of Americans want to give the DACA kids a better life, and 80 percent of Americans want to secure our border and change a broken immigration system. It's going to take you, Mr. President, to get this done. MARTIN: That was from WIS Television in South Carolina. So NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell is in the studio with us to talk about this. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: Where do talks stand? I mean, the key to all of this - the government shutdown is contingent on a spending bill. And the spending bill's contingent on a DACA solution - so DACA solution coming? SNELL: We are in a point where people are just buying time. So the idea is that the House is preparing to pass some sort of short-term spending bill. That would give them about another month to keep negotiating. Democrats haven't said where they stand on a short-term spending bill, but they do say they don't want a government shutdown. Nobody wants a government shutdown. They want more time to reach a deal. Problem is, they don't know what a deal would look like at this point because there was one bipartisan negotiation happening, and that was the negotiation between six senators that happened last week, and that was rejected by the White House. MARTIN: So the president says this is tough because there's no trust, in his words, to get a deal done. But isn't he the one who said last week that he was going to sign whatever Congress came up with? And then he reneged on that promise. SNELL: Right. I have spoken with many Democrats who say they don't know what comes next because they don't know what to believe. We heard Senator Graham say that it was on the president. And that's in part because Trump said in that big televised event at the White House that he would take the heat, that he would sign anything. And they took him at his word on that. And then when this White House meeting happened on Thursday, that no longer seemed to be the case. And Democrats felt blindsided by the scenario they entered. MARTIN: Lay out first the strategic play by Democrats and Republicans in this moment. SNELL: Democrats think that there is reason to get a deal because both sides - Republicans, Democrats, the White House - all of them have said that they want an agreement for DREAMers. They don't want these 700,000, 800,000 people to be left in a situation where they don't know what happens in March. The - they hope that that is enough to get everybody on the same page. Republicans, on the other hand - there is a faction of the hard-line Republicans, particularly in the House, who view this as an opportunity to remind the president what he ran on and try to move the entire Congress further to the right. They think that if the House can pass a tougher immigration bill, it will put pressure on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate to put that bill up for a vote in the Senate. MARTIN: But could they do that without Democratic support? SNELL: They can't get that passed in the Senate. There just simply aren't enough votes. This would require 60 votes, and there are not 60 Republicans in the Senate. MARTIN: So when you think about the fact that a DACA solution was something that it appeared that both parties were all in for - right? - like, everyone agreed this is untenable; we've got to fix this. If they can't make this happen, what does it portend for the future in what is already complicated because it's an election year? SNELL: It's very difficult to see how Congress does much of anything if they get this DACA deal done and they get a spending bill done that funds them through the end of the year. So they say they want to do infrastructure and these big-idea things that take time, and they take more agreement than they seem to have. MARTIN: NPR's Kelsey Snell for us this morning.

Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff from Arizona, announced this week that he will run for the U.S. Senate to help advance President Trump's agenda. But he is breaking from the president on the future of people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \"Deport them,\" Arpaio told NPR Morning Edition's Rachel Martin in an interview that aired Thursday morning. \"When we come across these kids, or some are older than just kids,\" Arpaio said, \"then deport them. You deport them back to the country they came from.\" Arpaio, 85, has devoted his career to cracking down on immigrants in the U.S. illegally and has used highly controversial tactics toward that goal \u2014 sometimes in defiance of federal court orders. He instructed his deputies, for example, to detain Latino residents and ask them about their legal status. He then ignored a federal judge's order to stop. He was convicted of criminal contempt for that in July. But Trump pardoned him. The immigration firebrand's entrance into the Arizona race could have far-reaching consequences for the party, as Arpaio's views will likely receive an outsize megaphone. It will likely mean that immigration \u2014 and conservative hard-line views on the subject \u2014 will dominate a Republican primary in a state that is now almost a third Latino and in a country where Hispanics are gaining increasing clout politically nationally. DACA recipients as ambassadors, like the Peace Corps? Under President Barack Obama, after the House did not pass the comprehensive immigration bill that garnered 68 votes in the Senate, immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children were allowed to stay in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, executive order. Trump rescinded DACA last year and is letting it expire by March. Trump's decision is now hung up in the courts, but he said this week that he wants a \"bill of love\" that allows the some 800,000 DACA recipients to stay. That, however, comes with conditions that Democrats don't appear ready to accept, including funding for a wall along the southern U.S. border. Arpaio told NPR that DACA recipients should be sent back in this controversial way: \"They can do a lot of good in those countries. They have education here and help out and be good ambassadors from the United States to their country.  That's just my idea.\" He likened it to the Peace Corps and indicated he would be open to their returning later to the United States legally. \"Should we deport all the people in Chicago?\" But asked about the risks many could face going back to dangerous countries, places some of these DACA recipients have never been or where they don't speak the language, Arpaio pushed back. \"We have danger here, so should we deport all the people in Chicago with all the shooting and murder?\" Arpaio asked. \"If they want to get out and go to another country, should the other countries welcome them? I don't think they would.\" He continued: \"It's unfortunate there's problems in other countries, but that's ... you live in those other countries, you have to do something there whether it's through the political system in those countries to try to alleviate the problem. \"We pumped a lot of money into these foreign countries \u2014 tons of money to help their security, law enforcement, and that's OK, but you have to do it right.\" \"Make sure you get the right people to come into our country\" Asked whether he would close all of U.S. borders to migrants, Arpaio adamantly said no. \"Just make sure you get the right people to come into our country,\" he contended, noting that his parents came from Italy. \"I have a personal interest in that situation.\" Of course, when Arpaio's parents came from Italy, there were far fewer restrictions and immigration was most certainly not \"merit-based.\" Italians at the turn of the century and into the mid-20th century, like people in other countries today, were escaping poverty, war and famine. It wasn't the doctor from Milan heading to America. A history of controversy In the 1990s, Arpaio controversially also set up an outdoor Tent City jail in the blistering Arizona sun. It was criticized as inhumane by activists, and his successor said there was no evidence it made people less likely to commit crimes. It began to be torn down last year and was closed in October. Arpaio was also closely linked to the \"Birther Movement,\" which peddled the falsehood that Obama was not born in the United States. That's how Arpaio and Trump got to know each other. How Arpaio's run could affect politics in Arizona and nationally Because of his reputation, Arpaio would be a highly controversial figure running in the Republican primary. But his candidacy might cut a couple of different ways. On the one hand, he will draw unwanted attention for the GOP nationally. On the other, Arpaio could unwittingly help establishment Republicans' preferred candidate get the nomination. It's possible he could split the vote with another hard-line conservative, Kelli Ward, and opens an avenue for Rep. Martha McSally, who is expected to announce her candidacy Friday. In fact, a poll paid for by a local TV station in Arizona and out Wednesday showed exactly that \u2014 McSally with 31 percent, Arpaio at 29 and Ward with 25. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner, a senator from Colorado, declined Wednesday to explicitly rule out throwing the NRSC's support behind Arpaio if he wins the primary. \"It's too early to speculate who's going to win, who's not going to win,\" Gardner said on MSNBC, adding, \"I think that is a conversation much further down the road.\" Gardner was publicly critical and refused to support controversial Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual assault by multiple women, many of whom were teenagers at the time of the alleged incidents. When it came to Arpaio, Gardner declined to take the same stance. \"It's difficult to compare what happened in Alabama to any other state,\" Gardner said. He seemed willing to let the primary play out instead: \"Is he going to be the nominee? I can't tell that; you can't tell that; only the people of Arizona can tell that. That's why we have campaigns; that's why we have primaries and races. That's not my choice. That's not my decision to make at the senatorial committee.\" Arpaio's candidacy all but guarantees that immigration will again be elevated in an election year, something that has not benefited Republicans in the past. \"Right now, that's what we need \u2014 is some leadership,\" Arpaio told NPR, \"and get this problem solved.\" It's the one issue that has galvanized and fired up the most ardent in the conservative base \u2014 and made Latinos reliable Democratic voters in the past few elections. Immigration's potential dominance in this race could have broad potential consequences for the party in the age of Trump and as Arizona and the country continue to become more racially diverse.

Updated at 4:27 p.m. ET President Trump refused to say Wednesday whether he would grant an interview to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians who attacked that election. \"Certainly I'll see what happens,\" Trump said. \"But when they have no collusion, and nobody's found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you'd even have an interview.\" Trump repeated his oft-stated claim that the multiple investigations of Russian interference shadowing his presidency are without merit \u2014 despite guilty pleas from two former associates, former campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the indictment of his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. \"It's a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election,\" Trump said. \"I'll speak to attorneys. I can only say this: There was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it.\" The White House has declined to confirm reports that Mueller plans to seek an interview with the president, although a spokeswoman has said the White House is cooperating fully with the special counsel's investigation. Trump's comments came during a joint news conference with Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway. The two leaders also discussed military cooperation, trade and their different responses to climate change. Trump also reiterated his insistence that any legislative deal to protect young people living in the U.S. illegally from deportation must include funds for border security, including his controversial border wall. \"Any solution has to include the wall because without the wall it all doesn't work,\" Trump said. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been trying to forge a compromise that would offer permanent protection from deportation for the so-called DREAMers, who were brought to the country illegally as children. A deal, if reached, could be included as part of must-pass spending legislation later this month. Trump and his fellow Republicans also want that measure to increase military spending. Credit:  AP \"We have a very, very powerful military. We're getting more powerful by the month, by the day,\" Trump said. He encouraged Norway to increase its own military spending. Like other NATO allies, Norway has pledged to devote 2 percent of its total economy to defense. \"I believe Norway will get there quite soon,\" Trump said. Trump said Norway's purchase of fighter jets and other U.S. military hardware contributes to America's trade surplus with that country. \"In November, we started delivering the first F-52s and F-35 fighter jets,\" Trump said. \"It's a $10 billion order.\" (There is no such aircraft as the F-52. The president may have misspoken in referring to the order, which is for 52 of the F-35 fighters.) Solberg highlighted another item on Norway's American shopping list: electric cars from Tesla. \"Norway is combating climate change. It's an important issue for us. And we are committed to the Paris Agreement,\" Solberg said. \"The green economy is an area where we see tremendous economic and business opportunities in the future.\" Trump has announced his intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a source of friction with Norway and other allies. He insists the voluntary commitments in the Paris deal imposed an unfair burden on the United States, the world's No. 2 emitter of carbon pollution. Solberg also gently chided Trump over his suspicion of international trade agreements. \"The American economy is doing well and our economic relations are flourishing,\" Solberg said. \"For a small country like Norway, it's important for our ability to trade and to invest across borders that we have fair trade and that we have multilateral trade systems also.\"",

President Trump told a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday that he wants a bill to allow young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally to remain, saying that such a measure should be \"a bipartisan bill of love\" and that \"we can do it.\" Trump also said that he was open to a larger measure overhauling immigration laws, but that it made the most sense to first settle the Obama-era Deferred Action On Childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA, issue. Authority allowing for the so-called DREAMers covered by the measure to remain in the country expires March 5. The president met with lawmakers for nearly an hour. The session was unusual in that a small pool of reporters was allowed to remain for the duration, an apparent effort to rebut one of the premises of the best-selling book Fire and Fury: Inside The Trump White House, which portrays the president as in over his head and possibly mentally unfit for office. Trump talked about how the current system in Congress doesn't lend itself to getting anything done. The president said there was so much anger and hostility in Congress that lawmakers should consider bringing back earmarks, the pork-barrel spending that GOP leaders outlawed, seen by many as one of the prime components of the \"swamp\" Trump campaigned against. As to what sort of immigration legislation he would approve, Trump said that he was reliant on lawmakers and that even if they produced legislation he wasn't \"in love with,\" he would still support it. He also said he would take the heat for both Republicans and Democrats if they get criticism over a compromise immigration measure, adding that his \"whole life has been heat\" and that to a certain extent he prefers it that way. In remarks afterward, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., threw cold water on the idea of a stand-alone DACA bill, saying Democrats have \"little faith\" that the measure will win approval unless it is attached to a must-pass bill. Schumer wants DACA legislation attached to a spending bill needed to keep the government open. The conservative Club for Growth immediately criticized the possibility of again allowing special-interest earmarks. \"If Republicans bring back earmarks, then it virtually guarantees that they will lose the House,\" said the the group's president, David McIntosh. Earmarks are an issue that John McCain campaigned on and against as the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. He largely won the argument in Washington, leading to the practice's retirement. The president also addressed the issue of a border wall with Mexico, saying the U.S. needs one \"in certain areas obviously that aren't protected by nature\" and where existing fences are in bad shape and need to be fixed or rebuilt. But Trump also said, \"There are large areas where you don't need a wall.\" And on the potential presidential candidacy of Oprah Winfrey, Trump said, \"Yeah, I'll beat Oprah. Oprah would be a lot of fun. I know her very well. You know I did one of her last shows.\" He added, \"I like Oprah; I don't think she's gonna run.\" Speaking of one of her last shows, this was Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Winfrey's show in 2009.",

NBC News reports Trump's lawyers are \"discussing a range of potential options for the format.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The president of the United States spent part of Monday addressing what he trusted was a supportive audience - farmers at a meeting in Nashville. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, are you happy you voted for me. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: You are so lucky that I gave you that privilege. INSKEEP: It was a campaign-style appearance, and it happens while an investigation of the 2016 election gets closer to some conclusion. Several past Trump campaign aides were indicted or pleaded guilty as a special counsel examines Russians - Russia's involvement in the election. NBC News first reported that special counsel Robert Muller is thinking of interviewing President Trump himself. NPR's Mara Liasson has been traveling with the president. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: I'm just thinking, Mara, the president's staff decided against sending him out for a year-end news conference. They don't like him answering a lot of questions. What are the odds they'd willingly submit to an interview by the special counsel? LIASSON: Well, the president's lawyers say they are cooperating with the special counsel. We don't know if Robert Mueller is, as he has been reported to be, ready to interview the president. If he is, that would mean he's probably getting to the end of his investigation, something that the president's lawyers have been predicting. But if he does want to interview the president, there probably would be a series of negotiations that would ensue about under what terms, and would it be in writing, would it be in person, et cetera. INSKEEP: We should remember, though, whatever the president says to a federal investigator - whatever a citizen says to a federal investigator - it has to be the truth, right? It'd be a crime to lie to a federal investigator. LIASSON: Absolutely. And that's how presidents in the past have sometimes gotten in trouble in investigations. INSKEEP: So that is looming over the president as he begins 2018, but he is trying to get started with legislation in 2018, which he talked about a little bit in this speech to farmers. He spoke of immigration policy yesterday in Tennessee. Let's hear just a little bit of what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We are going to end chain migration. We are going to end the lottery system, and we are going to build the wall. INSKEEP: OK - chain migration, lottery system, building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border - but this is a negotiation where he needs Democratic votes. What's in that for Democrats? LIASSON: That's right. This is a negotiation over a deal that, presumably, would legalize the DREAMers, those young people who, in many cases, were brought here illegally as children by their parents. And what the president just did is lay out his demands for legalizing the DREAMers. Now, Democrats and Republicans both say that there is a compromise to be had, and it would presumably be some kind of a deal where the president could say he got a wall and Democrats would say he didn't get a wall, but what we don't know yet is, what does a wall mean? Is it more than just border security? And it was interesting that Republican Senator Jim Lankford, who was at the White House last week for a Republicans-only immigration meeting, tweeted about the wall the other day where he said that there is no plan to build a 2,500-mile concrete wall. There are places where fencing or drones or more border agents would be more effective. These are all things he pointed out that Democrats have voted for in the wall. So what he's trying to say is a wall doesn't mean a big physical barrier. What we don't know is what does the president think he needs politically in terms of a wall. INSKEEP: Of course, there's already a fence over hundreds of miles... LIASSON: Yes... INSKEEP: ...Of border... LIASSON: ...There's already a fence. INSKEEP: ...Security measures. I want to ask about one other thing, Mara Liasson, because I want to talk about big, one-name stars in politics. Now, when I think of big, one-name stars, I think of Mara just for starters... LIASSON: Ah, thank you. INSKEEP: ...But there's also Oprah. What do you make of Oprah being talked about as a potential candidate? LIASSON: Well, Oprah made a very powerful speech at the Golden Globes, and all of a sudden, Twitter was atwitter with Oprah running for president in 2020... INSKEEP: Twitter was atwitter... LIASSON: ...With her partner encouraged, and the president's spokesperson, the other day, said that Trump is running for re-election and he welcomes all comers. But what's interesting is back in 1999, Trump said that he wanted to run for president and his first choice for vice president would be Oprah. He said, she's great. We'll win. INSKEEP: (Laughter) But, you know, the president can change his mind. Sometimes he... LIASSON: Yes... INSKEEP: ...Does it. LIASSON: Yes. And he does. INSKEEP: Well, Mara, thanks very much, really appreciate it. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's Mara, also known as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

It may be a new year, but Congress plans to spend most of January wrapping up old business left over from 2017. Congressional leaders are promising to head off any chance of a government shutdown well before the Jan. 19 deadline, but a nearly yearlong fight over President Trump's demands to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could threaten those plans. Democrats want the upcoming spending bill to also permanently protect the roughly 700,000 immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought to the U.S. as children. They stand to lose the protected status they were given under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Trump rescinded that program last year, setting an expiration date in March, and congressional Republicans have agreed to work with Democrats on a new law to grant rights to those immigrants. Those talks appeared to be progressing over the holidays, but Trump's demands that the deal include money to build a border wall could prevent an agreement. Trump repeated his demands Saturday during a news conference held during a weekend planning retreat with congressional leaders at Camp David. \"We want the wall,\" Trump said. \"The wall is going to happen, or we're not going to have DACA.\" But Democrats are threatening to block any spending bill that includes funding for a wall \u2014 even if that means shutting down the government. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said Friday that Democrats would not accept the latest offer from Republicans because it included $18 billion to build a wall. \"President Trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,\" Durbin said. \"With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction.\" Alabama Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in last week, which leaves Republicans with just 51 votes in the Senate. GOP leaders will need votes from at least nine Senate Democrats to pass any spending or immigration legislation. To do that, negotiators will have to balance Democrats' calls for citizenship for all people protected under DACA against Trump's demands for border security and the construction of a border wall. That standoff comes at a critical moment in the talks. Lawmakers are set to return to Washington on Monday with hopes of finalizing an immigration and spending bill while continuing talks to reauthorize a controversial wiretapping program, fully fund children's health insurance and send billions in disaster aid to roughly half a dozen states and U.S. territories. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Thursday that he is confident that negotiators will reach a deal without the risk of a shutdown. \"Nobody wants to shut the government down on either side,\" McConnell said. \"I'm optimistic we'll get a resolution to many of those issues before Jan. 19.\" Finishing that work in just two weeks would be ambitious under any circumstances, but the talks come as Congress is also gearing up for the start of an election season that will determine which party controls both the House and the Senate. Congressional negotiators were nearing an agreement in late December on the spending portion of the talks, but leaders have been unwilling to finalize any single portion of the deal until all other elements are complete. That strategy is based on a political bet that a big, broad deal will include so many elements that nearly every lawmaker will be able to find something in the bill that they can support. That plan is particularly risky if lawmakers on either side try to add in politically motivated provisions \u2014 like abortion funding restrictions or means testing for government aid programs \u2014 known as poison pills. The House plans to kickstart action on some parts of the broader agreement early next week with a vote to extend a controversial wiretapping program authorized by Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. Leaders are also in talks over plans to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is set to expire in March, though some states may run out of funding sooner. The program generally enjoys bipartisan support and could be added to a big spending bill in hopes of making it more appealing to lawmakers who might be skittish about other parts of the deal. One group that may need some extra convincing are conservatives who are frustrated with Democrats' demands to increase funding for domestic programs as part of any eventual spending deal.  Democrats want the upcoming spending agreement to uphold a recent pattern of funding domestic programs at the same rate as military expenditures. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that cutting domestic funding would starve programs including health insurance for veterans and newly created initiatives to combat the opioid crisis. Schumer said there are a number of issues that have yet to be resolved, but like McConnell said he believes a deal is within reach. \"Democrats are hopeful we can get this all done,\" Schumer said. \"We had very serious discussions with the Republican leadership in those areas, and now there will be staff discussions in the next few days trying to get those things done.\"",

How? Trump's takedown came after Bannon was quoted in a new book \u2014 Fire And Fury: Inside Trump's White House by Michael Wolff \u2014 calling the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. and other top Trump campaign advisers took with Russian intermediaries in June 2016 \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\" The White House, however, continued to take a hard line against Bannon on Thursday. During the daily press briefing, press secretary Sarah Sanders claimed that she wasn't aware that Bannon and Trump were \"ever particularly close.\" There's plenty of evidence to the contrary though, given that Bannon was among Trump's highest-ranking campaign and White House staffers, and reportedly had walk-in privileges to the Oval Office. And when asked whether the pro-Trump Breitbart News, which Bannon returned to after leaving the White House, should consider parting ways with its chairman given his criticisms of Trump, Sanders said \"I certainly think it's something they should look at.\" Taking to Twitter the president fired off a late-night salvo \u2014 he'd never granted Wolff access to the White House, Trump tweeted, saying the book was \"full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist,\" and referring to Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve.\" I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist. Look at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! Wolff says his book is based on more than 200 interviews with Bannon and other top Trump advisers. But Sanders also disputed the reported wide-ranging access Wolff was granted, saying that at least 30 requests for access were denied, including two dozen requests for a one-on-one interview with Trump, which he was never granted. Trump's public and blunt distancing from his onetime top campaign and White House aide was followed by a legal threat. On Wednesday night, Beverly Hills-based lawyer Charles J. Harder sent Bannon a letter claiming his interviews with Wolff violated a nondisclosure agreement he had signed with the Trump campaign. The cease-and-desist letter threatened a lawsuit. However, throughout his business and political career, Trump has consistently threatened adversaries with litigation and often never followed up with actual lawsuits. Still, Bannon insists he continues to support Trump. He made the brief statement on a late-night Breitbart News radio show broadcast on SiriusXM \u2014 a program that, by and large, ignored the Trump-Bannon blowup that had dominated the news cycle everywhere else. Bannon and other panelists discussed immigration and the coming debate over whether to provide permanent protections for enrollees in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Bannon only addressed the feud when a caller specifically mentioned it. Trump took notice of the compliment. At the beginning of a meeting with Republican lawmakers about immigration policy, Trump told reporters, \"I don't know, he called me a great man last night, so, you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\" Trump went on to say that he and Bannon do not speak on the phone anymore. President Trump on Steve Bannon: \"He called me a great man last night, so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick ... I don't talk to him\" pic.twitter.com/gMffRI0tmx On Thursday morning, Wolff published a column on The Hollywood Reporter's website explaining how the new book came about. Wolff said that shortly after Trump's 2016 win, he asked the president-elect for access to write about the incoming administration. Trump didn't say yes, but didn't say no, Wolff writes: \"Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around \u2014 checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the 'system,' and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch.\" Wolff describes a White House staff that became increasingly alarmed at Trump's disinterest in governing, chaotic management style and seething rage. \"For Rex Tillerson, he was a moron,\" he writes. \"For Gary Cohn, he was dumb as [s***]. For H.R. McMaster, he was a hopeless idiot. For Steve Bannon, he had lost his mind.\" Many of the staffers quoted in the book are denying its details, and the White House is dismissing it as \"trashy tabloid fiction.\" Trump's lawyer, Harder, followed up on his Bannon cease-and-desist letter with a similar note to Wolff and his publisher, warning that \"your publication of the false/baseless statements about Mr. Trump gives rises to, among other claims, defamation by libel.\" But Trump's high-profile incendiary response to Bannon only heightened the attention being focused on the book. Shortly after Trump's statement was distributed to the press Wednesday, Fire And Fury had shot to the top slot of Amazon's best-seller list.",

            "article_content": "On the domestic front in 2018, President Trump is expected to focus on immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On the domestic front in 2018, President Trump is expected to focus on immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care. The Senate returns Wednesday, and President Trump made his way back to Washington on Monday after lying fairly low to end the year in Palm Beach, Fla., at his personal resort. His first year was a mixed bag of legislative accomplishments (tax overhaul) and failures (health care), the book is still out on his foreign policy posture, and the Russia probe continues. So what should we expect in 2018? There are four areas of domestic policy the president is particularly focused on, according to the White House \u2014 immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care. \"I would expect to see those four areas, as well as national security, which never goes away,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, per USA Today. More pressingly, there is a Jan. 19 deadline to pass yet another spending bill to keep the lights on in the government. Here is a look at some of those key priority areas and variables: National security The president's team would make the case that the U.S. is safer now and that ISIS is on the run. But there have been lone wolf attacks domestically on this president's watch, including a truck attack in New York that killed eight people and another man's failed attempt to blow himself up in the New York subway. Attacks like these have prompted the president to move to curtail the immigration system further. His critics argue that doing so emboldens recruitment for those trying to pull off or inspire these kinds of attacks. So that will remain an area of political tension. Iran The president has tweeted support for protests against the current Iranian regime, while also opposing (yet not completely ripping up) the Iranian nuclear deal. Trump has tweeted support for the protests, such as one in Tehran last week, against the current Iranian regime.\n                \n                    \n                    Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump has tweeted support for the protests, such as one in Tehran last week, against the current Iranian regime. At least 21 people have been reported dead in Iran, as the regime has moved against the protesters. But it's still unclear what this president wants to do tangibly to effect change. Vice President Pence has brought up the difference from past administrations' approaches, but remember, back in 2009 when protests also cropped up, it was a very different kind of Iranian leadership that then-President Barack Obama was dealing with. Now, there is a more pragmatic leader in President Hassan Rouhani than there was in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. So what would change in Iran actually bring? What's more, Trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist America First policy. So there is a question about the Trump Doctrine: When does the United States intervene and when does it not? What is the trigger to say, \"OK, this is where the United States gets involved\"? North Korea Anyone who thought the North Korean leader would be cowed by a more saber-rattling U.S. stance was mistaken. Kim Jong Un took to state airwaves during the New Year's holiday weekend to tout that his country had made progress as a nuclear power \u2014 and that he has a button to launch attacks on his desk. In North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's address, he talked about his country's progress as a nuclear power.\n                \n                    \n                    Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's address, he talked about his country's progress as a nuclear power. The White House says it remains focused on the \"denuclearization\" of North Korea. But the president also tweeted criticism of China, a key player in achieving that goal. And, ironically, it is China that is stepping forward as more of a world leader as the United States has receded, as some see it, under Trump. China The view from China of Trump? Yan Xuetong, dean of Tsinghua University's Institute of Modern International Relations, told The New Yorker: \"American leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. In 1991, when Bush, Sr., launched the war against Iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort. This time, if Trump launched a war against anyone, I doubt he would get support from even five countries.\" \"For Chinese leaders, Yan said, 'Trump is the biggest strategic opportunity.' [New Yorker reporter Evan Osnos] asked Yan how long he thought the opportunity would last. 'As long as Trump stays in power,' he replied.\" So, for as much as Trump might think Chinese President Xi  Jinping likes him (\"He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of China\"), Xi might have a different reason for feeling that way than Trump thinks. Immigration As noted, for Trump, immigration is tied to national security. So don't expect him to pull back on his push to curtail various programs and make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based. Democrats, though, feel as if they have leverage in this election year on the issue, especially because there is generally bipartisan support for a DREAM Act or a path to legalization, if not citizenship, for people in the U.S. illegally who haven't committed crimes. (The DREAM Act would provide a path to citizenship for people brought to the United States as children.) Trump said in September that he was giving Congress six months to address DACA, the executive action implemented by Obama on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. That means Congress has until March to do something. DACA allowed people brought to the country as children to avoid deportation. Obama signed the executive order after Congress failed to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration overhaul. \"We think we have to have a DACA solution,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Nov. 30. We'll see shortly what that is or whether it is even true. Still, Trump's posture doesn't appear to be one through which a deal has been made. In fact, he tweeted Friday that any DACA deal must include building a wall with Mexico and ending both \"chain migration\" and the visa lottery system. The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost! Infrastructure Infrastructure is always dangled as a potentially big area of bipartisanship. Both parties say they want it, and yet nothing has gotten done in the past decade. Why? The question of how to pay for it. Yet, Trump teased that \"maybe we start with infrastructure\" in the new year. \"Infrastructure is by far the easiest,\" the president said Dec. 22 during the bill signing for the tax overhaul. \"People want it \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure as you know. I could've started with infrastructure \u2014 I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.\" Having it \"done pretty quickly\" could be an overstatement. Republicans are going to need 60 votes, which now means the support of nine Democrats or independents after Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday. Welfare, entitlements and health care Ryan, R-Wis., has indicated that he would like to target welfare and entitlements, but Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are not on board with all that Ryan wants to do.

Watson, a single mother and nursing student, received benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The Trump administration is reviewing the programs, and the White House is preparing a January executive order related to welfare, according to Politico. NPR's Mara Liasson reports that the president \"wants to keep his promise not to touch the big, middle-class entitlements \u2014 Medicare and Social Security \u2014 but he is interested in reforming means-tested programs that target lower-income Americans.\" The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs affects about 1.5 million families, and Liasson reports: \"White House aides say they are now looking at a number of additional changes, including tighter work requirements and drug-testing rules for food stamps, Medicaid and housing assistance. Those changes may not save much money the way changes in the big middle-class entitlements like Medicare or Social Security might. But it will help the president highlight an issue that seems to motivate his base in a year when getting Republican voters excited is the No. 1 goal.\" The Senate also seems to be less-than-enthused to change any of the big entitlements. McConnell, who will be clinging to an even narrower 51-49 majority in 2018, told Axios that he \"would not expect to see\" the Senate work on making changes to those programs without Democrats. \"I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\" McConnell told NPR. \"The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it.\" Translation: He is not about to walk the plank without holding hands with Democrats \u2014 and Democrats aren't going anywhere near the edge of that ship. It's the same story when it comes to health care. \"Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,\" McConnell told NPR. \"We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.\" Does Ryan resign? So if a tax overhaul has passed \u2014 and Ryan can't get his next agenda on entitlements, welfare or health care through the Senate, it does raise the question \u2014 does the speaker think about stepping aside in the next few months or after the election? Remember, this is not a job he wanted. He was seen as the only one who could get the votes to become speaker after John Boehner resigned. It has certainly been rumored that Ryan is considering resigning \u2014 and it makes some sense. At this point, it's just speculation, but worth watching. \"I ain't goin' anywhere,\" Ryan told reporters after a  Dec. 14 Politico piece speculating on his resignation. His office added, \"This is pure speculation.\" Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, \"As the speaker himself said today, he's not going anywhere any time soon.\" Boehner's representatives denied he was leaving up until right before he did. Midterms will shape the year Not much traditionally gets done in midterm years, McConnell is skittish about diving into the president's thornier priorities and Democrats feel they have some leverage now on things like immigration and infrastructure. So don't expect them to jump at the chance to work with this president, in this election year, without major concessions.",

It's not enough to make list after list. The Turning the Tables project seeks to suggest alternatives to the traditional popular music canon, and to do more than that, too: to stimulate conversation about how hierarchies emerge and endure. This year, Turning the Tables considers how women and non-binary artists are shaping music in our moment, from the pop mainstream to the sinecures of jazz and contemporary classical music. Our list of the 200 Greatest Songs By Women+ offers a soundtrack to a new century. This series of essays takes on another task. The 25 arguments writers make in these pieces challenge the usual definitions of influence. Some rethink the building legacies of popular artists; others celebrate those who create within subcultures, their innovations rippling outward over time. As always, women forge new pathways in sound; today, they also make waves under the surface of culture by confronting, in their music, the increased fluidity of \"woman\" itself. What is a woman? It's a timeless question on the surface, but one deeply engaged with whatever historical moment in which it is asked. Our 25 Most Influential Women Musicians of the 21st Century illuminate its complexities. \u2014Ann Powers Janelle Mon\u00e1e is many people in alternate timelines at once. She's an archivist of right now, interpreter of back then, dreamer of one day. She imagines black people into the future in the midst of past and present threats of erasure. And after two studio EPs and three albums, the full scope of her work illuminates how the past, present and future might exist simultaneously. Who we were, who we are and who we'd like to be swirl and layer until timelines merge. She's Cindi Mayweather, an android on the run from an oppressive government dressed in black and white. She's Jane, a human who holds onto her memories even as powers-that-be aim to systematically erase them. She's a singer and actress; a queer, black woman who grew up in Kansas, City, Kan. to working class parents; an Atlanta transplant who sold her CDs and sang on Atlanta University Center library steps before signing with Bad Boy in 2008. Mon\u00e1e's first self-released demo album The Audition (2003) was situated in both the present and the future. \"Lettin' Go,\" a song about getting fired from Office Depot, appears on the same project as \"Metropolis,\" a four minute primer for the Afrofuturist world that Cindi Mayweather would love and live in. The universe she accelerated herself into was centuries away from the right now. Mon\u00e1e received the first of several Grammy nominations for \"Many Moons,\" a song from her 2007 release Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase). In Metropolis, androids are \"the Other\" in a dystopian reality set in 2719. The story of Metropolis revolves around Cindi Mayweather \u2013 just one of the characters Mon\u00e1e would perform as, onstage and off, for much of her career. These characters allow Mon\u00e1e to sometimes speak in symbol and shadow. Timelines blur then sharpen, and visions of the future collide with present realities. \"Left the city, my mama she said 'Don't come back home / These kids round' killin' each other, they lost they minds, they gone,'\" she sings in Metropolis' \"Sincerely, Jane.\" Even when Mon\u00e1e sings in character, the sense of something immediately true to her own life bobs into and outside of these voices. \"[The inspiration for 'Sincerely Jane'] was a letter from my mother, and she was basically warning me of all the things that were going on in Kansas,\" Mon\u00e1e said to Public Radio International in 2009. \"And it was just her plea to tell me to stay where I was and run to the future because my present was not a safe place for us to be.\" The idea of envisioning a reality uncoupled from the structures that tie us to a threatening present is the power and affirmation of imagining black futures. Ytasha Womack, author of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture describes Afrofuturism as \"an intersection of black cultures as well as imagination, technology, mysticism, and liberation.\" For Womack, \"the value in exploring these ideas is the very real understanding that it liberates us.\" Mon\u00e1e's cinematic 2010 album The ArchAndroid finds Cindi Mayweather in Metropolis' far-future, still trying to get free. \"Running fast through time like Tubman and John Henry,\" Mayweather navigates \"Neon Valley Streets,\" to illegally be with the human she's fallen in love with, Anthony Greendown. Although their robot-human relationship is centuries away from now, Mon\u00e1e connects it to medieval symbols of love and courting: men on horses and women locked away in towers. Inherent to all forward-looking work, from music to tech to organizing for social change, is what Dr. Moya Bailey, author of Vampires and Cyborgs and professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality studies, calls \"radical imagination.\" A term dependent on the work of late activist Grace Lee Boggs, it asks us to create and interrogate images of the world that we want so that they might propel us into the future. Afrofuturism re-affirms that the imagination is a necessary tool for dismantling old structures. \"When I think about our radical imaginations, I want us to get out of our current ideas of how the world works,\" Bailey says. \"So, even in our most radical futures, with the exception of Octavia Butler, there's a lot of assumed monogamy, a lot of assumed heteronormativity, we're still in a capitalist system, etc. There ends up being a replication of a lot of the hierarchies that we have now.\" In Mon\u00e1e's radical imagination, we see both the existence of these old hierarchies \u2014 the android as Other, the rule of an authoritarian regime \u2014 and, through the stories of her narrators, a path beyond them. Womack notes that creating images of the future was the work of Sun Ra and his Arkestra, as well as George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic. Wondaland Arts Society, the record label and artist collective Mon\u00e1e co-founded, also reflects the communal experience of imagining black futures and, by doing so, inhabits a future where our communities survive. Wondaland expands on the way that Mon\u00e1e plays with time. The label's headquarters feature red-painted walls with clocks stuck in different hours. Atlanta-based band St. Beauty, part of the collective, often sings luxuriously about the now, stretching out a moment to explore all of its textures. The 2015 hit \"Classic Man\" by Jidenna, another Wondaland artist, was an image of black masculinity that transposed a paradigm of respectability from the past onto realities of today. Time is even evident in the tension between the futures that Mon\u00e1e imagines and the present that she navigates as a queer, black woman and artist whose image is marketed as well as her art. In another offering of what black masculinity can be, \"Classic Man [Chopped and Screwed]\" can be heard in Moonlight, the Oscar-winning movie that illuminates a gay black man's life through vignettes in time. Mon\u00e1e's role in that film and in the 2016 film Hidden Figures were also exercises in time-travel. Set in the 1960s and filmed in the months leading up to the 2016 election, Hidden Figures allowed Mon\u00e1e to be \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 in the black past and in the black present simultaneously. Musically, Mon\u00e1e's vision of the future drew closer with Electric Lady (2013). By the time she released Dirty Computer in 2018, Mon\u00e1e had shifted to an image of reality that felt familiar. \"It's a reality that you're literally stepping into,\" Womack says of Mon\u00e1e's representation. \"To talk about the near future is to acknowledge that things are transforming and changing and that you play a role in that immediate change.\" In the album and its visual counterpart, there's color and joy that spans timelines. The project's rollout came with an announcement tied to Mon\u00e1e's most contemporary character, herself, publicly sharing her queerness for the first time. This is digital archiving: building records of now and preserving histories to analyze, celebrate and re-interpret in the future. In Dirty Computer, we see queer love in the face of a government that seeks to erase memories. Moments tied to specific instances in recent musical memory accompany images of a future reminiscent of both past and present. Neoprene and neon exist in the same timeline as hovering pink vintage cars. It's in this layering of time that we're reminded that the present moment is not just in conversation with the past, but that the past continues into the present moment. In light of the current and continued marginalization and silencing of black, brown and queer communities, Mon\u00e1e's work reminds us that it's not just collective memory that informs our future. When we document the ways we intimately and publicly exist in these moments in time, we build that future, too. And Mon\u00e1e shows us that we don't need to be tied to one vision of the future. We can create worlds that help us process current hierarchies and others that try to break out of those structures. Through this imagination, our vision of what's to come sharpens and adapts. This idea of \"practicing futures\" is explored in Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds by adrienne maree brown. \"Imagination turns Brown bombers into terrorists and white bombers into mentally ill victims. Imagination gives us borders, gives us superiority, gives us race as an indicator of capability. I often feel I am trapped inside someone else's imagination, and I must engage my own imagination in order to break free,\" brown writes. Actress Tessa Thompson, a close friend of Mon\u00e1e, points to the way she wields this imaginative power in \"A Revolution of Love,\" a short video about Mon\u00e1e's quest for tenderness: \"Inside the space of make-believe, we have the ability, in sort of an aspirational way, to create the world that we live in. To create a word that is more joyful, that is more pleasantly challenging, that is more free. That's Janelle to me.\" Mon\u00e1e's time travel reminds us that while the present may be unsafe, the intimacies of right now are worth savoring. How we may love and with whom we may find love brings us light and longing in absurd and hateful circumstances. It inspires action. It not only anchors us in the present moment while considering the whole past, but it propels us into a new vision of the future: perhaps one that will be extricated from systems that oppress us; that is free, queer, black and only as far away as we can see on the horizon.",

            "article_content": "Democrats have retaken the House in Tuesday's elections and more than 100 women have been elected to Congress. Meanwhile, Republicans consolidated their control of the Senate.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A central result of last night's congressional elections was this - in a high turnout election for a midterm, a substantial majority of Americans voted for Democrats in the House. They defeated Republican leaders who aggressively defended President Trump, and they empowered a party whose leader, Nancy Pelosi, says she will be independent of the president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration. INSKEEP: Pelosi is now favored to be the next speaker of the House, after Democrats gained something in the neighborhood of 30 seats or a little more. Republicans added to their majority in the Senate, defeating three Democrats who held seats in more rural and conservative states. NPR's Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow are here to talk all this through. Good morning guys. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: So, Scott, how big a change in Washington is that House result? DETROW: It's a major change. All the big pushes that President Trump and Republicans pushed for the last few years - repealing Obamacare, big tax cuts - that stops dead, and Democrats now have the leverage to try and get a permanent fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, among other Democratic priorities. They have a lot of leverage for spending. But the most important change is that Democrats now have oversight control. They have subpoena power. That means they can dig into the Trump White House, whether it's things related to Mueller's investigation or scandals in the EPA and other departments or - get this - President Trump's tax returns and the relationship between his personal business and government action. INSKEEP: Yeah, I'm just thinking - the House Intelligence Committee. Devin Nunes was the chairman - avid defender of the president. Adam Schiff, presumably, will be the chairman now, assuming that things stay as they are. However, Mara Liasson, Republicans add to their majority in the Senate, which, among other things, is the body that confirms judges, isn't it? LIASSON: That's right. And I think this is where Democrats really failed to limit their losses. That was their goal in the Senate. And this is where Trump traveled. This is where he put his energy. And this is where he mattered - in the red-state Senate races, so he gets to crow about that victory. As a practical matter, I think it's less significant than the Democrats taking over the House because even with just 50 votes and Mike Pence, they could have continued in the Senate to confirm Donald Trump's judges. It makes it a little bit easier, and it sets the Republicans up for what will be a much harder cycle for them in 2020. INSKEEP: Let's listen to one of the winning Senate candidates from last night, Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, kept his seat despite a dramatic and much-followed challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke. Let's listen to Ted Cruz. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: All the money in the world was no match for the good people of Texas and the hard-working men and women across our state. INSKEEP: OK, Scott Detrow, there was a lot of money in this election but also a lot of voters. Wow. More than 8 million people voted in a midterm in Texas. DETROW: Yeah, this is - Democrats aren't looking for, you know, consolation prizes on a day like today on the Senate side. But yeah, Democratic turnout was pretty big. The gap between Cruz and O'Rourke was incredibly small, especially for Texas - same goes for the Georgia governor's race where Democrats, at the moment, are trailing in a very close contest. But Democrats were able to mobilize voters who hadn't turned out before and get Democrats a lot more excited in states where, typically, they don't compete on the statewide level. INSKEEP: So guys, there was all this debate over whether it was going to be a blue wave, and President Trump was at rallies saying no, there's going to be a red wave. So let's just say one definite election result is that that was an utterly meaningless debate over a metaphor. And I'd like to know is there something that's a little more genuine that either of you feels you did learn from these results last night? LIASSON: Well, America is deeply divided, and it's particularly divided between rural areas and metro-suburban areas. Right now, Democrats have the people, Republicans have the real estate. And that really matters because of the way Congress is set up. But we are even more divided, I think, today than we were before the election. INSKEEP: Scott Detrow, you get the last word. DETROW: Well, I was going to say exactly what Mara Liasson just said right now. And I think the biggest question that I have no answer to is what this means for 2020 because, you know, states like Florida and a lot of Republican states, pretty solid for President Trump. He seemed to not pay any sort of consequences for, you know, the very divisive rhetoric from the closing weeks of the race. INSKEEP: Scott Detrow and Mara Liasson, thanks to you both.

For all the talk of how Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won are a protective shield for Senate Republicans, Nevada's Dean Heller has the opposite problem. He is the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016. The candidate challenging him for the seat is Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. \"Right now, the Republicans have all three branches of government,\" Rosen said. \"So what we can do is try to hold their feet to the fire every way we can, because we don't have the votes to win.\" For Nevada, that means this state of only about 3 million people plays an outsize political role in this year's midterm elections. Republicans and Democrats are competing in tight races \u2014 not just for the Senate, but for the House and gubernatorial seats. For Democrats who had failed expectations to win the White House and the Senate in 2016, Nevada was a rare bright spot on the map, going blue by the slimmest of margins for Clinton and freshman Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. Rep.

Jacky Rosen (center), the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Nevada, greets supporters ahead of early voting at Cardenas Supermarket in Las Vegas on May 26. Part of the reason for that was the state's increasing diversity. Latinos make up about 28 percent of the population of the state, and that number is growing. David Damore, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, says their participation was critical to the places where Democrats found success in 2016, citing a precinct-by-precinct analysis of the Latino vote that he helped conduct. \"It's pretty stunning on that,\" Damore said. \"So you know, you're looking at the order in those races of 80-20 voting Democratic in those races there.\" The vast majority of Latinos in Nevada vote for Democrats, and Rosen hopes they can help her defeat Heller and whittle away at the GOP majority. Republicans are relying on the white rural vote to come out strong. But if they can shift at least some of the Latino vote in the state, it will be vital for protecting Heller's seat.

He is the only Republican in the Senate up for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won. Unlocking Latino turnout The challenge is to engage the Latino population. Most of those in Nevada are not native born and they have strong ties to their home countries, which means they tend not to dive into U.S. politics. That's true even more so during midterms, when voter turnout is historically low. In the last midterm election in 2014, there was about a 50 percent drop in Latino voting compared with 2012, a presidential election year. Pollsters described it as falling off a \"cliff,\" which helped Republican candidates. A key organization Democrats rely on to turn out the vote is the Culinary Union. Bethany Khan, spokesperson for the union, says it is the state's largest immigrant organization. \"Fifty-seven thousand members \u2014 about 55 percent women, 54 percent Latino \u2014 so it is a majority people of color, women, immigrant organization,\" she explained. \"It's going to have a huge impact on this race,\" said Jon Ralston, editor of The Nevada Independent. \"They could help put Jacky Rosen over the top, but if they're not all in, that could help Heller.\" On a recent weekday at the union's headquarters, Rosen addressed a room of about 100 union workers preparing to head out and canvass for her. She spoke on issues that she hopes will motivate the members \u2014 health care and immigration. \"We are going to fight for DREAMers, and we are going to fight for a fair immigration system,\" she told the hospitality workers. \"And I have to tell you, too, if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.\" Rosen is a first-term congresswoman and she doesn't have a lot of statewide name recognition, but the area south of Las Vegas is her home turf. Some of the most populous parts of the state are in her district. Before running for office, Rosen served as the president of the largest Jewish temple in Nevada, Congregation Ner Tamid. When she was younger she was a waitress during summers in Las Vegas and was a member of the Culinary Union, something she reminded the crowd of union members she addressed. After the speeches were over, Fransisco Benitez and Telma Vasquez, two of the Hispanic union members at the event, jumped in their car and headed to their assigned neighborhood. They went door to door in the scorching afternoon heat, trying to encourage their fellow union members to vote. One of the first people they visited was Armando Saenz. He is a lively 78-year-old retiree with four children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He came to the United States from Mexico in the 1970s. Benitez shows him pamphlets with Rosen's face on it, but Saenz was having none of it. \"They are tricksters and liars, like all politicians,\" he said. \"When the moment comes, they don't do anything for us.\" Saenz acknowledged that he is angry at the current administration's immigration policies but said he does not have a favorite party. Benitez and Vasquez, however, tried to persuade him, using a last-ditch pitch. \"It's for the future of our children,\" Vasquez said, hoping this would be enough to persuade Saenz to come out to vote in November.

On the other side of town, at a campaign rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center in late September, along with his usual jabs at the media and Democrats, President Trump urged a crowd to vote for Heller. \"We started out, we weren't friends. I didn't like him, he didn't like me!\" Trump said, referring to his earlier rocky relationship with Heller. \"But as we fought and fought and fought, believe it or not, we started to respect each other, then we started to like each other, then we started to love each other.\" In the runup to 2016, Heller was a vocal critic of Trump. But now he needs his star power to turn out Republican voters, so he's all in. \"Does this president know how to pack the people in one room?\" Heller said after joining Trump on stage. \"This is incredible. I think he just turned Nevada red today!\" Heller is on the defensive over Trump's immigration policies and his pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Heller has been attacked by Democrats for his shifting positions on both issues, which polls show are important to Latinos. Heller has voted both for and against portions of the health care law. Latinos have been a big beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion in Nevada. With immigration, Heller has condemned Trump's family separation policies but has also supported a hard-line immigration bill championed by the president that would restrict legal immigration. But Joel Garcia, the director of Heller's Hispanic outreach initiative, \"Juntos con Heller,\" argues that Latinos can be persuaded to vote for his candidate. He said Latinos respond to the Republican economic message and that many Latinos don't realize they already embrace conservative values. \"When you actually have a conversation with them, and start talking about issues, they come out of the woodwork and they start saying, 'No, I am pro-life, I am for lower taxes, I am for less government,' \" said Garcia, who also runs a small business. Garcia refused to talk about health care policy, despite its being one of the most important issues for Hispanic voters, and abruptly shut down that portion of the conversation. It's a sign of awareness of which issues are winners for a Republican in this state and which are not.",

Mazie Hirono may have a quiet demeanor, but that shouldn't be confused for a lack of toughness.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono may have a quiet demeanor, but that shouldn't be confused for a lack of toughness. Mazie Hirono used to be known as the \"good girl\" of Hawaii politics. She was seen as polite, never in-your-face, not a boat-rocker. But now, that view has changed. As one Hawaii columnist put it, she is a \"badass.\" \"I always was,\" Hirono said in an interview with NPR. \"I just wasn't very noisy about it. I've been a fighter all my life. I just don't look like that.\" If that's considered liberal, as opposed to what I call justice and fairness, as I am wont to say, 'F*** them!' \" Sen. Mazie Hirono referring to her view that judges should be fair and qualified and care about individual and civil rights The Senate's only immigrant takes that fight to President Trump, whom she openly calls \"xenophobic\" and a \"liar.\" \"To call the president a liar, that is not good, but it happens to be the truth,\" the soft-spoken Hawaii senator told Time recently. The Democrat also takes that fight to Senate Judiciary Committee, as it weekly considers a tranche of Trump judicial nominees, abandoning long-standing rules that guaranteed significant time to examine each nominee's record. There are lots of big-gun Democrats on the committee, senators who get a lot more attention than Hirono. But she is perhaps the most dogged, albeit polite, questioner. That doggedness will be even more important this summer because Republican leader Mitch McConnell has just canceled most of the August recess, mainly to push through more Trump judicial nominees before the midterm elections. McConnell's aggressiveness about judges is galling to Hirono. \"The word hypocrisy comes to mind,\" she said, adding that McConnell just wants to get \"more right-wing, ideological judges\" onto the courts. The Republican-controlled Senate has already confirmed 21 Trump appeals court appointees, compared with nine Obama appointees when the Democrats controlled the Senate at an equivalent time. \"As long as we're going to be here,\" Hirono said with a twinkle, \"maybe we should pass something important like DACA or an infrastructure bill.\" Because Senate Democrats are in the minority, they have little control over the legislative agenda, whether that is addressing immigration or infrastructure, or the pace of confirmation votes. But they do have the power to debate each nominee on the Senate floor for up to 30 hours. If they do that, look for Hirono to be there, even though she is up for re-election this year and may have to cancel planned events in her home state. \"If I had to wait around for somebody to pick me ... I never would have been picked\" Despite her often cool affect, she is no stranger to determined badassery. She recalls a breakfast in 1994 when the Democratic candidate for governor, Ben Cayetano, tried to talk her out of running for lieutenant governor. He argued that she wouldn't help the ticket. After Cayetano finished, Hirono said she looked him in the eye, \"and I said, 'Well, that's all fine and good, but it's all bulls***. And I'm running.' \" By the time the primary happens, \"people will know who I am,\" she recalled telling Cayetano. Indeed they did. Hirono actually wound up getting more votes in that election than Cayetano himself. \"If I had to wait around for somebody to pick me for lieutenant governor,\" Hirono said, \"I never would have been picked.\" \"People are getting screwed in this country every single second, minute, hour of the day\" In the Senate, Hirono is known as a \"workhorse, not a show horse,\" as one of her colleagues put it. But she is the only senator who asks every nominee, for any position, whether they have ever been accused of sexual misconduct and whether they have ever signed a nondisclosure agreement. She wants these answers on the record in case future information shows a nominee lied. She is the Senate's only immigrant and its first female Asian-American, and she had kept a pretty low profile. But she has put herself out there more, doing more media interviews, for example, in hopes it would help her advance causes she cares about. \"As I tell my staff,\" she said, \"people are getting screwed in this country every single second, minute, hour of the day. And, by our efforts, if we can decrease that number, we will be making a difference. We will be doing our jobs.\" Hirono plays the political game with a quiet rage, bred of personal experience. The escape to America from Japan 1 of 5 Born on a rice farm in Japan, she lived with her mother and three siblings in harsh conditions. Her father, who had problems with alcohol and gambling, left the family with his parents, and by the time Hirono was 7, her mother was plotting an escape for herself and her children. They would eventually travel by ship, in steerage for a week, to Hawaii. There, they lived in a boardinghouse, crowded into one room and sharing a stove and refrigerator with the other boarders. Hirono's mother supported them by working low-wage jobs. \"No job security, no health care, no nothing,\" she said, adding that she doesn't remember ever going to a doctor in those years. Her \"greatest fear,\" Hirono said, was that her mother would get sick. After graduating  Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Hawaii, she worked as a legislative aide, and on political campaigns. But, by the time Hirono was 26, she knew she wanted more. Hirono left Hawaii for Georgetown University Law School, paying for it with money she had saved up, plus student loans and a small scholarship. Hirono was nothing if not inventive about saving her pennies. She even made her own yogurt by putting the starter and milk in a jar and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 \"I'd wrap my electric blanket around it, and the next morning it would be yogurt!\" Hirono said. \"It was one of those breakups where I burned all of his pictures\" Her activism in politics sprang from the Vietnam War and from a book, The Feminine Mystique. \"Literally, the light bulb went on, and I thought, 'Why do I think that some guy is going to take care of me?' \" she said. \"Where did that come from?\" Indeed, she was 42 and serving in the Hawaii state legislature when she finally took the plunge, marrying Leighton Kim Oshima. Her friends were shocked by her choice of mate, because she had broken up with Oshima 13 years earlier, and, as she puts it, with a laugh, \"It was one of those breakups where I burned all of his pictures.\" Hirono sees herself today as strategic and able to build bridges. In fact, the first bill she got enacted into law was with the help of then-Sen. and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man with whom she disagrees on almost everything. A soft heart and hard head Hirono talks to an aide during the confirmation hearing of FBI Director nominee Christopher Wray.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hirono talks to an aide during the confirmation hearing of FBI Director nominee Christopher Wray. Hirono was trying to move a stalled bill out of committee and onto the Senate floor for a vote. Because the bill involved a charitable tax provision to aid victims of a typhoon in the Philippines, there was a deadline. \"I'm on the floor about 11 p.m. or so,\" she recalled, \"and I see Jeff Sessions come walking in, and I know he's there to object.\" Under Senate rules, an objection from just one senator would doom the bill. So she did something unusual. She went to the Republican cloakroom. \"I began to talk with him,\" she recounted, \"and I said, 'Why is your caucus so against this bill?' \" Sessions explained that Republicans felt they had to be consistent in opposing this sort of special tax provision. Hirono countered with an impassioned plea, explaining why the bill was important to her and to many Hawaiians. And then she did something else unusual. Reaching over to Sessions, she touched his heart. With her hand on his shirt, she said, \"I am speaking to this.\" \"We don't often communicate that way,\" she noted. Sessions heard her. He did officially object that night but made it clear he would would work out a compromise quickly that would accomplish Hirono's goals without \"offending the budget niceties.\" With Sessions' willingness and Hirono's doggedness, the bill was enacted into law the day before the deadline. Four years later, however, Hirono went to Sessions to tell him she could not support his nomination to be attorney general, not just because they disagreed on so many issues, but in particular because Sessions \"would come on the floor every week to rail against immigration reform.\" Hirono's interactions with Sessions are an example of her soft heart and hard head. She has needed both in the past year. Hirono's battle with cancer leads to a passionate plea Diagnosed with kidney cancer, she has undergone two major operations. After the second one, a teeth-grindingly painful operation to remove 5 inches of a rib, she was out for 10 days, but back on the Senate floor in time for the big vote on repeal of Obamacare \u2014 and to deliver a message to her colleagues. She had not planned to speak and had no prepared remarks, but she was uncharacteristically emotional. Sighing audibly, she began, \"I was born at home in rural Japan. I lost a sister to pneumonia, when she was 2 years old. She died at home, not in a hospital, where maybe her life could have been saved.\" Her voice quivering, she paused. \"It's hard for me to talk about this,\" she said. \"I think you can tell. Give me a moment.\" After gathering herself, she turned to her own kidney cancer and the treatment, enabled by having health insurance, that was saving her life. \"When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and facing my first surgery,\" she said, \"I heard from so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who wrote me wonderful notes, sharing with me their own experience with major illness in their families or loved ones. You showed me your care. You showed me your compassion.\" Then suddenly, her voice rising, and her hand banging the table with each word, she demanded, \"Where is that tonight?\" Hirono's voice is rarely that openly passionate. Indeed, she can often have a rather flat affect, an unassuming, even cool public presence that is in sharp contrast to her earthiness and colorful language in private. After a long day, this reporter asked her why her skepticism about Trump judicial nominees is any different from Republican skepticism of Obama nominees. Her reply was that what she wants are judges who are fair and qualified and \"care about individual and civil rights.\" And then, without missing a beat, she added, \"If that's considered liberal, as opposed to what I call justice and fairness, as I am wont to say, 'F*** them!' \"",

Steve Knight, R-Palmdale, speaks at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this May 28, 2014, file photo, then-California state Sen. Steve Knight, R-Palmdale, speaks at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. House Republican leaders are struggling to contain a growing split within their party over immigration policy. But for some vulnerable moderates breaking from some of the GOP's hardest-line proposals could be the key to avoiding defeat in November. Californian Steve Knight is one of nearly two dozen House Republicans who have signed on to a petition to force the House to vote on immigration proposals as early as next month. The plan is to allow the House to vote on at least four bills, including a pathway to citizenship that many conservatives hate. That plan frustrates House leaders who worry a messy fight on immigration will divide the party and boost Democrats' chances of winning control of the House in November. But Knight said Monday in an interview at a Memorial Day event in his home district that he is confident that it's better for him if they at least try to pass some immigration legislation. \"This is doing probably one of the hardest things in America that we've ever tried to do,\" Knight said. \"I understand that, but I think we have the votes to get something done.\" Knight said the best path forward is a bill to combine some measures for increased border security with legal protections for the roughly 800,000 people who stand to lose protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. He said he's heard from voters in his district and he's confident that is what they want. \"People have said that consistently,\" Knight said. \"If I just don't listen then I'm not listening to the people in my district.\" That position puts him at odds with many in his party, including House conservatives and President Trump. Trump continues to lean into the same hard-line position on immigration that was his signature in 2016 \u2014 he wants a wall along the border with Mexico and broad crackdowns on illegal immigration. He told a crowd in Tennessee Tuesday night that Republicans need to be tough if they want to win. \"And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a great issue. Not a bad issue.\" But Democrats and many moderates disagree. They say a majority of Americans oppose a wall, and point to polls like a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey that showed 86 percent of voters support the DACA program. The issue is even more personal in California, a state that is home to nearly 30 percent of all DACA recipients. That's part of why Knight is willing to risk angering party leaders. He represents one of the 23 districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but voted for a Republican for Congress. Democrats believe Republicans are unpopular across the country and particularly here, in part because of issues like immigration. But Democrats here haven't figured out the right way to campaign against a Republican like Knight. With less than a week to go before their June 5 primary, the two top Democrats are at odds over whether they should court progressives or stick to more moderate policies that could help them win votes from a wider range of voters. In California's system, all candidates \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 compete in the primary and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election in the fall. Bryan Caforio is the most progressive of the Democrats running here and he says Knight's rogue move signing the immigration petition won't be enough to set him apart. \"It's a huge issue and frankly Steve Knight isn't doing anything on it,\" Caforio said while knocking on doors in the high desert city of Palmdale. \"Signing a discharge petition, that probably won't go through when four bills will be put up anyway, some of which are horrible, is nothing but trying to confuse people into thinking he cares.\" His opponent Katie Hill takes a more moderate approach. She's in line with party leaders in Washington who want to trade some border security money for DACA protections. She argues its the right way to win votes in this moderate suburban district. \"We are going to have to make sure that we've got the best possible chance of defeating him in the fall,\" Hill said in an interview at a canvassing kickoff last weekend in Simi Valley. The two Democrats are at odds over more than just immigration in a race that has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks. Hill insists that her moderate approach is the only way Democrats stand a chance of beating Knight in November. Recent analysis from The Cook Political Report ranked the seat as a toss-up that could trend more favorably for Democrats if she wins in the primary. But, Knight says he isn't worried about facing one of them in November. \"This district has never flipped,\" Knight said. The California Republican is confident that his position on immigration is right for his district. He said he knows immigration is a tough issue for Republicans but he says its not for him. Plus, he says, voters have a lot more on their minds than just immigration. \"We got into Congress to work on military, veterans and small business,\" Knight said. \"That's what we've done. They know that. The veterans know that. We've kept our word.\" Bert Brionies, a Democrat here, agrees. He says he respects that Knight took his own route on immigration. Plus, he likes Knight's work on local issues. Briones knows Democrats need to defeat Republicans like Knight to win control of the House. But, he trusts his congressman and he's planning to vote for him in November. \"I'm more in favor of Knight. He's been in office longer,\" he said. \"I'd like to stay with the Democrats but if I see that someone has ideas that would favor my way of thinking then yea, I'd sway towards that.\" Knight's split on immigration may infuriate Republican leaders but it could be the key to helping the GOP keep their House majority.",

Updated at 6:31 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told NPR in an interview that he continues to support the Mueller Russia investigation \u2014 and that nothing in Thursday's hotly anticipated secret briefing on the Russia probe to congressional leaders changed his mind. \"The two investigations going on that I think will give us the answers to the questions that you raise \u2014 the [inspector general] investigation in the Justice Department and the Mueller investigation,\" McConnell said. \"I support both of them, and I don't really have anything to add to this subject based upon the Gang of Eight briefing that we had today, which was classified.\" McConnell spoke with NPR immediately following a classified intelligence briefing from law enforcement and intelligence officials. The Gang of Eight \u2014 a bipartisan group of the four top congressional leaders and the four bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 met with representatives from the Department of Justice and the FBI to discuss materials regarding a confidential FBI source who met with Trump campaign officials. McConnell has remained the most prominent congressional Republican to defend Mueller and his investigation amid a concerted effort by Trump and conservative supporters to discredit that investigation. The president has accused the investigation of being a partisan \"witch hunt\" and the investigators of being \"conflicted.\" There is a hashtag devoted to what the president and his allies are calling \"SPYGATE\" that the president himself is using. Trump boasted that it \"could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\" SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history! The briefing and the intense conservative scrutiny of the FBI comes as lawmakers are leaving Washington for a weeklong Memorial Day recess. Members up for re-election typically use the break to campaign on the legislative successes of the first half of the year. But the Russia investigation threatens to overshadow many of those victories. McConnell touted those successes amid fears that Republicans are at risk of losing their majorities in the House and the Senate. And he would like Trump's help selling that to voters. \"If you are a right-of-center person, there hasn't been a better period than this in at least three decades,\" McConnell said. \"Obviously we'd like to see him talking about what we're sitting here talking about more of the time. And I think many of us have urged him to do that and we hope he will.\" Also in the NPR interview, McConnell expressed confidence in Trump's decision to cancel the North Korea summit. \"I think the president did exactly the right thing,\" McConnell said, \"because they were playing with us.\" McConnell's comments come amid a concerted effort by Trump and conservative supporters to discredit the Mueller investigation. The president has accused the investigation of being a partisan \"witch hunt\" and the investigators of being \"conflicted.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption McConnell's comments come amid a concerted effort by Trump and conservative supporters to discredit the Mueller investigation. The president has accused the investigation of being a partisan \"witch hunt\" and the investigators of being \"conflicted.\" He called it a \"pattern of that over the last couple of decades.\" On immigration, McConnell made clear he will not push for immigration legislation. He put the ball in the House's court instead, saying, \"If the House passes a bill that the president would sign, I'd be open to it.\" But, he added, he is not going to allow for another open amendment process that produced no discernible results on immigration, like he did in February. \"I'm not going to do that again, I can tell you that,\" McConnell said. McConnell noted that filling out federal judicial appointments is his top priority and that if a Supreme Court vacancy came up this year, he would act \u2014 despite this being an election year. In 2016, McConnell took a very different position, refusing to bring Judge Merrick Garland's appointment to the Senate floor or even give him a hearing. He said that the new president should decide who is on the Supreme Court. When asked if someone could argue that he should wait to make an appointment so whoever controls the Senate can make the decision \u2014 setting hearings, vetting nominees, laying out timetables \u2014 he said that would be a \"foolish argument.\" He did not see irony in his stance given his position on Garland because Justice Antonin Scalia died in a presidential election year. \"The presidential election is in 2020,\" McConnell said. \"If we get a vacancy on the court this year, we'll deal with it.\"",

Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M., speaks at a news conference calling for the passage of the Dream Act in January, along with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Lujan Grisham is one of five Democratic lawmakers, along with nine Republicans, receiving praise over immigration, in the form of paid ads, by the Koch network. The Koch brothers are going rogue. For years the political network funded by billionaires Charles and David Koch funded politicians on the right, laying the foundation for the libertarian causes the two support. Their support has gone almost exclusively to Republican candidates, with rare exception. But in the era of Trump, what it means to be on the \"right\" is changing, and the Koch network's tactics are changing to reflect new realities. For the first time, the LIBRE Initiative \u2014 the Hispanic outreach arm of the Koch network \u2014 is putting money behind efforts to praise Democrats on the federal level, and doing so with control of Congress on the line in the midterm elections. \"This stands out. People when they talk about the Koch network ... they point at areas like tax reform, where we've worked very closely with Republican members,\" said Wadi Gaitan, a spokesman for the LIBRE Initiative. \"Here on this issue, we have Democrats where we want to make sure that their constituents are aware that they are working on a permanent solution for DREAMers and on border security. So it certainly is a unique effort.\" It's a novel approach for a network that has made a name for itself for funding causes on the right \u2014 and has only very sparsely praised anyone in the Democratic Party. But the Republican Party under the Trump administration has not moved closer to the libertarian philosophy favored by the Kochs: The White House has pursued foreign tariffs, taken a hard line on immigration, and approved a massive spending bill that would increase the deficit. As the Republican Party moves further away from the Kochs' ideals, it appears that their network has begun investing in bipartisan efforts that unite members of both parties. In recent years the Koch network has pursued issues such as criminal justice reform, letting terminally ill patients try experimental medical interventions, and protecting DREAMers \u2014 immigrants in the U.S. who were brought to the country as children \u2014 which draws interest from both sides of the aisle. \"Even when Congress agrees that action is required, members tend to focus on petty differences rather than getting the job done,\" James Davis, a senior official in the Koch network, wrote in a recent op-ed. \"Our fervent hope is that even isolated agreements won't just advance good policy but will also help tear down the walls of mistrust and bitterness that have degraded our politics and turned Americans against one another.\" This mailer will be sent to constituents of Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., as the LIBRE Initiative, part of the libertarian Koch network, reaches across the aisle on immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    The LIBRE Initiative\n                    \n                \nhide caption The LIBRE Initiative, which is part of the Koch network's advocacy for typically conservative causes, has found reason to praise Democrats like Rep.

Chris Coons, D-Del. Luj\u00e1n is the chairman of House Democrats' campaign committee. Republicans still make up more than half of the beneficiaries of this ad blitz \u2014 six GOP House members and three GOP Senate lawmakers will get kudos from the Koch network. They have already pledged to spend nearly $400 million in 2017-2018 to back the Koch Network's policy goals in various states and the federal level, including the free market policy gains achieved by the Republican-controlled Congress. \"Thank you Sen. Coons for supporting a permanent solution for Dreamers,\" one mailer reads. \"More than 90% of Americans want protection for the Dreamers.\" The LIBRE Initiative declined to say precisely how much it would be spending on this effort, except to note that it was part of a larger seven-figure project on finding a fix for DREAMers. This project includes television and digital advertisements, congressional advocacy, grass-roots mobilization and educational programs. \"In order to get this through the House and Senate, it is important for Democrats to be at the table ... for us, it's how do we achieve the goal?\" Gaitan said. \"And what we said is we're willing to work with whoever to make sure that we're getting good policy through Congress.\"",

This story is part of a series on coal country by NPR's Embedded podcast. Episode audio is below. On May 5, 2016, Donald Trump led a campaign rally in Charleston, W.Va. He put on a hard hat and pretended he was shoveling coal. The crowd loved it. And he made a promise \u2014 a variation on one he had been making throughout the campaign \u2014 to coal miners. President Trump at a campaign rally in May 2016. \"Get ready,\" he told them. \"Because you're going to be working your asses off!\" With that, he set himself apart from his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In a moment that is now considered to be one of the biggest mistakes of her campaign, just two months before, Clinton had infamously told a town hall in Ohio: \"We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" That quote was part of a larger plan to reinvest $30 billion in the region. But the only thing most folks heard was \"out of business.\" In the end, the coal counties of central Appalachia voted overwhelmingly for Trump. (Though they didn't decide the election for Trump. White people without a college education, namely in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, did that.) The SunCoke Energy Jewell Thompson in Vansant, Va., sometimes called \"the cloud machine.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Guzy for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The SunCoke Energy Jewell Thompson in Vansant, Va., sometimes called \"the cloud machine.\" We actually started going to the region just before the election, when most people still thought Clinton was going to win. We wanted to know what it feels like to live through the decline of an industry, the loss of so many jobs. Then, after Trump was elected, we wanted to see whether his promise would come true: Did those miners end up working their asses off? The \"red hat\" Kyle Johnson was driving around southwestern Virginia in his white Dodge Ram in February 2017 when he heard a radio ad for jobs in a coal mine. \"I just turned the radio up,\" Johnson says. \"I was like, 'Yeah!' \" Kyle Johnson heads home to wash up and sleep.\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Guzy for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kyle Johnson heads home to wash up and sleep. Johnson couldn't remember the last time he had heard coal companies advertising on the radio. He had wanted to be a coal miner since high school. He even dropped out of college in 2015 to try to get a coal mining job. His family and friends wanted him to get a degree, but school just didn't hold his attention. Plus, coal jobs often pay more than what his friends with college degrees are making, and he just didn't see the point of school.

So by 2017, that radio ad felt like vindication. \"I don't think anyone here in the coalfields thought [Trump's] going to bring back every job,\" says Johnson. \"But ... I think everybody thought maybe he's going to bring back my job.\" Since Trump was elected, there has been a bump in coal jobs in Virginia and a handful of other states. That's in part because of the coal companies' new confidence in Trump, but also because demand for metallurgical coal \u2014 the kind used to make steel \u2014 went up, mainly in China. (Energy analysts say thermal coal plants, the ones that produce electricity, are continuing to close around the country.) For Johnson, it doesn't really matter why there are jobs.

Pennington decided it would never come back. \"There's nothing here,\" he says. \"It's slowly dying.\" Brad Pennington, 23, works at a hotel in Grundy, Va.

Years ago, Keen and a co-writer turned the life of Keen's grandmother Teddy into a play. Teddy married a coal miner named Clyde.

            "article_content": "Alabama Sen. Doug Jones delivered his maiden speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, tackling a topic that would seem anathema to most Southern Democrats \u2014 gun control. Jones, who was elected in a special election upset last December, called for universal background checks, raising the age for purchasing semi-automatic weapons to 21 and eliminating key loopholes that could allow a gun to fall into dangerous hands. \"In the wake of yet another mass shooting, and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility \u2013 our duty \u2013 to have a serious discussion about guns and gun safety,\" Jones said. \"But that conversation has to be two-fold: We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands, but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.\" Jones nodded to his own background as a gun-owning hunting enthusiast, and talked about how he's shared that love with his son. He also shied away from completely vilifying the National Rifle Association, which has resisted many of the proposals he and other legislators have put forward. President Trump initially seemed open to more drastic gun control measures in a bipartisan meeting earlier this month, but later backed off and has endorsed arming some school personnel, among other measures backed by the NRA. But, Jones argued, ultimately the government's commitment to the safety of its citizens must be paramount. And while he said that some of the actions undertaken recently are positive \u2014 moving to ban bump stocks that can convert guns into automatic-style weapons, efforts to strengthen the background check system \u2014 Jones also said it's not enough. He proposed making background checks universal, including on internet sales, at gun shows and even private sales, as well as implementing three-day waiting periods. \"So while I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they're complicated for me, too. But as a United States Senator today, a member of the legislative branch of government, I have many obligations. And I believe that the first obligation of government is to protect its citizens,\" Jones said. \"We spend unimaginable amounts of money fighting our enemies abroad and terrorists who would attack us at home. Yet, on many levels, we fail our children and grandchildren every morning when we pack their backpacks and send them into harm's way.\" Jones said that, for him, the deadly shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people was a \"tipping point regarding gun violence.\" That's spurred a school walkout last week and a protest, \"March For Our Lives,\" this coming Saturday in Washington, D.C., and around the country. A former federal prosecutor, Jones also said the activism spurred by this protest shooting reminded him of the civil rights movement and made him reflect on one his most famous case \u2014 finally bringing to justice Ku Klux Klansmen who had bombed a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four African-American girls. \"With the convictions of two former Klansmen for the murder of those four young girls, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rose up, and hope and history rhymed in Birmingham,\" Jones recalled. \"And for me, and I hope for you, when I walk the halls of the Senate office buildings, and come through those double doors onto the Senate floor, I realize that every day we as a collective body have that same opportunity.  Whether it is for DREAMers, or voting rights, or victims of sex trafficking, or in this case, our children who are demanding action on gun violence, we have the opportunity to build that tidal wave of justice and have hope and history rhyme.\" But, Jones said, in order to do so it requires \"courage to seize this moment,\" to work across the aisle and find common ground, tamp down on divisive political rhetoric and be unafraid to do the right thing, no matter the political consequences \u2014 something that rings especially true for Jones, as he faces re-election in 2020 in a deep red state. \"We could spend days in this chamber debating the meaning and intent of the Second Amendment.  We can let our nation further divide itself while more lives are lost. We can fret about what people are saying about us on social media or whether we might lose campaign contributions. We can again choose the path of inaction, in the face of yet another mass shooting, and expect different results,\" Jones said. \"Or, we can take another path,\" the Alabama senator continued. \"Let us find what we can agree on, act on it, and begin to make our country a safer place.  We can be reasonable here because we all want the same thing: a safer country, a safer world. At its core, the Second Amendment was an effort to protect Americans.  Let us do the same.\" \"I don't have all the answers on how to do it, but I'm willing to work with each and every one of you to find them,\" Jones closed by promising. \"Because that's why we were sent here \u2013 to find those answers...so that the tidal wave of justice will rise up.\"",

            "article_content": "The primary elections in Texas are the country's first for the 2018 midterms. Political observers say enthusiasm and turnout for the Democratic Party are far higher than previous election cycles.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm Rachel Martin at our member station KERA in Dallas, Texas. The first primary election of the political season is underway here today. And the big question is, who's going to turn out? Because if Democrats show up in a big way in Texas, that could be a sign that they could mobilize enough voters to gain the majority in Congress after elections in the fall. And the early voting numbers have Democratic turnout up 105 percent over 2014. Democrats might sense an opportunity as President Trump is polling worse in Texas than in many other Republican strongholds, even in swing states. NPR's Wade Goodwyn is in Dallas and joins us now. Hey, Wade. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So if you're a Texas Democrat running for office this year, the fact that your party doubled its early voting numbers from four years ago has got to make you pretty happy, and at the same time might give Republicans some pause? GOODWYN: Well, maybe they're a little concerned. I mean, 105 percent difference in favor of one party or another, it's a big gap. But, you know. You know that little emoji that runs around in circles waving its arms above its little head in panic? You know that one, Rachel? MARTIN: Yeah. I totally know that one, Wade. (Laughter). GOODWYN: There's no panicking among Republican candidates or voters waving their arms in Texas. MARTIN: All right. GOODWYN: But what Republican candidates are genuinely worried about is Republican voter overconfidence. You know, we have some really good political writers down here, and Ross Ramsey, he's the executive editor at The Texas Tribune, he's one of them. ROSS RAMSEY: One of the biggest problems that the Republicans have in Texas is that they have won regularly for a quarter of a century, and their voters get more and more complacent - we're going to win this thing, we don't need to show up. So it becomes a problem for people like Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz and Republicans at the top of the ticket to get their voters ginned up and to turn out. GOODWYN: In Texas, the Republican Party has been the undisputed champion for a long, long time. But if Republican voters start to think, you know what? We stop the Democrats every time, it's never close, I'm tired, let's go have a beer - that's the attitude, that if it were to manifest, could bite the Texas GOP in the fanny. MARTIN: Right. OK. So what specifically is behind the Democrats' particular kind of enthusiasm here? GOODWYN: Well, I think in many ways this election's about President Trump. He enjoys about an 85 percent approval rating among Texas Republicans. So we've had a lot of Republican candidates on TV saying they're the Trump-iest Trump supporter there ever was. And Democrats are happy to let them do that. They want to run against the president rather than their own opponent because the president makes the Democrats mad and fired up the vote. The Me Too movement, DACA, school shooting, all these are issues that are motivating the Democratic base. MARTIN: Yeah. So one of the races that's gotten a lot of attention is the campaign for Ted Cruz's seat, right? Cruz is the incumbent. He's likely going to face this Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a congressman from El Paso. O'Rourke has been outraising Cruz in a big way. Is that correct? GOODWYN: Yes. If anything's gotten the political class's attention, it's been Beto O'Rourke's fundraising strength the last two reporting cycles. In the last two months, O'Rourke has raised nearly three times what Ted Cruz has raised. But here's the thing, Rachel. Argentina should not shed any tears for Senator Cruz's empty campaign pockets because he's one of the Koch brothers' favorite politicians that can expect enthusiastic support from their PACs and from many others. The question going forward will be whether O'Rourke can keep up with Cruz's fundraising. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Wade Goodwyn for us this morning. Thanks, Wade. GOODWYN: You're quite welcome.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, during a bipartisan meeting with members of Congress on school and community safety at the White House on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks, watched by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, during a bipartisan meeting with members of Congress on school and community safety at the White House on Wednesday. Updated at 3:05 a.m. ET Friday Plans for a speedy Senate vote on gun legislation crumbled Thursday as Senate leaders announced plans to move on to long-planned banking legislation, while congressional Republicans struggle to make sense of President Trump's wishes on guns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Thursday that the Senate will move on to the banking bill after voting on several nominations this week. McConnell said he hopes to vote on changes to the background check system for most gun purchases but did not provide a timeline or any further details. \"We'd love to do that at some point,\" McConnell said. \"I'm hoping there is a way forward.\" The lack of commitment is the surest sign yet that Congress does not plan to quickly address gun access, despite pressure from the White House and survivors of last month's deadly shooting at a Florida high school. There is no plan for any action on gun legislation ahead of the two-week Easter recess at the end of March. The Senate will next take up Idaho GOP Sen. Mike Crapo's bipartisan legislation to ease bank regulations. The Senate also plans to vote this month on Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman's legislation to combat sex trafficking, and Congress must pass a sweeping spending package by March 23. There is no room in the agenda for guns, unless senators reach agreement on legislation that could move through the Senate via an expedited process known as unanimous consent. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is opposed to any new restrictions on gun rights, said he did not believe that kind of consensus was within reach. \"Look, we've got a lot of disagreement on the Republican side, and I would be surprised if something moved anytime soon,\" he said. Widespread confusion The sharp departure was the result of widespread confusion on Capitol Hill over guns. Republicans spent the day Thursday struggling to respond to a set of vague instructions Trump laid out during a televised meeting at the White House. That meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet Trump's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president. Over the course of the hourlong broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions generally anathema to congressional Republicans. He also suggested pre-emptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people, a policy that might draw significant legal challenges. \"I don't know, you saw it, right? It was wild,\" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican. \"I think the president is going to have to narrow his list of what he'd like to see addressed and figure out what's realistic.\" The disconnect between Trump and congressional Republicans on core philosophical issues on display this week, coupled with the lingering partisan anger between the two parties following the failed immigration talks, is quickly lowering already dim expectations that 2018 will result in much legislative output. Adding to the confusion, however, Trump and Vice President Pence met Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm. The president tweeted that it was a \"Good (Great) meeting ...\" and Cox said in a tweet after the meeting that \"POTUS & VPOTUS support he Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control.\" Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA! I had a great meeting tonight with @realDonaldTrump & @VP. We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don\u2019t want gun control. #NRA #MAGA The only must-pass measure on the agenda is the spending bill still being drafted to finalize the appropriations process for the year that, once passed, will free up lawmakers to focus their efforts on what is quickly overtaking Capitol Hill: the battle for control of Congress in the midterm elections. Republicans say they all agree that something needs to be done to curb gun violence, but there is little, if any, consensus on the best way to do that while still maintaining gun rights. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters Thursday that he is not inclined to support any of the numerous gun-related bills that have been floated in recent days. \"I'm not inclined to do anything right now except to see what comes up,\" Shelby said. \"We all are interested in our children being safe in schools; we're all interested in the communities being safe. It's how do we get there?\" Trump often acknowledges that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress, let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, say Trump's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder. The meeting concluded with Trump asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting, and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan. \"Element of unpredictability\" Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello told NPR's Morning Edition that he worries that kind of broad directive makes it harder for Congress to focus its attention on specific legislation that could pass and eventually become law. \"There's still an element of unpredictability on what the White House is willing to lean on from a gun safety reform measure,\" Costello said. \"There was a bit of contradiction in what he said.\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the leading lawmakers working on a proposal to update the criminal background check system, shared similar concerns Wednesday after the meeting adjourned. Cornyn told reporters that it is his experience that passing these measures is harder than it sounds. \"I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,\" Cornyn said. \"He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.\" Shock at tariff announcement Republicans still reeling from the fallout of Trump's conflicting comments during Wednesday's gun meeting were again taken by surprise Thursday with the White House announcement of impending tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The decision upends long-standing GOP orthodoxy on trade policy and provoked fears among senators of a trade war with China and other traditional allies that threatens to harm the U.S. economy more than tariffs promise to help. \"Every time you do this you get a retaliation, and agriculture is the No. 1 target,\" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. \"I think this is terribly unproductive for the ag economy.\" China is already signaling it could retaliate against U.S. sorghum exports. Kansas is the country's top sorghum producer. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the president's decision is counter to the view of the Senate GOP Conference, which has in prior meetings urged Trump not to impose these tariffs. \"I think every Republican is pretty well on the same side of the page from that standpoint, resisting what [Trump] and his trade advisers were talking about,\" Johnson said. \"We have been talking to the administration almost in a unanimous fashion, warning against protectionist measures, warning against these types of tariffs.\"",

Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaks with reporters Thursday on his way to a vote on the Senate floor.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaks with reporters Thursday on his way to a vote on the Senate floor. Updated at 10:47 p.m. ET It seems all but certain that the nonessential operations of the government could shutter for at least a few hours overnight after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., repeatedly objected to a Senate vote in order to air his grievances over what he calls runaway federal spending. Paul faced off with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate majority whip, just after 10 p.m. on the Senate floor and blocked multiple attempts by Cornyn to hold a vote on funding legislation before 1 a.m. Friday. Even apart from that, Republicans and Democrats are still at odds over spending levels and immigration in the bipartisan budget agreement, and while the bill is likely to pass the Senate, its future in the House remains in limbo. Given Paul's objections, the Senate is not set to vote on the spending compromise until roughly 3 a.m. Friday. And the House is set to vote somewhere between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., according to guidance from the House majority whip's office. Optimism about the $300 billion, two-year budget agreement began to falter earlier Thursday as some House Democrats threatened to vote against the bill because it does not address immigration. Some conservatives are also threatening to vote against the measure because it would increase spending and add billions to the deficit. Senate leaders had hoped to pass the bill early in the day but were forced to wait after Paul objected to the plan. The Kentucky Republican said Thursday evening he planned to force the Senate to wait until the early hours of Friday morning \u2014 after the midnight deadline when funding expires \u2014 when debate time would expire and the Senate would be allowed to override his objection. \"I'm not advocating for shutting down the government,\" Paul said in an interview on Fox News. \"I'm also not advocating for keeping the damn thing open and borrowing a million dollars a minute.\" Paul took to the Senate floor Thursday evening, armed with charts and graphs that pointed to what he says is wasteful government spending. \"I just can't, in all honestly, look the other way just because my party is now complicit in the deficits,\" Paul said. Nevertheless, separate concerns grew in the House as his protest wore on. A growing number of House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, are threatening to vote against the bill, raising concerns that House leaders may not have the votes to pass the spending bill in that chamber. \"We cannot allow our success in one part of the discussion to diminish our leverage in another,\" Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats. \"Speaker Ryan's refusal to allow a bipartisan process for a DACA proposal demeans the dignity of the House of Representatives. It is also an insult to the American people, who overwhelmingly support the Dreamers.\" Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in an interview on All Things Considered Thursday that he also wouldn't vote for the current budget agreement because it doesn't reflect his party's values. Republicans, he said, should be doing more to make overtures to Democrats if they need their votes to keep the government open. Official position: HFC opposes the caps deal. We support funding our troops, but growing the size of government by 13 percent is not what the voters sent us here to do. \"What I am suggesting is they control the House, the Senate and the presidency. I don't know why, for crying out loud; why they can't actually govern, is beyond me,\" Crowley lamented. \"And the notional idea to blame Democrats in the House when they have the Oval and the majority \u2014 it's really incumbent upon them to pass their budget. It's not our responsibility to do that. It's the responsibility of the governing party to do that, and they have failed miserably. We've gone from week to week, or month to month with continuing [resolutions] and that's no way to govern.\" House Republicans have always expected that they would need some Democrats to help pass the spending bill, and the growing revolt has sparked serious anxiety that the spending agreement could fail, especially since House Republican leadership appears unsure how many Republicans will vote for the bill. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus already announced that their roughly 30 members will vote against the pact. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a member of that fiscally conservative caucus, told All Things Considered Thursday that he is not confident the House has the votes to pass the spending bill and hopes enough House Republicans will oppose the idea \"that we're going to spend away our future.\" \"The problem is the American people have elected so many debt junkies that they're ecstatic with borrowing money today so they can get elected tomorrow [without] worrying about someone paying for it after the elections,\" Brooks said. \"And that's very unfortunate that so many people are putting their self-interest, their elections before their country.\" The two factions are angry about dramatically different issues but their combined frustration could be enough to make sure the bill can't pass. House Democrats huddled for more than an hour Thursday night to decide how they should vote. Members emerged conflicted. House Democrats are particularly worried that they will lose any leverage on immigration once a spending bill is enacted. Spending bills are among the few areas where Republicans need Democratic votes in the House. Pelosi and other top Democrats say they want to force Republicans to agree to legal protections for DREAMers, including the roughly 700,000 immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally after being brought to the country as children and who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Democrats decided to take advantage of that leverage and merge immigration talks and spending negotiations after President Trump last September announced his plan to wind down DACA. The program ends on March 5 according to terms set by the administration but is the subject of litigation in the federal courts. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., says Democrats' power would disappear if the budget bill passes because it would lift the spending pressure created by mandatory budget caps that have forced Congress to revisit spending fights since the caps were enacted in 2011. \"Once you've lifted the caps and you've done this, do you really believe that anybody is going to take us seriously?\" Gutierrez asked reporters. \"They have decoupled the budgetary process from anything where we needed leverage.\" The Congressional Hispanic Caucus officially announced its opposition to the budget bill, with the group urging members to vote against the measure in a statement released Thursday evening.

The official also urged Congress to send the funding bill to the president's desk \"without delay.\" The deal was announced Wednesday as a bipartisan breakthrough that could free Congress from an endless cycle of spending fights. The agreement was negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to increase military and domestic spending for two years. Under the pact, the Pentagon would get an additional $80 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $85 billion in fiscal year 2019, while domestic spending would grow by $63 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $68 billion the following fiscal year. \"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground,\" McConnell said in a speech announcing the deal. Schumer echoed the support, saying the agreement would give the federal government certainty after years of bickering. \"This budget deal is a genuine breakthrough,\" Schumer said, adding the agreement would \"break the long cycle of spending crises.\" The agreement also has the support of the White House, where press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the plan to hike military spending. \"This deal achieves our top priority, a much needed increase in funding for our national defense,\" Sanders said Wednesday. \"The bottom line is that, thanks to President Trump, we can now have the strongest military we have ever had.\" Loading...",

One year ago this week, Jeff Sessions stood beaming in the Oval Office as he awaited his swearing-in as the 84th attorney general of the United States. On that day last February, President Trump signed executive orders on violent crime and gangs, pledging that a \"new era of justice begins.\" And, in the year that followed, Sessions has managed to transform the Justice Department, particularly in the areas of civil rights, immigration and drugs. Those policy initiatives have advanced despite an increasingly turbulent relationship among the president, Sessions and the institution he leads. Trump disavowed his attorney general over his recusal last year in the Russia investigation, and he has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department and the FBI as inept or politically motivated. For his part, Sessions has tried to have it both ways. He has offered a few words of praise for his deputies at Justice, but told an audience this week that he knows there are sharp critics of his department. \"I'll be the first to acknowledge that we still have work to do,\" he said. \"Sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. We will not ignore these problems or hide our heads in the sand.\" Civil rights A few weeks into the job, Sessions rescinded guidance for schools that was designed to protect transgender students in bathrooms and locker rooms. Later, the Justice Department filed legal briefs arguing that a landmark 1964 civil rights law did not bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and sided with a cake shop owner who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Sessions switched positions in a major voting rights case in Texas, backing away from an argument that state lawmakers had intended to discriminate on the basis of race in their voter ID bill. And he ordered a review of the Justice Department's approach to consent decrees with errant police departments, ultimately determining that his civil rights unit will turn away from investigating patterns of excessive force and racial profiling by local law enforcement and instead focus resources on prosecuting individual police officers who break the law. Last fall, the attorney general also put an end to a collaborative reform process some police departments used to identify problems and get advice about how to fix them. In California, the state attorney general recently agreed to monitor how the San Francisco Police Department was ushering in changes recommended through the old DOJ program, since the federal government had backed off. Immigration As a senator, Sessions became the leading voice in Congress for restrictive immigration policies. And in his post as the top federal law enforcement officer, Sessions has continued to advance those goals, often with the immense power of the executive branch behind him.  The attorney general has issued new priorities for immigration judges in an effort to reduce heavy backlogs in those courts. He has promised to hire dozens more judges and monitor their efficiency through what he describes as \"benchmarks.\" He has begun to crack down on immigrants who become naturalized citizens through fraud, moving to strip those people of their citizenship in court. And he has threatened to withhold U.S. grant dollars from \"sanctuary city\" jurisdictions that don't share information with federal immigration authorities. Under Sessions' watch, the Justice Department also determined that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was \"an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch\" and could not be defended in a court challenge by Texas and other states.  Sentencing and drug policy Early in his tenure, Sessions revoked an Obama-era memo that directed federal prosecutors to use discretion in making decisions about charges in drug cases. In its place, the attorney general ordered U.S. attorneys to charge the most serious, readily provable offense \u2014 a policy that could lead to more and longer prison terms for drug criminals. Sessions also reversed course and announced that the Justice Department will continue to make use of private prison facilities, rather than phase out those contracts. Last month, Sessions withdrew a memo that set priorities for prosecutors in states where marijuana had been legalized for recreational or medical purposes. Long a foe of marijuana usage, the attorney general pointed out that the drug remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. His decision to get rid of the Obama memo, without issuing his own priorities, has created some confusion about whether the law will be enforced differently in different states. Sessions explained himself at an event this week honoring former President Ronald Reagan and the people who worked for him. \"We don't think illegal drug use is 'recreation,' \" the attorney general said. \"Lax enforcement, permissive rhetoric and the media have undermined the essential need to say no to drug use \u2014 don't start.\"",

President Trump's first State of the Union address was billed as a bid for unity, a call for all to rise above party and faction in pursuit of national ideas and ideals. In fact, scattered throughout the 80-minute speech were several moments that might qualify as outreach. But if you blinked, you might have missed them. For example, halfway through his speech, the president made a passing reference to vocational schools. Then he quickly added these 10 words \u2014 \"And let's support working families by supporting paid family leave,\" a hat tip to a Democratic issue supported by his eldest daughter, Ivanka. Cameras cut to a happy Ivanka, clapping in the family gallery. Democrats, too, leapt to their feet, and many stayed there as the president followed up with a single sentence referring to another of their issues: \"[T]his year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life.\" But anyone expecting a word of detail regarding any of these proposals or the resources they'd require, in fact, got no such thing. Last year, the president included paid family leave in his budget but left it up to the states to finance it. Nothing changed. A bit earlier in the address, the president had this to say on another topic of urgency to many Democrats: \"One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. [Applause.] In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair.\" And the White House plan for addressing this? \"[I]'ve directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year,\" the president said, to general applause. \"And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\" Some may note that the newly confirmed head of Trump's Department of Health and Human Services comes to the office from Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant. So, watch we will. Throughout the speech, when the president came to questions of policy, he fell back on a recitation of his campaign talking points. Much of the speech recalled his remarks at the pep rallies he has held in the past year, most of them deep in the heart of Trump Country. It is true that Trump's tone and manner on Tuesday night were more restrained than his famously rousing style on the stump. But a somewhat more sedate delivery does not, in itself, constitute a conciliatory speech. This was most in evidence when Trump turned to immigration and related topics, as he did again and again. Among his salient points was a repeated emphasis on the MS-13 gang and its crimes. These included alleged crimes he has highlighted before, complete with the victims' grieving parents, who were seated in the visitors gallery and were asked to stand for a round of applause. By citing the MS-13 (\"horrible people\") repeatedly, Trump emphasized his view that lax enforcement in the past has resulted in substantial economic, criminal and terrorist threats. Trump made the same point in speaking of \"open borders\" that allowed criminals and drugs to \"pour\" across. There were times when Trump's remarks could be heard and appreciated by all hearers. He laced his address with tributes to various American heroes whom all could salute and applaud \u2014 often at length. These included rescuers who saved lives in the California wildfires and other natural disasters of the past year. There were several uniformed military and police personnel who had battled the nation's enemies foreign and domestic. These moments had the desired effect of bringing all in the House chamber and, symbolically, all those watching at home, to share moments of common emotion and community feeling. But here again, Trump veered into his favored themes of criminality and joblessness stemming from immigration. Some of his heroes were parents of young people who allegedly died at the hands of illegal immigrants. It is understandable that victims of any crime committed by immigrants may blame immigration for their suffering. But the exploitation of that suffering to appeal to hardcore anti-immigration voters and members of Congress may not be the way to \"set politics aside and finally get the job done\" \u2014 as the president said he wanted to do when it comes to changing the nation's immigration laws. Even when discussing the DREAMers, whom he has said he would offer legal status and an eventual path to citizenship, the president was not letting go of the distinction between them and actual Americans. DREAMers are the estimated 1.8 million U.S. residents brought to the country as minors without legal status. The president repeated his offer of status and eventual citizenship for these residents, made it conditional on Congress building his wall on the Mexico border and ending \"chain migration\" \u2014 his inimical term for long-standing programs stressing family reunification. Trump said ending such programs was intended \"to protect the nuclear family\" by limiting reunification to immediate spouses and minor children. \"Americans,\" the president said in a widely quoted passage, \"are dreamers too.\" The distinction in the president's mind between Americans and these who aspire to be Americans could scarcely be clearer. As the evening began, the usually celebratory atmosphere of such occasions was lacking. For some, at least, the moment was fraught with the divisiveness of immigration and issues of sexual assault and harassment. Some Democrats had invited DREAMers as their gallery guests, prompting Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., to suggest these guests be arrested by Capitol Police and deported. Trump makes a point during his State of the Union address.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump makes a point during his State of the Union address. Given this tension, the president might have chosen to make a very different speech \u2014 aimed at meeting his various opponents halfway. He might have credited, for example, some of the members of the Senate who have been trying to negotiate a compromise on immigration. He might have saluted the Democrats in the Senate who voted for his tax cut last year, or who have been negotiating with his administration on infrastructure and other areas of shared concern. We know the president is capable of such behavior; we saw him do it when he hosted a bipartisan White House meeting of House and Senate leaders on immigration on Jan. 17. During that hourlong confab, with TV cameras still on, Trump listened to all sides and offered to embrace whatever they could produce. Two days later, of course, the president famously rejected what he'd asked for and produced his own set of demands. After that, the immigration puzzle seemed as far as ever from a solution. And the State of the Union address left the two sides, or the many sides, just as far apart. And then there is the even more explosive question of the Department of Justice investigation into election interference by Russia. Trump mentioned Russia only once in his address, and then only in a drive-by reference to \"rival countries such as China and Russia.\" He never mentioned his struggles with the FBI, or his widely reported concerns about DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller. Perhaps it would have been surprising if he had. His lawyers might well have urged him not to, just as they probably beg him not to discuss the investigation on Twitter. But would it have been impossible for Trump to have at least expressed respect for the legal process now underway? Would it be wrong for him to relieve the anxieties of many in his party who fear he might soon fire Mueller or Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department official who appointed Mueller? Even Richard Nixon took on Watergate, which was the elephant in the room when he gave his last State of the Union address early in 1974. \"One year of Watergate is enough,\" Nixon said, referring to the various probes that had dominated the news in 1973. Republicans in the chamber agreed and applauded. Nixon apparently thought he was secure enough to urge dismissal of that matter at that time. Trump apparently feels secure enough not to address his own potential legal exposures at all. In any event, leaving Russia out entirely represented yet another missed opportunity to make this speech a truly national and nonpartisan assessment of the state of the union.",

            "article_content": "In the aftermath of the January 2011 shooting attack against Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., lawmakers used the State of the Union that month to send a message to the nation: What unites us is greater than what divides us. Lawmakers voluntarily scrambled the partisan seating chart in the U.S. House chamber that year to bring Republicans and Democrats together. \"I'm here because I believe it is time to work together to solve the problems at hand,\" said newly elected Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., at the news conference touting the bipartisan seating plan. \"At the end of the day, we all came to Congress with the same goal: to represent the people we serve and to continue to ensure that our future generations will have the same opportunities all of us had. While we may disagree how we get there, we can do so respectfully and work hand in hand to find the best solutions for the problems we face as a country,\" Gosar said then. The seating tradition endured for a few years, but as President Trump prepares to address Congress in his first official State of the Union speech one thing is certain: Those days are over. \"Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance,\" Gosar's office tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance. Gosar's tweet is in response to dozens of congressional Democrats planning a confrontational move of their own toward the president: Inviting DREAMers as their official guests, people who were brought to the country as children and now reside in the U.S. either illegally or with a temporary protected status that Trump has threatened to revoke in March, if Congress does not pass legislation to determine their fate. Gosar is unlikely to get his way \u2014 a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said the speaker \"clearly does not agree\" with such a move \u2014 but the immigration impasse hanging over Congress is just one factor contributing to a confrontational and partisan atmosphere waiting to greet the president Tuesday night. No president in the modern era has been as unpopular with the American public on his first State of the Union address as Trump. With approval ratings hovering in the high 30s, and the immigration debate inflaming the parties' most passionate base activists, Democrats in particular are in no mood to play nice. \"Since his campaign, President Trump has taken every opportunity, in speeches, in tweets, in meetings to divide this country along racial lines,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond, D-La., said Tuesday. \"He's called Mexicans 'criminals and rapists.' He's called white supremacists 'very fine people.' He's called African-American football players 'sons of bitches.' He's called Haiti and Africa 'shithole' countries. ... What we know now, more than any time in our history, is that words matter,\" Richmond said. \"And President Trump's racist rhetoric makes the country less safe for people of color by encouraging and emboldening and pandering to those who wish to do harm to others based on the color of their skin.\" At least a dozen Democrats, including prominent CBC members like civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., announced they will boycott tonight's address. Other Democrats have chosen other confrontational moves. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., ticked off Republicans with his decision to bring Randy Bryce as his guest. Bryce is the Democratic candidate seeking to challenge Ryan in the 2018 midterms \u2014 a move that injects midterm election year politics into an official event. \"This is an attempt to sow political discourse and deepen a divide in an already fractured political environment. Creating a spectacle like this \u2014 regardless of position or party \u2014 is disrespectful and out of bounds,\" Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., told The Wisconsin State Journal. However, the president is injecting partisan politics into the address on his own. The Trump campaign is using his speech to solicit campaign contributions to have donor names appear onscreen during a campaign livestream of the event. \"This is a movement. It's not about just one of us. It's about ALL of us. Which is why your name deserves to be displayed during tonight's speech,\" reads the Trump campaign site. All of this means it will be that much harder for Trump to make a case to the public for a bipartisan immigration deal. Democrats have uniformly rejected the White House's proposals to limit family-based migration and a visa lottery program. The president is also facing pushback from immigration hard-liners in the GOP who don't want to support any legislation that provides a path to citizenship for people currently residing in the country illegally. No matter what Trump says tonight, many lawmakers in the audience have already retreated to their corners and stopped listening. Editor's note: NPR has decided in this case to spell out the vulgar word that the president reportedly used because it meets our standard for use of offensive language: It is \"absolutely integral to the meaning and spirit of the story being told.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump says he's willing to be interviewed by the special counsel probing Russian interference in the election. Trump urges caution as Turkey attacks U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: President Trump made this surprise appearance in front of reporters last night and during the session he made some promises. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Yeah, he said he'd be willing to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation - investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. And the president added he would do it under oath. GREENE: Well, let's explore this with NPR's Mara Liasson, who was one of the reporters in the room at - what - Mara, was this like an impromptu press conference, or what happened here? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: It was absolutely impromptu. We were in the office of a senior White House official who was going to brief us off the record about immigration. In walks the president, presumably on his way out the door to go to Davos. And he started talking on the record, and he kept on talking. And he did... GREENE: Doesn't happen every day when you're covering the White House, does it? LIASSON: Doesn't happen every day. He did say he would do it under oath - as in talk to Robert Mueller. He said he'd love to do it. He said he was looking forward to it. He said, subject to my lawyers and all of that. And of course later, one of his lawyers, Ty Cobb, gave a statement to The New York Times that tried to walk back Trump's promises a little bit. He said Trump was not volunteering to go before a grand jury. But there it is - I would do it under oath. GREENE: OK - with the caveat, subject to my lawyers, which leaves all options open, I guess. LIASSON: Yes. GREENE: What else stood out to you as he was discussing this investigation? LIASSON: Well, two other things stood out to me. One is he said he doesn't recall asking Andrew McCabe who he voted for - McCabe was the acting director of the FBI - although he said that question would be unimportant. He also talked about obstruction in a new way. He said there was no obstruction. He said, quote, \"oh, well, did he fight back? Did he fight back? You fight back, and they say it's obstruction.\" In other words, he was suggesting that his efforts to defend himself against the investigation were unfairly interpreted as obstruction. Presumably, that includes firing Jim Comey. GREENE: Wow, he got into a lot of details about this investigation... LIASSON: Yeah. GREENE: ...This impromptu session. LIASSON: Yeah. GREENE: So - OK, you said you were originally there to talk to a senior administration official about immigration. And I mean, I guess sometimes when you're talking to a senior White House official, they might say, well, you have to hear from the president himself on that. And you got to hear from the president himself... LIASSON: Yes. GREENE: ...On that. What did he say? LIASSON: That was the most interesting part. Also, Congress has been asking - even begging to find out, what does the president want in a deal on immigration for the DACA recipients? What would he sign? And he was very specific. He said he wanted a path to citizenship. He said, quote, \"over a period of 10 to 12 years.\" He said he wanted $20 billion for the wall for 800 miles of wall. We asked him, what does he want on chain migration or family unification? That's a very important sticking point here. He said we want a new standard. He said you can't just bring anybody you've ever met into the country. But wives, husbands, sons and daughters would be OK. And then he said he wants the visa lottery system either gone or replaced. So that's a framework for a deal. GREENE: Yeah, those are details - although details like the wall, money for the wall - didn't Minority Leader Chuck Schumer say that the wall is now off the table? LIASSON: Yes because he had offered Trump the wall in exchange for legalizing the DREAMers. And when Trump didn't take that, he said that's off the table. But that would absolutely be part of a final deal. He also said that he had a message for DACA recipients. He said they shouldn't worry. Tell them not to be concerned. So this is something new. Donald Trump is getting involved in the details of legislation, and he actually is trying to make a deal. He will have to sell this to his hard-line conservatives in the House if something like this passes the Senate, and maybe he will be able to. GREENE: NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK, President Trump had another conversation yesterday. And unlike that meeting with reporters we just heard about, we do not have an audio recording. INSKEEP: Nope. This was a phone call between President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The two countries, Turkey and the United States, have reached an awkward moment. Turkish jets have been bombing Kurdish forces, Kurdish forces armed by the United States to fight ISIS. Yes, a NATO ally of the United States bombed forces allied with the United States. The White House said President Trump warned that Turkey's operations threaten their shared goals. Turkey does not agree, though, on what was said. GREENE: And let's turn to NPR's Peter Kenyon who is in Istanbul. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So they call this a readout. This is when the White House, you know, types up an account of what the president discussed with a world leader. We see this all the time. It's usually a lot about cooperation and shared goals. This feels different, like the readout's being, you know, studied more closely now. KENYON: Very different. The White House went first - quickly sent out its own summary of the call - and it was pretty sharp. It focused on President Trump's concerns over this military operation against the fighters that the Pentagon, you know, thinks are crucial to this fight against ISIS. The White House says Trump spoke about escalating violence, undercutting the goals in Syria. And since then, we've seen even stronger language. Now the White House homeland security adviser is quoted as saying it would be preferable if Turkish troops would remove themselves from the conflict in Syria. Now, there's one particular worry for the U.S., and that's Turkey's intention to move from Afrin, where they are now, toward a place called Manbij, further east. And there are U.S. forces there. Now, Turkey's foreign minister has responded to U.S. statements by saying - well, we've got trust issues with the U.S. right now, and that makes it impossible for us to really talk seriously about our plans in northern Syria. Ankara's version of this exact same call is remarkably different, basically accusing the White House of misstating the content of what was said. Never brought up - several phrases in the White House readout were completely denied in the Turkish one. So two remarkably different summaries. GREENE: How serious is this in Turkey, I mean, this disagreement over a very important phone call? KENYON: Well, it's the latest in a series of disagreements. I mean, it's just sort of the latest sign that anti-American sentiment here is running stronger than it has in years. Meanwhile, you've got some conservatives in the U.S. questioning whether Turkey even belongs in NATO anymore. Now, if the polls are to be believed, Turkey's people are rallying behind Erdogan. We'll see how it goes. INSKEEP: You know, this is a reminder of something that was said by the very first president, George Washington, who observed that countries do not act based on friendship; they act based on interests. And this is a circumstance where the U.S. and Turkey, though they're allies, just don't see their interests exactly the same way in northern Syria. GREENE: Something we're seeing exposed here. NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Peter, we appreciate it. KENYON: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we're going to turn now to the question of, who is to blame for a long, long pattern of abuse? INSKEEP: Yeah. And this number is stunning. More than 150 women say they were sexually abused by Larry Nassar. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State doctor was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison yesterday. His crimes go back decades. And so people are asking, how could that happen, and how could it happen so long? Who was in charge? Well, the former CEO of USA Gymnastics resigned last year. And now the longtime president of Michigan State University, where Nassar also worked, has stepped down. So what do we know about what they knew? GREENE: OK, we have USA Today sportswriter Christine Brennan with us. Hi, Christine. CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Hey, David. How's it going? GREENE: It's going OK. BRENNAN: Yeah. GREENE: But this a - I mean, this is a terrible story to cover. And I guess we're seeing the fallout now. And I guess - can you just remind us about this former university president and why she says she's now resigning? BRENNAN: In 2014, David, she received a Title IX complaint and word that there was an investigation, and this would be, of course, of Larry Nassar, the man who did these horrible things to so many gymnasts. And she said that she really didn't have the curiosity to even go any further and find out what it was about. And when you consider that this was less than three years after the horrors at Penn State involving Jerry Sandusky and you've got a university president at Michigan State just a few hundred miles away - it is just unbelievable that a university president wouldn't look into this and take it a step further and see what this was about. So President Simon was under fire and under pressure. The board of trustees was very supportive of her up until about, you know, last night. But clearly, the waves and waves of victim impact statements, the continuing storyline here that riveted the nation - horrified the nation - it just became too much for her to keep her job. GREENE: And so - I mean, first this started out as USA Gymnastics. Now we're saying the head of Michigan State having to resign. I mean, Christine, you've covered scandals involving sexual abuse by powerful figures in athletics. You mentioned Sandusky of Penn State. I mean, have you - are there solutions out there to prevent something like this from happening? Why does this keep happening? BRENNAN: Proactive, new-age leadership. It's just amazing that these young women feel powerless to speak out, even as they are some of the most powerful and successful athletes in the world. And that's, of course, what we're talking about with these Olympic gold medal gymnasts who felt they had no place to - nowhere to go, no one to tell, almost paralyzed in their fear over this doctor as they're in the Olympic pipeline and don't want to, obviously, lose their place by speaking out. So a whole new day has to dawn here. And it has to happen with the U.S. Olympic Committee leading the way - and they're very concerned - but to have younger voices and openness, liaisons with athletes. But it is just appalling, frankly, that now we've had two of these in this decade involving two of the most respected sports programs, Penn State, Michigan State - and of course Michigan State with USA Gymnastics because this doctor did all these terrible things at both places. GREENE: Christine Brennan covers sports for USA Today. Christine, thanks a lot. BRENNAN: David, thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF VETIVER'S \"STRANGER STILL\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Doug Jones of Alabama voted to end the shutdown in exchange for a promise the Senate will consider protecting child immigrants brought illegally to the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama voted to end the shutdown in exchange for a promise the Senate will consider protecting child immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. Alabama Sen. Doug Jones has a message for those who say Democrats gave in too quickly during recent negotiations to end the government shutdown. \"I don't think they caved at all,\" Jones tells NPR's Morning Edition. Jones, who won a special election last month in a deep red state, fills the seat left vacant by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones and other Democrats voted to end the shutdown on Monday in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the Senate will consider a bill to grant legal status to those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The roughly 700,000 DACA recipients are often referred to as DREAMers. McConnell's promise, Jones says, is progress. \"The Senate hasn't been for some time the kind of deliberative body that it's supposed to be \u2014 where you have legislation, you come to the floor of the Senate and you debate it and all sides have an equal opportunity to talk about it, debate it, and then hopefully pass something,\" he says. \"To be able to do that I think with the DACA and the DREAMers in a little bit broader immigration \u2014 not necessarily the broad piece of reform \u2014 I think that was a major breakthrough.\" On whether Democrats will have a fair shot I think so, absolutely. I think one of the biggest issues that the Senate faced this past weekend was one of trust, and that was a huge hurdle and it was distrust on both sides. I think this was a big breakthrough because you had a bipartisan group of senators that actually grew in number over the course of the weekend. That said, we've got to get past this, we've got to put our cards on the table and we've got to trust each other to do what the Senate does best and that's deliberate. On what the House may do with a Senate-passed immigration bill If the Senate can come up with a bill that [gets] 60 votes, I think there will be a lot of pressure on the White House and the House to pass something. We have another deadline of March 5 coming up in which there will be people starting to be deported. That is also I think a driving factor to get something done. On the prospects of the Senate considering a larger immigration overhaul bill I don't think we're going to get there on this right now. I don't know, I think we have to wait and see. I think a broader immigration reform package is going to be down the road. I think we need to address some of the issues at hand right now \u2014 the issue of the DACA kids and the issue of border security right now.

Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET The federal government is back open for business on Tuesday, but the immigration fight that brought it to a three-day shutdown is far from over. On Monday, Congress passed a stopgap spending bill that funds the government through Feb. 8, with Democrats crossing over to back the measure in exchange for assurances that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would bring an immigration bill to the floor. McConnell said he would pursue legislation to address the legal status of roughly 700,000 immigrants protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which will expire in March, as well as border security and other issues. President Trump weighed in on Twitter on Tuesday morning to congratulate his staff for its work over the past several days, after much chatter about how little the president himself was involved in the deal-making. Trump also acknowledged the big task ahead on working out an immigration deal in 16 days. Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us! Congress also needs to agree on a long-term funding plan, which is thought to be close at hand, but there are several reasons why finding a bipartisan solution on immigration is far from easy. To begin with, Trump has been inconsistent on what kind of immigration bill he would sign, despite an insistence otherwise from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday. The broad framework is that, in exchange for a permanent fix for DACA, the president wants funding for the border wall he touted frequently during the campaign, along with an end to what he calls chain migration \u2014 or legal immigrants bringing other family members to the U.S. \u2014 and an end to the visa lottery system. Sanders said Tuesday that the bipartisan compromise negotiated by Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., was \"totally unacceptable to the president and should be declared dead on arrival\" because it doesn't meet those benchmarks. But when Trump held a bipartisan discussion with lawmakers earlier this month, he signaled that he would sign whatever bill Congress sent him, even if he wasn't \"in love with\" it and that he would take any backlash from both sides. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said that he offered Trump funding for his border wall on Friday, hours before the shutdown started, as part of a deal for DACA protections but that Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, later called to say the deal was off. Schumer reiterated Tuesday that the wall was now off the table and argued that Trump's inability to negotiate was what had led to the shutdown. Tensions were already inflamed after Trump reportedly used a vulgarity to refer to African countries and disparaged Haiti during a discussion of U.S. visa and immigration policies with a bipartisan group of senators earlier this month. On Monday, Sanders wouldn't commit to Trump's supporting a path to citizenship, instead of simply a legal status for the \"DREAMers.\" That is the common name given to those who are in the U.S. illegally after entering the country as children. For Democrats, and even some Republicans, a status short of citizenship could be a nonstarter. And even if a bill passes the Senate, it could have a much tougher time in the House, where Republicans say they will not be bound by any deal made in the Senate. The last time the Senate passed a major immigration overhaul bill, in 2013, it died a year later in the House. Trump did meet with six GOP senators on Monday to discuss \"the next steps on responsible immigration reform.\" That group included immigration hard-liners such as Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga., who were not members of the bipartisan group that has been working to find a solution palpable to both sides. Not in attendance were Graham and Flake, who are part of the bipartisan group, but Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who has spoken out in favor of protecting DACA recipients, was there. Graham \u2014 once a strident opponent of Trump's who has developed a cozy relationship with the president over the past few months \u2014 said over the weekend that he is skeptical of many of the president's advisers, especially White House senior policy aide Stephen Miller, who push Trump in a conservative direction on immigration as soon as he seems to want a compromise. The president also conferred with two conservative Democrats at the White House on Monday, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and the newly elected Doug Jones of Alabama. Upon returning to the Capitol, they said that specifics weren't discussed but sounded optimistic that an immigration deal could be reached. \"I think he's very much committed to relieving this DACA challenge that we all have. I don't think anyone wants to be in it, no one is insensitive about that. In talking with his chief of staff, Gen. Kelly, I'm just hopeful we can find that pathway forward. ... The House is going to have to do their thing, but the Senate is in a position to move forward, and he's hoping that they'll come to something that they can all live with,\" said Manchin, who faces a tough re-election campaign in November. He's one of 10 Democrats running again in states that Trump won in 2016. Further direct talks with Trump may have to wait. He is slated to travel to Davos, Switzerland, this week for the World Economic Forum. The president's first State of the Union address on Jan. 30 provides him a highly visible opportunity to expand on what he wants in a bill, just over a week before the critical deadline. While some Democrats and progressive groups said that Schumer \"caved,\" more moderate lawmakers expressed optimism that McConnell would keep his promise to bring a bill to the floor. That is despite the fact that he hasn't yet fulfilled pledges to other lawmakers in exchange for their votes in December on the GOP tax bill. \"It's one thing to make a promise behind closed doors in a conversation. It's another thing to be before C-SPAN and before the whole world saying, 'I will bring a bill forward, it will be neutral, it will be an open, level playing field.' That's a commitment,\" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, told NPR's All Things Considered on Monday. Speaking after Senate lunches on Tuesday, McConnell also stood behind his promise. \"I intend to keep my word,\" the majority leader said.",

The House followed suit, and the government is expected to reopen on Tuesday. Updated at 9:05 p.m. ET President Trump has signed a stopgap spending bill passed by Congress on Monday, ending the partial shutdown of the federal government after three days. The White House has said normal government operations will resume by Tuesday morning. The bill passed the Senate on Monday afternoon with a 81-18 vote, but the real hurdle was the procedural vote earlier in the day requiring at least 60 votes. That's where the measure hit a snafu late Friday night, triggering the stalemate. The House later passed the 17-day extension by a 266-150 vote. Shortly before the Monday procedural vote was set to begin, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced that he would vote to reopen the government along with enough Democrats needed to advance the bill. After 24 hours of furious negotiation over plans to consider immigration legislation in the coming weeks, the Senate voted to move forward with the continuing resolution, which would fund the government through Feb. 8. In exchange for his support, Schumer said, he has received assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that if an agreement isn't reached by then, the GOP leader will bring a vote to the floor on legislation to grant legal status to those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, roughly 700,000 immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children. The bill also extends the expired Children's Health Insurance Program for six years. McConnell says Democrats caved because they realized holding out for a DACA deal tied to the funding deal was not wise politically. \"I think if we've learned anything during this process it's that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the American people didn't understand,\" McConnell said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., arrives at the Capitol on Monday, the third day of the government shutdown. With support for a 17-day funding measure, the government is on track to reopen.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

With support for a 17-day funding measure, the government is on track to reopen. Schumer, however, argued that blame for the weekend-long stalemate lay at the president's feet. \"The reason the Republican majority had such difficulty finding consensus is they could never get a firm grip on what the president of their party wanted to do. These days, you never know who to deal with when it comes to the Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"The Republican leaders told me to work out a deal with the White House. The White House said, work it out with Republican leaders on the Hill. Separately, President Trump turned away from not one, but two bipartisan compromises. Each would have avoided this shutdown.\" In statement later Monday, Trump said that with the government on the path to reopening, the administration would work on immigration legislation \u2014 but \"only if it's good for our country.\" \"I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, border patrol, first responders and insurance for vulnerable children,\" Trump said. \"As I've always said, once the government is funded, my administration will work towards solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if and only if it's good for our country.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dodged questions at the daily briefing as to whether that would include a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, which many hard-line conservatives oppose. And she insisted that the president has been clear about what he wants in an immigration bill, despite shifting positions over the past week that even GOP leaders have complained about. With the measure moving forward, it will now be hard for Democrats to argue they extracted many concessions from GOP leaders. McConnell's promise is just that \u2014 a promise. \"Some of us struggle to trust him,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told NPR's Morning Edition, \"because of the famously vulgar way that President Trump sort of blew up the last time that Sens. [Lindsey] Graham and [Dick] Durbin offered him a bipartisan deal [on immigration].\" Democrats were trying to frame the deal as a temporary victory, though. Senate Minority Whip Durbin took the floor to call the DACA issue the \"civil rights issue of our time\" and underscore the importance of passing an immigration bill by the new deadline, which he said McConnell had assured them would be on a level playing field. While many Senate Democrats had remained entrenched in their opposition to any funding deal that didn't include a DACA fix, a growing number of moderate lawmakers were wary of an extended shutdown fight. Most of the endangered Democrats who are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won all voted to advance the measure, except for Montana Sen. Jon Tester. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who faces a potentially competitive re-election this fall, sounded optimistic about the agreement. \"What you have is pretty much an ironclad commitment that if we don't resolve this \u2014 and that's what we're going to try to do with the Graham bill \u2014 resolve the DACA issue by Feb. 8, the commitment is you go to the floor with a neutral bill, like a shell, and you let the Senate process work,\" Nelson said. Many Democrats had worried that the Republican talking point that Democrats were siding with \"illegal immigrants\" over the military and government would resonate with voters as the stalemate extended into the workweek Monday morning. President Trump tweeted that argument himself. The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good! Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who has argued for tougher immigration standards, also echoed that sentiment. \"Shutting down the government and depriving American citizens of services because you want amnesty for illegal immigrants is a massive political blunder,\" said Cotton. Trump has generally kept a low profile during the shutdown. He canceled a planned trip to Florida where he hoped to celebrate the first anniversary of his inauguration with a high-dollar fundraising party. Aides say the president spent the weekend telephoning lawmakers and working with staff to minimize fallout from shuttered government operations. Sanders pushed back on allegations from Schumer and other Democrats that Trump was absent from negotiations over the weekend and never reached out to their side. \"What the president did clearly worked,\" Sanders countered. \"The vote just came in 81-18.\" A group of about 20 senators met for several hours on Saturday and again on Sunday afternoon to hash out the plan that ultimately allowed both sides to back down from their increasingly entrenched positions and vote to reopen the government. Representatives from those talks briefed leaders Sunday afternoon, but the suspense dragged out for nearly six hours before McConnell made his announcement. Several of the senators in the bipartisan group said they worried a prolonged shutdown could become harder to fix and would cause greater damage to the country. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., who is one of several Democrats up for re-election in states where Trump won in 2016, joined the talks. \"One of the things we learned from the last shutdown was that as time goes on, positions harden,\" Heitkamp said. \"Resolution gets more difficult the longer we wait.\" However, more liberal senators \u2014 including several potential 2020 hopefuls such as Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 all voted against the measure, standing firm over the DACA issue. Two conservative GOP senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, also voted no, though they have repeatedly opposed on principle any continuing resolutions as a way to keep the government funded.

Updated at 10:01 p.m. ET The Senate will vote at noon on Monday to end the government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the floor Sunday evening and laid out a plan to restore government funding for three weeks and consider immigration proposals, while bipartisan talks continue to end the impasse that has triggered a partial government shutdown since Friday night. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer objected to a vote on Sunday evening, but not the plan to vote on Monday. \"I am happy to continue my discussion with the majority leader about reopening the government,\" Schumer said. \"We've had several conversations. Talks will continue, but we have yet to reach an agreement on a path forward that would be acceptable to both sides.\" A vote was originally scheduled for 1 a.m. ET, but instead the Senate adjourned until 10 a.m. Monday morning. McConnell said that, if the impasse ends, \"It would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA, border security, and related issues.\" A bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators said earlier they were nearing an agreement to pass a spending bill to reopen the government in exchange for plans to begin work on immigration legislation. The group emerged from a closed door meeting Sunday prepared to brief leaders on the outlines of a plan that would allow both sides to back down from their increasingly entrenched positions and vote to reopen the government. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said the agreement would require the Senate to quickly begin debate a wide range of immigration proposals with hopes of passing a bill in the coming weeks. \"There was a larger conversation about having the Senate actually function again,\" Coons said. \"And how important it would be to have a full, wide open debate on the different proposals that Democrats and Republicans have on how to deal with border security and how to deal with DACA.\" Another negotiator in the room, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., predicted that \"there will be a breakthrough tonight.\" The positive tone was a distinct departure from the hostile rhetoric elsewhere in the Senate earlier on Sunday. The number two Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, said in a floor speech that Democrats had \"shot themselves in the foot, reloaded, and shot themselves in the other foot.\" Democrats accused Republicans of pitting \"innocent kids against innocent kids,\" as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said Sunday. Republicans have offered a six year funding extension of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program as part of their funding proposal. CHIP expired last fall. But Democrats also want action on the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which granted legal status to people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Several of the negotiators at the Sunday afternoon meeting said they believed their plan would demonstrate to leaders that there is a path forward. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the plan was to help leadership, not circumvent them. \"We are trying to be helpful in showing them there is a path forward,\" Collins said. \"A substantial of Senators from both parties are eager to find that path.\" Such an agreement would allow both sides to vote to reopen the government without backing down from their demands. Republicans have continued to reiterate that they will not negotiate on immigration and DACA while the government is shut down. And Democrats say a spending deal would also have to protect the immigrants who have been shielded from deportation by the DACA program. \"What we're facing right now is Democrats taking an absolutely implausible position that says we're going to deny funding to two million troops who are serving our country, tens of thousands of border patrol agents trying to protect our country, over an issue that's not even in this bill,\" said Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, on Sunday's This Week as well. \"That is an impossible position on which to negotiate.\" President Trump began his day Sunday by suggesting the Senate should get rid of the requirement the 60 vote threshold for advancing legislation. \"Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked,\" Trump tweeted before 8 a.m. on Sunday. \"If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.'s!\" Trump was acknowledging the fact that a government spending bill would need 60 votes to pass the Senate, which would require at least nine Democrats to vote in favor of it. Republicans could theoretically vote to change its rules to require just a simple 51-vote majority to pass a spending bill, as they did to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long voiced opposition to such an option. \"That would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our founding fathers,\" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on ABC's This Week on Sunday. \"We have to acknowledge a respect for the minority, and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition and its procedure.\" In the midst of the stalemate, President Trump's re-election campaign released an ad declaring that \"Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants,\" a stance that did little to improve the negotiating climate. Short defended the ad on Sunday, saying \"the reality is that there are safety concerns for our country.\" Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, however, looked surprised after being shown the ad by John Dickerson on CBS' Face The Nation and said \"I don't know if that's necessarily productive, but it's no secret the president has strong views on immigration.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the president of essentially acting in bad faith after the two met one-on-one at the White House on Friday. \"What's even more frustrating than President Trump's intransigence is the way he seems amenable to these compromises before completely switching positions and backing off. Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\" Schumer said Saturday. Some congressional Republicans have been open to negotiating on just a DACA solution, while others, like President Trump, want it tied to increased border security efforts, like building a wall on the southern border. \"We want to move from a system based on family relations to one based on skills and merit for what the economy needs \u2014 perfectly common sense,\" said House Speaker Ryan on Sunday. \"Here's the issue, if we simply did DACA without incumbent reforms then we'd have a DACA problem five years down the road. We want to fix the problem and the root cause of the problem.\" Democrats say Schumer offered border security compromises in his meeting on Friday with the President, including potential funding for the wall, which Trump seemed initially receptive to. The White House then called just hours later, Democrats say, to kill the negotiations. Remaining in D.C. because of the shutdown, Trump has had no public appearances or interviews although the White House said he had spoken with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex. and was consulting with Cabinet members about the impact of the shutdown on government agencies. In the House, Republicans approved a procedural measure that will allow GOP leaders to speedily bring a new stopgap measure to the floor if a new spending agreement is reached.

Updated at 11:16 p.m. ET A partial government shutdown now looks inevitable after the Senate lacks the votes on a stopgap spending bill late Friday night. The vote was 50-48 in favor of the measure with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., yet to vote. The White House, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats were unable to reach a deal to get to the 60 votes needed to proceed after a flurry of meetings, leading to finger-pointing and blame over who was responsible for the unprecedented shutdown on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. Shutdowns are usually the product of divided government, but this likely shutdown would be the first time one occurred when the same party controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Republicans stepped up their attacks on Democrats throughout the day Friday, blaming them for forcing the standoff. McConnell, R-Ky., accused Democrats of using immigration as a bargaining chip in the fight. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., returns to the U.S. Capitol after meeting with President Trump at the White House on Friday afternoon.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., returns to the U.S. Capitol after meeting with President Trump at the White House on Friday afternoon. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., traveled Friday afternoon to the White House to meet with President Trump, and the White House struck an optimistic tone afterward, but ultimately the high-level meeting proved unsuccessful. Senate Democrats stood firm in refusing to vote for a stopgap measure without an agreement for long-term increases in military and domestic spending and a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700,000 immigrants. Those are individuals who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program established by the Obama administration. Those protections from deportation are set to begin expiring in March after the Trump administration announced it was rescinding DACA last year. McConnell could vote no on the measure for procedural reasons so that he reserves the ability to bring up a substitute bill later. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was not present for the vote. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, W.Va.; Joe Donnelly, Ind.; Heidi Heitkamp, N.D.; and Claire McCaskill, Mo. \u2014 all four in competitive re-election races in states that Trump won \u2014 ended up crossing party lines to vote for the bill, along with newly-elected Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. But four Republicans also voted no \u2014 Sens. Lindsey Graham, S.C; Rand Paul, Ky.; Mike Lee, Utah; and Jeff Flake, Ariz., meaning that a majority of Republicans failed to vote for the measure. \"I am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days by voting for a continuing resolution,\" Graham said Thursday, though late Friday he was pushing for a three-week stopgap measure he said he would be able to support. \"It's time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up and act consistent with the values of a great nation,\" Graham also said Thursday. Democrats launched into a last-minute flurry of talks late Thursday after a House vote to approve a short-term spending bill to keep the government open until Feb. 16 and fund the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for six years. Schumer and McConnell have said they want to avoid a shutdown, but both Senate leaders have become increasingly insistent that they are unwilling to compromise on their demands. McConnell and other Republicans argued they had more than a month to agree to an immigration package before DACA is set to expire and called on Democrats to back the short-term bill in order to give them more time to negotiate. Republicans are already dubbing it the \"Schumer Shutdown.\" The minority leader had warned Republicans that they will not have enough Democratic votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold. Late Friday night as the vote happened, the hashtag \"TrumpShutdown\" was trending across the U.S. on Twitter. The Senate had convened Friday morning, but lawmakers and aides said even then there was no consensus on how to head off the impending midnight partial government shutdown. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who runs Senate Democrats' 2018 campaign operation, told NPR's Morning Edition Friday that Democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to four days to keep the government running and give negotiators more time to clinch deals in stalled immigration and budget talks. \"I'm not voting for a government shutdown. I'm voting to get an agreement to move forward,\" Van Hollen said. \"Let's stay in. Let's get it done.\" Van Hollen also said Trump, not the Democrats, will shoulder the blame if a shutdown occurs. \"If the president of the United States, whether by design or incompetence is going to shut down the government, that is a big problem,\" Van Hollen said. \"I hope he will show some leadership; he says he's the great negotiator.\" New data seems to agree. A Washington Post-ABC News poll out Friday found that 48 percent of Americans would blame Trump and Republicans for a shutdown, compared with 28 percent who would blame Democrats. The rest of the participants either blamed both equally or had no opinion. A CNN poll also out Friday found similar numbers blaming the president and Republicans in Congress over Democrats, though 56 percent said approving a budget deal was more important than a DACA deal, while just over a third said they wanted an immigration compromise included. Still, the Trump White House had worked hard to shift blame back to the Democrats. \"There is no way you could lay this at the feet of the president of the United States,\" said Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a press conference Friday morning. \"The reality is Republicans are united in keeping the government open. Democrats are united in trying to shut it down,\" White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told NPR's Morning Edition Friday. Short downplayed the merits of an even shorter stopgap, arguing that negotiators need more time to reach an immigration deal to determine the fate of the hundreds of thousands of people in the DACA program. \"I think we're making progress on DACA, but I think it's unrealistic to think there's going to be a solution in the next five days,\" Short said. Republicans have also sought to call attention to what they see as hypocrisy from the Democratic leadership, who loudly criticized Republicans in 2013 when the government last shut down, over Affordable Care Act disagreements. The House passed the four-week stopgap on Thursday, 230-197, with just six Democrats voting with Republicans. The measure included a six-year renewal of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program and further delays of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. There was ostensibly Democratic support for all of those provisions, but the vast majority of Democrats oppose the stopgap because of the ongoing inability to reach a bipartisan immigration deal. Democrats are also withholding support for a longer-term spending deal until an immigration deal is clinched. \"This vote should be a no-brainer,\" McConnell said Friday morning on the Senate floor. \"And it would be, except the Democratic leader has convinced his members to filibuster any funding bill that doesn't include legislation they are demanding for people who came into the United States illegally.\" The president has been an erratic negotiator in recent days, throwing already-contentious talks into disarray. After initially suggesting he would support any bipartisan proposal lawmakers could come up with, Trump rejected a proposal authored by Graham, a Republican, and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on the advice of more conservative lawmakers and his own top White House aides. The White House said Friday morning that President Trump will not leave for Florida as planned unless a spending deal is reached.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The White House said Friday morning that President Trump will not leave for Florida as planned unless a spending deal is reached. Trump was also seemingly at odds with his own chief of staff, John Kelly, over the president's continued support for building a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly told Fox News this week that Trump was \"flexible\" on the wall, to which Trump later tweeted: \"The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\" Trump further complicated budget negotiations on Thursday with a series of tweets that suggested he opposed the House stopgap bill. The White House put out a statement later that he did support it, and the president ultimately helped win over reluctant House conservatives to vote for the bill. Most Americans would not feel the effects of a partial government shutdown. However, hundreds of thousands of federal workers would face furloughs. \"The military would still go to work, they will not get paid. The border will still be patrolled, they will not get paid,\" said Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"Folks will still be fighting the fires out West, they will not get paid. Parks will be open, people won't get paid.\" All national security and military personnel deemed \"essential\" would continue to report to work, but they wouldn't get paid. That includes active-duty U.S. troops, unless Congress passes separate legislation to make sure their paychecks go out. Lawmakers, however, face no such threat. Members of Congress continue to get paid in a government shutdown. It costs more to shut down the government than to keep it running. Standard & Poor's estimated that the 2013 government shutdown, lasting 16 days, cost the economy $24 billion and shaved 0.6 percent off the economic growth for the fourth quarter that year.",

            "article_content": "NPR's news operation is a team effort. But a newsroom can't abruptly lose its leader \u2014 as NPR did in November when Michael Oreskes resigned under pressure amid allegations of sexual harassment \u2014 and expect to bounce back quickly or easily. More disruption could be on the way, as well, given that NPR has announced internally that it will search for a new newsroom head, who \u2014 unless she or he is already at NPR \u2014 will likely come with his or her own priorities and vision. Christopher Turpin is in the challenging position of overseeing this interlude period. A 17-year NPR veteran, he has been there before, as interim head of NPR's newsroom for a stint in 2014-15. When Oreskes, formerly of The Associated Press, was named to the top post, Turpin was named his deputy. He took the top spot again after Oreskes was pushed out. I have been impressed at how quickly he and his colleagues have moved to regroup, even as uncertainty looms. I asked Turpin to walk me (as a proxy for listeners) through his priorities for the year ahead. He started with reporting priorities: \"We want to focus on trying to do more high-impact reporting, more unduplicated reporting.\" In other words, break stories and commit resources to journalistic endeavors such as investigative and enterprise reporting. The latter involves a broad range of reporting, including digging beneath the surface of the daily news and looking for developments and trends that deserve greater public attention. That idea has been discussed internally for some time; I (and others) wished for more such reporting during the 2016 presidential campaign, since NPR certainly has the reporting and editing capability to do high-impact work. But it's an ambitious goal, as Turpin quickly acknowledged; the newsroom, like others, continues to maintain a punishing schedule just keeping up with the relentless number of stories coming out of Washington. Turpin called the newsroom staff of about 375 people (that compares to approximately 1,300 at The New York Times) \"overstretched and arguably under-resourced for what we're doing. It's a little miracle every day that we put out the coverage that we put out. The natural response is, where's the time and space to do that, when we're also having to focus on this firestorm of breaking news every single day that I also believe we have to keep pushing on. We can't let that go in order to do enterprise reporting.\" The shift has already proven doable, he said. Last week, NPR put forth, among other stories, a major investigative series on sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities, a report on why states are worried about changes to 529 college savings plans, and a thoughtful piece on if and how sexual harassers find redemption. All that while covering the fight over the DACA program, the revocation of Temporary Protective Status for El Salvador, and the uproar over reports of the president's profanity when discussing which immigrants should be allowed to enter the U.S. NPR is already bulking up on staff to cover Washington. It announced just after the new year that Asma Khalid would return to NPR to cover the political impact of America's changing demographics, and Tim Mak, formerly of the Daily Beast, would join NPR to cover \"movement conservatism,\" among other topics. NPR is also in the process of hiring a fourth White House correspondent, which is twice as many as the company assigned to cover most previous presidents. The team investigating Russia's alleged interference in U.S. elections will remain in place at least through the first quarter and most likely beyond, depending on the news. One particular area of focus will be election security. \"It's an area that plays to our strengths, and the strengths of member stations, and we have people in states who can look at this and cover it,\" Turpin said, adding, that \"it feels very true to our mission to be looking at the safety and security of our election process. That has a kind of public service mission to it.\" But to make room for the enterprise reporting, he said, \"We're also going to have to make some smart decisions about what we stop doing.\" He did not elaborate, partly because those newsroom conversations are just starting. But he did say: \"It's about every desk, every show, every platform thinking about what are the really essential stories that they need to be telling, what are the stories we need to be focusing on and what editorially can we leave behind and not do. Where do we want to be more efficient about aggregating and using material from other people and other organizations that will save our own reporters time that could be more valuably spent doing the kind of original work we want to put more value on.\" That could mean, for example, interviewing reporters from other news organizations when they break a big story rather than trying to match that story in-house. As an aside, listeners will also likely hear more about it when NPR does produce work that deserves attention, he said, as it focuses on better promotion. In the past, he said, NPR would, say, \"Put something out on Morning Edition, it goes out into the world and then it's gone.\" Going forward, he said, NPR wants to make sure reporting it is proud of reaches the widest possible audience. A second priority, Turpin said, is to continue work that began in earnest last year to make greater use of the public radio network by more closely tying local stations to the national newsroom through a series of regional reporting hubs. The first is expected to launch in March, with another two coming later in the year. If it works, he said, the initiative will improve \"local, regional and national journalism.\" (There are major challenges to this work, as NPR and the stations work on common editorial standards to guide their work. I'll have more on that initiative in an upcoming column, but Turpin acknowledged, \"It's not going to be easy.\") The coming year will also be one of further evolution in NPR's tone, with the early January retirement of Robert Siegel, one of the baby boomers who built NPR. \"Robert's retirement puts the point that we're at a moment of generational transition at NPR,\" Turpin said. \"We live in a less formal age and we need to reflect that,\" while still maintaining journalistic quality. Specifically, he has been working to \"infuse the newsmagazines with some of the energy and dynamism that's come out of podcasting,\" but \"without changing them so fundamentally that they are unrecognizable to people.\" One specific change that could be coming: NPR is talking to its member stations about making another round of changes to the Morning Edition \"clock,\" the minute-by-minute formatting that determines how long stories run, the timing of newscasts and promotions and when local stations can add their own news. The last change to the clock in November 2014 led to many listener complaints that stories are now too short, and that the hosts must constantly cut off live interviews. At the moment, he said, NPR is soliciting feedback from stations about possible changes, but I am encouraged that clock changes might be forthcoming. Finally, in a reference to the internal conversations that were convened following the ouster of Oreskes, Turpin said, \"we need to make sure that the newsroom comes out stronger from the mishegoss of the last few months. We need to really re-evaluate the culture. We need to think about what that means for the newsroom. And what that looks like.\" Specifically, he said, announcements are coming soon about NPR's use of temporary employees, who have been a mainstay of the newsroom for years. He said, \"A) there were too many of them and b) we weren't doing a very good job of looking after them and making sure they were integrated into the organization. We're going to announce some steps very soon around that\" which will include better training, and possibly evaluation systems \"so they know where they stand and what they need to work on so they don't feel that they're just wandering around the building without ever getting any feedback.\" Additionally, NPR is looking at whether it should make some of the temporary positions into full-time staff jobs, he said. More broadly, Turpin said, discussions that started around sexual harassment in the newsroom also turned up wider questions \"about how we treat each other. It's about civility, it's about what's acceptable behavior in the newsroom. I think we want to make sure we have a civil and respectful work place, and I think we need to work out what our baselines are and what's acceptable and what's not. I think it's clear that we don't have as strong a sense of shared values around civility and around what's acceptable as I think we might have thought that we did, and we clearly need to work at that.\" He added, \"I'll be blunt about this as a longtime manager: We need to be a better managed company. All of us who are managers need to better understand what our responsibilities are and we're committed to working at that. It would be a terrible tragedy if we get to the end of next year and we don't feel universally in every corner of the newsroom and every strata of the newsroom and beyond that we don't feel we are collectively better, healthier, happier place.\" All that said, Turpin clarified that he didn't want to overstate the discord. \"We have a wonderful culture; people come here and they stay. I joke that I've been here 17 years and I'm still regarded as a newcomer. But I think this has been a wake-up call that we can't take it for granted.\" Why do those issues matter to listeners and readers? They speak to NPR's ability to recruit and retain the best employees, and to reduce staff turnover. Stability, it seems to me, is one key to maintaining high journalistic standards.

After receiving assurances from Ryan, a key group of conservative House Republicans said they would support a short-term-funding bill.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., answers questions Thursday on the possibility of a government shutdown. After receiving assurances from Ryan, a key group of conservative House Republicans said they would support a short-term-funding bill. Updated at 8:46 p.m. ET The House passed a stopgap funding bill Thursday evening, though the measure now faces uncertainty in the Senate as Republican congressional leaders work to avert a government shutdown by late Friday night. Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate to proceed on the four-week continuing resolution, which would extend funding only until Feb. 16. That is looking more and more difficult after most Democrats and at least three Republican senators have said they won't vote for the bill. The measure passed in the House, 230-197, with 11 Republicans voting against the bill and six Democrats voting for it, after House Freedom Caucus members reached a deal to vote for the bill. The group's chairman, Mark Meadows, R-N.C., had initially said enough of his members would withhold support that the bill would fail with GOP votes only, but about an hour before the vote was expected to begin Meadows told reporters he had received enough concessions from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \u2014 including plans for future votes on additional military funding \u2014 that he would recommend his caucus vote for the bill. And Thursday evening, the group said on Twitter that a majority of its members had decided to support the stopgap measure. Democrats, however, wanted to include a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, set to expire in March, to protect the roughly 700,000 enrollees in the program who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. And House Democrats had indicated they wouldn't encourage their members to vote for the bill to bail out Republicans if the GOP had fallen short of the votes needed. After the House vote, Ryan and other GOP leaders put the onus on Senate Democrats and their leader, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to pass the bill. And the House speaker was already calling any interruption in the operations of the federal government the \"Schumer Shutdown,\" should the bill fail in the Senate. \"I ask the American people to understand this: The only people standing in the way of keeping the government open are Senate Democrats,\" Ryan said Thursday night. \"Whether there is a government shutdown or not is now entirely up to them. I also want people to understand that Senate Democrats do not oppose anything that is in this bill. They are just holding this critical funding hostage for a deal on a completely unrelated immigration issue.\" Some Senate Republicans have already said they won't support the bill. Republicans have only a 51-49 advantage, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., possibly unavailable owing to medical issues. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was one of the lawmakers pushing for a bipartisan immigration deal to go along with a funding bill, reiterated Thursday evening he would oppose any short-term measure. \"I am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days by voting for a continuing resolution,\" Graham said. \"It's time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up and act consistent with the values of a great nation.\" President Trump had injected fresh confusion into tense negotiations to avert an impending shutdown with a Thursday morning tweet that indicated he opposed the measure the White House had previously signaled support for. \"CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. The House funding bill includes a six-year renewal of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, which GOP leaders included as a potential sweetener to get the votes they need to pass the stopgap measure and force Democrats to vote against the program they are eager to reauthorize. CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension! Ryan downplayed the tweet to reporters Thursday morning. \"I am sure where he stands. He fully supports passing this legislation,\" Ryan countered, noting that he spoke to the president after the tweet was posted. Trump's tweet also contradicted the White House's already stated position in favor of the stopgap bill. In a statement Thursday, White House spokesman Raj Shah said the president supports the House bill. \"The President supports the continuing resolution introduced in the House. Congress needs to do its job and provide full funding of our troops and military with a two-year budget caps deal,\" Shah said. \"However, as the deal is negotiated, the President wants to ensure our military and national security are funded. He will not let it be held hostage by Democrats.\" The House bill that passed Thursday evening included funding to extend the CHIP program for six years. After the House passed the bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. posted on Twitter essentially suggesting that Senate Democrats choose between protecting DACA enrollees whose program runs until March and protecting millions of children insured by CHIP who could face funding shortfalls more immediately. McConnell had said Thursday morning that he anticipated the House would pass the funding bill, but its fate in the Senate is uncertain. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, had said he was \"not sure what the president means\" when asked on Fox & Friends about the CHIP tweet. The last-minute confusion over CHIP had further complicated spending negotiations that were stalled when Trump rejected a bipartisan Senate immigration plan intended to pave the way for a long-term-spending agreement. The president had also jabbed at Democrats in another tweet Thursday morning over the stalled negotiations to reach a deal on spending limits for this fiscal year. \"A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!\" he tweeted. Democrats are resisting a spending deal agreement until a bipartisan immigration deal is clinched. The immigration talks fell apart last week after Trump rejected a plan proposed by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to pair increased border security with new legal protections and a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 700,000 DACA participants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children. It was during that meeting that Trump questioned why the U.S. would want more immigrants from \"shithole countries\" in Africa. Trump also weighed in Thursday on Twitter on immigration, again demanding money for a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. \"We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!\" Trump tweeted. We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal! Democrats say they will not accept any spending bill that funds the construction of a physical border wall, but they have been willing to negotiate over money for increased technology and other forms of border security. Now, a second group of negotiators, led by the second-ranking Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate, has stepped in to attempt to craft a new deal, but the talks have been largely unsuccessful, according to several aides familiar with the talks. Durbin is one of those negotiators, but he has indicated he will vote against the stopgap funding measure in the Senate. A growing number of Senate Democrats see the vote on the funding bill as a leverage point to try to reach a deal on immigration, even if their opposition threatens a shutdown. Three centrist Democrats, Sen. Angus King of Maine (he is an independent but caucuses with Democrats) and Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, all announced Thursday morning they would oppose the funding measure. All three voted in favor of the previous stopgap measure in late December. \"Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues,\" Kaine and Warner said in a joint statement in which they said they would vote for a stopgap measure lasting just a few days to keep the government's lights on and negotiations continuing. Virginia is home to a large number of government employees who would be directly affected by a shutdown. \"The continuing resolution is just a gimmick,\" Kaine said Thursday evening on NPR's All Things Considered. \"It's a way of saying, 'Well, we can't decide so let's just drive by looking in the rearview mirror and do what we did yesterday.' \" The House needed to pass a bill Thursday to give the Senate time to do the same ahead of the midnight Friday deadline. One key Democratic divide in the Senate: a tactical split between the Democrats running for re-election this year in states that Trump carried and the Democrats being mentioned as possible 2020 contenders. 2020 hopefuls like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand all oppose voting for a funding bill, if it doesn't include permanent protections for DACA recipients. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has advocated for this, too. In December, seven of the 10 Democrats running in states that Trump won in 2016 voted in favor of the funding bill. Immigration activists have increased the pressure on Democrats to oppose any spending measure while DACA is still unresolved. United We Dream has labeled Democrats who voted for the last funding bill, in December, as the \"Deportation Caucus.\" When asked Thursday morning if he would be responsible if the government shuts down, Trump responded: \"Could happen. We'll see what happens. It's up to the Democrats.\" Editor's note: NPR has decided in this case to spell out the vulgar word that the president reportedly used because it meets our standard for use of offensive language: It is \"absolutely integral to the meaning and spirit of the story being told.\"",

Trump met with staff, members of his Cabinet and Republican members of Congress to discuss the Republican legislative agenda for 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Donald Trump speaks to the press after holding meetings at Camp David Saturday. Trump met with staff, members of his Cabinet and Republican members of Congress to discuss the Republican legislative agenda for 2018. Flanked by congressional Republican leadership and some members of his Cabinet at Camp David Saturday, President Trump vowed to be \"very involved\" in midterm elections later this year and said he had some \"incredible meetings\" with Republicans as the party charts its legislative course for 2018. In a wide-ranging press conference, Trump touched on his hopes for passing bipartisan legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration laws and national welfare programs, repeated claims his campaign did not collude with the Russians who attacked the 2016 presidential election and signaled a willingness to start a dialogue with North Korea, just a week after its leader announced there's a button to launch a nuclear attack sitting on his desk. On immigration, Trump said Republicans are going to have to work out an arrangement with Democrats on the Obama-area program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). \"I think it is something they'd like to see happen. It's certainly something I'd like to see happen,\" the president said. When pressed for specifics about what he wanted to see in an immigration bill, he suggested that items he wanted would have to be tied to a legislative fix for DACA, which protects roughly 700,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ticked off a list of what he called \"the basics\": \"We want the wall, the wall's going to happen or we're not going to have DACA. We want to get rid of chain migration, very important, and we want to get rid of the lottery system.\" The \"lottery system\" refers to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, that NPR reported in November lets around 50,000 immigrants into the U.S. each year. A man from Uzbekistan used that program to enter the country and he is accused using a truck to plow into a pedestrian and bicycle path in New York City killing eight people in October. \"Chain migration\" refers to an existing part of the national immigration system based on family connections that allows immigrants already settled in the United States to seek to have relatives move to the U.S. to join them. President Trump also called for more border security and more funding related to border security. And he reiterated a campaign promise that Mexico will pay for the border wall \"in some form,\" a day after reports from the Washington Post and the New York Times that his administration is seeking $18 billion in funding from Congress for the first phase of a wall and other improvements on the U.S.-Mexico border. On the topic of a welfare overhaul \u2014 something Trump said for Republicans was \"very dear to our heart\" \u2014 he said again he'd seek help from Democrats. \"We'll try and do something in a bipartisan way, otherwise we'll be holding it for a bit later. But we'll be looking to do that very much in a bipartisan way,\" he explained. That comment echoes recent comments by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Just before Congress left for the holidays late last year, McConnell suggested in an interview with NPR, that in order for 2018 to be a productive year, the GOP may have to move on from changes to things like changes to the federal welfare programs and repealing the Affordable Care Act, unless Democrats in the Senate were willing to work with Republicans on those issues. When it came to North Korea, the president spoke about the thawing of relations between North and South Korea. Next week, the two nations are set to revive talks for the first time in two years. \"I hope it works out. I very much want to see it work out between the two countries,\" Trump said. South Korea hosts the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang next month and Trump said he was \"100 percent\" behind North Korea sending athletes to the games. Trump was also asked if he was open to having a phone conversation with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Earlier this week, Trump got into a war of words on Twitter with the North Korean leader over who has the bigger nuclear button. \"Sure I always believe in talking,\" Trump said Saturday, adding later, \"absolutely I would do that, no problem with that at all.\" The president was pressed by a journalist about whether he would require any prerequisites from Kim before having a phone conversation. Trump pushed back and said: \"It's not what I said, at all.\" The president also said of Kim: \"He knows I'm not messing around. I'm not messing around, not even a little bit, not even 1 percent. He understands that. At the same time if we can come up with a very peaceful and a very good solution...if something can happen and something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing for all of humanity.\" On the FBI investigation looking into contacts between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign, the president was asked whether he had White House counsel Donald McGahn urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself in the Russia investigation, as reported by the New York Times. Trump scoffed at the question, saying, \"The story by the way in the Times was way off. Or at least off. But everything I've done is 100 percent proper. That's what I do is I do things proper.\" The president added: \"There's been no collusion between us and the Russians\" but said there was collusion between Hillary Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Russians, but didn't provide any proof of these assertions. Trump's claims about Clinton and the DNC come after recent reports that the FBI in Arkansas is investigating the Clinton Foundation after a steady drumbeat of claims by Trump and Republicans about the 2010 sale of a mining company to Russia. The president was joined at Saturday's press conference by Republican congressional leaders from both the House and the Senate, some members of his Cabinet and Vice President Pence. After touting many items on conservatives' wish list that have been checked off by the White House and the GOP-controlled Congress in Trump's first year in office, McConnell said Saturday that 2017 \"was an astonishing year. But it's time to look forward\" to 2018. \"We have big things to do for the American people,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Saturday. Ryan added: \"And what we want to work on in 2018 is making sure that everyone enjoys the economic growth that's to come.\"",

            "article_content": "Trump uses Houston rally to stoke fears about illegal immigration, and he plans to exit an arms control treaty with Russia. Turkey's president says he'll reveal what happened to Jamal Khashoggi.  NOEL KING, HOST: It is two weeks until congressional elections, and President Trump has been leaning into some suggestive rhetoric. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, they have a word - it sort of became old-fashioned - it's called a nationalist. And I say really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist. KING: That was the president speaking at a rally in Texas. Now, the word nationalist can mean different things, but as the president seemed to be suggesting, it is often taken to mean white nationalist. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And in supporting Senator Ted Cruz, the president worked to fire up core supporters by stoking fears of immigration. Border crossings remain well below historic highs, but recent dramatic TV images of a caravan of several thousand people fleeing Honduras gave the president an occasion to smear Democrats, who want legal status for people in the U.S. without permission. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: As we speak, the Democrat party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation. That's what's happening. KING: NPR's congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is in studio with us this morning. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, good morning. KING: All right, so midterms are two weeks away. How is this message, including that use of the word nationalist, likely to play with Republican voters? DETROW: Well, this has been President Trump's instinct all along - to play up immigration fears going into the midterm. At one point, he hinted that he wanted to see a government funding shutdown over that border wall in the fall. Congressional leaders on the Republican side have wanted to focus on that strong economy. But President Trump sees this type of immigration and crime, really fearmongering, as key to his presidential election. And he's never felt the need to do anything but rev up his core base. Of course, we should point out the key races that are probably going to decide control of the House aren't being played out in the Trump base part of the country. They're in the suburbs in high-income, high-education areas where this doesn't really play as well. KING: You've been out on the campaign trail in recent weeks. How often are you seeing illegal immigration come up, and how often does it come up in the kind of tone that the president was using in Texas? DETROW: Sure. Well, I was actually in some Western states last week covering a Senate race in Nevada and a key House race in Utah, and there are a lot of immigrants there and a lot of people sympathetic to immigrants. And President Trump's approach really isn't too popular, and in those places, Democrats are very happy to have this discussion, criticize his decision to try to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, criticize his policy of separating families who entered the country illegally. Jacky Rosen - Democrat running for Senate in Nevada - really talked about this a lot, saying that she would try to stop all those policies. KING: But does it motivate - does it motivate Democratic voters? DETROW: I think it does, but I think - go back to how President Trump views the world. KING: Yeah. DETROW: He views himself as occupying the White House. He sees that this was a key thing that he talked about in 2016 that worked, and in his mind, he's a very successful president. So he's going to try and keep doing that over and over again. INSKEEP: I think it's valuable whatever your views of immigration might be to get a couple of numbers on the table. The president has talked a lot about this caravan, an estimated 7,000 people, some of whom will head toward the United States based on past caravans. They'll seek legal entry. We're in a point in history where the number of legal, permanent residents admitted to the U.S. each year is over 1 million. The number of people stopped at the border, the southwestern border, each month is 35,000 to 40,000. This few thousand people is not actually a significant change - a significant flow of people. It's not overwhelming the country at all, although it is a dramatic human story. DETROW: And we should say that in the past, caravans like this, when they get to the border, they present themselves at ports of entry and apply for asylum. They're not storming the border like the president is suggesting. KING: NPR's Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks so much. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. President Trump says he plans to end a 30-year-old arms control treaty with Russia. This is a treaty that helped mark the end of the Cold War. INSKEEP: Yeah. He sent National Security Adviser John Bolton to Moscow, where he's scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin today. Trashing the treaty is a sign that world powers could be returning to an arms race mentality. KING: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel is with us in studio. He's been reporting on this new class of missiles that could help to define that race. They're known as hypersonic weapons. Good morning, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: What is a hypersonic weapon? BRUMFIEL: Well, the first thing to say is it is not covered by this arms control treaty or actually any treaty because it's still in the research and development phase. But essentially, this is a weapon that can go very, very fast - five times the speed of sound or more. And not only that, but it can fly like an airplane. So this is an incredibly fast, potentially very stealthy weapon that can sort of maneuver around defenses to strike its target. KING: So kind of a worrying weapon if weapons are something you worry about. BRUMFIEL: Weapons are always worrying. KING: Yeah. You've been to the Air Force's testing sites. How far along are countries in actually producing these kind of weapons? BRUMFIEL: Right. So I went to one of the Air Force's wind tunnels where they're doing some prototyping. And I actually can't tell you much because the morning I showed up, I got a text message. They told me we're doing classified testing today. We won't let you in. But they did let me talk to some of the people there, and what I can say is that they are definitely increasing the pace of testing, and they're not the only ones. The Chinese and Russians are also doing a lot of testing. China did a test back in August. Russia was talking about its tests earlier this year. So this is a weapon that appears to be on the fast track at least among the world powers. KING: I mean, that brings up a really interesting question, right? Is - are we seeing the beginning of a kind of new arms race, do you think? BRUMFIEL: Well, Mike Griffin, who's the head of the Pentagon's R&D sort of division, was talking about hypersonic weapons last month, and this is what he had to say about it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE GRIFFIN: We did the groundbreaking research. They've chosen to weaponize it. We need to respond. BRUMFIEL: And the they there is China and Russia. So basically, I mean, that does sound a bit like an arms race to me. We started it. They're keeping to do it, so we got to keep going. You know, I think that this is a case of everyone is investing heavily in a new weapons technology. And it's not the only case. Russia is developing a lot of new systems right now, some of which are pretty wild. INSKEEP: Can I just ask - what is the point of a hypersonic weapon, a missile that gets to its target even faster? Is it just that missile defenses, which don't always work anyway, would work even less with a superfast weapon? BRUMFIEL: Well, exactly. I mean, this is a good question. Arms control experts say there isn't much point of the U.S. developing one. We already have a lot of capabilities. China and Russia are definitely just perennially worried about missile defense. And so they see it as a way to get around U.S. missile defenses, especially in the future as our missile defenses grow more sophisticated. KING: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, thanks so much. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Saudi Arabia is still trying to get its story straight on what exactly happened to journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Meanwhile, Turkey has been slowly releasing details about his murder. INSKEEP: Slowly. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said today he will reveal what happened to the Saudi critic and journalist when he went to the Saudi consulate in Turkey to obtain marriage paperwork on October 2. This issue, as you may know, has become the center of a tense relationship between two regional powers, and Erdogan could see this as an opportunity to gain some leverage over the de facto Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. KING: NPR's Peter Kenyon is with us from Istanbul, where he's been following this story. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Noel. KING: All right. So why has President Erdogan taken such an interest in what happened to Jamal Khashoggi? KENYON: Well, basically, he doesn't have any choice. I mean, the world is focused on this killing in Istanbul. One newspaper columnist wrote last week or so Turkey's not the bad guy this time. As you noted, this has not been the greatest place for journalists. Other commentators have tried to make a distinction between jailing journalists and killing them. But anyway, there's been this steady drip of evidence from the Turkish investigation. And analysts say it's very much in Turkey's interest to be aggressive, thorough, go wherever the evidence leads. So far, it's pointing towards Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was a steady government critic. He had a column in The Washington Post. And the question still remains - was it a rogue operation as Riyadh claims, or did the Saudi leadership have a hand in ordering it? The Saudi foreign minister has basically repeated in Indonesia that they want to hold those responsible to account. The Turkish foreign minister today raised the possibility of an international investigation, possibly by the United Nations. KING: And meanwhile, Erdogan is saying we have more information, and we're prepared to release it. Do we know what Turkey's got? KENYON: They have been giving little bit out day by day. There is no one that I know who's seen it all who's talking publicly about it. The CIA director was dispatched to Ankara, presumably to see and hear what exactly Turkey does have. But basically the evidence we are seeing calls into doubt the Saudi's story that this was a brawl, it was an accident, rogue killers that has nothing to do with the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. We're seeing evidence of calls from the consulate to a key adviser to the crown prince and a report even that he ordered the killing. Plus, there's been footage of a Saudi consular official burning papers the day after Khashoggi's killing and also footage of an apparent body double, a man dressed in Khashoggi's clothes leaving the consulate on the day he went in. So that all speaks to premeditation and attempts to cover up. KING: Is Erdogan using this situation as an opportunity to kind of confront Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? KENYON: We're going to watch that closely. It's an important aspect of all this. Saudi Arabia and Turkey - longtime regional rivals, different foreign policy views. Now, the Saudis, along with the Israelis, have been seen as America's top allies in the Middle East. Turkey's an important ally, part of NATO. Now, with this widespread international criticism of Saudi Arabia, this could be an opportunity for Erdogan to raise Turkey's star a bit as a key Muslim power, vital Mideast player. It would, if that happened, be something of a jolt to U.S. foreign policy, though. I mean, Turkey could never replace Saudi Arabia as a U.S. partner in confronting Iran, for instance. So it's not clear this will fundamentally alter the regional power structure, but people will be watching it closely. KING: NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Peter, thanks so much. KENYON: Thanks, Noel. (SOUNDBITE OF ESMERINE'S \"A RIVER RUNS THROUGH THIS CITY\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Senate race between GOP incumbent Sen. Dean Heller and Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, is one to watch this November. Appealing to the Latino vote will be crucial to whoever wins.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And to Lulu in Nevada now because it is election year, and politics isn't contained to Capitol Hill. Right, Lulu? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Yeah. Here in Las Vegas, thousands came out to the convention center draped in American flags to see President Trump. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) USA, USA, USA. GARCIA-NAVARRO: His supporters, who were wearing red Make America Great Again hats, cheered as the president lobbed his usual jabs at the media and the Democrats. But then Trump made a direct appeal to this demographic. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hispanic. Any Hispanic here? I think so. (CHEERING) TRUMP: Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Trump has a reason to reach out to Latino voters. They make up about 28 percent of the population of this state - and growing. The vast majority of Latinos here do vote Democratic, but the Republicans will need some of those Latino votes if they're going to hang on to Nevada's crucial Senate seat currently held by Senator Dean Heller. TRUMP: Finally, I want you to please welcome the person that we're all here for tonight. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Now, Heller wasn't always a Trump guy. In the run-up to 2016, in fact, he was a vocal critic. But he's all in for Trump these days. He needs President Trump's star power to win in a tough race. He's the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won. Polls show him neck and neck with Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen - more about her later. At the rally, Heller had only fulsome praise for the president. DEAN HELLER: Thank you for putting Nevada back to work. (CHEERING) HELLER: Because of your administration, Nevada families have more money in their paychecks. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The problem for Heller is that Trump is controversial with Hispanics because of his pledge to repeal Obamacare and his hard line on immigration. Still, there are some who support him. In the crowd was Latina Lilia Heart, who likes Trump's immigration policies. LILIA HEART: He's cleaning house. And there's certain steps that he's taking that need to be taken for America to become what it needs to become. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The next day, we were able to sit down with Joel Garcia, Heller's Hispanic outreach director, about Heller's strategy with Latinos. JOEL GARCIA: The communities that we go into are faith-based communities, obviously with values, business communities. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Garcia is of Mexican descent and a small business owner himself. He told us Latinos are persuadable in his view. They respond to the economic message. And many don't realize they already embrace conservative values. GARCIA: When you actually have a conversation with them and start talking about issues, they come out of the woodwork. And they start saying, no, I'm pro-life. I'm for, you know, lower taxes. I'm for less government. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Heller, though, is being attacked by Democrats for his shifting policies on key issues. On health care, he's voted both for and against portions of Obamacare. With immigration, he has condemned Trump's family separation policies, but he's also supported a hard-line immigration bill championed by the president. I asked Garcia about the issue of family separation. GARCIA: Well, here it is. He was one of the first senators to come out against it. And that came out in June. When everything came out, he was one of the early Republican senators to come out. He also asked the Trump administration, please provide me regular updates on the progress of what's going on down there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, what about health care? Leaving aside the issue of immigration... GARCIA: I'm not going to go into health care because I just don't want to go into that. Policy-wise, I just don't want to go into that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He insisted health care never comes up with Latino voters, even though polling shows it's a top issue. Latinos have been a big beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion in this state. While Heller's team may not want to talk about healthcare policy, the Democrats here are running on that issue. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) Si se puede. Si se puede. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Across town at the Culinary Workers Union, there is a different sea of red - union workers wearing red T-shirts, stuffing envelopes and preparing to knock on doors. They've endorsed Heller's challenger, Democratic Congresswoman Jacky Rosen, who was there to cheer them on. JACKY ROSEN: And I can tell you, too, that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The Culinary Workers Union is the biggest in town, with 57,000 members from all over the hospitality industry, a majority of them Hispanic. They're here today on a vital mission for Democrats. In the last midterm election, there was a huge drop-off in Latino voting compared to 2012, a presidential election year, by about half. Pollsters describe it as going off a cliff, and that helped Republican candidates. Rosen cannot win if Latinos stay home this time, so she's trying to motivate them to vote. ROSEN: We're going to fight for DREAMers. We're going to fight for a fair immigration system. (CHEERING) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Rosen is a first-time Congresswoman, and she doesn't have a lot of statewide name recognition, but this is her home turf. Some of the most populous parts of the state are in her district here. And when she was younger, she waitressed during the summers in Las Vegas, something she frequently cites. ROSEN: I'm going to get a little choked up here for a minute because 40 years ago, I joined the Culinary Union. GARCIA-NAVARRO: After, the teams of canvassers prepare to head out. And we follow Fransisco Benitez and Telma Vasquez, two Hispanic union members. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) GARCIA-NAVARRO: On a quiet street in North Las Vegas, they consult a list of addresses of union members, and they start knocking on doors. The tactic here is one that has been proven to work - colleagues coming from a trusted organization, pitching in person on a candidate. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Fransisco Benitez tells me that first-generation Latinos especially are tough to motivate to vote. They don't see themselves as Democrats or Republicans, and they still have strong ties to their home countries. FRANSISCO BENITEZ: Most of them - they think like, OK. This is politics, but we are not involved too much in politics. But for example, in my case, I try to tell them, OK. This is important. This is for us. This is for - not only for yourself but for your children. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We end up at the house of Armando Saenz. He's a flirtatious and lively 78-year-old retiree. Benitez shows him pamphlets with Jacky Rosen's face on them, but Saenz is having none of it. ARMANDO SAENZ: (Speaking Spanish). BENITEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"They are tricksters and liars,\" he tells us, \"like all politicians.\" Benitez says, not all of them. Saenz responds, \"When the moment comes, they don't do anything for us.\" He says he doesn't vote for any particular party. But Saenz does acknowledge that he's angry at the current administration's immigration policies. SAENZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Benitez and Vasquez try to persuade him using their last-ditch pitch. TELMA VASQUEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"It's for the future of the children,\" Telma says to him. The interaction ends with Saenz promising to come out to vote for the union's choice. In such a tight race, whether or not Saenz and other Latinos like him actually show up at the polls could decide who controls the Senate in November. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Polls show a majority of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration's policy of separating parents from their children at the border. But opinion among Republicans is mixed.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: President Trump's hard-line immigration policy is injecting a highly volatile political issue into the middle of an election year. And that is making Republicans in Congress worry that it could endanger their majorities. The fear is that this will help motivate Democrats, who are already fired up over President Trump's policies. Here's NPR's Asma Khalid. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Polls this week show that as many as two-thirds of Americans oppose President Trump's immigration policy of separating children from their parents who come into the country illegally. But opinion among Republicans is more mixed. To find out why, I made some calls to check in with voters I've met before on the campaign trail. One of them is Robert Lee, a 37-year-old from Georgia. ROBERT LEE: It's being used as leverage essentially. KHALID: Lee called the policy an abysmal failure. He's the kind of Republican who wants a solution for DREAMers, the kind of Republican who does not support a big, physical border wall. LEE: Our government should not be in the position of using people's lives as leverage to get some other policy prescription put in place. KHALID: But then I called Connie Kessler, a 77-year-old Republican from Ohio. CONNIE KESSLER: I love children, and I love people. But for me, if I was president, I'd send them all the hell back. Sorry. KHALID: Kessler wanted me to know that she thinks the images of detained children on the news are being used to make Trump look bad. KESSLER: The Democrats want to blame it on Trump all the time. And I am so fed up with that crap. We're taking care of these children. TIM MALLOY: The president's people are loyal to him. They don't budge. KHALID: That's Tim Malloy. He's the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. MALLOY: It's not surprising that the majority of Republicans support this separation issue because the country is so polarized now that it could be any issue and we would see this. KHALID: While other Republicans want to emphasize tax cuts or the economy, Trump is eager to talk about immigration. Here he is at a rally in Nashville last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party. I think it's a great issue, not a bad issue. KHALID: But the danger with Trump's immigration zeal is that Republicans are dealing with a very different political map in 2018. Whit Ayres is a GOP pollster who's wary of fighting culture wars. WHIT AYRES: The Republican congressional seats that will determine control of the House in 2018 are largely located in suburban areas. Somehow, I don't think taking children from their mothers' arms and putting them in cages will go over particularly well with suburban moms. KHALID: But immigration is an issue that helped Republicans in 2016. Exit polls show that among voters who said the most important issue facing the country was immigration, they heavily favored Trump. Steve Schale, a Democratic operative in Florida, says anger motivated Trump voters but now with policies like family separation, anger is motivating Democrats. STEVE SCHALE: Things like immigration, whether it's taking on health care, whether it's the Muslim ban - you name it - it's that anger and frustration about the type of country Trump is trying to lead us into that is driving people to the polls. KHALID: And that, he says, means immigration could resonate with Democrats, even if they're not personally worried about loved ones getting deported. As long as the reality of kids being separated from their parents sticks in voters' minds, as one analyst told me, you can bet Democrats will drag this issue out in every commercial until November.

            "article_content": "Fake news, hate speech and foreign interference are the notable examples of what went wrong online during the 2016 campaign. Facebook, Google and Twitter want to avoid a repeat in the 2018 midterms. They're working on fixes, but the solutions won't be easy.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now it's time for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\") KELLY: Hate speech, terrorism, foreign interference in American democracy, fake news - we have spent many hours talking about what went wrong online during the 2016 presidential election. Well, tech companies are working hard to avoid a repeat as the 2018 midterm elections approach. They're fast upon us. And here to tell us what Facebook, Google and Twitter are doing is NPR tech correspondent Aarti Shahani. Hey, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: Let's talk first about Facebook. It took a long time for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to acknowledge that Facebook was a platform for fake news, fake ads during the 2016 election. What are they doing to get ready for this coming November? SHAHANI: Well, none of the tech giants claims to be ready, OK? They each have a version of, we're getting there but only for ads explicitly about candidates like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, not ads about issues like DACA or global warming. Facebook says it's creating a new documentation process where advertisers may be required to verify who they are and where they are. KELLY: And then I suppose there's the process of verifying that they're telling the truth, which is another layer of this. SHAHANI: That's right. You're getting it, exactly. KELLY: Yeah, well, let me move you to Google and YouTube, we should mention, as part of Google. What changes are they making? SHAHANI: So Google does not yet have a working definition of what counts as an election ad. They're working on that. And what each company is desperately trying to stave off is any kind of regulation. They don't want politicians putting rules on them like legacy media has. KELLY: What about, Aarti, the favored platform of our tweeter in chief? I'm talking of course about Twitter. Their latest, I was interested to read, is Twitter is reaching out to something like close to 700,000 people here in the U.S., letting them know if they maybe were shown political ads on their Twitter feed that may have had some kind of link to Russia. SHAHANI: Yeah. And you know, Twitter is much smaller than Google and Facebook. And a spokesperson at Twitter tells me their investigation into the 2016 election mishap is setting back their efforts to fix the broken advertising tools in time for the midterms. They're concerned about that. And now, you know, each company has a fundamental tension. By way of analogy, let's take a nightclub. The official policy would be no one under 21 allowed. But you don't want to check ID because you're afraid that'll slow down the line and you'll lose customers, so you try to figure some workaround, some other way to do it. Now, when I shared that (laughter) specific analogy with Twitter, got to say, the spokesperson laughed very hard and told me, these are exactly the questions we're asking. KELLY: One related thing to this - I wanted to follow up on my question about Facebook, which is, Facebook last week said it's going to start picking and choosing what news to show us, what news we're going to see. This is related to the quest to show us less fake news. SHAHANI: Yeah. And you know, CEO Mark Zuckerberg - he posted on his Facebook page that the company is going to start showing more news from sources that are high-quality, in his words, and push down stuff that purports to be news but may be lower-quality. This is the single biggest announcement the company has made directly in response to the fake news controversy. And you know, it is important to point out that many experts say that this is how a powerful tech giant censors speech on the Internet. Now, granted, Facebook is not zapping away articles. What they're doing in an attention economy - right? - it's about a competition for people's eyeballs here - is that the company censors by pushing things so far down a bottomless feed that eyeballs never get to see it. KELLY: Which of course prompts the question of how Facebook is going to decide what counts as high-quality news and what's low-quality news. SHAHANI: They're going to let the crowd decide. They're asking Facebook users to vote on it. KELLY: What's been the reaction from mainstream news media to that? SHAHANI: Well, veteran news leaders are, to put it mildly, horrified that Facebook would take an important decision like that and throw it to a popular vote. There's another kind of criticism among conservatives who are concerned that liberal Facebook will push down right-wing content. And meanwhile, Facebook has decided they're not offering interviews to talk about the rationale for their move. KELLY: NPR's Aarti Shahani - thank you, Aarti. SHAHANI: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg breaks his silence on the controversy surrounding allegations that Cambridge Analytica exploited users' data. And, Congress unveils a $1.3 trillion spending bill.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Mark Zuckerberg says he is sorry. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah, the Facebook CEO is making the media rounds after it was revealed that a tech firm took data from 50 million Facebook users and then used it to try to influence the 2016 election. In an interview with CNN, Zuckerberg made a fairly surprising remark. He signaled that he'd be open to Facebook being regulated in some kind of way. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\") MARK ZUCKERBERG: I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation, rather than, yes or no, should it be regulated? GREENE: OK, we have NPR's Aarti Shahani here. Aarti, you've covered this company. You've covered this CEO for a long time. What stood out to you? AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: You know, well, he said - he had a lot to say. And about the recent scandal, Zuckerberg says his company's going to audit thousands of apps - OK? - meaning a lot of the games, the dating apps, the news, the music streaming services you might use through Facebook. And, you know, to get those apps to build on Facebook years ago, to make Facebook the powerhouse it is today, they used to have to offer to share lots of user data. But, you know, that's how they ended up with this leaky, insecure system that spiraled out of control and, you know, tossed tens of millions of profiles into the hands of Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg has not yet explained why his company failed to be more careful early on. And as Facebook was ramping up its mobile advertising business - OK? - going from $0 to $13 billion in just five years, and out of nowhere, competing with Google, part of that strategy may have been to play fast and loose with user data. So, you know, that needs more scrutiny. GREENE: You say scrutiny. I mean, there're a lot of questions remaining, not just about what Zuckerberg is going to do in the future, but how we actually got here. And I just think about this research firm you mentioned, Cambridge Analytica, using this data to microtarget users. Isn't that really key to Facebook's whole business model? SHAHANI: Yeah. You know, this is a really important point. This scandal brought privacy issues to life, OK? It got people asking, do you really want every like, every post, every click, every new friend to be turned into a data point so that Facebook... GREENE: Maybe not. Maybe not. SHAHANI: Or maybe not. Right. I mean, do you want Facebook to sell you or access to you to whoever's buying? Listen for a moment to this former Facebook employee, Dipayan Ghosh. He's got a very skeptical take on what the company is doing. DIPAYAN GHOSH: The business model of this company is directly in contradiction to user privacy. We all know that. And it is always going to be a difficulty to try to move forward in this industry in a way that is sensitive to privacy and security risks. SHAHANI: You know, so say you don't want to tell Facebook your gender, your race, your marital status. You skip those parts of the profile, but they figure it out anyway from what you're doing, the stories you're clicking on, the groups you're joining. You end up revealing the inner workings of your mind and your biases, and the business is to exploit that. GREENE: And if the business is actually making users vulnerable and Zuckerberg is saying that he is committed to not making users as vulnerable, the question is, does he have to change the business model? Which, I guess, is one question that might come up if he is brought before Congress, which sounds like - is a possibility now. SHAHANI: Yeah, I mean, you're right. It could come down to fundamentals that have not been asked thus far of him directly in congressional testimony. He says he's happy to testify before Congress if it's the right thing to do. Those were his words. GREENE: That's a caveat, yeah. SHAHANI: Yeah, it's quite a caveat. And, you know, he could decide the right thing to do is to send his lawyers to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee instead. You know, so we have to see about that. Fact is, Zuckerberg is 33 years old. He's already built a company that is more powerful than most countries, and he's taking his legacy very seriously. GREENE: Yeah, quite a moment for Mark Zuckerberg. SHAHANI: It is. GREENE: All right, NPR's Aarti Shahani. Aarti, thanks a lot. SHAHANI: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF THE NATIONAL SONG, \"LEMONWORLD\") GREENE: All right, on Capitol Hill, party leaders have now agreed on a spending bill. MARTIN: Yup. And Congress has until just tomorrow night to pass this big spending bill - we should say, $1.3 trillion. If they don't, it will trigger yet another partial government shutdown. So what is in this bill? A whole lot because the thing is more than 2,000 pages long. GREENE: And you, Domenico Montanaro, have read the entire thing. Is that right? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Nope. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: Very nice confession. Domenico Montanaro from NPR's political team. OK, even if you haven't read it, is... MONTANARO: I have a pretty good idea. MARTIN: This is going to be a super-informed conversation. GREENE: Yeah. We do know it's a compromise, right? So, I mean, can you tell us at least what each side got here? MONTANARO: Yeah. So here's what both sides are saying when I get the cheat sheet and crib notes on this, OK? MARTIN: Nice. MONTANARO: There are a lot of things in this bill, and I'm going to run through a few of them on both sides, so bear with me a little bit. But for Republicans, let's start there. There's a big increase in military spending - $1.6 billion for border security that goes mostly to technology - so the White House not thrilled with that because they wanted some $25 billion for a wall. This doesn't go to that. GREENE: They want it to explicitly say wall, not just security on the border, which is a distinction. MONTANARO: Yeah, and it's just, they want more money. And right now, it's only 1.6 billion of the 25 that the White House wanted. There's also a fix to the Republican tax law that they had wanted. And then there's a whole bunch of stuff on the Democratic side in order to give some of those items to Republicans. There's lots of increases to domestic programs, funding for opioids, you know, rural broadband, student loans, child care. And they're also allowing the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence, something that hadn't been done in the past. And it also includes some funding to states for what they call the Fix NICS program on background checks to try to allow states to, you know - to try to fix the fact that some of the states have not been reporting to the background check database that they had been wanting. There's also a blocking of the tips policy - the new policy from the administration that would've allowed employers to pocket some of that restaurant money, some of those tips as long as they paid them minimum wage. So that's no longer included. And it also includes $2.8 billion, as I said, to battle opioid addiction. And there's this tunnel in New York and New Jersey that the president said he would veto, and instead of it being direct funding, it is going directly to Amtrak, which can then use the funding - so lots of stuff in here. GREENE: Well, so can President Trump live with this? Do we think he'll sign it if Congress passes it? MONTANARO: So he tweeted last night that he appears to be OK with it. He touted the fact that they got the border funding, and he swatted at Democrats for not including anything on DACA or immigration. So there's nothing in there for people on the left who wanted something on an immigration fix, but it does look like the president's OK with it. GREENE: So will the government shut down? Big question. MONTANARO: It doesn't look like the government's going to shut down. You know, they're hoping that conservatives will kind of get over the fact that they're upset with this new spending, that Rand Paul won't block it. But he may be the key here, and we'll be watching over the next 24 hours. GREENE: He might like this role, Rand Paul - like, relish being - having that influence over what happens. MONTANARO: Yeah, but I think he - that's true, but I think he really wants to see the government spend less money. GREENE: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, investigators in Austin, Texas, have new information about the man who terrorized that city for three weeks with these homemade bombs. MARTIN: Yeah, the man's name is Mark Conditt. And in the hours before his death, he recorded a 25-minute video confessing to these bombings. Austin police Chief Brian Manley says Conditt, though, did not reveal any motive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN MANLEY: ...Nor does he mention anything about hate. But instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point. GREENE: All right, let's bring in Nadia Hamdan. She's from member station KUT in Austin. Hi, Nadia. NADIA HAMDAN, BYLINE: Hi. GREENE: So the question of motive still seems to be a mystery. We're learning more about this man - I mean, that there is this confession that we have, but we still don't really know why he did this, right? HAMDAN: We really don't. And, you know, and I even asked Manley privately just to confirm that there was nothing within the video that gave them any indication as to why this young man did what he did. I mean, even in the presser, Manley says everybody always wants to understand the reason, and sometimes we can't assign a reason to irrational acts. So it's an unfortunate truth, I guess, that you can't sometimes always know why people do what they do. But Manley did say that within the video, the 23-year-old did go into the differences between the bombs. So he took the time to show, I guess, law enforcement how he differentiated the bombs even though law enforcement did say that there were similarities between them. I guess he wanted to show that there were slight differences, and he actually took the time in the video to go over that. So yes... GREENE: Wow. HAMDAN: We're - still have questions, I guess, so... GREENE: Confessing to every little detail, it sounds like, for whatever reason. It was such a quickly moving day yesterday - must have been crazy in the city. I mean, how did police actually track him down? HAMDAN: So, I mean, I think what we've been able to understand is that obviously, the explosion that happened at the FedEx kind of was a trip-up (ph), it seems like. And it was able to give a connection to another bomb that did not explode at another FedEx facility that was then able to let them go back to the FedEx office. And then this all kind of just spiraled into them being able to lead back to a vehicle, which then led them to the suspect. And it led to their Pflugerville home, which now they have - are still searching for different explosive devices that are within his home. And so now I guess we know who it is. We have the confession, and it's a bit disappointing. And obviously, we are all still very shaken by everything that has happened. But at least for now, it feels that it is over. GREENE: All right, Nadia Hamdan of member station KUT in Austin, a city that, as you just said, is feeling somewhat better but still shaken by all this this morning. Nadia, thanks a lot. HAMDAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF PIANO INTERRUPTED'S \"CAMERA OBSCURA\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Republican Party is using its control of Congress and the White House to pursue a hard line on immigration. It's a big shift in rhetoric and policy for a party long seen as pro-immigration.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Congress is trying again to make progress on immigration. Democrats stepped back from a government shutdown triggered by their demand to protect people brought illegally to the U.S. as children. In return, they received a promise to at least consider that issue in the Senate. Some Republicans also favor a deal for DACA recipients, but over a period of decades, the Republican Party has shifted on immigration. Here's NPR's Don Gonyea. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: For decades, it was constant, the way Republican presidents and other party leaders talked about immigration. Take Ronald Reagan, a hero then and now to GOP conservatives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: I think the time has come that the United States and our neighbors, particularly our neighbor to the south, should have a better understanding and a better relationship than we've ever had. GONYEA: That was from 1980 at a GOP candidate debate before Reagan was elected president, but it sounds almost like he's reacting to today's immigration debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REAGAN: Rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems? GONYEA: On the stage debating him that day, another 1980 GOP presidential hopeful, George H.W. Bush, arguing that children who are in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to attend U.S. public school. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE H.W. BUSH: I don't want to see a whole thing of 6 and 8-year-old kids being made, one, totally uneducated, and made to feel they're living with - outside the law. GONYEA: Now let's jump forward a couple of decades to the presidency of George W. Bush, who could be finishing his father's sentences in these comments at the White House in 2004. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE W. BUSH: Many undocumented workers have walked mile after mile through the heat of the day and the cold of the night. GONYEA: They risked their lives, Bush said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE W. BUSH: Workers who seek only to earn a living end up in the shadows of American life. GONYEA: Again, those were mainstream Republicans speaking, each elected president. But over the past decade, a very different discussion of immigration has taken hold within the GOP, eventually building to this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. GONYEA: It's Donald Trump, kicking off his presidential campaign two and a half years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting. GONYEA: And, of course, there was this staple of Trump campaign rallies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. GONYEA: Ari Fleischer was the press secretary for President George W. Bush. He's been watching this shift on immigration within the GOP closely. ARI FLEISCHER: Donald Trump talks about immigration in a way that's very different from how George Bush talked about it, how Mitt Romney talked about it, how John McCain talked about it. But it's also true that Donald Trump won the election. GONYEA: Key, Fleischer says, is how working-class voters look at the issue. FLEISCHER: Frankly, I think the biggest change was the economy weakened. People who were in America were worried about their jobs and their livelihood, and they did worry about a surge of people coming through illegally, a lower-priced labor force that would squeeze Americans. GONYEA: Economists say what drives wages goes way beyond immigration. Still, such worries gave the topic more potency than it previously had within the GOP. But Mark Krikorian, an advocate for less immigration at the D.C.-based think tank the Center for Immigration Studies, has a different theory. He says that establishment GOP leaders of an earlier era were simply out of touch with working people. MARK KRIKORIAN: Ordinary Republican voters were just much more hawkish on immigration than Republican politicians and advisers and fixers and donors and the whole political class. GONYEA: In 2013, conservatives blocked an immigration bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. Senate. Krikorian notes that years earlier GOP voters were strong enough to prevent passage of immigration legislation pushed by President George W. Bush, and he believes all of this helped set the stage for Donald Trump. KRIKORIAN: He took advantage of that gap between what the actual voters wanted and what the political class was offering. GONYEA: Now many Republicans in Congress feel they've closed that gap with the GOP base. And with Trump in the Oval Office, they expect to at last get an immigration policy that the base also likes.

            "article_content": "Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith, a Democrat, takes Democrat Al Franken's former seat, and Doug Jones will be the first Democrat sworn into an Alabama Senate seat in 25 years.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Senate convenes today for the first time in this new year. And two new members will be sworn in right off the bat. Minnesota lieutenant governor Tina Smith takes Al Franken's seat. And Doug Jones will be the first Democrat sworn into an Alabama Senate seat in 25 years. They join the Senate as Congress gets ready for midterm elections this fall. We're joined in the studio by NPR's Kelsey Snell. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: Two new Democratic senators. They're going to make the Republicans' margin in the Senate that much smaller, right? SNELL: Right. So now we are going from a 52-48 Republican majority to a 51-48 majority - or 51-49 - remembering that Tina Smith is filling the seat of another Democrat, Al Franken. MARTIN: Yeah. SNELL: The one person we're watching the most is going to be Doug Jones. When he was elected, there were a number of Republican officials who called on him to act like a Republican because he's representing a lot of Republicans in Alabama. We don't actually expect him to do that. But there will be a lot of talk about that once he gets started. Democrats are also hoping that his addition gives them the space to tell Republicans that they need to come to their side on things like spending and DACA, which is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration issue. And, you know, they are hoping - Democrats are hoping - there will be a lot more pressure for Republicans to wheel and deal this year than they saw last year. MARTIN: So where's the wheeling and dealing going to happen? I mean, when you think about the Senate more generally, what are the primary items on their agenda when they get back to work? SNELL: The big thing that we're watching first - this idea of spending caps. So the Republicans and Democrats started conversations almost as early as Thanksgiving about a way to increase spending levels for the rest of the fiscal year. That may sound like not that big of a deal, but Republicans have been resisting the idea of funding major spending programs on the domestic side, things that people rely on every day. And Democrats want to make sure that those are funded at the same level as military priorities. So the hope is that they will reach a deal sometime maybe this week or next week, so they can pass a new spending bill, since it's unfinished business left over from last year. MARTIN: Yeah. SNELL: (Laughter). MARTIN: So 2018 is also going to be the last year for the Senate's longest-serving member. Republican Orrin Hatch is set to retire. How's that going to change the Senate? SNELL: Yeah. Today is actually the 40th anniversary of the day that Hatch was sworn into office in 1977. MARTIN: Wow. SNELL: So it is a big departure. He has been a mainstay of a lot of, again, bipartisan negotiations. He helped write the Children's Health Insurance Program. He's done a lot of religious freedom work. And he was an architect of that big tax plan that passed at the end of the year. His departure really does make a big difference because it's an open seat. We're seeing that former governor and former vice presidential candidate Mitt Romney may be throwing his hat into the ring. He just changed his location on his Twitter page to say that he is in Utah... MARTIN: Yeah, I saw that. SNELL: ...Reminding people that he's in Utah. MARTIN: Changed from Massachusetts to Utah. SNELL: Yeah. MARTIN: So that's an indicator. SNELL: So reminding people he's available. But he also is one of many powerful Republican chairmen who retired, leaving open seats where Democrats hope they can make some challenges and pick up more seats, particularly in the House, where they are hoping for a wave election this year. MARTIN: Are we really talking about midterm elections in January? SNELL: I know. It's - what? - third day of the year. MARTIN: Yeah. SNELL: And we're already thinking about November. MARTIN: Yes. Do it. That's what we do. SNELL: There are a lot of people who have been thinking about this for some time. Democrats really do hope that this is a year they can turn over a lot of seats, particularly in the suburbs and areas in California. There are eight open seats - well, eight contested seats - in California that Democrats really think they could pick up. And we're also looking at places like New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where they're hoping that they could retake control of the House. MARTIN: NPR's Kelsey Snell. Thanks so much, Kelsey.

            "article_content": "President Trump threatens to pull out of NAFTA because Mexico is doing very little to stop migrants passing through to the U.S. And, China has retaliated \u2014 slapping tariffs on 128 U.S. products.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump started off his Sunday morning with a post about happy Easter. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: That's what he said at 7:27 a.m., according to his Twitter timeline. And then a little bit later - 8:56 a.m. - the tone abruptly changed. The president wrote that Border Patrol agents could not do their jobs because of, quote, \"liberal Democrat laws.\" He said there would be no deal to preserve DACA. That's the program giving some rights to people that - who were brought to the United States as children and don't have legal status. Then the president threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement to retaliate against Mexico for illegal immigration. And he warned of caravans headed toward the border. The presidential eruption came shortly after a Fox News report on Easter Sunday morning about a caravan of migrants. And when it was over, Fox News reported the story with the caption, Trump strengthens immigration stance. MARTIN: All right, a lot to unpack here - we've got NPR's correspondent in Mexico City, Carrie Kahn, with us on the line. Good morning, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's start with these caravans that President Trump referenced in his series of tweets. What are these? KAHN: Well, there is a large group of migrants from Central America traveling through Mexico en masse together. I spoke to one of the organizers of this caravan, as they're calling it, yesterday. And he puts the number at around 1,200 men, women and children, mainly from Honduras. They gathered at Mexico's southern border city Tapachula, Chiapas, and began walking, riding buses, trains and trucks together and are expected to arrive near to Mexico City this Thursday. MARTIN: So is this the first time this has happened, Carrie, that such a large group of migrants would be coming kind of in the spotlight, out of the shadows in this organized way? KAHN: No, it's not. And last May, I talked to a lot of Central Americans who were in a similar caravan like this here in Mexico City. And it was unclear then and it's unclear now how many of those people will actually head to the U.S. border. Many of them will ask for asylum here in Mexico and stay here without authorization in Mexico. And the group also told me that along the way, they're giving these migrants so-called workshops to tell them about the complexity and the difficulty of applying for asylum laws, and that most likely, they will be detained at the U.S. border if they tried to sneak in without authorization or if they ask a U.S. border guard for asylum. But just the numbers here of Central Americans in Mexico that have opted to stay in Mexico is rising greatly. And also, just one more point - that between February and March, these are historically high years - high months of the year when Central Americans begin a migration to the U.S., and apprehension numbers at the border show that. So Trump saying that they are here to take advantage of DACA don't really mesh out. MARTIN: It - not - it also just doesn't work that way - right? - the DACA program. KAHN: No. Exactly, right. The DACA program is not accepting any new applicants. MARTIN: Is there any truth to what the president is saying, though, in terms of whether or not Mexico should be doing more, could be doing more to stop illegal immigration from Central America? KAHN: Well, Mexico would say it's cooperating greatly with the U.S. on migration issues and doing all it can to stop illegal migration. There have been crackdowns by Mexican authorities here, but it's hard to keep those up. As in the U.S., detention facilities fill up here. Money is tight. And the situation in Central America has not changed, either. More migrants are coming now. And some would say in Honduras that conditions have gotten worse since they held a highly contentious presidential election last November. INSKEEP: We should be clear, this is a debate about fact and emotion. Carrie's reporting facts that people who might be heading toward the border anyway, wisely or not, are going in groups because they feel it's safer. The way that gets interpreted by the president and many of his supporters is masses and masses of people are coming to overwhelm you. That is the message that the president and others send. MARTIN: NPR's Carrie Kahn reporting for us this morning. Hey, Carrie, thanks so much. KAHN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, so we reported there President Trump talked about tearing up NAFTA if Mexico doesn't do more on immigration. He's using trade to try to pressure Mexico. He's actually doing the same thing with China. And now China is pushing back. INSKEEP: Yeah, you may recall the president announced tariffs on steel and aluminum last month. The administration soon refined that declaration to let some countries out of it, but certainly not China. And then the president made more moves against China. And last night, as promised, China struck back, imposing new tariffs on U.S. products. MARTIN: All right, we've got NPR's Rob Schmitz with us from Shanghai. Hey, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What exactly is being targeted with China's new tariffs? SCHMITZ: This is a long list. We've got 128 products from apples and berries to pork products, recycled aluminum, ethanol. And the tariffs that'll be slapped on them when they enter China will range from 15-25 percent. In a statement, China's Ministry of Commerce said, quote, \"we hope that the United States will rescind its measures that violate World Trade Organization rules as quickly as possible.\" And those measures that Beijing is talking about here are, of course, the tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on steel and aluminum imports from countries like China. MARTIN: What does this mean for trade between the U.S. and China? And what does it mean for consumers? SCHMITZ: Well, you know, the U.S. exports more than 115 billion dollars' worth of goods to China. So 3 billion over 120 categories of products is, in trade terms, sort of a drop in the bucket. MARTIN: Right. SCHMITZ: China seems to be purposely avoiding America's biggest exports to China, which would include soybeans, sorghum, commercial jets made by Boeing. They're not on this list. What is interesting here is that a lot of the products on this tariff list are produced in rural or working-class regions of the U.S., areas that voted for Trump in the 2016 election. It's clear that China's going after his base. What's also interesting is that when Beijing announced this list a couple weeks ago, it did so saying it would impose these tariffs if Beijing and Washington couldn't come to an agreement on Trump's threat of across-the-board tariffs on Chinese imports. So we weren't sure these Chinese tariffs would come. But suddenly, today, Beijing just went ahead and approved them. So this seems like a significant escalation in this trade standoff between the U.S. and China. MARTIN: You're saying, though, that China isn't putting all its cards on the table right now. There are still other things - right? - that they - other moves they could make. Do you expect that to happen? I mean, are we in a trade war? SCHMITZ: Not yet. We're still waiting. In many ways, we're waiting for the Trump administration to come up with a list of Chinese products that it wants to target with around 60 billion dollars' worth of tariffs. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer still has a week to deliver on that. Once that's done, there's supposed to be a monthlong comment period before the Trump administration finalizes and then implements the tariffs. So we've still got some time. MARTIN: So that's going to be even worse. I mean, if China has made this move without even knowing the extent of this specific tariffs, then we can expect another Chinese move. SCHMITZ: April could be a very tense month as the world's two largest economies sort of prepare to duke it out on this. So yeah, I think prepare for choppier waters in the weeks to come here. INSKEEP: The president still faces the same question as past presidents - how to fight Chinese trade practices without doing more harm than good to the United States. MARTIN: Yeah. NPR's Rob Schmitz for us this morning. Hey, Rob, thanks so much. SCHMITZ: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, now to the Gaza border and the fallout from the violence there. INSKEEP: In short, Israel's defense minister says there will be no fallout. Israel says there is no need to investigate the troops who opened fire on Palestinians last week. Protesters in Gaza marched to the fortified Israeli border. Israeli troops opened fire with live as well as rubber bullets, killing at least 15 people. Human rights groups are saying that Israel used excessive force, while Israel says its forces were simply defending themselves. MARTIN: All right, let's bring in NPR's Daniel Estrin, reporting in Gaza this morning. Hey, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So I understand that this was a pretty large demonstration, right? Do you have any sense of what exactly was motivating so many Palestinians in this moment to go to the Gaza border that day? ESTRIN: Well, there were big rallies organized along the border. Palestinians were demanding to return to lands that are today a part of Israel. And this was a big rally that Hamas, the militant group, encouraged people to go to. A number of people I spoke to said, you know, they wanted to get out of the crowded city. They wanted some fresh air. But then closer to the border fence, Israel said young Palestinians gathered, and that's where the violence was. We were at the border yesterday. We met an 18-year-old Palestinian, Hamada Zaza. His hand was bandaged from a rubber bullet wound, and he said he had shot fireworks towards soldiers. And I asked him why he went to protest. HAMADA ZAZA: (Speaking Arabic). ESTRIN: He said, \"I want to die.\" You know, he says, \"there's no work in Gaza.\" He's so bored, he counts the number of times he crosses the street. He blamed this on the rulers in Gaza, the Islamist militant group Hamas. He says he sees no point in living. And, you know, he felt he had little to lose, going to the border. MARTIN: So we hear Israel and the Palestinians describing what happened differently. So now the U.N. is saying that it wants - what? - just things to be cleared up? What does it want from an investigation? ESTRIN: Well, the U.N. chief and the EU's foreign policy chief are both calling for an investigation - an independent investigation. Human rights groups are accusing Israel of excessive use of force. And there are disputes, first of all, about the numbers of injured. Palestinian officials say more than 700 people were wounded by live gunfire. Israel says those numbers are much lower. There are also disputes about who was killed. Israel says 10 people who were killed were militants. But in one instance, I visited a family of someone who was killed - shot while running away from the border. And Israel says he was a Hamas militant. The family says he wasn't. MARTIN: So Israel is saying it's not going to comply with the U.N.'s request to do an investigation. Is that going to provoke more violence? ESTRIN: We'll have to see. The Palestinians are vowing to continue protesting at this border for the next six weeks, culminating in mid-May, when the U.S. is moving its embassy to Jerusalem. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Daniel Estrin. He is reporting for us this morning from Gaza. Hey, Daniel, thank you so much. ESTRIN: My pleasure.

            "article_content": "A new report says President Trump ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller but backed off when a White House lawyer threatened to quit. Also, Trump is speaking to world leaders in Davos.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We've got these reports out this morning saying President Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller from the Russia investigation. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Here is the story as written by The New York Times. You will recall the president fired the FBI director last May. In an interview, he then linked the firing to the Russia investigation, and that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to probe Russia's role in the 2016 election. Then by June, the president was ready to fire Robert Mueller, too. He ordered his White House counsel to get it done, but Don McGahn said it was a terrible idea and said he would resign first. MARTIN: Again, all that according to a report first in The New York Times, then The Washington Post. NPR's justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is in the studio with us this morning. Also, NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith is on the line. Good morning to you both. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Morning. MARTIN: All right, Ryan. Let's start with you. Tell us what we know. What did President Trump ask and why? LUCAS: First off, I have to say that NPR has not confirmed this report, but what The Times is saying is that as reports started to surface last summer that Mueller was looking at a potential obstruction of justice case, Trump began to argue internally that the special counsel had possible conflicts of interest. There were a number of things that that Trump was looking at. One would be Mueller's one-time membership at a Trump golf course in north Virginia - Northern Virginia. Reportedly, there was a dispute about fees, and Mueller left the club - also Mueller's connection to a law firm that was representing Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. And then the third kind of big piece here is that he was arguing that because Trump had interviewed Mueller to possibly replace James Comey... MARTIN: Right. LUCAS: ...That that presented a third possible conflict of interest. MARTIN: So just to review - he was saying that Robert Mueller couldn't do his job properly because there was a spat over golf club fees and that he once represented or worked for a firm that represented his son-in-law, which would have made him more disposed to being favorable to him, you would think. INSKEEP: And some of this we know. Some of this was said. The complaints were made publicly at the time. What The New York Times has added here is just that the president tried to act on his complaints. LUCAS: That's right. A lot of these arguments about possible conflict of interest are things that we have heard from the White House over time. MARTIN: And so at the center of all this is this question of obstruction of justice. You say this is when the president really started to wage this personal war against Robert Mueller because Mueller was seizing on how the president had fired James Comey. LUCAS: That's right. A lot of this does go back to the question of Comey's firing and our understanding of it in the public. And the timeline is important here. Remember, Comey was fired on May 9. Several days later, word leaked out that Trump had asked Comey to lay off Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. MARTIN: Right. LUCAS: Flynn was under FBI investigation. That helped prompt the appointment of Mueller. That was on May 17. Comey then testifies in early June before Congress, provides all these details under oath about interactions that he had with President Trump - the requests for loyalty, requests to have Comey go easy on Flynn. So by mid-June - mid-June - we're talking three weeks, a month after Mueller was put in the job - there were already questions publicly about possible obstruction of justice. MARTIN: All right. Tamara Keith's on the line, too. What is the White House saying about these reports this morning, Tamara? KEITH: So White House lawyer Ty Cobb has said that they are declining to comment out of respect for the office of special counsel and its process. However, President Trump has commented. He was walking into the World Economic Forum in Davos this morning, surrounded by a massive scrum of reporters and photographers. And he was asked about the New York Times report. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Why did you fire Robert Mueller? Why did you want to fire Robert Mueller? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fake news, folks. Fake news. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: What's your message today? TRUMP: Typical New York Times fake stories. KEITH: We should say... MARTIN: We've heard that from him before. KEITH: Yeah, we have heard that from him before. He has called a lot of things fake news that are, in fact, not fake. He then went on to say that the crowd at Davos was tremendous. Quote, \"It's a crowd like they've never had before at Davos.\" MARTIN: We've also heard that from him before at different events. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Biggest crowd in history. MARTIN: Biggest crowd ever. KEITH: Period. MARTIN: So, Tam... KEITH: Yes. MARTIN: ...President Trump has said that he is looking forward to talking to Mueller's team under oath. He said this just a couple days ago to reporters, right? I mean, this was - this is a shift that he, all of a sudden, is game to do this. How is this latest revelation going to play into that conversation, to that interview? KEITH: Well - and so there has - he has been shifting back and forth on this. He had previously said he would talk to investigators. Then he said, we'll see. We'll see. We don't know. And now he's saying, I'd love to do it. But it's up to my lawyers. And what we know is that his lawyers are in the process of negotiating with Mueller's team the terms of such a conversation. You know, the other interesting thing is that, yesterday, early in the day before all of this came out, Trump's legal team sent me this document that listed all the various ways that the campaign and the White House have been cooperating with the Mueller investigation, including turning over thousands of pages of documents that they point out are related to James Comey and Michael Flynn and also that more than 20 White House personnel, including eight people from the White House counsel's office, have sat - they say voluntarily - for interviews with Mueller's team. MARTIN: Plus, there's this new public line that the White House and President Trump - is just defending himself, that there's somehow a difference between obstructing the investigation and just standing up for himself under this pressure. KEITH: Right. President Trump in that meeting with reporters earlier this week says, I'm fighting back, fighting back. And now you say it's obstruction. MARTIN: Right. So, Ryan, what is this news that - according to The Times, that President Trump tried to get rid of Robert Mueller - how is that going to change the investigation, if at all? LUCAS: Well, it doesn't change Robert Mueller's investigation. This is stuff that Robert Mueller would already know. Mueller, as Tam said, has interviewed 20 people with ties to the White House. He's interviewed White House counsel Don McGahn, who is one of the chief players in this story. MARTIN: Right. LUCAS: He's interviewed former chief of staff Reince Priebus. He interviewed Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week. So Mueller's team is moving ahead methodically. MARTIN: Regardless. LUCAS: Right. INSKEEP: And one other thing to keep in mind from this story is it's an example, as reported by The New York Times, of a presidential staff trying to manage the boss. And in fairness, it's not the only White House staff ever to try to do this. But you have Don McGahn saying to the president, I'm not going to do what you want me to do. And later in the same story, as the president continues getting upset over time, The Times says the president's lawyers tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him that the investigation was close to ending. MARTIN: Real quick, Tam - president's going to give an address at Davos. What's he going to say? KEITH: So when he's in the United States, he's all about America First. When he's overseas, it's America First but not alone. And that's what this speech is going to be. MARTIN: NPR's Tamara Keith and NPR's Ryan Lucas for us this morning. Thanks, guys. KEITH: You're welcome. LUCAS: Thank you. MARTIN: All right. We're going to remember a moment in the standoff that led to a recent government shutdown. Many lawmakers, remember, wanted a deal on immigration. They still do. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he couldn't tell what legislation President Trump would actually support. INSKEEP: Now the White House has specified what it will accept. The proposal would offer legal status for people brought to the United States illegally as children. It would also offer a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million people who would qualify. The plan also demands lots and lots of money for a border wall. MARTIN: NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis is here. Hey, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What's the opening bid in this plan? DAVIS: There's four major components to what the White House is seeking. First is that path to citizenship that would include the 800,000 people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and everyone that would qualify for that program, which is how you get to that 1.8 million figure. MARTIN: Right - because to be a DACA recipient, you had to go through paperwork. DAVIS: Precisely. MARTIN: And there's lots of people who didn't. So this would encompass all of them. DAVIS: They want $25 billion upfront to build a border wall system. And they're seeking dramatic reductions to legal immigration, specifically policies that govern family-based immigration and a diversity visa program that allows slots for up to 50,000 people to come into the country every year. MARTIN: Do Democrats like this? DAVIS: Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez is a Democrat from Illinois. He put out a statement in regards to the wall in which he said, it would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America. MARTIN: OK. INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. DAVIS: Democrats don't like the wall. They've never liked the wall, but the wall is also something they've been willing to trade. The issue that's going to be the hardest piece of this puzzle to solve is the legal immigration point. MARTIN: Right. DAVIS: It's really the killer for Democrats. I also think it's very important to know that in the context of legal immigration, this is not a traditional Republican vs. Democrat argument. In the White House - in calling for dramatic reductions in legal immigration, also goes against a lot of Republican orthodoxy. Traditionally, the business community and other allies support legal immigration. Most mainstream economists say it's beneficial, if not necessary, to U.S. economic growth. MARTIN: We should also point out that not all Republicans are on board with this idea, too - the idea of essentially giving what they call amnesty to the so-called DREAMers. DAVIS: That's - in the Senate, there is a lot of support for what the president has outlined. The tougher hurdles always have been in the House. What the Republican leaders in Congress had been asking for is the White House to outline what they want because in order to get a vote, they really do need Republicans to believe that this is President Trump's immigration proposal... MARTIN: Right. DAVIS: ...To win over a lot of those reluctant Republicans. MARTIN: So what happens now. What dates do we look forward to here? DAVIS: The date that the administration is saying is March 5. That's when he's called for the end of the DACA program. So they'd like to have something to enact by then. MARTIN: All right. NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis laying out the White House's new immigration proposal. Thanks so much, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Facing a government shutdown deadline, senators passed a 2-year budget deal but there are hurdles. A day before the Winter Olympic's opening ceremony in South Korea, the North held a military parade.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stood on the House floor yesterday. It seemed like she had no plans to sit down ever. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Yeah, she ended up speaking for eight hours, which is the longest talk in more than a century on the floor of the House. Pelosi demanded a House vote on the fate of immigrants brought to the United States as children who do not have legal status. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: As members of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers, who are the pride of our nation and are American in every way but on paper. There's nothing partisan or political about protecting DREAMers. INSKEEP: Democrats and some Republicans say they do want legal status for people called DREAMers. As of March, President Trump takes away protection that President Obama granted under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The government-spending talks of recent weeks included a promise by Senate Republicans to at least debate that immigration issue. House Speaker Paul Ryan made no such promise, which is why Pelosi was speaking in protest. As a larger spending deal comes together, Pelosi says she'll vote no. GREENE: All right, lots to talk about here with NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro. And, Domenico, we do not have eight hours here. I just want you to know that ahead of time. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Oh, I'm aware. (LAUGHTER) INSKEEP: But he's going to be taking that time anyway. GREENE: But he's going to be taking that time anyway. INSKEEP: See if you can cut him off. GREENE: Well, what is the point of an eight-hour speech. What was Pelosi trying to accomplish here? MONTANARO: Well, first, what Pelosi did was historic. As Steve mentioned, she held the floor for eight hours. It was the longest House speech in history since at least 1909. The point of the speech was to protest that there is nothing in this Senate deal having to do with DACA. You know, some Democrats feel like they have leverage now, and they believe that they're giving away too much to Republicans. That will make it less likely to get a good deal for DREAMers. But there's a flip side to all this attention that Pelosi is getting. Republicans are perfectly happy to give her as much airtime as possible. They plan to bludgeon Democrats using Pelosi. And they've done it in the past. They'll do it again. They've been doing it in special elections. And there's reason for that. When you look at polling, she's less popular than President Trump. GREENE: Oh, so they would give her the floor as long as she wants in many ways - hoping to get more material. What - so there's this deal in the Senate. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer are celebrating this outbreak of bipartisanship. What exactly is in this spending deal if not immigration? MONTANARO: So it finally loosens military and domestic spending levels, increasing them for two years. Republicans got more money for the military than the president had asked for. Democrats got more money for domestic spending than Republicans would ordinarily support. Notably, it funds the government through September 19 - September 2019, David, so we wouldn't have to keep talking about them passing these short-term Band-Aid spending measures. GREENE: For a little while at least. MONTANARO: Well, yeah, I mean for, you know, a good year and a half. GREENE: Yeah. MONTANARO: And it also has funding in it to combat the opioid crisis, improve veterans' health care. It funds the Children's Health Insurance Program, for example, for a decade, which means that program goes from being in something of a financial crisis to being solvent for some time. And by the way, the debt ceiling would be risen through March of 2019, taking that issue off the table. That was set to be reached next month and always a point of contention among House conservatives. GREENE: Help me do the math here. I mean, you mentioned point of contention for House conservatives. You have some conservatives in the House who don't want to spend a ton of money. You have Democrats who are angry that immigration is not part of this deal. Are there the votes in the House to pass this budget agreement? MONTANARO: I mean, that's the big question - right? - because in addition to that debt ceiling, members of the House Freedom Caucus are not happy that it adds $400 billion in new spending. Remember. That tax bill was $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Mark Meadows, the chairman of that Freedom Caucus, said even if President Trump calls him, no way he can vote for this. That means if they block it, then they need Democrats. And Democrats are not necessarily sold on this. Pelosi is against it. So there's a lot that needs to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours to get this done. GREENE: Yeah, sounds like it. INSKEEP: Even if they do have leverage though, the problem Democrats face is they already tried a government shutdown once and very quickly decided it didn't work for them and decided they really didn't have the leverage this time. GREENE: Domenico, you were very succinct. We appreciate it. MONTANARO: You're welcome. GREENE: NPR political editor, Domenico Montanaro. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we've been talking a lot about the Olympics. But tomorrow, finally, the opening ceremony - the winter games officially begin in South Korea. INSKEEP: North Korea is sending a delegation that includes Kim Jong Un's younger sister. By the standards of the constant tension on the Korean Peninsula, that's considered a big symbolic gesture. But then there's North Korea's other symbolic gesture - troops marching on the streets of its capital. (SOUNDBITE OF PARADE) INSKEEP: You're hearing sounds of a giant Soviet-style military parade in Pyongyang. You could see the soldiers' breath in the cold and see North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un smiling. GREENE: All right, NPR's Elise Hu covers the Koreas for NPR. She joins us from Seoul. Hi, Elise. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Hi, there. GREENE: So how do we interpret the last couple of days and North Korea's message? I mean, they're playing nice at the Olympics, and then they go - I mean, it's this display of military power. What's happening? HU: Well, this happens to be an anniversary. This marks the day the Korean People's Army was founded. North Korea had been holding a parade to mark a similar anniversary that's a little bit forward in the calendar in recent years. But now the regime has moved it back to this February date. And conveniently, it gives North Korea a chance to show off its troops and tanks and missiles just as everyone's eyes are on the Korean Peninsula. GREENE: While the world is watching, yeah. HU: That's right. So even though North Korea is being diplomatic with these Olympic Games and sending this delegation, joining in in a lot of these unified activities, Kim Jong Un still wants to remind the world that he takes their military seriously - that they're going to defend themselves if threatened. GREENE: OK, so he's sending also his younger sister to the games in South Korea. I don't think I know anything about her. Who is she? HU: Kim Yo Jong - she's influential by virtue of having her brother's ear. She's immediate family - younger sister, about 30 years old, someone he trusts. Kim Jong Un has a surviving brother, but he isn't part of the Worker's Party hierarchy in the way that this younger sister is. She's part of his entourage. And she's officially the deputy head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department... GREENE: That's quite a name. HU: ...And in charge of her brother's logistical needs and organizing his presence at public events. GREENE: OK, so this delegation is going to be at this huge public event in South Korea - the Olympics. I mean, are they going to be making overtures to South Korean officials - or, I mean, to U.S. officials who are going to be there? HU: Well, North Korea's Foreign Ministry said it has no intention to meet the U.S. side during the visit to South Korea. And then there's U.S. Vice President Mike Pence who announced just yesterday more ratcheting up of sanctions aimed at further isolating North Korea, keeping up this pressure and isolation campaign by the Trump administration, because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. But at the same time, the Trump administration has also said that it isn't ruling out a meeting - saying that there are no plans but, quote, \"we'll see\" - or \"we'll see what comes about.\" That has come from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as well as the vice president. There are reasons to be skeptical about any sort of high-level contact. But North Koreans and American leaders at the high level are both going to be in the same place in the same stadium at the same time tomorrow, so it'll be really interesting to watch. GREENE: Yeah. HU: We'll see. GREENE: We'll see. INSKEEP: All of it clearly about managing a crisis still rather than resolving it. HU: That's right. GREENE: Indeed. NPR's Elise Hu in Seoul - Elise, thanks. HU: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, next month, Russia is holding a presidential election, and here is some stunning news, Steve. Vladimir Putin is going to win. INSKEEP: Wow, unbelievable. GREENE: Yeah. INSKEEP: OK, it's actually preordained. But you can learn a lot about a country from an election, even one where the results seems to be cooked, especially if you talk with politicians disqualified from running - among them Alexei Navalny, who describes Putin as scared going into this election. ALEXEI NAVALNY: (Through interpreter) He's afraid. He understands perfectly well that his 80 percent approval ratings exist in a vacuum - when there's only Putin and no other politicians, just some fake candidates. GREENE: OK, so this Putin critic Navalny was speaking to NPR Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim, who's on the line. Hi, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So just remind us, if you can, who Alexei Navalny is. KIM: Well, in some case, he's really come out of nowhere and put himself front and center on the political stage. And now he's so toxic for the Kremlin that Vladimir Putin won't even mention his name in public. I think that gives you an idea of how much he's really gotten under Putin's skin with his slogan that Russia's being run by crooks and thieves. Navalny is a lawyer. He is 41 years old - quite charismatic. And he started as an anti-corruption campaigner who became a protest leader. Right now, his brother is in jail. He's been attacked. And the office where we had the interview has been raided a couple of times. And now he faces arrest for organizing protests a couple of weeks ago. When we met yesterday, I asked him what drives him to keep attacking the Kremlin. NAVALNY: (Through interpreter) I want to live here, and I can't tolerate the injustice that for many people has become routine. Probably my profession as a lawyer led me to politics because you can't get justice here. GREENE: OK, so Navalny not likely to win an election. So what exactly does he want as he's getting his message out? What is he demanding here? KIM: His demands are pretty clear. He says he wants an independent judiciary, competitive elections, free media. And what's more - he says that a majority of Russians actually want the same thing even though the Kremlin, of course, would say that Russia is already a democracy. GREENE: So is - does he have an ultimate goal here in terms of this election - like, I mean, keeping Putin's numbers down or what? KIM: Well, I think - you know, I left with the impression that he still has the ambition to be Russia's president. But for the election, he wants to organize his network that he organized on Twitter to act as election observers and to uncover any irregularities. GREENE: OK, NPR's Lucian Kim speaking to us from Moscow - Lucian, thanks a lot. We appreciate it. KIM: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LITTLE PEOPLE'S \"ELECTRICKERY\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "We discuss the release of a Democratic memo, rebutting the House GOP version released a few weeks ago, plus gun control and the president's strategy.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: We begin this hour with more memos. The House intelligence committee has released yet another politically sensitive one. This version is from the Democrats, rejecting GOP claims that the FBI and DOJ abused their powers while spying on Trump campaign aide Carter Page. NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to talk about this latest entry in the dueling memos saga. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So the Democrats have said they expect this memo to put to rest the claims that there were abuses in the FISA process. Do you think it did that? LIASSON: It certainly tried to. It was a point-by-point rebuttal to what Democrats said were the Republicans' attempt to undermine the investigations into Russian meddling in the elections, the Mueller investigation, congressional investigations. It also was a defense of the FBI in face of the Republicans' really aggressive attacks on that institution. Now, whether it succeeded is unclear. This debate has become so partisan. It might not move any opinions. But it now is part of the record. And not surprisingly, Donald Trump tweeted about it, saying the democratic memo was a bust. And he went back to calling the investigations a witch hunt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we should say that the memo dropped right at the moment House chairman of the intelligence committee Devin Nunes was on stage speaking at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference. How did he react? LIASSON: Well, he said the memo was part of a Democratic cover-up and that the Democrats were, quote, \"colluding\" with parts of the government to enact this government - this cover-up. This is Donald Trump's MO. Whatever you're accused of, attack your opponent for the same thing - just like he continuously attacks Hillary Clinton and the Democrats for colluding with Russia. I've never quite understood what he means by that. But that was how Nunes reacted. And, of course, he was in a very friendly - before a very friendly audience at CPAC. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Before the memo dropped, it was the debate over gun control in this country that dominated the national conversation throughout the past week and into this weekend, we should add. Mara, does it seem like there will be some movement on that issue, which usually peaks quickly and peters out? LIASSON: That's not clear yet. I think there will be some movement, for instance, in Florida. But there's no doubt that the system failed in the case of the Parkland shooting on every level. There was a good guy with a gun at the school. And he didn't intervene. There were multiple cries for help to federal agencies, state agencies about the shooter. And nothing was done. The ball was dropped. So there will be an effort to fix some of those failings. But the majority of the conversation has been about guns. That's the big, contentious debate. You now have the governor of Florida willing to raise the age limit to buy a long gun to 21. That's the same as it would be for buying a handgun. He's talking about hardening schools, hardening mental health restrictions. And even when it comes to actual restrictions on owning guns, you've seen a little bit of movement. The president is also talking about an age limit. When it comes to a ban on certain types of semiautomatic weapons - these mass casualty weapons - that's the big question. Will that be even broached in Congress? - unclear. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. It is the big question. And is the president even willing to broach the subject? I mean, has he been leading on this? LIASSON: No, and certainly not on any kind of a ban on semiautomatic weapons, mass casualty weapons. The White House has made that clear. The president has pretty much stuck to things that the NRA is for - hardening schools, tweaking current background checks. He's not talking about a universal background check system, although he calls what he's talking about comprehensive. He's not talking about closing the gun show loophole or the loophole for private sales. His calls to arm teachers has dominated the conversation. And that's to me the most interesting takeaway. This is what the NRA is for. It's a pretty extreme position. He's now put it front and center into the debate, even though the White House says they're not planning to make any kind of a legislative proposal on this. It hasn't gone through a policy process. He's just talking about it. And that's the president's strategy. Number one, he never crosses his base. Usually, he sticks to things that the NRA is for. They're not for raising the age limit to 21. But we don't know where that'll go. And he likes to dominate the media narrative. And his proposal for arming teachers, even though it's not a serious policy idea yet, has dominated the discussion in the media. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. It seems like a strategy that works. And we've seen the strategy, I think, from the president before. LIASSON: Yes. We certainly have. In every debate, we've seen a feint to the center. Then he goes right back to the base. In the debate about immigration, he was talking about DACA recipients, telling Congress, if you make a compromise, I'll sign anything you send me. I'll take the heat for you. Then he retreated to a position that was even more extreme. It wasn't about shrinking illegal immigration. It was about drastically cutting legal immigration. So that's a strategy. Double down on the base. That seems to be the position where he's most comfortable. And you saw that when Trump appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend - gave a very anti-immigrant speech at other points in that conference. The idea of naturalization ceremonies was booed. So you can really see where Trump ends up in almost every debate on every issue. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Thank you so much.

            "article_content": "President Trump appears to be on course to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. And, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu visits the White House Monday \u2014 for the 5th time.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A lot of Republicans say they're just not willing to switch from promoting free trade to fighting trade wars, and that puts them at odds with a Republican president. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Indeed. President Trump appears to be on course to impose these new tariffs on steel and aluminum from other countries. His promise about tariffs sparked fears of a trade war and that other countries will retaliate by raising taxes on U.S. exports, which is how a trade war works. Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, told NBC News yesterday he denies that any of this is going to affect American consumers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILBUR ROSS: Retaliation isn't going to change the price of a can of beer. It isn't going to change the price of a car. It's just not going to. MARTIN: Not all Republicans agree. INSKEEP: So what does this mean for Republicans just as they would like to be uniting for this year's elections? NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell is in our studios. Good morning, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Thanks for coming by. How concerned are Republicans? SNELL: Trump really caught Congress off guard with all of this. Most of the Republicans I talked to, particularly in the Senate, said that this was kind of a ham-fisted and not very well-tailored approach to addressing the issues that Trump says he wants to address, which is that there are these cheap imports of steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. and making it difficult for the U.S. to sell its exports of aluminum and steel. So as Republicans have been responding, they say that they would have been happier with something that either had carve-outs for our trade partners, like the EU and Canada, or were more directed specifically at the countries they wanted to get to. INSKEEP: That's the complaint, isn't it? The president, in his rhetoric, complains about China, but it's Germany that's crying foul here, and other countries like that. SNELL: Yeah. And the EU has already said that they want to respond swiftly and are threatening tariffs on Harley Davidsons and bourbon. And that may sound random, but it is not. (LAUGHTER) SNELL: Harley Davidsons are made in the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin. And bourbon is a Kentucky specialty. And as we all know, it is the home state of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. INSKEEP: Hard to think of two more American products, either. The president sometimes does make announcements and then not really go through with things. Any chance that there won't be tariffs, after all? SNELL: Well, as far as we can tell, he will be following through. There was this weird exchange with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Sunday on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" where he wouldn't say that he was definitely going to guarantee that these tariffs would go through, but he said he had every reason to believe that the president would follow through. MARTIN: Although, I've got to say, why were they so surprised? I mean, Donald Trump has been erratic, I think we can say, on DACA. He has flipped on guns. But in terms of trade, this is something that this man has been pretty consistent on, at least since the '80s. SNELL: Sure. So the thing that they were surprised about is that he kind of went around the normal way of things. Which, again, shouldn't be surprising for this president. But he didn't go through the normal channels, and there really isn't an opportunity for Congress to soften the blow of this because it is more or less a unilateral decision by the White House. INSKEEP: Took even his advisers by surprise in many cases. So I hate to pretend that we know what's coming up this week - 'cause we certainly didn't know what was coming up last week - but, lawmakers are expected to vote on a major rewrite of financial industry rules. What's going on here? SNELL: Yeah. This one, we can pretty well assume that they will do this in the Senate. More than a dozen Democrats seem on board. It would be a huge swing from the height of the financial crisis when the Dodd-Frank regulations passed, but this is aimed at rolling back regulations just for smaller banks, banks that are sometimes known as the main stream banks - or, or main street banks. I'm sorry. INSKEEP: So not a total rewrite. SNELL: Not a total rewrite, just a scaling back for some of these smaller banks. INSKEEP: Kelsey, thanks, as always. SNELL: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Kelsey Snell. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House today. MARTIN: It is his fifth meeting with President Trump since he took office. The two leaders boast about their strong relationship, and they share something else in common. Both men are under investigation, Trump for his campaign's possible ties to Russia and Netanyahu for suspected corruption. So what is at stake politically for them as this meeting gets underway? INSKEEP: Well, the other high-profile visitor to Washington today is NPR's Daniel Estrin... MARTIN: Daniel. INSKEEP: ...Who is traveling with Netanyahu and joins us in the studios. Daniel, good morning. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Welcome. Good to see you. What makes this meeting meaningful? ESTRIN: Well, it's the first meeting since Trump said he is moving the embassy to Jerusalem in May, and Netanyahu says he's going to talk to Trump about him possibly coming to Jerusalem to inaugurate that embassy. But what is at the top of the agenda is Iran. You'll remember, last month there was this major confrontation between Israeli and Iranian forces in Syria, that hunk of metal that Netanyahu held up at the Munich Security Conference... INSKEEP: He said, this is part of a drone. Right? ESTRIN: An Iranian drone, right. And Netanyahu says this is evidence of a deepening Iranian involvement in Syria. He's worried about the manufacturing of precision-guided missiles in Syria that could hit any city in Israel. So all of this will be on the agenda today. The Iranian nuclear deal, as well. If you thought the peace process would be at the top of the agenda, think again. It looks like it's at the very bottom of the list. The White House has been saying for a long time that its peace proposal is coming soon, but there are some problems. The Palestinians are boycotting the administration, and Jared Kushner, the top peace man, has lost his top security clearance. INSKEEP: He's lost his security clearance. He has a few other things to worry about. He's been in the news for other things, including the Russia investigation, which raises this other point that Benjamin Netanyahu has been under investigation. What exactly are the charges against him? ESTRIN: That's right. In fact, just the day before Netanyahu left for Washington, police grilled him on a third corruption case. He's facing three different corruption cases about his ties to businessmen and different backroom deals. And his political future is really in question right now, and this was the main question that reporters in the back of the plane traveling with Netanyahu were talking about - what's going to happen? Are there going to be early elections? Now, Netanyahu has said he has done nothing wrong. His reaction to these police investigations shares a lot in common with Trump. He has questioned the motives of law enforcement. He has accused the media of a witch hunt. But I have to tell you, Steve, it was really incredible to see Netanyahu at the tarmac before boarding the plane to Washington. He he stood in front of reporters, he took a couple moments. And he just looked really radiant and confident. And he spoke about his close, personal relationship with Trump. And this is something that he's going to highlight on this trip. He he wants to look like a statesman, and he will look like like a statesman, almost like an equal to Trump. INSKEEP: Although that close personal relationship brings to mind a bit of a difficulty that Israelis have faced in recent years. Israel is a bipartisan issue for Americans. There are Democrats as well as Republicans who support Israel. But there's a partisan divide when it comes to Israel's recent course, and you can see that in the poor relations Netanyahu had with Obama and the better relations with Trump, can't you? ESTRIN: Israel's very worried about itself becoming a partisan issue in America. INSKEEP: Daniel, thanks for coming by. ESTRIN: Great to be here. INSKEEP: Enjoy your travels. That's NPR's Daniel Estrin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Last night was the Academy Awards, but maybe the first of the 90 Academy Awards to mark a new era in Hollywood. MARTIN: Right. This was the first Oscars show in years where nobody heaped praise on Harvey Weinstein, of course, the film producer who lost his company following a long string of sexual misconduct allegations, sexual abuse. And some of the biggest awards of the night also marked historical and political moments for the stars behind movies like \"Get Out.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GET OUT\") DANIEL KALUUYA: (As Chris) Do they know I'm black? ALLISON WILLIAMS: (As Rose) Should they? KALUUYA: (As Chris) You might want to - you know... WILLIAMS: (As Rose) Mom and Dad, my black boyfriend will be coming up this weekend. MARTIN: \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI\") MALAYA RIVERA DREW: (As Gabriella) So Mildred Hayes, why did you put up these billboards? FRANCES MCDORMAND: (As Mildred) My daughter, Angela, was murdered seven months ago. MARTIN: And the winner of the best picture, \"The Shape Of Water.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE SHAPE OF WATER\") MICHAEL SHANNON: (As Richard Strickland) You may think that thing looks human. Stands on two legs, right? But we're created in the Lord's image. You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you? INSKEEP: NPR's Andrew Limbong stayed up late to cover the awards so that you didn't have to. Hey there, Andrew. ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Hey. What's up? INSKEEP: So some of those winners clearly attack pretty topical, social messages. And the entire program was topical in a way, wasn't it, because of Me Too? LIMBONG: Yeah. It was. You know, like you said, it was the first after the scandal broke. And, you know, the show opened with Kimmel making these, like, very vague, you know, but, you know, funny jokes about the situation at large, about men and stuff like that, but no pointed barbs at Harvey himself. Yeah. It was fine. But then a few hours into it, three women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of rape and sexual misconduct, Annabella Sciorra, Ashley Judd and Salma Hayek, stood on stage and made a statement. And you can tell by their voices, it was, like, a very, like, important moment for them to be there. INSKEEP: Well, so that was one way that this was addressed, in that very direct way of putting victims of Harvey Weinstein, in effect, on stage. And, of course, we shouldn't just think of them as victims, but as accomplished actors. Absolutely. Absolutely. But this was not the only issue that Hollywood has been facing that gets to the question of diversity, the question of inclusiveness. LIMBONG: Yeah. No, there's a lot of talk, lots of shout-out about immigration, and diversity, and people of color being cast and stuff like that. You know, you heard from, like Lupita Nyong'o and Kumail Nanjiani about it. Common mentioned immigration when he did his rap. But it's funny 'cause Tiffany Haddish made that joke about backstage, there being, like, still lots of white dudes. And, you know, being backstage, she's not wrong. You know, there's a lot of people, a lot of, like, you know, white faces running the shows that are there. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Even though it looked more diverse onstage, it wasn't more diverse? LIMBONG: Yeah. Yeah, you know, you just, like, open your eyes and see. Jordan Peele actually made a joke backstage about how if \"Get Out 2\" was going to be made, it'd be in an awards show. INSKEEP: And what does that reveal about further changes for Hollywood? LIMBONG: Slow steps, maybe. You know? You know, we'll see how it goes from here, but they're taking measured moves towards it. INSKEEP: Measured moves. OK. Andrew, thanks very much. LIMBONG: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Andrew Limbong. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "We talk about what preceded the decision to shut down the government and what happens next.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Going to turn now to NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thanks very much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: You heard Democratic Senator Van Hollen. We had Republican Congressman Cole. What points do they make that stand up for you? ELVING: These are a couple of reasonable guys, and they are making reasonable arguments. And if they were speaking for the two parties, I very much doubt we'd have a shutdown this morning. But it's not clear how representative they are of their respective parties. What we're seeing instead is a couple of parties being pulled back from compromise by elements of their own coalitions, their hardcore backers, if you will. So both sides are rather at odds with the larger middle of the rest of the country, the political culture of America. And the real sticking point here isn't what's in the bill. It's what's not in the bill - the fix for DREAMers that the Democrats feel they've been promised over and over again that they've negotiated and they want to see done. And they only can see a vehicle for that in a must-pass bill like this spending bill. SIMON: Well, they thought they had a deal this week, didn't they? ELVING: Yes, indeed. And they went to the White House. And the president said he'd sign whatever the deal was. And then it appears that a couple of people in the White House - at least maybe more than a couple - policy adviser Stephen Miller, chief of staff John Kelly seemed to have talked to the president, and then the president changed his mind. It's a widely shared impression. And we don't know exactly what goes on inside the White House. But the senators who wanted a deal were really unhappy about the influence of those two individuals on where the president stood. And so now at this point, we really don't know where the president stands. SIMON: The Senate meets later today. Where do they stand? What kind of movement do you see there? ELVING: They are going to try to pass, as Senator Van Hollen just referred to, a very, very short-term stopgap spending measure - just a matter of a few days. That would supposedly force everyone to stay at the negotiating table over the weekend. The president did not go to Mar-a-Lago, and he is theoretically available. And even though there's no guarantee of a breakthrough, at least it would keep people talking. And if the Senate gets a short-term extension it's probable that the House would go along, although, on the other hand, we always have to see. Both chambers have to vote. SIMON: I have to tell you - on Twitter, a man named Johnny Lovato (ph) has suggested this be called shutdown hole (laughter), which raises the question, is this going to be known as a Schumer shutdown or a Trump shutdown? ELVING: Which phrase you hear on which cable news channel you watch will probably determine which you think it is. Or maybe that's going to determine which cable channel you watch. But the two parties would clearly prefer to have a deal, but they also fear any deal that offends the hardest core of their political base. So Republicans have been moving away from their previous positions. They've been moving away from things they said they would accept. The Democrats have also dug in their heels on this. It was surprising to see that there were a handful of bailouts on both sides. We should give credit to those senators who are willing to buck their own party - both Republicans and Democrats. And maybe on the basis of that and on the basis, I think, of the country's disgust with these very short-term stopgap spending measures that we've had one after another - this is the fourth since October - that combination may actually get people to the table and may actually get people to bend. SIMON: Is there a political cost for this, though? Because people keep winning elections. ELVING: That's right. And there are elections in November. And sometimes, it's hard to know how that particular ball is going to bounce. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent on the Washington desk, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Congress returns Tuesday with conflicts brewing inside the GOP on two major issues where Republicans are breaking with President Trump: immigration and trade.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm Rachel Martin in Singapore, where President Trump has been meeting with North Korea's Leader Kim Jong Un. But Republicans back in Washington are growing frustrated with some issues closer to home. Several moderate House Republicans are close to forcing a vote to break a stalemate on immigration. And several Senate Republicans want to confront President Trump on his trade policies. Those two issues could come to a head this week on Capitol Hill. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow joins us now to walk us through it. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there, Rachel. MARTIN: So this could be a big week for immigration, although I feel like I have said that before... DETROW: (Laughter). MARTIN: ...Over the course of the past few months. Is there a path forward right now for a GOP-approved immigration plan? DETROW: Well, you hit on it right there. We've talked about this over and over and over and over again since September when President Trump first began the process of expiring the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and the facts have remained the same. And that is that there is not a path forward in a Republican-controlled House and Senate for any sort of immigration deal. And that's because the popular idea of providing a path to citizenship, or at least permanent legal status for DACA protectees, is something that's very popular but there are not enough Republican votes alone to do that because of President Trump's hardline immigration positions, among other reasons. So you need some Democratic votes. But Democrats are not going to vote for any plan that goes as far as the White House is insisting on really making drastic changes to the legal immigration process. So that leaves us in the stalemate we've been in since September. MARTIN: But this is going to be politically difficult ahead of midterms for some Republicans who represent kind of purple-shaded districts, isn't it? DETROW: Absolutely. And that is why moderate House Republicans are pretty worried. And that's why they're taking this very unusual step of this House procedure called a discharge petition which would force a vote on the House floor against the will of House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House Republican leaders. That's a big deal. It hardly ever happens. And they've been gathering the signatures. They only need three more signatures, two more Republicans, to sign on to force this vote. Now, moderate Republicans have been holding off because they don't want to embarrass Ryan and other leaders, but they're saying, look, we need to do something about this, we're tired of talking about this and having it not go anywhere. And they're feeling the political pressure in their districts because any year like this, where Democrats feel like they can make big gains, it's the moderate Republicans who would be the most likely to lose those seats. And that's the hard thing because at the same time you have a party where a key part of its base doesn't want any sort of path forward and wants tougher immigration policies. MARTIN: Right. In seconds remaining, we have to talk about trade because this was a huge flashpoint with G7 allies, although that relationship is a little fraught right now between the U.S., Canada and France, in particular. Is this going to be tough for free-trading Republicans? DETROW: It is. They are not happy right now, but it looks like there is not going to be that big showdown vote that was hinted at on the Senate floor. Tennessee Republican Bob Corker is pushing for a bill allowing Congress to block President Trump from imposing tariffs on allies on national security grounds like he's doing. Several Republicans support that idea. This is one of the areas where there has been Republican pushback, but the fact is Republican leaders do not want a vote going against the president this close to an election. So they're going to talk about that in a meeting today. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Scott Detrow. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with NPR's Mara Liasson about the government shutdown and the anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: This hour, we've been tackling two important stories - the federal government shutdown and the anniversary of President Trump's first year in office. So this is where we wanted to take a step back and look at what it all means. We'll start with NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much for joining us once again. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. MARTIN: So what have we heard so far from President Trump since the shutdown started? LIASSON: What we've heard from President Trump is a pretty simple message - and he said it over and over again on Twitter - Democrats are holding the military hostage over their desire for unchecked illegal immigration. And that's a message that I think his base will find very appealing, whether it helps him with anyone beyond his base is not clear. MARTIN: And what about the Democrats and what about that argument? I mean, the polls show - and there's been some recent polling on this - it shows that the whole idea of protecting DACA recipients is politically popular but not when you've posed it as a tradeoff between... LIASSON: Right. MARTIN: ...You know, keeping the government open and helping them. So what about on the Democratic side? LIASSON: The problem for both sides is that neither is convinced that the other guy will pay politically. For Democrats, they know, as you said, that something like 90 percent of Americans are sympathetic with their position on the DREAMers but not shutting down the government over the DREAMers. And when people are polled about who would you blame. It turns out that majorities, overall, would blame Republicans for a shutdown. After all, they control all branches of government. But in those big five states, the red states where Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re-election - and that's what Democrats are most worried about in those states - Missouri, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana, South Dakota - that's where Democrats would be blamed if it looks like they're doing this because of the DREAMers. And in terms of whether the president would be blamed, we do know that the hashtag @Trumpshutdown, not @Schumershutdown, but @Trumpshutdown was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday night. So a lot of people voted for him thinking he was a businessman who would come to Washington, make deals, which is what he promised, make the government work. And now here we are on the first anniversary of his inauguration with a shutdown. MARTIN: Just building on that point, though, you know, in the past, the polls have suggested that Republicans were blamed for the shutdown but then they went on to midterm elections and actually did fine - in fact, did very, very well, according to the historical pattern that says, you know, the party in the White House tends to suffer in midterms, right? So any sense of what's going to happen this year? LIASSON: Well, this is the first shutdown that we've ever had under one-party control of government. The last shutdown in 2013, of course, there was a Democrat in the White House, Republicans in Congress. And what you're talking about is absolutely true. What happened was Republicans initially were blamed for the shutdown. The approval ratings for the Republican Party dropped faster and deeper than they had ever dropped before during that shutdown. But then what people forget about is that then the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. And it totally wiped that story of the shutdown off the front pages. And that's what could happen now if we have a very short shutdown. If something happens to wipe this story in our kind of ADD news environment, we might be talking about something completely different a week from now. MARTIN: Mara, just one more minute on this, if I could, before we head into the Barbershop because I'm going to ask them to reflect on this question. You know, here we are on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. What more do we know about him now than we did a year ago? LIASSON: Wow. Well, I think what we've - what I wondered about when he was inaugurated was, would he be different in degree or kind? Was he just a ruder, cruder kind of conservative Republican or something completely different? I think in terms of domestic policy, he's become a pretty standard conservative Republican - tax cuts, Neil Gorsuch, deregulation. But I think for - on the other hand, his divisive behavior and his continuing attacks on democratic institutions like the independent judiciary, free press, the FBI - I think that shows us that he conceives of the presidency in a completely different way than any of his predecessors. He doesn't see himself as the moral leader of the country or with the responsibility to unify the country. He has a totally different concept of the presidency. MARTIN: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It highlighted the limits of her power, though she remains a potent force for Republicans to rally against.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Democrats provided the votes this morning to pass a major two-year budget deal that capped a high-stakes week for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. She set a record by giving an eight-hour speech on the House floor, protesting that the bill did not include an immigration deal. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, Pelosi did that while coming under more pressure from all sides. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Nancy Pelosi found herself in an interesting position earlier this morning. She liked a lot of things in the budget deal the House was about to vote on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: This is a success for us to get, as I said, the opioid crisis, boosts in the NIH, pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more affordable and investing in child care for our working families. This was... DETROW: And yet she had spent most of the past two days trying to get other House Democrats to vote no. The reason - Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had vowed to use government funding measures as leverage to try and force a resolution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But House Speaker Paul Ryan still wouldn't promise to hold House debate on any measure President Trump had not already OK'd. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PELOSI: Sometimes I think the speaker thinks he's speaker of the White House, not the speaker of the House of Representatives. And that - we should have the opportunity... (BOOING) PELOSI: ...We should have the opportunity - we should - oh, touched a nerve there, I hear. DETROW: So even though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had negotiated the budget deal, Pelosi tried to tank it. House Democrats spent more than an hour behind closed doors Thursday as Pelosi made her case. As he left, California Democrat Brad Sherman explained what was happening inside. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAD SHERMAN: Number one, she's not in favor of the bill. Number two, she's very persuasive. DETROW: But in the end, more than 70 House Democrats voted for the budget. That big of a split raises questions about Pelosi's clout with Democrats even though most members of her caucus still won't criticize her publicly. And it comes at a time when the longtime leader finds herself once again the focus of Republicans and not in a good way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VAL DIGIORGIO: How many of you saw that State of the Union speech? Was that something else? (CHEERING) DETROW: That's Val DiGiorgio, the chair of the Pennsylvania Republican Party. At a recent campaign rally in the western Pennsylvania district holding a special House election, he was one of several Republican speakers to paint Pelosi as a liberal boogeyman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DIGIORGIO: Now, let me paint a picture for you. A year from now at the next State of the Union, Nancy Pelosi is not seated on the floor. She's up there on the podium behind the president of the United States. She's looking down. DETROW: Pelosi is playing a leading role in most of the ads Republicans are running in the race against the Democratic candidate. That was the case during last year's special elections, too, and it will likely be the case this fall. As Pelosi spoke about DACA on the House floor for a record-setting eight hours this week, the Republican's congressional campaign arm tweeted, dear Nancy Pelosi, every minute you're in front of the cameras you make our job easier. Pelosi doesn't appear bothered by attacks from her opponents or the murmurs within her own caucus. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PELOSI: So you want me to sing my praises? Is that what you're saying? Why should I? Well, I'm a master legislator. DETROW: That was Pelosi's self-defense in June when some Democrats raised questions about her leadership after the party's candidate lost a close, expensive contest in suburban Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PELOSI: I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country. And that is why I am able to attract the support that I do. DETROW: That's all being tested right now. As the leader of the minority party, Pelosi is trying to get as much as she can without much leverage. But she also has to show the Democratic base she won't compromise on key issues like immigration. Scott Detrow, NPR news.

            "article_content": "Organizers of the women's marches planned for this weekend, including a big expected one in Las Vegas on Sunday, discuss what's changed since last year and their hopes for this year.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It was the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history. A year ago this Sunday, liberal women flocked to Washington, D.C., by the hundreds of thousands to express outrage the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration. Similar protests happened throughout the country, throughout the world. This weekend, people will take to the streets again. But unlike last year, the marquee event is a rally in Las Vegas. NPR's Leila Fadel sent this report. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Why Las Vegas you ask? It's a far cry from the Capitol where over a million marchers came together last year. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) My body, my choice. FADEL: And that's why national organizers like Bob Bland, a founder of the original march, chose it for the anniversary. BOB BLAND: It was more important for us to create an event somewhere strategic that reflected the work that needed to be done in 2018. And Nevada is an example of a battleground state that went for Hillary Clinton and went blue for the first time in 2016. FADEL: That year, Nevada also elected the first Latina senator. And with midterm elections coming up, Bland says she and her three co-founders want to highlight that work and go to a battleground state where women are running for local, state and national offices. They're going to register and mobilize voters, and after this Sunday, they'll head to 10 other swing states for rallies around the country. BLAND: We are the leaders we've been waiting for. There's no better time than now. FADEL: Organizers say they're using the anniversary to harness the momentum of the past year into voter power. They call themselves the resistance, the resistance to this administration, and so many conservative women say they don't feel welcome at these marches and rallies. One of the big criticisms was the march in D.C. was mostly white, liberal women. This year, organizers say they are reaching out to local partners after a year of grassroots work to try to access a cross section of America, from minorities to the disenfranchised to women in low-income communities. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm going to put equality on there. FADEL: At the Las Vegas Indian Center, Indigenous women are making signs for the rally. I see the words rise, equality, protect our lands, written in colorful marker and adorned with illustrations. Many here didn't march last year. MERCEDES KRAUS: This is my oldest daughter. FADEL: That's Mercedes Kraus, a local organizer in the Indigenous community, and she's helping mobilize people for the rally and to vote. But she's also determined to vocalize issues that concern Native American women. KRAUS: All of us are going to be wearing red in solidarity with our missing and murdered Indigenous women. FADEL: She refers to the disproportionate violence against Indigenous women that often goes unnoticed. According to the Center for Disease Control, murder rates are highest among non-Hispanic black women and Indigenous women. Krause says she wants to highlight her community on the national stage. KRAUS: And I've been going nationwide to conferences and meeting spaces where we're talking about diversity. But even in those spaces, most of the time if I don't speak up and mention our community, they're not among those recognized. FADEL: Across town, I meet Bethany Khan at the Culinary Union. The union is a strong force in this town. It represents some 57,000 hospitality workers, and more than half of its members are Latino. This year, they're a partner in organizing the rally, chosen because of their strong track record of community organizing. BETHANY KHAN: We're fighting to protect DREAMers. We're fighting to protect workers who have Temporary Protected Status. And I think Nevada is a really good example for how everyday organizing in the communities that we care about and live in make a difference. FADEL: Since the Women's March in 2017, EMILY's List, an organization that trains progressive women to run for office, says more than 26,000 have signed up to run. Leila Fadel, NPR News, Las Vegas.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This weekend marks the first anniversary of the Women's March. Last year's demonstrations drew enormous crowds to the nation's capitol and other cities around the world. Today one of the places that protesters are gathering is New York City. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang joins us now from just outside Central Park. Good morning, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: What are you seeing? WANG: Well, I'm here right by the site where the rally is going to start in a few hours. There's tents up. They were checking the sound system a little bit earlier. And I'm seeing lots of marchers starting to gather and lots of those pink hats that we saw last year - those pussyhats. Women are wearing them as they gather to get ready to march later today. SIMON: Yeah. You've been speaking with some of the marchers, haven't you? WANG: I have been. And a lot of folks that I've talked to today came out last year. They said they for sure wanted to come out again and - essentially to say, no, we do not support what's happening right now with the Trump administration. We're concerned about encroachment on women's rights. One woman I spoke to, Bridie Bugeja, she's a psychotherapist from Northport, N.Y., on Long Island. She told me she's very concerned about what's going to happen to DACA, the immigration program for young immigrants who were brought here as children and are staying, currently, in the U.S. illegally - what's going to happen to them. And she's also concerned about all the new attention on sexual harassment because of the #MeToo movement, a new focus on that. She brought a sign with her, and here's what she told me. BRIDIE BUGEJA: I wanted to do something Seussical, as I love Dr. Seuss. I'd read it to my children when they were little. So I wrote, I don't like you in my shirt. I don't like you up my skirt. I don't like you near my rump. Replace Republicans and Donald Trump. SIMON: Well, an homage to Dr. Seuss. What do the the march organizers - what kind of objective do they have today? WANG: Well, the march organizers have told me that one of their main focuses is taking all this energy of people coming out, showing up to these marches and really channeling them to the polls this November. They're focusing on the midterm elections coming up, and they want to make sure that for the congressional races, for local races, that women and other marchers really think about getting registered to vote, encouraging other people to register to vote and to really channel their energy into ballots. And they're hoping - well, they're sending out volunteers today - in addition to marching - here in New York City to register voters. And they're also encouraging women to think about running for public office. SIMON: And there are other events planned for this weekend - aren't there? - around the march. WANG: That's right. Officially, the actual anniversary is tomorrow, January 21. And the main event is in Las Vegas. And our colleague Leila Fadel will be out there covering that. But there are marches here in New York City today. There's a march in Washington, D.C., as well as other cities and towns around the country. And so we'll be seeing and hearing a lot about the Women's March this weekend. SIMON: NPR's Hansi Lo Wang, thanks so much for being with us, my friend. Thanks for doing... WANG: You're welcome. SIMON: ...The job. WANG: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Trump campaigned in Tennessee, where a critical Senate race is taking shape to fill the seat of a GOP senator. The administration says it will impose a tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump tried to fire up his political base at a rally in Nashville last night. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And he was there to do, really, two things - drum up support for Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for Senate, and also work towards keeping Congress under Republican control. Most Republicans are running on the state of the economy and the tax cuts they passed last year. But last night, the president struck a different but familiar message on immigration. INSKEEP: NPR's Ayesha Rascoe covers the White House and was at the rally in Nashville. Good morning, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Hope you got a little bit of sleep. What was it like to be there last night? RASCOE: It was very loud. The crowd was very into everything that President Trump had to say. So it was an interesting rally. INSKEEP: And he was talking about immigration and in a particular way that he does. Right? RASCOE: Yeah. So President Trump was very focused on MS-13 and really trying to make this issue of illegal immigration a safety issue. He basically said Democrats are too soft on gang members and care more about criminals than citizens. Democrats, of course, have argued that some of Trump's policies are cruel when it comes to immigration. But it's interesting because congressional Republican leaders have been trying to avoid this fight on immigration, particularly DACA. They don't want this to be the issue dominating the campaign. INSKEEP: Yeah because they are, to an extent, divided - aren't they? You have some Republican lawmakers who want to vote on DACA, who feel people in their district want to vote on DACA, the program that would give legal status to people who don't have it at the moment, some people anyway. Now, the president was there because there's a Senate race in Tennessee. Marsha Blackburn is the Republican candidate. What did he have to say about her? RASCOE: He really talked up Blackburn. And that's notable because a lot of times at these rallies, they can really end up being all about President Trump and maybe some controversial statement that he makes. But this time, he really kind of stuck to the script. And Blackburn did speak to the crowd, and she said that President Trump needs Republicans who will back him. Here's a little bit more of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) MARSHA BLACKBURN: Tennessee needs a senator who is going to support President Donald Trump. And I... (CHEERING) BLACKBURN: I am going to be there to stand with President Donald Trump and take your Tennessee values to Washington, D.C., to fight with him to get the job done. Thank you all so much. (CHEERING) RASCOE: And that may have been a subtle dig at Senator Bob Corker, who was also at the rally. The crowd even booed Corker when he was introduced by Trump because Corker has been critical of President Trump at times. INSKEEP: Yeah. And of course, Corker is the one who is retiring, leaving the Senate seat open. I want to ask about something else, Ayesha. The very evening of this rally, The New York Times reported something new about the investigation of possible obstruction of justice, of the Mueller investigation of Russian interference in the election. The Times reports that, at one point, President Trump berated Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, for recusing himself from the investigation, said that he should reverse that decision because he wanted a loyalist overseeing the investigation. That was the report. Did the president mention the Russia investigation at all in this rally last night? RASCOE: He did mention the investigation. And he once again turned the topic to the issue of the investigators at the FBI and the Justice Department, saying that it was horrible that he felt that his campaign had been infiltrated going back to that, quote, unquote, \"Spygate.\" And so he did bring that up at the rally and tried to get the crowd kind of worked up about it. INSKEEP: A discussion of an informant that the FBI used when trying to track Russian interference in the election. Ayesha, thanks very much. RASCOE: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Oh, my gosh - was this only last week? Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared that the administration was putting its trade war with China on hold. GREENE: That was only last week. But then we have yesterday and the White House saying that it is developing new limits on Chinese investment in the United States and also preparing to slap steep tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports. This move comes just as the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is preparing for a trade mission to Beijing later this week. And it appears calculated to keep the pressure on China over what the administration is calling that country's unfair trade practices. INSKEEP: NPR's Beijing correspondent Anthony Kuhn is on the line. Hey there, Anthony. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: So what more can you say about the administration measures here? KUHN: Well, I think these measures are going to be seen in China as mean-spirited and very political. And here's why. Those tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports are aimed at high-tech goods that China does not yet make and does not yet export but wants to. And the message the Chinese get from that is that you are not allowed to develop high tech because we suspect you of stealing our technology from the U.S. And another thing was not in the raft of measures that the White House announced but was reported by several media - and that is that the U.S. is going to make it harder for Chinese students who are studying in sensitive tech fields in the U.S. And, as you may know, China is pretty used to sending its talented students to the U.S. to study tech and science at these... INSKEEP: Well, this is really interesting, Anthony... KUHN: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Because here in the United States, people are becoming more aware of this Made in China 2025 platform, as I believe it's called. This is the Chinese listing a bunch of high-tech industries... KUHN: Right. INSKEEP: ...And saying they want to dominate them within a few years. So it sounds like this Trump administration remove is a fairly direct response to that, saying we're not going to let you get away with it. KUHN: That's right. But to say that, you know, Chinese students coming to the U.S. to study tech and science are going to face limits, to Chinese, makes them feel like they're being - you know, suspicion is being cast on them that they're spies, they're going to engage in industrial espionage. And it's really seen as very political and mean-spirited, I think. INSKEEP: Anthony, what about the timing of this? The administration is making this move at the very moment, just days before this projected summit between the leaders of the United States and North Korea diplomatic dance in which China, as North Korea's friend, is a major player. KUHN: That's correct. And you may have noticed that President Trump seems to think that China did something to set North Korea against the U.S. Both the U.S. and China seem a little bit uncomfortable about North Korea getting too comfortable with the other side, and so we've had these statements. I think if the U.S. really thought China could still derail the summit, then they wouldn't do something like this, which could be seen as irritating Beijing. So I think they consider the summit set. INSKEEP: OK. Well, Anthony, thanks very much. KUHN: You bet, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Roseanne Barr has long been a provocateur. But yesterday, she paid a price for going too far. GREENE: Yeah. On Twitter, Roseanne Barr was referring to the Islamist political party, the Muslim Brotherhood. She tweeted that if, quote, \"Muslim Brotherhood and 'Planet Of The Apes' had a baby, it would equal VJ.\" She was referring to former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. That tweet drew a flurry of condemnation, though many also came to her defense. Just hours after the tweet, ABC pulled the plug on her show. Now Jarrett says she wants to use this moment to highlight everyday examples of racism. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"EVERYDAY RACISM IN AMERICA\") VALERIE JARRETT: I'm fine. I'm worried about all the people out there who don't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense. INSKEEP: NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans has been following this story, and he joins us now to discuss it. And I have one question, Eric. This is an obviously racist remark. But Roseanne Barr has been tweeting racially charged, racist or just conspiratorial things for quite some time. How can ABC act like they're shocked that she would say something like this? ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Yeah, I was at a press conference featuring the cast and producers in January, and people asked about this. And at the time, it seemed as if executives and producers were trying to minimize what she had done. Roseanne herself joked about how her son had gone back and deleted many of her more controversial tweets. But she had a tweet in 2013 where she compared Obama aide Susan Rice to a simian. She had called Islam a rape pedo culture in another tweet and also retweeted some conspiracy theories about Democrats being involved with sex trafficking. So the evidence was out there that she was saying these things on social media. But some of them had been deleted. Some of them had been kind of minimized. And I think this may have been the first time that a tweet like this happened when everyone was paying attention and there was no way to delete it or walk it back or minimize it. INSKEEP: Do you have any insight into ABC's decision to work with Roseanne at all, knowing - I mean, they must have had some sense that there was a potential downside like this. DEGGANS: I think, obviously, there was this trend of reviving or rebooting old shows that has been very successful. And I think they had the sense that \"Roseanne\" could be that kind of success. And it was that kind of success. And I think people also remembered the original \"Roseanne\" show, which was much different than this. It was often an advocate for inclusion. It often talked about racism and talked about opposing homophobia. And so it was sort of hard to square what was happening on that show, which Roseanne controlled, with the way that she seems to be acting on social media now. INSKEEP: Yeah. And even the new version of the show had different kinds of characters. That's NPR's Eric Deggans talking with us this morning. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The president's position on immigration may make things harder for embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Denham in rural California. Denham hopes his moderate stance on immigration will attract Latino voters.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on immigration may be making things harder for one Republican congressman in California's rural Central Valley. His name is Jeff Denham, and he's trying to get re-elected in a district that went for Hillary Clinton two years ago. The number of Latino voters in his district is rising. But as NPR's Ina Jaffe reports, Denham is hoping his moderate position on immigration will help him out. JAKE WENGER: This is our walnut huller-dehydrator. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: It's harvest time at Jake Wenger's walnut orchard outside of Modesto. He's the fourth generation of his family to farm here. He's also a vice president of the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau, which endorsed incumbent Republican Jeff Denham. WENGER: There isn't in my opinion a Valley representative in Congress who's done a better job than Jeff Denham in fighting for water issues. JAFFE: Water is Jake Wenger's top issue, as it is for all the farmers in the 10th Congressional District. But Wenger also likes Jeff Denham's moderate position on immigration. Latinos make up nearly 45 percent of the population here, and they're the backbone of the agricultural workforce. WENGER: If you're here and you've been working, there's no reason anybody should be sent home. I mean, it just - it's a ridiculous thought. JAFFE: Last spring, Denham tried to force a vote on the House floor on a package of immigration bills that included increased border security but also a path to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers who were brought to the United States as children. Denham says that for him, immigration reform is a personal issue. WENGER: Not only is my wife Hispanic, but my kids are now considered Hispanic, too, just because they're - you know, my wife and I being married. JAFFE: In the end, Denham was outmaneuvered by House GOP leadership. The bills that came to the floor were more conservative than the ones he'd proposed, and they failed. Denham's Democratic opponent, Josh Harder, was glad to rub that in during a televised debate sponsored by the Turlock Journal and Univision 19. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH HARDER: You have again and again co-sponsored bills. And then every time you get the call from your party leadership to drop it, you do. JAFFE: Denham's failed efforts no longer impress Juan Vasquez. He was once a registered Republican and voted for Denham. But everything changed in 2016. JUAN VASQUEZ: I was a Trump supporter until he started calling people like me rapists, you know, criminals. There's no way I could support something like that. JAFFE: Since Trump's election, an additional 8,200 Latinos have registered to vote in this district. Jeff Denham won by fewer votes than that in 2016. And while Latinos tend to vote Democratic, historically they haven't turned out in high numbers. Juan Vasquez knows that well since he's now on the Central Committee of the Stanislaus County Democratic Party. But he thinks it might be different this time because people in his community keep asking him about voting. VASQUEZ: Their response was like, I want to vote for people who will stop Trump and his agenda. And I was like, OK, well, if that's what you want, you need to, you know, vote for Democrats (laughter). JAFFE: Jeff Denham doesn't think that Trump will drag him down. Even though Democrats have a slight registration advantage, voters here keep re-electing him. JEFF DENHAM: I think all things are local. You know, people know who I am and know what I'm fighting for. JAFFE: But Democrat Josh Harder argues that there's a disconnect between Denham's moderate reputation and his actions in Congress. HARDER: Like all of these other issues - health care and immigration - he says one thing back in the district and then votes with his party 98 percent of the time. JAFFE: Though some polls show Harder with a small advantage, many analysts call this race a toss-up. The outcome could depend on how many of the growing number of Latino voters actually cast ballots.

            "article_content": "So far this year colleges and diners in New Hampshire have played host to a special visit from Republicans Jeff Flake and John Kasich, and Democrats Joe Biden and Martin O'Malley. That's early even for a place that is used to seeing a lot of politicians with national aspirations.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: New Hampshire is already seeing a stream of early visitors eyeing a possible 2020 presidential run. Democrats and Republicans are dropping in on the state that hosts the first presidential primary, still almost two years away. NPR's Don Gonyea is also there. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: This is former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley greeting New Hampshire voters at St. Anselm College's Politics & Eggs breakfast yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN O'MALLEY: We've got to keep the eggs. GONYEA: A Democrat who ran last time and fared poorly, he reflected on 2016, finding one bright spot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) O'MALLEY: Say what we will as a party about Donald Trump, he has been the most effective tool for candidate recruitment we have ever had. GONYEA: O'Malley's referring to all of the new Democrats running for federal, state and local offices these days. But he could also be talking about the coming 2020 presidential field. Here is a partial list of Democrats who've been here in recent months - Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, former Cabinet secretary Julian Castro and Congressman Tim Ryan. And on the Republican side, Senator Jeff Flake was here last month, and just last night, another veteran of the 2016 race. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Please join me in welcoming to New England College the governor of Ohio, John Kasich. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: Governor Kasich, like Senator Flake, has emerged as one of the strongest Republican critics of Trump. That was on display last night. Take the president's Easter comments that he would end the DACA program that protects undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Kasich had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KASICH: If we believe in justice, and if we believe in compassion, then there would be no reason why we would take somebody who was brought to this country at the age of 6 who's now 26 with a spouse and children and announce to them that we're shipping you out. GONYEA: And then there was this when asked about the White House floating the idea of an Oval Office meeting with Vladimir Putin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASICH: You mean, like, now? No, not now. I mean, receive him to do what? GONYEA: Those comments are about President Trump. But Kasich also directed this at some of Trump's strongest supporters, those who see themselves as victims of a changing economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASICH: We need to address their problems. And we cannot allow them to call themselves victims. Victims are people who have a very hard time being able to get up on their feet. Victimhood leads to anger, and anger never leads to anything good. GONYEA: In the audience was 60-year-old Gary Glines, a veteran of the first Iraq war. He says in November of 2016, he wrote in Kasich's name. He says he's increasingly alarmed with the Trump presidency. GARY GLINES: Just watching the revolving door, it just seems like he's not in control. That means the country's not in control. GONYEA: If Kasich does run as a Republican, he'd face an incumbent president with an approval rating currently at 80 percent among New Hampshire Republicans. Jennifer Horn, a former state GOP chairwoman, was there last night. She says it's an unusual time in Republican Party politics thanks to Trump. JENNIFER HORN: People kind of aren't sure where he falls on any given day on any given issue. And I think that that opens the door to someone like John Kasich or any of a number of others to come in and make an argument for themselves. GONYEA: Any decisions on whether to run may not come until after this year's midterm elections. Meantime, look for plenty of possible candidates dropping into New Hampshire just saying hello.

            "article_content": "President Trump is getting for Tuesday night's State of the Union address \u2014 while the question of whether he considered firing the special counsel in the Russia probe continues to be debated.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This happens a lot when Congress faces some tricky problem. A few members form a little bipartisan working group with a catchy name. DAVID GREENE, HOST: That's right, like the Gang of Six. There was the Gang of Eight - this is how long I've been covering politics - I remember the Gang of 14, like, more than a decade ago. INSKEEP: Wow. And some of these gangs were focused on immigration policy. And here we are with Congress stuck on immigration policy again, and there's another gang. GREENE: Yeah. They're calling themselves the Common Sense Coalition. This is about two dozen senators who want to reach a deal before a deadline next week. Meanwhile, President Trump is preparing his State of the Union address for tomorrow night. And meanwhile that comes after reports that he tried to fire the special counsel, Robert Mueller, last summer. This is Senator Lindsey Graham speaking yesterday on ABC News \"This Week.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\") LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm sure that there will be an investigation around whether or not President Trump did try to fire Mr. Mueller. We know that he didn't fire Mr. Mueller. We know that if he tried to, it'd be the end of his presidency. So at the end of the day, let Mr. Mueller do his job and see if we can fix a broken immigration system. GREENE: OK. Graham trying to focus on fixing a broken immigration system, but what is that going to take? INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro has been posing that question. Hey there, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. And I have to say, lucky for you this is what I like. INSKEEP: (Laughter) It's what you like? GREENE: Oh, a Grammy reference. That's good. MONTANARO: Politics. INSKEEP: OK, it's politics. (Unintelligible) just talking about politics, of course. GREENE: That's right. That's right. INSKEEP: OK, immigration, immigration. The president said the other day, hey, I'm willing to give - and this is focused on people who were brought to the United States illegally as children - DACA recipients and those eligible for that status. Hey, I'm willing to give those folks a path to citizenship, although it would take some years. But he also wants lots and lots of money for a wall on the border and limits to legal immigration. Is that beginning to look like the basis for a deal, Domenico? MONTANARO: Well, it's a basis of what President Trump wants to start as a deal, but frankly, it's held up right now. You know, it's safe to say that what the president proposed is not likely to pass Congress. If something does pass, it will have to be changed and negotiated. And there are a couple groups that are trying to work with the president or at least work together to bring something to the president. INSKEEP: You know, those gangs that we mentioned tended to be on the Senate side where people are a little more bipartisan. But let me just ask - if anything were to get through the Senate on immigration, are House Republicans who are - who include many hard-liners on immigration - are they willing to vote for anything remotely like this? MONTANARO: Well, as you allude to, the Senate has a history of having passed some bipartisan legislation on immigration in the past. In 2013, 68 senators voted for a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration - of immigration in this country. Of course, it didn't get through the House. The House does have, you know, a couple of groups that are trying to work together - Will Hurd from Texas, who has a border of 820 miles in his district - the longest border of any district in the country - and Pete Aguilar, a Democrat from California, have about 53 co-sponsors for their legislation, which is more narrowly tailored to those DACA recipients and so-called DREAMers. INSKEEP: Oh, so the question is go big, go narrow, don't go at all. One other thing, though - we heard Lindsey Graham say of President Trump, if he tried to fire Mueller, the special counsel, it would be the end of his presidency. But it would only be the end in the short-term if Congress impeached him. Are there enough Republicans willing to say they're going to stand up for Robert Mueller in that way? MONTANARO: Not at this point. They're even split on whether or not they should pass legislation to protect Mueller. So it would have to be something catastrophic for the president - for Republicans to really start to act. It's really going to depend on the midterms in 2018. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro - Domenico, I'm glad it's what you're like. MONTANARO: (Laughter) Thank you. INSKEEP: Take care. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: In Russia, protests took place around the country Sunday. Thousands marched against what they see as a lack of choice in the upcoming presidential election. GREENE: Yeah. Alexei Navalny called for these protests, and he's considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest critics. And during these protests yesterday, Navalny was arrested. INSKEEP: NPR's Lucian Kim is covering this story from Moscow. Lucian, what is the protesters' objection to the presidential election? LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Well, Alexei Navalny was denied registration as a candidate in the presidential election, and that's why he's calling now for a boycott. People are - he's saying that by participating, people are basically supporting unfair elections and that they should simply withdraw that participation. INSKEEP: Lucian, having observed Vladimir Putin for years as you have, is it clear to you that Putin's goal here would appear to be an election with only one choice or only one real choice - him? KIM: Well, in some sense, that's what his last two re-election campaigns were like. There are usually an assortment of familiar faces, most of them not particularly serious as far as the opposition candidates are concerned. Vladimir Putin doesn't participate in debates out of principle. So in some ways, yeah, it's much more like a referendum. Given this choice, he always, you know, comes out looking like the best - the best candidate. INSKEEP: The best candidate because he's virtually the only candidate. So this is what Navalny was protesting against. And we mentioned that almost the moment he showed up at this rally in Moscow he was arrested. Where is he now? KIM: Well, he was released later Sunday evening, and no charges have been pressed against him yet, although his lawyer says it's likely he'll be charged later perhaps for organizing an illegal rally because in Moscow, they had not received permission for this rally. But I think just almost just as dramatic - David mentioned earlier about it all starting with sort of building this - building this national campaign, and he used YouTube, and he was broadcasting - I mean, his people were broadcasting live about the protests. And police on camera broke into his anti-corruption foundation office. They said there was a bomb threat and disrupted - tried to disrupt this broadcast. But they - since this had happened already - since this had already happened once before, they were broadcasting from an alternative, secret location. INSKEEP: Oh, so they continued to get their message out. Well that's another bottom-line question. Despite the restrictions, keeping him out of the media, despite the arrests and other disruptions of his protests and events, is it your sense that lots of people know who Navalny is, that his message gets out in a sense? KIM: Well, state media does ignore him, and it's true that Navalny still presents a pretty narrow demographic - urban, young, educated, middle class. I think the fear in the Kremlin is that this Navalny movement could begin to snowball since the economy isn't doing very well and there's a lot of frustration with corruption and simply the rigid political system. INSKEEP: NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow, thanks very much. KIM: Thanks, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: A string of recent events underscores that Afghanistan's war remains profoundly serious and deadly. GREENE: Yeah, that is very true. Both the Taliban and ISIS are carrying out attacks in Afghanistan. The targets have included a major hotel, also the offices of the aid group Save the Children. A suicide bombing on Saturday killed more than a hundred people, and today, another assault. This is one on a military academy in the capital. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid has been monitoring all these attacks from Islamabad, Pakistan. Hey there, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What happened to the military academy? That's going right at the heart of the security apparatus. HADID: The military academy - so it seems that in the early hours of this morning, ISIS gunmen and suicide bombers tried to penetrate the academy, and local reporters say they were stopped at the gate, and there was a gun battle there, and that killed 11 security personnel. INSKEEP: So when you take that attack and you pair it with the other attacks that David mentioned - and some of them are linked to ISIS, some of them are linked to the Taliban, but they're happening in this very compressed period of time - what do people think is going on? HADID: So there's a few theories, and one of them is is that people think there's literally competition between ISIS and the Taliban for followers and for attention. And the easiest way they can do that is by conducting these large-scale attacks in Kabul. That's particularly true for the Taliban because over the past few months, it's been ISIS who was conducting the biggest attacks in Kabul, and it was believed that they were luring away low-level Taliban to its ranks. And so part of the Taliban's resurgence now may be a way showing its own followers like, hey, we're here and we're also doing these things. INSKEEP: So each of these groups is trying to sharpen its brand in Afghanistan. HADID: It's believed to be. Yeah, it's one of the theories behind why there's been so many attacks in Kabul. But the other thing is just that there's been so many drone strikes in rural areas, and it's much easier, unfortunately, to operate in a crowded, urban environment where security is so much more problematic to deal with. Remember, the Taliban used an ambulance laden with explosives to detonate in the middle of a busy street. That's an incredibly difficult thing to stop. INSKEEP: You just alluded to drone strikes. You're saying that in a rural area where there aren't as many people, the United States military, which is assisting Afghanistan, would feel more confident targeting militants. There might still be a mistake and civilian casualties, but there is a bit of a clearer shot. Let me ask about one other aspect of this very quickly, if I can. The United States has been putting extra pressure on Pakistan to crack down on militants who may take shelter in Pakistan across the border. The U.S. even cut off some aid to Pakistan. How's that working out? HADID: Well, it's - you know, I've been speaking to analysts about this, and they say it's unlikely to change much about Pakistan's defensive posture. Analysts here say Pakistan needs some sort of leverage in Afghanistan, however violent. And this is imbedded in the military structure institutionally, and it might be very hard to change that. INSKEEP: Afghanistan - leverage in Afghanistan, meaning the Pakistanis want to have militant groups working for them in Afghanistan, even if it's counterproductive (ph). HADID: Some sort of leverage. INSKEEP: Diaa, thank you very much. HADID: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Diaa Hadid in Islamabad. (SOUNDBITE OF DEEB'S \"FLUID DYNAMICS\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The three-day partial government shutdown is coming to an end. Senate Democrats agreed to a stopgap funding measure after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell committed to a vote on immigration legislation.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The three-day partial government shutdown has come to an end. President Trump has signed a short-term spending bill to fund the government. Senate Democrats agreed to the measure after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell committed to a vote on immigration. Conservatives say Democrats relented because they had overplayed their hand. Here's Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOM COTTON: Shutting down the government and depriving American citizens of services because you want amnesty for illegal immigrants is a massive political blunder. MCEVERS: And Democrats for their part say they expect Senate Leader McConnell to make good on his promise. Listen to Michigan Senator Gary Peters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GARY PETERS: This is a commitment that was done on the floor of the Senate on the record for the American people to see. MCEVERS: So those are Democratic and Republican voices. Let's bring in our own congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who is on Capitol Hill. Hey, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Kelly. MCEVERS: So what is in this Senate bipartisan deal to end the shutdown? DAVIS: You know, the new bill looks an awful lot like the old bill. It's essentially identical to the first stopgap funding measure that Democrats rejected. But in this case, it's one week shorter in length. The stopgap will now run through February 8. It also includes provisions that were in the other legislation, including a six-year renewal of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, and delays of certain health care-related taxes under the Affordable Care Act. MCEVERS: So, I mean, the Democrats initially said they would not agree to reopen the government until they got a deal from Republicans on immigration legislation, and they did not get that. So did they cave as Tom Cotton suggested? DAVIS: You know, there was just increasing dividing lines among Senate Democrats about this shutdown strategy. A lot of their more liberal members, notably a lot of their rumored 2020 candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, wanted Democrats to hold the line. They wanted the shutdown to keep going. They voted against the funding bill. There were cracks, though, among more moderate senators, particularly those who have to run for re-election this year. They were really doubtful that a shutdown was advancing their cause on these ongoing immigration talks. So they started working across the aisle, talking to Republicans. And ultimately a sort of group of centrist senators were able to nudge their party leaders to end the shutdown. Democrats - you're right - don't have much to immediately show for this strategy, but they say they've extracted what they're calling a more ironclad commitment from Republicans to take up legislation either by that February 8 deadline or immediately after. MCEVERS: Is there any sense of whether all this has made it harder or easier, then, to get a bipartisan immigration deal? DAVIS: There still remains a coalition of the willing, as I call it, in the Senate on immigration. The framework that they've talked about hasn't really changed. It still needs to include those four things - a path to citizenship for DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, money for border security including President Trump's wall money for the border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. And conservatives want some tougher policies on legal immigration and visa programs. The question that's going to be lingering over this still is where's President Trump? There's still some confusion on Capitol Hill where the president is. Until the White House is very clear what the president will sign, it's hard to say how likely a deal is to happen. MCEVERS: The Senate has passed bipartisan immigration legislation before. They did it in 2013, but then the House never voted on it. So how confident are Senate negotiators that any deal that they strike will eventually become law? DAVIS: There is a lot of skepticism up here for that very reason. I think that's also why today we're hearing a lot of disappointment from immigration activists that Democrats should have held the line on the shutdown and tried to extract more of a commitment from President Trump and from congressional Republicans. Really important to note here - House Speaker Paul Ryan has not committed the House to vote on any of this. So you know - and without the House commitment, without clarity of where the president is, it's unclear to say where this will land. I will say Democrats are saying they want that deal by February 8. Republicans are saying the real deadline is March 5. That is when President Trump has ordered the DACA program to come to an end. MCEVERS: NPR congressional correspondent Sue Davis, thanks a lot.

            "article_content": "President Trump has issued new rebukes of the new book \u2014 Fire and Fury \u2014 for which former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is now apologizing for not denouncing sooner.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Two facts make this presidential moment distinct. One is the unprecedented questioning of President Trump's mental fitness for office. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The other is President Trump's feeling that he must respond. Over the weekend, the president wrote on Twitter that he is, quote, \"like, really smart\" and also, quote, \"a very stable genius.\" No president has ever publicly spoken of himself in precisely that way. The president was responding to a book by the writer Michael Wolff who says he believes that every White House staffer he encountered has come to think the president is not up to his job. The president laid the blame for Wolff's access in the White House on his former senior strategist, Steve Bannon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know this man. I guess sloppy Steve brought him into the White House quite a bit, and it was one of those things. That's why sloppy Steve is now looking for a job. INSKEEP: The president applying one of his nicknames as he does to people he regards as political enemies. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is covering this story and much more. She's in our studios. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Is this what the rest of the president's party wants to be talking about? DAVIS: No. And I think we know that because one of the consistent criticisms of President Trump from his own party is that, one, they wish he would tweet less. And also when other members of his party have gotten into disagreements or engaged with Steve Bannon in the past, people like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, they have chosen a different path. They have dismissed him. They have not responded. And when asked persistently to engage, they have just said, I don't have anything to say about him. The president has chosen a very different path. INSKEEP: And this happened on a weekend when the president was at Camp David, the presidential retreat, with Republican leaders. And they didn't want to rehash 2017, which Wolff's book is about. They wanted to talk about 2018. DAVIS: They do. And this is a broader point here - is that the Republican Party is still trying to figure out what 2018 should be about. It's a midterm election year. The majorities are at stake in Congress. And they need an agenda. Two of the items coming up that we think we're going to hear a lot about this year are immigration and infrastructure. One of the notable things that the president seemed to be walking away from at Camp David this weekend was Speaker Ryan's insistence that they spend the year focused on overhauling social welfare programs. Mitch McConnell has been hesitant to do something like that in an election year. The president likewise said he didn't see a path forward unless they could get Democrats onboard. Getting Democrats onboard to do something like Paul Ryan would like to do to entitlement programs seems pretty unlikely in 2013. INSKEEP: OK. You mentioned, though, immigration and infrastructure, two areas where hypothetically, in theory, there is bipartisan agreement. But is there really when you get down to the details? DAVIS: We're going to know soon enough on immigration. There's a bipartisan meeting at the White House this week between Republicans and Democrats. I think we know what a compromise looks like. The problem with compromise is that usually means the base in both of your parties are going to be probably pretty angry by the end result. Democrats want some level of legal certainty for certain people living in the country illegally, the so-called DREAMers. Republicans want tougher border enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border. And the president himself wants tougher crackdowns on legal immigration, which is maybe a bit further than other presidents have called for. In order to get there, it needs to have some combination of those things. They probably have the votes to do it if there's willingness to get there. It's just not clear the political will is there yet. INSKEEP: Hasn't the president repeatedly taken off the table and then put back on the table his request for billions of dollars for his border wall as well? DAVIS: He has. And part of - one of the things going into the talks this week is there's a feeling among Democrats that every time they get close to maybe a deal, the president moves the marker. He's - his most current ask from the White House is $18 billion towards the construction of a physical barrier along the border. Democrats like Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin say that they - that that's too much, that that's not fair. So this is why I think that they - the end goal is one that Republicans and Democrats can agree on, which is a compromise immigration legislation. The details of how you get there are still very much in doubt. INSKEEP: And I feel obliged to underline the president said Mexico would pay for the wall. We're talking about $18 billion from American taxpayers here. DAVIS: That is correct. INSKEEP: OK. And then there's that other thing you mentioned - infrastructure. Is that real? DAVIS: Infrastructure is the bipartisan bill of the future and may always be in this administration. Again, the end goal is one that Republicans and Democrats agree on, which is why I think it's always pointed to as this thing that could be this great bipartisan achievement of Washington. But how you get there - Republicans and Democrats have very different views of that. Democrats want to spend a lot more money and maybe raise some taxes to do it, and Republicans don't want to do that. INSKEEP: Before dealing with any of this, lawmakers have to make sure the government doesn't shut down. DAVIS: That's a familiar problem that they're facing. The government runs out of money on January 19. They're trying to find a longer term budget deal. If they don't do that, they'll do what Congress does best - punt, pass a stopgap funding measure... INSKEEP: (Laughter) What counts as longer term at this point when they've been doing it three weeks at a time? DAVIS: And that is often how they like to do it. And if they can't get a longer term deal, that is what's expected to happen this time again. INSKEEP: What happens to the government when they get funded three weeks at a time or whatever it turns out to be? DAVIS: It runs on autopilot, which good budgeters will say is very bad budgeting. INSKEEP: OK. Sue, thanks very much, always a pleasure. DAVIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican members of Congress heard from President Trump on Thursday as they met for their annual strategy and policy retreat. Trump urged them to move ahead with an immigration bill that the party is divided on.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Republicans in Congress huddled today with President Trump, Cabinet secretaries and senior White House officials at the party's retreat in West Virginia. They're mapping out the party agenda for 2018. A classified House intelligence committee memo is also dominating conversation among Republicans. They overwhelmingly support its public release. Republicans drafted the memo, and it reportedly makes allegations that senior Justice Department officials abused their authority to spy on the Trump campaign during the 2016 campaign. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is at that retreat and joins us now. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Republicans have been thought of as the party of law and order. Is there any concern among the ones you're talking to that this memo fight makes them look like they're attacking the credibility of the institutions that they say they trust and respect? DAVIS: Right. I mean, this is the tricky balance that Republicans are facing. As you noted, overwhelmingly, Republicans in the House are in favor of releasing this memo. They say it could come as early as tomorrow. That includes House Speaker Paul Ryan. We talked to him today. He supports releasing the memo. And like a lot of Republicans, he's trying to make this case - it's not about the men and women of the FBI. This is just about congressional oversight of the executive branch and of national surveillance programs. He said he does not see this memo as in any way impugning the Mueller investigation, although that is certainly not how Democrats see it and certainly not how some in the Justice Department see it. I do think it's worth noting Senate Republicans have been a lot more cautious here. They are not calling for the release of the memo in the same way House Republicans are. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he hasn't even seen it, but he - that he trusts the speaker's judgment. SHAPIRO: We're going to keep following this memo story. Meanwhile, President Trump also pushed Republicans today to support his immigration proposal. How are Republicans responding to the principles the White House put forth? DAVIS: There is still a lot of disagreement in the party over what the end goal is here. One of the Republicans we talked today, South Dakota Republican John Thune, said, hey, maybe Republicans need to pare down their expectations and could maybe settle for an even smaller immigration compromise that would just include a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program in exchange for more border security. House conservatives already rejected that out of hand. North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows told us that it was a nonstarter in the House. If there is still no bipartisan agreement here by February 8 - and there is nothing coming out of this retreat that makes me think there will be a bipartisan agreement - Mitch McConnell says he intends to just start an open debate on the floor of the Senate. And his - and in his words, he said, we'll just see who can get 60 votes. SHAPIRO: OK, so I have to imagine that the 2018 agenda includes avoiding another government shutdown, funding the government in more than three-week increments (laughter). The next deadline, as you said... DAVIS: I would hope so. SHAPIRO: ...Is February 8. Are we going to have another shutdown? DAVIS: You know, they really just have three legislative days to figure this out. The House is only expected to be in session until Tuesday next week. They're going out early to give Democrats their chance to go have their annual retreat. It seems like another stopgap bill is an absolute certainty at this point. It will be the fifth such bill Congress has had to pass since September. Republicans are talking about doing another short-term funding bill into late March. The details are still being worked out. There isn't much appetite for another shutdown, but Democrats are maintaining that they will withhold support for any long-term spending deal that would end these shutdown fights until they get some clarity on how this immigration fight ends. SHAPIRO: This is also a midterm election year, and I have to imagine that's come up. Are Republicans afraid of losing seats? DAVIS: You know, the one thing that they keep saying over and over is that the conventional wisdom was wrong about Donald Trump in the party in 2016, and they think it will be again. They are facing historically tough headwinds. They say the party in power in the White House averages something like 30 losses in the House. If Republicans had those kind of losses this November, that would hand control of the House over to Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence was here, and President Trump was here today. Both of them pledged to hit the campaign trail hard this fall. They say that they're going to keep both the House and the Senate, and they're going to campaign on a message of economic revival. SHAPIRO: NPR's Susan Davis at the Republican congressional retreat in West Virginia. Thanks, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "We have the latest on federal budget negotiations after Sen. Rand Paul delayed a vote past midnight, triggering another government funding lapse.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: President Trump this morning signed a new spending bill, and that ended what was a brief, partial government shutdown that many Americans probably slept through. A midnight deadline passed after Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky delayed a Senate vote. Eventually, though, the spending bill passed through the Senate very early this morning. The House followed suit hours later. Lots of activity to talk through with NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So this means everything is settled. The gridlock is over in Washington and on Capitol Hill, and there's going to just be compromise after compromise. DAVIS: You got it. Nothing to see here, right? GREENE: Well, good. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: So what does this bill actually mean? DAVIS: The intention of this two-year budget deal is to end this very shutdown cycle that we have been living in since September. What it does is it establishes the amount of money the federal government can spend on everything from the Pentagon to all domestic programs to things like the FBI. Part of why this agreement was so contentious is that it also includes $300 billion in additional spending over the next 10 years on top of that trillion dollars or so the federal government already spends every year to fund those programs. Once you have those top-line agreements, it will allow lawmakers to write their spending bills, and there will be no need for a shutdown, at least hopefully, through September of 2019. GREENE: Oh, no, I'm going to miss these conversations that we have every few weeks about when the next shutdown might be coming (laughter). DAVIS: You may still have a chance to have another one because while this bill set those top-line numbers, now they actually have to write that spending bill. GREENE: Oh. DAVIS: So what they passed is another short-term stopgap measure through March 23. And when that date comes up, they're supposed to actually enact the spending bill they all just agreed to. We think they will, but, as you said, David, stay tuned. GREENE: We could be right back here having the same conversation. DAVIS: (Laughter) Exactly. GREENE: Well, let's get to some of the substance of this. I mean, as you said, there's this extra money in this bill, and that is never something that fiscal conservatives like Rand Paul enjoy very much. A number of House conservatives opposed it for that reason. I mean, how serious are the concerns they're raising? DAVIS: This was a really tough vote if you won and were elected to Congress on promises of fiscal responsibility as a Republican. This is more spending than Republicans ever agreed to increase under President Obama where spending levels of government were also a big fight there. I think that a lot of Republicans feel that this vote broke that promise and could be a vote that comes back to haunt them beyond today and potentially in the midterm elections where they could potentially face primary challenges or other general election problems by people who said, hey, you promised to go to Washington and reduce the deficit and cut spending and, the deficit's growing, and you're spending more money. GREENE: Well, then we have another concern about this bill, which came from many Democrats, which is that it did not include any immigration resolution. DAVIS: Yeah. GREENE: And Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, I mean, she held that record-setting speech on the House floor. So where does that stand now? DAVIS: What Pelosi was trying to extract was some kind of commitment from Republicans that they would take up immigration legislation. In the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already moved towards that debate. The Senate is expected to take up immigration next week. A lot of House Democrats wanted those same assurances. The issue of immigration has been a very emotional debate. And Nita Lowey is a Democrat from New York. She's the top Democrat on the appropriations committee that writes these spending bills, and she talked about this issue early this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NITA LOWEY: They serve with distinction in our armed forces. They pay taxes and contribute to their communities. President Trump and the Republican majority hold the lives and future of these children and young adults in their hands. DAVIS: Now, she, of course, is talking about those affected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the people that were brought here illegally as children that Congress is trying to find a legal solution to. GREENE: Right. DAVIS: And so what Democrats in the House are saying is we want a vote as well. The next big debate in Washington, it does seem like, will be immigration. GREENE: And so this has House Democrats basically telling their colleagues in the Senate you may have gotten a promise from McConnell to go to an immigration debate, but in the House, we don't have any such promise. Is that where things stand? I mean, what are the chances for a debate on the House side? DAVIS: Well, that was the perception. But we should note - Speaker Paul Ryan, in the closing moments before this vote, spoke on the floor, and this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem. DAVIS: So there you have it. House Speaker Paul Ryan early this morning did make a very public commitment that the House and Congress will resolve this immigration issue. GREENE: OK. So the budget debate resolved for now, and now it's onto what could be a pretty interesting debate over immigration in the coming days and weeks. DAVIS: You got it.

            "article_content": "The federal government remains partially closed with the Senate scheduled to vote at noon on a short-term fix. Essential employees have been told to report to work, but paychecks are on hold.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And this is day three of a government shutdown. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah. Lawmakers worked all weekend to try to reach an agreement. Last night, the Senate leadership agreed to vote on a resolution that's going to happen today around noon Eastern. If it passes, the government will reopen for three weeks. But the debate over immigration policy, the reason the government shut down in the first place, has yet to be resolved. GREENE: And let's see where this might be going with NPR's Scott Detrow, who's here. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: OK, so we have a vote today at noon that if it goes in one direction, it could reopen the government at least until February 8. Are Democrats signaling that they are willing to support this? DETROW: It seems like just enough Democrats might support this. So just to recap, Mitch McConnell went on the Senate floor last night and promised the Senate will address immigration next. That follows talks all weekend by a large group of moderate senators from both parties looking for a way out. So many of the Democrats who had been pushing for this confrontation all along say this is just status quo. There's nothing new here. There's no difference between a three-week funding bill and a four-week funding bill. And promises to deal with immigration is what McConnell and President Trump have promised all along and kept punting, so there's frustration from many Democrats. But a lot of moderate Democrats, Democrats up for reelection next year do not want a protracted shutdown and seem to be looking for an off ramp all weekend. GREENE: Well, I mean, you mentioned President Trump - a lot of Democrats complaining and saying that they can't trust him because he can change his mind unexpectedly. Where has the president been in all of this so far? DETROW: Curiously absent ever since the shutdown began. President Trump stayed in the White House all weekend, no public appearances, not even that many tweets, just some pictures the White House sent out of him in the Oval Office making calls, wearing a make America great again hat. And from what we can tell, he has not really been too involved in the negotiations, which is interesting since one dynamic that brought us here is the fact that President Trump keeps seeming to agree to one thing in meetings with Democrats and then backtracking right afterwards. Over the weekend, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, said negotiating with Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O. GREENE: One of those people in Washington who always come with a turn of phrase to capture attention is Chuck Schumer. DETROW: I haven't negotiated with Jell-O, so I don't know. GREENE: (Laughter) The president did tweet though something about maybe Republicans using a nuclear option. What would that be, Scott? DETROW: Yeah, that would be changing the Senate rules so that you only need the bare majority of 51 votes to do anything. That's something that most senators from both parties don't want to do because they know that a couple of elections later, they could be the ones in the minority. GREENE: All right, so both sides are accusing the other of playing politics. Some are calling this the Schumer shutdown, some are calling this the Trump shutdown. Last night, Senator Flake of Arizona said, let's end all the blame game rhetoric. But, I mean, are there political winners and losers here once this is resolved? DETROW: So we'll stick with the blame game, I guess, (laughter) for our purposes. You know, I think that if this gets resolved with this deal we're talking about right now, three weeks instead of four weeks and still no hard promise on DACA, it's hard to say that Democrats got anything out of this. It looks like Republicans basically kept the status quo. We'll be able to end the shutdown for now, but I think it's important to point out that with just three weeks deal, we could be in this exact situation, maybe in another shutdown, in just a matter of weeks. MARTIN: Can I point out two things? One, it was super interesting to hear Lindsey Graham say he doesn't feel like he has a valuable partner to negotiate in the White House, referring there to Stephen Miller, who's taken the lead on immigration policy, giving him a whole lot of influence - totally fascinating. And the second thing I want to note, the fashion of working over the weekend. When you have to be working over the weekend, apparently it's mandatory to wear the baseball hat. We've got Trump wearing the baseball hat, we've got Lindsey Graham - I'm working on the weekend, I've got to have my hat on. That's all I have to say. DETROW: (Laughter). GREENE: A new fashion statement. Let's all wear hats next weekend together. MARTIN: Right. GREENE: Scott Detrow - thanks, Scott, we appreciate it. DETROW: Thank you. GREENE: So this federal shutdown, I mean, depending on how long it goes or maybe if it's just a few days, I mean, it really could affect millions of people in this country. MARTIN: Right. And this is when federal employees have to ask this very awkward question. Am I essential, am I not essential? If you're not a so-called essential employee, then odds are you don't have to go to work today. The shutdown also means that hundreds of thousands of paychecks are currently on hold. GREENE: All right, NPR's Wade Goodwyn has been looking at who has been hit the most by this shutdown. And, Wade, where is the biggest impact here? WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: Well, at first, it's not really going to be all that bad. You know, as you mentioned, some workers are going to go to the office today to find out whether they're essential or not. But, you know, the category of what's considered to be an essential service can be expansive. Law enforcement, military, air traffic control, Veterans hospital, post office men and women will keep trudging through the weather. The post office has a funding stream that's happily independent of Congress. You know, even at the Department of Agriculture, inspections of eggs, meat, dairy, poultry, those are considered essential to safeguarding American lives, so they'll keep right on inspecting. Social Security, Homeland Security, Justice Department, FBI, CIA keep right on going. GREENE: Wow. GOODWYN: I mean, can you imagine the chaos if all the TSA agents were suddenly furloughed? You know, not going to happen. There's going to be plenty of folks to pat you down. GREENE: So, I mean, you're naming a list of agencies here that are still going to be operating. Who's not operating? I mean, break this down for us. GOODWYN: Well, I mean, who's not operating is maybe the national parks. They're supposed to be open this time, they weren't last time. But if it were me, I'd check before I present myself at the gate. You know, another big one, if you're trying to buy a house and get a mortgage loan approved and your bank has to verify your income to your social security number and the IRS, the shutdown is going to be a big problem for you because the IRS is not deemed essential. You know, if that goes on for two or three weeks, it's going to drive realtors mad with frustration. GREENE: Have you been talking to people who may or may not be affected by this? GOODWYN: I did. I talked to a hydrologist out of Durango, Colo. named Derek Ryter. His science research helps keep the state of Oklahoma in drinking water, which is rather important. And here's Ryter. DEREK RYTER: I'm very disappointed with the entire situation and also stressed because we have a lot of work we need to get done. You know, I can't miss a house payment. If I miss a paycheck, I don't have, you know, reserves to make up for something like this. GOODWYN: You know, the 2013 shutdown lasted 16 days. And Standard and Poor's said that was about a $24 billion hit to the economy. Somebody should break down this price tag, you know, the political bickering hourly cost. Maybe that would get Congress's attention. GREENE: That would be interesting. I mean, President Trump talking about the cost and what he sees as the cost, he has said that the shutdown is going to devastate the country's military. Is that true? GOODWYN: Well, no. I mean, The Washington Post fact checker gave President Trump's tweets on this subject 3 Pinocchios out of 4, three Pinocchios meaning mostly false. The nation's military will soldier on, if it's not too early in the morning for bad puns. My apologies. GREENE: Never apologize for that, Wade. NPR's Wade Goodwyn, we appreciate it, thanks. GOODWYN: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, some other news now. Vice President Pence is on the move right now. MARTIN: He was in Egypt and Jordan over the weekend. And this morning, the vice president is in Jerusalem. Pence met with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He will not, however, be meeting with any Palestinians on this trip. They were furious over President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, so they've refused to meet with Pence while he's in the region. So the question now, what exactly can Pence achieve on this trip? GREENE: And let's ask NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Jerusalem. Hey, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So how is this big decision from President Trump about Jerusalem affecting this visit? ESTRIN: Well, White House officials at first weren't expecting the Jerusalem issue to be the centerpiece of the vice president's discussions on this trip, but it has been. Jerusalem's been front and center. The king of Jordan called on the U.S. to rebuild trust and confidence in the possibility of peace. And so Pence on this trip has tried to explain the rationale behind the Jerusalem declaration. He has said by recognizing what he called the obvious, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, that creates an opportunity to, quote, \"move on,\" to move on to issues that need to be negotiated at the peace table. The Palestinians are not at all interested in moving on. They have claims in Jerusalem as well. The Palestinian leaders now are refusing any U.S.-led peace process and refusing to meet with Pence. GREENE: Ok, so given that the Palestinians are refusing to meet with him, Israeli leaders are, how has this trip felt and how has it played out so far? ESTRIN: Well, today in Jerusalem, Pence was greeted by an Israeli honor guard that played the American and Israeli national anthems. Pence was grinning the whole time. An evangelical organization in Jerusalem has put up signs next to Pence's hotel that say, you are a true friend of Zion. Pence is an ardent supporter of Israel. He has been for a long time. He's a devout Christian. He was one of the biggest advocates pushing Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. So he feels very welcome here. GREENE: And he's going to be giving a speech at the Israeli parliament today. What can we expect? ESTRIN: Well, he has said that he is going to stand before the Israeli Parliament and say that if both Israelis and Palestinians agree, the Trump administration will support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, meaning creating an independent Palestinian state next to Israel. Now that's a vision that many in the Israeli government today actually reject. So we'll see how lawmakers react. Arab lawmakers are boycotting Pence's speech. GREENE: OK, NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem covering a visit by Vice President Pence to Jerusalem. We appreciate it. ESTRIN: No problem. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A year ago this weekend, Albert Kiecke and Becky Dinsmore came to Washington, D.C., but the friends of 50 years visited the nation's capital for two very different events. Kiecke came to celebrate President Trump's inauguration, while Dinsmore said it was her civic duty to protest at the Women's March. At the time, the lifelong friends from Houston said they didn't want the country's political divisions to affect their friendship. \"I mean, Becky and other people are going to have their opinion on politics, and I have my opinion on politics,\" Kiecke told NPR. \"And I'm not going to change your mind nor can I change anybody else's mind.\" So, one year later, how do they think President Trump is doing? NPR's Scott Simon caught up with them to find out. On what grade they give the president Kiecke: I'd probably give him about a B - ... He's just standing up to everybody, up to the media and up to all the people that are against him. But you know then on the other hand, you know, I get discouraged when he just tweets stuff that, you know, really doesn't matter. It only just inflames people and causes more turmoil. Dinsmore: I'm sorry to say would give him an F. You know, I think that it's difficult to divide his policies from what I would call his proclivities, Twittering being one of them. But I think the F for me is due to the fact that he is divisive, and we've got people on both far ends of the spectrum. I'm surprised to hear Albert say a B-. I don't know, maybe I'll give him an F+. On if they're proud that Donald Trump is president Kiecke: I guess I'm proud. But I've always held the president of the United States, even if I didn't care for their policies, I've always been proud of our presidents. Dinsmore: Well I hate to say it because I think Albert's point is well made, which is that we should all be able to be proud of the office of president. So, I still think we're a great country, but no, I'm not proud. In fact, I'm disgusted. On immigration and the uncertain fate of people brought to the U.S. illegally as children Dinsmore: To me, I just think what would it be like going back somewhere you'd really never been before. And separating someone from their family and from their job, and I think there is an impact on a larger group than just that individual. Kiecke: I think that we should allow them to stay here. It's kind of hard to send them back to the country they have no knowledge of, but also they didn't come here legally by fault of their parents, and I don't think they should be automatically granted citizenship because of that. There should be some pathway that they could get in line with all the other people that want to be citizens and get their citizenship that way. NPR's Isabel Dobrin produced this story for the Web.",

            "article_content": "Japan's prime minister meets with President Trump to discuss North Korea. And, the U.S. ambassador to Germany raises eyebrows for his support of the far right.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In recent years, North Korea has launched missiles that theoretically could have reached the United States. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: But for people in Japan, the risk was not theoretical at all. At least two North Korean missiles flew right over Japan before crashing into the sea in recent times. So before President Trump meets with Kim Jong Un of North Korea next week, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to have a word. He gets his chance at the White House today. MARTIN: Indeed, he does. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us this morning. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: What is Japan's prime minister going to be asking from President Trump? LIASSON: I think he's going to be asking for clarification. Abe has been a big supporter of this maximum-pressure campaign on North Korea, very tough sanctions. And now there is some concern that President Trump is backing away from that campaign without getting any concessions from North Korea. On Friday, President Trump said he didn't even want to talk about maximum pressure anymore. So Japan is concerned that Donald Trump could make a deal with North Korea that would address only U.S. security concerns but not Japanese ones - for example, a deal that would get rid of North Korea's long-range intercontinental missiles that presumably could reach the U.S. but allow North Korea to keep shorter-range missiles that could still be a threat to Japan. He also wants Donald Trump to bring up the issue of the Japanese abductees in North Korea. And I think he just wants overall clarification, what is the Trump administration strategy with North Korea? MARTIN: Is he likely to get what he wants? I mean, what's the relationship between these two men? LIASSON: That's a good question. He has put a lot of effort into this relationship. He has met with Donald Trump many times. Just on April 18, he met with him at Mar-a-Lago. They've golfed together. So even before Emmanuel Macron became President Trump's buddy, Abe was trying to develop a personal relationship, but so far, he hasn't gotten much. He wasn't even able to secure an exemption for Japan from those steel and aluminum tariffs that Donald Trump has put on U.S. allies. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Mara, there's something else to talk about today, something we haven't actually discussed in a while, immigration, the potential for immigration reform on Capitol Hill. There is movement. The House - at least some House Republicans are meeting today. What can you tell us? LIASSON: House Republicans are meeting to see if they can hammer out some kind of a compromise on immigration. The hand of the Republican leadership is being forced by a group of moderate Republicans, along with Democrats, on a mechanism called a discharge petition that would allow them to bring some immigration bills to the floor over the objections of leadership. They're just a couple signatures away from having the number they need to do that. It's kind of a bipartisan rank-and-file revolt. So today, the House speaker is going to try to work out a compromise to avoid that. But it's hard to see what kind of compromise they could find since they've been working for a compromise on immigration, on what to do with the DREAMers all year, and they haven't found one. INSKEEP: This is an election dilemma for many Republicans. You have more moderate Republicans or Republicans in districts with large Latino populations who want something to be done for DACA kids, as they're called. And you have more hardline base voters who don't. LIASSON: That's right. And then you've got the president on the campaign trail using immigration as a weapon. He thinks it's a great political issue for him. He's been bashing the Democrats for being illegal immigrant lovers. They like illegal immigrants more than U.S. citizens, he says. So it's a complicated issue for Republicans. MARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson this morning. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. The U.S. ambassador to Germany is under some pressure in this moment. There are some German politicians who now want him out of his job. INSKEEP: Yeah. Ambassador Richard Grenell said some things that ambassadors normally would not. Not long after President Trump nominated him and he was confirmed and he settled into his new job in Berlin, Grenell gave an interview to the conservative news site Breitbart and said he wants to empower conservatives, populists, right-wing movements throughout Europe. Normally, an ambassador would try to stay out of a host country's politics at all costs, but here, Grenell explicitly said he wanted in to European politics. MARTIN: OK. So what exactly do Germans hear in those remarks that Grenell made? Let's ask NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. She joins us from Berlin. Hey, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So saying that he wants to empower conservatives sounds different in a U.S. context than it does in a European context. Why did this cause such an uproar over there? NELSON: Well, in Germany, there is a lot of sensitivity about this trend across Europe of far-right political parties rising, gaining popularity, joining governments. And the interview that Richard Grenell gave was perceived to be talking about these far-right groups even though it didn't specifically mention them by name. But he did mention right-wing Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who of course is a Merkel critic. And he's joined forces with the far right in Austria to form a government. So these are the things that are really worrying people here. MARTIN: Right. It's not just conservatives, it's very extreme far-right leaders, of course. And when you take into consideration Europe's history... NELSON: Right. That was definitely the fear, or that's the concern is that what he meant in other words. MARTIN: So now some lawmakers in Germany say that they want Grenell to leave over this? NELSON: Yes, certainly. And it's not just lawmakers. You'll recall from your time here covering the elections that Martin Schulz of the Social Democrats who ran against Merkel and lost, he's been very vocal about Richard Grenell leaving. And Sahra Wagenknecht basically referred - or called him a colonial master, you know, that this sort of behavior welcome. And so you really do have this growing outcry of explain yourself and leave. INSKEEP: There is a lot in that phrase colonial master because Europeans are well used to the idea of sending an ambassador to Africa or to Asia in past generations, of course, and the ambassador being extraordinarily powerful in some other country. Americans have had ambassadors like that. But the idea of an American ambassador coming to Europe and acting like that is something that people take offense. MARTIN: Altogether different. And clearly, this is not happening in a vacuum, right? Soraya - President Trump, Chancellor Merkel, they are not seeing eye to eye much. NELSON: Oh, yes. I mean, we're talking about the trade tariffs that are on the table at the moment, the punitive tariffs against aluminum and steel that the Trump White House has imposed, the fact that the Iran deal is - that the U.S. is leaving the Iran deal. And so this is something where Grenell has ruffled a lot of feathers as well because on his first day, he tweeted about German companies doing business in Iran. MARTIN: All right. Much more to say as we keep covering this. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting from Berlin this morning. Thanks so much, Soraya. NELSON: You're welcome, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Steve, you'll remember that story in Cuba where all these American diplomats were hearing strange sounds and then getting sick, kind of a harrowing story. Now this appears to be happening in China. What's going on? INSKEEP: For the second time in recent weeks now, U.S. diplomats stationed in Guangzhou - that's a huge city not far from Hong Kong in China - have been sent to the United States for medical testing after they complained of an unexplained illness. The diplomats suffered symptoms after they said they heard strange high-pitched noises. MARTIN: This is such a weird story. NPR's Anthony Kuhn is with us now. He's in Beijing. Anthony, what can you tell us? I mean, what do we know about this case in China? ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Well, as you said, Rachel, this happened at the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, where there are about 170 U.S. staff working. And they were found to have symptoms similar to diplomats - U.S. diplomats in Havana. To experts, these symptoms looked like mild traumatic brain injury. And after hearing these odd high-pitched sounds, the employees said that it impaired their hearing, their vision, their balance, memory, sleep and other functions. INSKEEP: Traumatic brain injury, that's something that happens to soldiers on the battlefield from the concussion of explosions and so forth. KUHN: Not diplomats, that's right. So the State Department says that it has sent an undisclosed number of employees back to the U.S. for examination. They're not saying who they are for privacy reasons. And a U.S. medical team has been sent to Guangzhou. And a government task force has also been established to look into this. MARTIN: I mean, what is - what are the Chinese saying? I mean, what's the government there saying? KUHN: Yeah. The Foreign Ministry was asked about this at a routine briefing today. And Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying responded. Let's hear a clip of tape of her explanation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HUA CHUNYING: (Through interpreter) The Chinese side has adopted a responsible attitude to investigate the relevant issue. And we haven't found any course or clue that leads to the situation mentioned by the U.S. MARTIN: So they don't have an explanation, basically. KUHN: That's right. We don't know whether this was the result of an intentional attack, something in the environment around the diplomats which caused this or some medical condition the government employees which is completely unrelated to outside factors. It's just unexplained. INSKEEP: This went on for quite some time in Cuba, and there's still no explanation for what happened there. MARTIN: Right. And it really disrupted an already fraught relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Is that likely to further complicate the relationship between the U.S. and China, which isn't so great right now? KUHN: Right. Well, you know, the U.S. relationship with China is, of course, much bigger. And it's already strained by so many disputes on everything from trade to China's actions in the South China Sea, human rights. I guess we can say that there's this growing atmosphere of strategic mistrust between the two countries, and that could fuel suspicions. And if these suspicions are confirmed, then it could sour the relationship even further. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reporting from Beijing for us this morning. Anthony, thanks so much. KUHN: You bet, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF TWUAN'S \"NAH MAN\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Voters in rural Pennsylvania were crucial to electing President Trump. A year after he took office, they are mostly pleased with how Trump has executed his presidency.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Voters in southwest Pennsylvania were among the most crucial in President Trump's rise to the presidency. It's coal country, and the president's pledge to boost that industry was a big part of it. But his background as a businessman who is not afraid to insult or throw a verbal punch also helped. Now, a year into the Trump presidency, NPR's Don Gonyea has been out talking to those voters. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: At Hot Rod's BBQ in Waynesburg, Pa., you can get a draft beer anytime for a dollar. I couldn't tell if you were open. ELIZABETH COGAR: Yeah, we are. GONYEA: How are you? COGAR: Well, the bartender will treat you very well. GONYEA: OK. Twenty-one-year-old waitress Elizabeth Cogar greets me as I walk inside. We chat while she waits for the dinner rush. I ask her about President Trump. She's a supporter. COGAR: Because he's a straightforward person. He doesn't sugarcoat anything. GONYEA: But she also has some advice for the president. Calm down on Twitter. COGAR: Like how he was posting about North Korea and how they have bombs but his button's bigger. And so I don't think that was appropriate. GONYEA: Yes, Cogar supports Trump but says she's not as big of a fan as she was a year ago because of the drama and the distractions. COGAR: If he could calm down on social media and his speeches and stuff, I feel like the country would want to work with him as well instead of trying to work against him. Like, we all live here. We all try to live comfortably. We're all just trying to provide for our families. So, like, let's find a median where we can work together. GONYEA: Even that level of criticism makes Cogar unusual among people I talked to here. Forty-eight-year-old Paul Walker works in a coal mine. He called me on his cellphone as he drove to his shift. PAUL WALKER: Right now I'm in Waynesburg, Pa. I'm driving on 21 West. GONYEA: Walker he says he likes Trump's combative approach and his Twitter feed. But what's most important, he says, is that Obama-era regulations on the coal industry are being rolled back. WALKER: We were at a period where we were only running the coal production three days a week. Now we're back up to six to seven days production. So yeah, we're all pretty pumped up about what's been going on. GONYEA: Walker acknowledged that there are a lot of reasons that production is up. It's an international market place with many complicating factors. But he gives Trump plenty of credit. Now to the city of Monroeville, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Len Young owns a small landscaping business. He says he's an original member of the Tea Party and likes Donald Trump more than ever these days. LEN YOUNG: He is the way he is. You have to accept him. The reporters who lambaste him and just have such vile hate in their heart - they're the ones who have to change, not Trump. GONYEA: Sure, there are some ups and downs for hardcore Trump backers. I talked to Young twice over the past two weeks. The first was when the president met with a group of senators and seemed to be embracing the Democrats' proposal on a possible path to citizenship for the so-called DREAMers. YOUNG: I was very disappointed. Right now the tone is not where I would want it to be. GONYEA: But a day later when Trump is alleged to have uttered the now infamous vulgarity regarding immigration and the deal was breaking up, Len Young's disappointment was gone. YOUNG: There's a good chance that the right thing is going to happen. GONYEA: Now to a coffee shop in Mt. Lebanon. Twenty-eight-year-old real estate agent Anissa Coury supports Trump and has some advice to anyone who will listen. Just ignore the noise, and focus on the accomplishments. She points to the Dow hitting 26,000 and the new tax bill and... ANISSA COURY: Unemployment rates are around 4 percent, the lowest unemployment for African-Americans, I believe. So the things that he's doing in my opinion are nothing short of miraculous - and a Supreme Court justice obviously. GONYEA: There will be an early electoral test of Trump's strength in this part of Pennsylvania - a special congressional election in March. It's a seat currently held by the GOP in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 points. Republicans and Democrats will be looking for any signs of cracks. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

            "article_content": "The Senate began an unusual debate on immigration Monday. There's no specific bill to debate, and no certainty on how long this debate will go, or what it will ultimately produce.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The Senate is beginning an unusual debate on immigration. There's no actual bill so far, no certainty on how long this debate will go or what it will ultimately produce. Democrats like Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin are cautiously optimistic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DICK DURBIN: I think the American people are going to watch this debate and hope that we do end up with something. And I think we can. I hope we will. SHAPIRO: To discuss what that something might be, NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: I'm thinking of that famous line from down the \"Downton Abbey.\" What is a week end? DAVIS: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: What is an open debate in the Senate? DAVIS: You know, true confession - I'm kind of excited to see how this week goes in the Senate because this just isn't something I've really covered before. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). DAVIS: What they're agreeing to have is essentially just a debate. There is no underlying bill that they're talking about amending, which is what makes this so rare. I even called the Senate Historian's Office to ask, is there any parallels to this? And even they were like, yeah, there's really nothing we can compare this to. There are no shortage of proposals on immigration. At least half a dozen pieces of legislation have been introduced on this. Obviously, President Trump has put forward his own proposal regarding what to do with people who were brought here illegally as children. And what essentially they're going to do is jockey back and forth these ideas on immigration and see if they can cobble together a bill. Remember; this is the Senate, so they need a supermajority. They need something that can get to 60 votes and see if it can clear the Senate. It's going to take up the entire week. It's quite possible it takes even longer. They have three weeks until that March 5 deadline to come up with a solution. SHAPIRO: But when there's no real legislation under debate, though, how does it work? Is it like each senator votes on every proposal that a senator makes? Or are they trying to write a bill together on the floor? Or - like, what's going on? DAVIS: It's a little bit of both. So what - essentially, what the leadership - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will talk with their senators and they will come up with loose agreements on what kind of amendments will get votes, what the vote thresholds will be and whether they become part of a final package. I think you're going to see two things happening this week. One's going to be very public - that's the debate you're going to be able to tune into C-SPAN and watch - and the debate going on behind the scenes in the cloakrooms, in the leader's offices. I would note that there are a group of moderate senators who are also meeting on the side, trying to come up with a solution from the middle to see if they can get their leadership and the president on board. And Dick Durbin, who I spoke with today, did say that he trusts Mitch McConnell in this process. He believes he's going to play it straight. He doesn't believe he's going to try and tilt the playing field. And they are going to at least try and see what the Senate can produce. SHAPIRO: We've heard some senators say, perhaps pessimistically, that they think the only thing people be able to agree on is a short-term fix for DACA recipients. DAVIS: Yeah. SHAPIRO: How much optimism is there generally in the Senate right now? DAVIS: The curious thing about this issue is that it is an issue that absolutely has majorities in both the Senate - House and Senate. It's just not clear that there is a political will to get it done. Again, where the president comes down on this is going to be very critical. The White House so far has not shown any ability to wiggle or negotiate on their proposal. Part of what's the toughest part of this is the restrictions that the White House is seeking on legal immigration, specifically on family unification policies. And, yes, there is already talk that if all else fails, the best last solution could be just a one-year extension of that DACA program - maybe a little bit longer than that - to get people through the midterm elections. And they could just keep fighting over it into next year. SHAPIRO: And if the Senate does pass a bipartisan deal, there is still the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he's committed to a bipartisan DACA fix. What do you think could happen there? DAVIS: The House is essentially in wait-and-see mode. They're not going to really move forward with anything until they know what the Senate can pass and if the president will support it. This is a much tougher vote for Republicans in the House. This is such a core issue to their base voters. Paul Ryan doesn't want to put anything on the floor that doesn't have the support of the president, that would make it an election year issue. So he wants to make sure the president's on board and it is certain to pass before he says what the House will do. SHAPIRO: NPR congressional correspondent Sue Davis, thanks. DAVIS: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "President Trump huddled with congressional leaders to try to focus the party's agenda, but revelations in a new book are distracting. Also, some Salvadorans  may lose their temporary protected status.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Steve, I want to talk to you about Camp David, which is designed to be a presidential retreat, and retreat means, you know, a chance to get away, maybe slow things down a little bit. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Although before taking office, President Trump found it a bit too slow, telling reporters at one point it was rustic and, quote, \"you'd like it for about 30 minutes.\" He's since insisted he likes it better, and over the weekend, the president met with Republican leaders there. The plan was to talk over the president's second year in office, although the national conversation is dominated by a book about his first. Michael Wolff wrote that book, which included explosive quotes from former adviser Steve Bannon, which caused the president of the United States to give Bannon a nickname. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess sloppy Steve brought him into the White House quite a bit, and it was one of those things. That's why sloppy Steve is now looking for a job. INSKEEP: Writer Michael Wolff also said the White House staff universally finds President Trump is not up to his job. In response, the president tweeted over the weekend he is, quote, \"like really smart,\" and, quote, \"a very stable genius.\" GREENE: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is in our studios this morning. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So many things to ask you about here with this book and Steve Bannon, but one thing that strikes me - Bannon has actually now given a statement to the news site Axios saying he has felt some regret over some of the quotes in this book. What is Bannon regretting here? DAVIS: He expressed regret that he didn't respond sooner to reporting in Michael Wolff's book that he had made critical comments about the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., specifically that that 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russian officials that the president's son helped set up was in the words of the book treasonous. Bannon said in his statement he intended to be more critical of the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, not Donald Trump Jr., who he praised as, in his words, as a patriot and a good man. It clearly seems like an effort to make amends with a White House that has tried to bury Steve Bannon in recent days. It doesn't sound like the president is in a very forgiving mood. INSKEEP: Bannon was also quoted, though, saying that Don Jr. was going to be cracked like an egg on national TV - we should just mention that - the original quote before he cleaned it up. GREENE: Yeah. The book was full of quotes like that, and this book is clearly on the mind of the president at a moment when he's meeting with top Republicans over the weekend at Camp David, and they're actually talking about an agenda for 2018. So what is - what's on it, Sue? DAVIS: One of the things that was most notable coming out of this weekend is what is not on the agenda, and that is the Republican push among some to try and overhaul social welfare programs. That has been a priority of Speaker Paul Ryan. He said he wanted to focus 2018 on doing that. He didn't get much backup from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell after - before the holidays. And President Trump seemed to side with Mitch McConnell, saying if they were going to do anything on that end, it would be - have to be bipartisan. I don't think it's an understatement to say Democrats have very little interest in working with Republicans to overhaul social welfare programs in an election year. GREENE: Although there is a bipartisan mood in the air in Washington when it comes to immigration, right? Is that an area where we could see some working together? DAVIS: It is. The president's expected to host a group of Republicans and Democrats at the White House early this week. They know what this bill needs to do. For Democrats, a compromise needs to include some kind of legal certainty for certain people living here illegally, the so-called DREAMers. To win enough Republicans, you have to have more border enforcement, and the White House wants tougher restrictions on legal immigration. They probably have the votes. What's not clear yet is if they have the political will to do it. GREENE: And we know you'll be covering all of it. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Sue, thanks. DAVIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. So if you live in a city like Houston, Texas, or if you live in Los Angeles where I spend most of my time or Washington, D.C., Steve, where you live, I mean, we are living with tens of thousands of immigrants from El Salvador who are part of our communities. INSKEEP: Yeah. And today, almost 200,000 Salvadorans across this country face a big day. They are in the country with Temporary Protected Status, which means the United States let them in while their country was in crisis; in El Salvador's case, a civil war. Their status is set to expire unless the Trump administration extends the protection. The White House has already ended TPS designations for Sudanese, Nicaraguans and Haitians. So will this be any different? GREENE: All right. NPR's Carrie Kahn is on the line. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi, good morning. GREENE: Just remind us, if you can, why Salvadorans left their country and came to the United States in the first place. KAHN: Sure. Well, TPS was granted to Salvadorans in 2001, and their grant - the designation came because of two major earthquakes that hit the Central American country that year. And it was actually George Bush who granted the TPS status that year. So Salvadorans that were already in the country, they got protection from deportation, and the vast majority of Salvadorans in the country illegally at that time were the tens of thousands who fled the - in the 1980s and 1990s during decades of the U.S.-backed civil war and unrest there. And TPS has been extended to Salvadorans every 18 months by subsequent presidents since then - both Republicans and Democrats. GREENE: So what exactly happens if the Trump administration decides not to extend this status practically? I mean, they'll be living in the country illegally all of a sudden. They won't be able to work. KAHN: Well, with TPS, you're granted a work permit, and that's renewed every time the TPS is extended. So they paid for that fee - they pay a fee for the permit, but they would no longer have a work permit, and they would be required to leave the country at that time once it's no longer extended. GREENE: Will this have an impact on El Salvador? KAHN: Oh, it'll be great. It'll be great. First of all, El Salvador is still one of the poorest and most violent in the hemisphere, and they would also have a very hard time absorbing so many returnees at once. Unemployment is still very high in El Salvador. Economic opportunity is not good, and it's crippled by one of the highest murder rates in the world, and that's due to the organized crime and violent local gangs. And additionally, most people in El Salvador are extremely worried about what will happen when these immigrants are no longer in a position to send money back home to El Salvador. These remittances, the dollars coming back home from relatives abroad, now account for a fifth of El Salvador's GDP. That's a huge loss. GREENE: A fifth of the country's GDP - this the money the people in the U.S. are sending. KAHN: It's about 17 percent, yeah. GREENE: That's incredible. KAHN: It is. GREENE: Well, when TPS ended for Haitians, thousands of Haitians moved to Canada. If this happens and it ends for El Salvador, where - will there be a surge of newcomers to other countries as well or mostly back to El Salvador? KAHN: Well, you're seeing a lot of Salvadorans going south into Costa Rica and also moving north and staying in Mexico as the U.S. seems farther out of reach for many since the Trump era. INSKEEP: You can feel the contradiction just in the name - Temporary Protected Status. It's supposed to be temporary. And yet it's clear when you hear the stories that many people who got that status have tried to make permanent lives here, which raises the dilemma of today. GREENE: And relied on it as something much more than temporary. NPR's Carrie Kahn. Carrie, thanks, we appreciate it. KAHN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. The Golden Globe Awards last night - you know, they were about the awards, of course, but it felt like they last night were about something bigger. INSKEEP: Because this was the first awards show since the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Since then, dozens of other powerful men have faced allegations of sexual misconduct or abuse. (SOUNDBITE OF 75TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS CEREMONY) SETH MYERS: For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: The host there, Seth Meyers, bringing up that topic. All right. The Golden Globes - this all came up as a big showcase for Time's Up, which is a new initiative to fight harassment across all industries and not just Hollywood. NPR's Mandalit del Barco was covering this last night. Hey, Mandalit. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Hey there. GREENE: So how different did this feel from all the award shows that you've covered in the past? DEL BARCO: Well, first of all, not only did all the - almost every actress I saw wear black, but some of them also brought along established activists as their guests. That included the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke. And there was a lot of solidarity between the women that I saw everywhere, from actresses locking arms on the red carpet to a stolen moment backstage I saw where actress Frances McDormand and Saoirse Ronan embraced after they each won awards. I've covered a lot of these shows, and I haven't seen such camaraderie before. And of course, the real question is whether this translates into more jobs and better pay for women in Hollywood and really all industries. You know, Natalie Portman even pointed to this when she introduced the nominees for best director and she said, and here are all the - all male nominees. GREENE: Oh, wow, she was sending a message there. Well, I - it almost feels like an afterthought because of a lot of the power of last night, but there were actually awards given as they are every year. Did any stand out? DEL BARCO: Well, you know, \"Coco,\" a Pixar film about the Mexican Day of the Dead celebration, it won for best animated feature, and Guillermo del Toro, who is from Mexico, he took home the best director award for \"The Shape Of Water.\" And there were some Golden Globes history made last night. Actor Sterling K. Brown won for his role on the TV show \"This Is Us.\" He became the first African-American man to win for acting in a TV drama. GREENE: It feels like this morning all people are writing about, though, is Oprah Winfrey. To what extent did she really steal the show last night? DEL BARCO: She did, and, you know, she also made history. She became the first African-American woman to win the Cecil B. DeMille Award. And that's an honor that's given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and this year in her acceptance speech, she talked about empowering women. It was really the big moment of the night. (SOUNDBITE OF 75TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS CEREMONY) OPRAH WINFREY: So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon. (APPLAUSE) DEL BARCO: And, of course, all of that immediately started a swirl of speculation online and at the awards show about whether or not Oprah Winfrey, the media mogul, might run for president. GREENE: And she has been mentioned before. So, I mean, there were probably some people who were looking for a moment when she would be on a stage saying something that would feed that speculation I guess. DEL BARCO: Right. Oprah for 2020, that's what they were all saying. GREENE: NPR's Mandalit del Barco covering the Golden Globes last night - sounds like a really powerful evening. Mandalit, thanks a lot. We appreciate it. DEL BARCO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF THRUPENCE'S \"FOREST ON THE SUN\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bob Corker called fellow Republicans out on Tuesday for not standing up to President Trump, but those who are breaking with Trump struggled again in Tuesday's primaries.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Republicans who speak out against President Trump are often the ones who have already decided to retire. One of those Republicans is Senator Bob Corker. He objects to the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump is imposing on other countries, including U.S. allies. Here's what Corker said on the Senate floor yesterday about fellow Republicans who are not backing him up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB CORKER: Gosh, we might poke the bear is a language I've been hearing in the hallways. We might poke the bear. The president might get upset with us as United States senators if we vote on the Corker amendment. So we're going to do everything we can to block it. GREENE: Well, one reason why those who confront the president are retiring - Republican voters who are sending a simple message - support President Trump. We saw this again last night. Republicans who distanced themselves from the president are struggling in Republican primary races. And let's talk this through with NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Hi, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there. GREENE: Let's start with Bob Corker, who we heard from there. What message is he trying to send here over tariffs? SNELL: Corker was trying to execute this strategy that would have allowed him to push back on the president by having a check, essentially, letting Congress be the last people to have a say over any tariffs that are issued for national security reasons. Now, that may seem like a very narrow space to be pushing back against the president, but so far, it's the only time we've actually seen Republicans in Congress actually try to press legislation on it. And he is frustrated because leaders basically told him no. And that's kind of been the theme over the past several months is that it's very hard for people in Congress to press back against the president. GREENE: Frustrating as it is for people like Corker who clearly wanted to send a message saying don't be intimidated by this president, there is a political reality that we really seemed to see play out last night. Mark Sanford, South Carolina congressman who survived a major sex scandal if we remember, he could not overcome his own criticism of the president. SNELL: That is true. And it was not criticism necessarily that led to him voting against the president. It was criticism about the way he handled things, the way he spoke. But that was enough to, you know, get an angry tweet from the president saying that people should vote for his opponent, the woman who won, Katie Arrington. And in her speech, she said we are the party of Donald J. Trump. And that has been the message that voters have wanted to hear. The more you can be with the president here, the more voters are happy. Now, the Sanford thing is really interesting because he was - as I was talking to Republicans all over Capitol Hill yesterday before the tweet, they were saying they thought he'd be safe, that he is a conservative guy. He is with the president usually. GREENE: Well, this division within the party over whether to support the president or not, another division playing out has been over the issue of immigration, which the party has really been struggling with. A lot of lawmakers have suggested they might work with Democrats on that issue. It sounds like the party might be coming together around at some sort of deal. SNELL: They are, and it fits with the theme we've been talking about. There was a group of Republicans who were going - trying to get this discharge petition, this thing to say that leadership doesn't know best and they should vote on an immigration deal with Democrats. Well, they fell two signatures short, and now leaders are talking about voting on something that largely aligns with what President Trump wants - the four pillars on immigration and, you know, a more moderate version that would support the DREAM Act. But they don't expect that DREAM Act to pass. GREENE: All right. NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell reporting on a fascinating political dynamic in this election year. Kelsey, thanks a lot.

When we set out to try to look back on the year that was in politics, we started with a list that grew ... and grew ... and grew. After a couple of days, the list was just shy of 100 news events. That's about one notable story every three days. Yes, it's been that kind of year. So we narrowed the list to 50 and asked readers on social media to pick what they thought were the 10 most important political stories of the year. Because voting took place last week, some important developments didn't make the cut, like, for example, Ret. Gen. Jim Mattis resigning as Pentagon chief, Trump pulling U.S. troops out of Syria or Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Here are the top 10 most selected stories \u2014 by you the readers \u2014 with No. 1 being the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testifying before Congress Sept. 27.\n                \n                    \n                    The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testifying before Congress Sept. 27. For all the news that happened in 2018, there might not have been a more emotional day than Sept. 27. A reluctant witness accuses a man nominated for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of sexual assault while they were in high school decades ago, and the nominee then lashes out with a defiant defense and partisan testimony. From there, senators and onlookers retreated into political corners. The saga dragged on for more than a week, as a retiring Republican senator defected from party ranks, calling for a further FBI investigation \u2014 and eventually voting for the nominee. It was another cultural wound in the Trump era that has highlighted massive fissures in the American populace. Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer approach microphones outside the White House after a contentious meeting with President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer approach microphones outside the White House after a contentious meeting with President Trump. A blue wave crashed ashore in 2018. Democrats will have control of the U.S. House once again come January because of an uprising in the suburbs and among women and independents. They helped Democrats net 40 seats, the most in any election for Democrats in a generation, since just after Watergate. It was a remarkable accomplishment that will have massive consequences for President Trump, with incoming Democratic committee chairmen preparing subpoenas and about to ramp up investigations of the Trump administration, the president's businesses and perhaps even his personal finances. David Hogg, Parkland shooting victim and survior (center), joins Manuel Oliver and his wife, Patricia Oliver, parents of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin Oliver.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Hogg, Parkland shooting victim and survior (center), joins Manuel Oliver and his wife, Patricia Oliver, parents of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin Oliver. In February, tragedy struck again at the hands of a mass shooter, at yet another school \u2014 this time, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen people were killed. But instead of fading into the background as other shootings have, the event led many of the students who survived to take center stage and become politically involved. There were mass walkouts at schools and marches across the country. Under political pressure, many states, including Florida, passed gun control measures. There has been little movement at the federal level \u2014 though the Trump Justice Department did ban bump stocks. In the 2018 election, 10 percent of voters said guns were the most important issue facing the country, according to exit polls, and 70 percent of those voters voted for Democrats. By 59 percent to 37 percent, voters said they support stricter gun control measures, and the new House may well take up the issue. Still, nothing divides Americans quite like gun ownership.

Trump took his hard-line immigration views to another level of controversy with this policy. It has been an issue of moral outrage for many Americans, as overwhelming numbers of Democrats and a majority of independents were against it, making for a very unpopular policy. It's yet another issue that led to consequences at the ballot box for Republicans. Thousands of migrant children remain detained in the U.S., mostly those who arrived unaccompanied, not those separated from parents, with doctors warning of short- and long-term repercussions for the children emotionally.

A record number of women ran, were nominated for the House and won in 2018. More women than ever \u2014 127 \u2014 will serve in Congress this January (adding in Republican Martha McSally, who was appointed to fill a Senate vacancy in Arizona). But this was not a bipartisan phenomenon \u2014 106 of the women are Democrats, and Republicans will have fewer women in Congress next year. In the previously dubbed \"Year of the Woman\" in 1992, after the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, 24 non-incumbent women were elected to the House; in 2018, it was 36 (35 Democrats and just one Republican), according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics. It's an improvement, but women will still make up less than a quarter of Congress, despite being more than a majority of the electorate. A record number of women will serve in state legislatures, too, up to 29 percent from 25 percent of all state-level seats across the country. Turnout in the 2018 election was 50.3 percent (and could go higher when all votes are counted), according to the U.S. Election Project at the University of Florida. That is higher than at any time since 1914. There are still other states that have yet to report their write-in votes for the \"highest office\" or their total ballots counted. The current turnout rate of 50.3% may yet edge up slightly. And I will continue to update the VEP denominator as new data become available That tells you something about the level of opposition to Trump in this year's election that saw a backlash to his policies, demeanor and approach. Voters were saying, at higher rates than in past elections, that the president was a factor in their vote. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll just before the election found that roughly two-thirds of voters saw Trump as at least a minor factor, 20 points higher than those who said so of President Barack Obama in 2014. And: \"47 percent of voters said their opinion of Trump makes them more likely to vote for a Democrat for Congress, while 34 percent said their opinion of Trump makes them more likely to vote for a Republican.\" Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stands with the defense minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman, moments after the Indian dignitary arrived at the Pentagon earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stands with the defense minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman, moments after the Indian dignitary arrived at the Pentagon earlier this month. Trump has topped past presidents for senior staff turnover \u2014 and that record was set as far back as March, as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported. At least 34 top people left the White House, the administration or Trump's close orbit in 2018, according to a CNN count and adding in Mattis, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and White House chief of staff John Kelly. There has been scandal within the administration, like at the Environmental Protection Agency with its former head Scott Pruitt, as well as with Zinke. Mattis' resignation was a stinging rebuke to the president. The secretary of defense was the first Cabinet official to bow out with sharp criticisms of the commander in chief since perhaps Cyrus Vance as Jimmy Carter's secretary of state, NPR's Tom Bowman has noted. What all the turnover tells you is that Trump's White House is becoming increasingly insular, kind of how the Trump Organization was run: one person that matters most, with a small circle of advisers and family around him. Voters, especially African-Americans in some places, waited in lines for hours in parts of Georgia. That was combined with aggressive voter roll purge efforts by Republican Brian Kemp, the governor-elect who ran while serving as secretary of state. Election Protection, a nonpartisan voter rights coalition led by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, issued a report about the 2018 elections earlier this month and noted: \"Voters in 2018 faced widespread attempts at voter suppression and disenfranchisement across the country \u2014 obstacles that made voting more difficult or impossible. Election Protection kept track of the top barriers to the vote in 2018, which included: long lines due to poor staffing, insufficient materials, and faulty voting machines problems; aggressive voter registration purges or failure to process applications; poor poll-worker training; restrictive voting identification requirements; and failure to receive or count absentee ballots. The root causes of these barriers are burdensome and arbitrary voting laws and policies, lack of planning and investment by election administration, and racism and xenophobia.\" Democrat Stacey Abrams lost a contentious race for governor of Georgia to Kemp by roughly 55,000 votes. Despite a strong economy and no wars where troops and artillery are being poured in at high numbers, the United States' federal deficit jumped to $779 billion by the end of the fiscal year in October. A big reason: those GOP tax cuts. As NPR's Scott Horsley reported: \"The government is expected to borrow more than a trillion dollars in the coming year, in part to make up for tax receipts that have been slashed by GOP tax cuts. Corporate tax collections fell by 31 percent in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, despite robust corporate profits. That's hardly surprising after lawmakers cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21.\" Judges were a big reason the Republican base rallied around President Trump. He has not only delivered two conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices, one of whom replaced the court's swing justice, but he is also reshaping the federal judiciary. With the help of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Trump has continued to get a big number of federal judges confirmed \u2014 29 appeals court judges and 53 district court judges, as of Nov. 15, all lifetime appointments. About three-quarters of Trump's nominees have been men; about 4 in 5 have been white; and they don't rank as highly qualified by the American Bar Association when compared with Obama's nominees.

Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, exits federal court Dec. 12 in New York City after being sentenced to three years in prison.\n                \n                    \n                    Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, exits federal court Dec. 12 in New York City after being sentenced to three years in prison. We're including this because it came very close to being in the top 10 \u2014 just two votes short. What happened this year is remarkable. President Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, and a host of others were found guilty as a result of charges stemming from the Mueller Russia probe. Cohen, after pleading guilty to tax evasion, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, was sentenced to three years in prison earlier this month. He is also cooperating with the feds and said he is determined not to be the \"villain\" of the Trump story. He accused the president of knowing the truth, that Trump directed Cohen to make illegal payments to two women Trump allegedly had affairs with in order to help the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. (Trump has acknowledged payment to one of the two women but denies the underlying allegations of sexual relationships with both women.) It's a remarkable turn of events, given there was no greater Trump defender in 2016 than Cohen. And who knows what's to come in 2019.",

Steve King attends a rally earlier this year on the East Front of the Capitol to highlight crimes committed by illegal immigrants in the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King attends a rally earlier this year on the East Front of the Capitol to highlight crimes committed by illegal immigrants in the U.S. Rep. Steve King, the Iowa Republican known for hard-line stances on immigration and for controversial remarks, challenged a conservative magazine to release audio to prove that he had compared immigrants to \"dirt.\" So The Weekly Standard did. The magazine reported last week that King, who won re-election earlier this month despite being called out for his white nationalist views, made the incendiary comment. On Friday, King tweeted in response that the magazine had joined HuffPost \"at the bottom of the lying journalistic gutter.\" He claimed the article's reporter was lying: \"Just release the full tape. Leftists lies exist without original sources because they are false and manufactured accusations,\" he tweeted. Rachael @RachaelBL Just release the full tape. Leftists lies exist without original sources because they are false and manufactured accusations. Weekly Standard is transitioning into \u201cAntifa News\u201d. https://t.co/oeoQ0c2QJ2 The Standard on Saturday published a YouTube video containing the audio to the article. \"We stand by the story,\" the magazine's Editor-in-Chief Stephen Hayes said. The tape was reportedly recorded during a campaign stop on Nov. 5 while King bantered with supporters in a restaurant. King discussed his \"patented pheasant noodle soup\" that includes a sprinkle of homegrown jalape\u00f1o peppers. Talking about those peppers, he said: KING: I raised a bunch this year, and they didn't have enough bite. So I guess I'm going to have to go get some dirt from Mexico to grow the next batch. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Trust me, it's on its way. KING: Well, yeah, there's plenty of dirt. It's coming from West Coast, too, and a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we've ever seen. The unidentified woman's comments are seemingly about the caravan of Central American migrants currently headed to the U.S. to seek asylum. As the conservative magazine said (emphasis theirs), \"Iowa does have a topsoil depletion problem, but it's hard to imagine that the audience and King were discussing the shipment of soil from out of country or from California.\" King's chief of staff, Sarah Stevens, told The Washington Post that King thought the woman was referring to the \"leftist media\" when she mentioned dirt \u2014 not immigrants. \"We quoted Representative King at length, on purpose, to provide readers with all of the context for his remarks,\" reads an editor's note on the article. \"Steve King never mentions the media in his remarks. To claim he was referring to the media when he worried about 'dirt' coming from Mexico is absurd.\" The Weekly Standard remains, proudly, a reporting-driven, conservative journal of opinion. @RubensteinAdam is a great reporter. There are no lies, willful or otherwise. The story is accurate and very well told. Our reporting wouldn't focus on your bigotry if you weren't a bigot. https://t.co/5K7Ace22Eq King's views aren't exactly a secret \u2014 on immigration, he said on Twitter last year, \"We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.\" In August, King did an interview with Austria's Freedom Party \u2014 which was founded by a former Nazi officer \u2014 in which he talked about the apparent decline of Western civilization and claimed immigrants are replacing white Europeans. Some top Republicans including Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, have distanced themselves from King after the Pittsburgh shooting in a synagogue that saw 11 dead brought more attention to the lawmaker.",

            "article_content": "\"Hate comes in many forms,\" Arjun Singh Sethi writes in American Hate, a collection of victims' testimonials. Survivors Speak Out by Arjun Singh Sethi Hardcover, 192 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Sethi, a Sikh American, is an activist lawyer and law professor who has become \"sensitive to the rising tide of hate violence.\" We should not be surprised by this rise, he says, since \"Trump told us who he was a long time ago... a racist and a sexist ... his ideologies are white supremacy and greed. He is the hater-in-chief...\" To compile American Hate: Survivors Speak Out, Sethi travels the country, interviewing survivors of hate. He focuses on women and young people, noting that women of color are \"the front lines \u2014 mobilizing, resisting, and protecting our communities from state and public harm.\" Sethi discovers two truths. The first he finds is that to \"move past hate\" we need the counsel of marginalized people and of the survivors themselves. And the second is that community responses to survivors' suffering contain the roots of hope and action. Amid the ugly realities of contemporary America, American Hate affirms our courage and inspiration, opening a roadmap to reconciliation by means of the victims' own words. In American Hate, there is Taylor Dumpson, the first black female president of American University's student body. The daughter of two educators, Dumpson was raised in Salisbury, Maryland, home to Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. At AU, she watches racist taunts intensify on campus with social media threats like, \"If you bring the ropes, I'll bring the fire.\" In response to these types of incidents, the killing of innocent black people at the hands of police, and the election of Donald Trump, Dumpson decides to run for president to \"do everything in [her] power to help underrepresented students at AU find their place there.\" The day after Dumpson's election, in at least three locations on campus, bananas are found hanging from nooses initialed with the historically black sorority to which she belongs. Fearing for her life, she pulls the blinds in her dorm room and hides, later to be diagnosed with PTSD. But Dumpson ultimately finds her voice. \"I can tell you that every act of love and compassion mattered,\" she says. \"Diverse students from so many different communities rallied to condemn hate on campus.\" Dumpson realizes that \"White supremacists aren't coming for one of us. They're coming for all of us.\" Racism and hatred \"are as old as this country,\" she says, reflecting Sethi's own grounding words: \"...we must begin by acknowledging that this country was built on a hate crime.... Native people ... were displaced and exterminated to make room for Christians and Europeans. Land theft, slavery, segregation, xenophobia, and exclusion are defining features of our history.\" Dumpson cautions us to \"tackle the roots of racism, including white supremacy, and remember that Trump exploit[s] long-standing racist and anti-black sentiment.\" We ignore our founding sins at our peril. She echoes her forebears in the struggle with this commanding message: \"Only when the most vulnerable among us are free, will we all be free. Only then will we rise.\" Sethi also profiles the Jabara family, Lebanese Americans who own a catering business in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their virulently anti-Muslim neighbor runs over Mrs. Haifa Jabara, causing \"major injuries and head trauma: a broken hand, shoulder, ribs, ankle, nose, and a collapsed lung.\" Despite the family's desperate pleas, the neighbor is released on bond only to murder the Jabara's son and brother, Khalid. \"My sweet brother had a heart of gold,\" says Victoria of Khalid \u2014 which means \"eternal\" in Arabic. The Jabaras are Christians who fled Lebanon's civil war. Taking the moral high ground, they refuse to state publicly that they are not Muslim because \"none of that should matter.\" In light of fear propagated by the Trump administration, the Jabaras urge the all-importance of community \u2014 as Victoria Jabara states: \"[Our] family is part of so many communities \u2014 Lebanese, Christians, Tulsans, and others. We're active in these communities, and it's the reason we were able to survive this tragedy. The guy next door didn't have a community...the point is that we have this cultural sickness and the only way to combat is through forging community.\" Sethi profiles gay people, people of Syrian, Lebanese, and African descent, Native Americans, and Jews \u2014 all victims of fear, misconception, and prejudice. He concludes that \"...the purpose of hate is to silence. It seeks to subjugate and exterminate, and to do away with difference and uniqueness.\" Read American Hate for the faces Sethi puts on our national hate epidemic, and for his sobering account of the fallout \u2014 humiliation, terror, injury, and death. But read American Hate, as well, for what the last chapter terms \"Hope in a Time of Despair.\" Hate may be rampant in America, but so are its antidotes: We must understand and own our history. We must speak out, for in community is power and love. Martha Anne Toll is the Executive Director of the Butler Family Fund; her writing is at www.marthaannetoll.com.

            "article_content": "Six Dissidents, Five Continents, and the Art of Resistance by Natalie Hopkinson Hardcover, 189 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? When I first started reading Natalie Hopkinson's A Mouth Is Always Muzzled: Six Dissidents, Five Continents, and the Art of Resistance, I found myself ricocheting between bewilderment and frustration. I consider myself a pretty well-informed person with more than a passing knowledge of the histories of oppressed people, but I couldn't make it more than a few paragraphs without wondering, \"How could I not know this?\" Although it spans five continents, A Mouth Is Always Muzzled uses Hopkinson's ancestral land of Guyana as its jumping off point and narrative center. Surprising facts about the country abound: Who knew that when Guyana gained independence from Britain in 1966, the British government paid 20 million pounds (16.5 billion pounds in today's currency) in reparations to former slaveholders? Not me. Who knew that the United States cut aid to the country from $18 million in 1968 to $200,000 in 1974 in retaliation for Guyana's decision to become a \"cooperative republic\"? I certainly didn't. Sure, I'd known that the Haitian Revolution began with a slave rebellion and ended with the establishment of the first free Black republic in the world. I'd had no idea that in Guyana a full 40 years prior, an enslaved Akan man named Cuffy led 5,000 people in the hemisphere's most successful slave revolt up to that point. He ruled the area for almost a year before the Dutch reclaimed power. More striking than what I didn't know about the history of Guyana was how little I knew about its present day reality. Sitting near the northeastern tip of South America, Guyana is one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere. Its residents are descended from African slaves, the indentured servants who replaced them after abolition and the smaller population of its longest-term inhabitants, the Amerindian community. It has the highest suicide rate in the world. This was all news to me. Hopkinson suggests I'm not alone in my ignorance of the country though, noting that \"fifty years after independence, Guyana has virtually fallen off the global map.\" That may be about to change. ExxonMobil recently located a cache of oil and gas worth over $200 billion off the country's coast. What this oil discovery will mean for the Guyanese people \u2013 and who among them will benefit \u2014 remains to be seen. Neither strictly history, biography, art criticism, travelogue, nor manifesto, the book manages to combine all of those approaches to create a strikingly detailed portrait of a country seeking to define itself. A Mouth Is Always Muzzled interrogates this question alongside others about the role of the artist in shaping politics, culture, and the future itself. Neither strictly history, biography, art criticism, travelogue, nor manifesto, the book manages to combine all of those approaches to create a strikingly detailed portrait of a country seeking to define itself. Of the six dissidents of Hopkinson's subtitle, we spend the most time with two artists she visits before a major election in 2015. The first is an Indo-Guyanese painter, Bernadette Persaud, a Baby Boomer whose perspectives of pre- and post-colonial rule leave her skeptical of the possibility of positive change. Persaud stands in contrast with a millennial poet, Ruel Johnson, whose conviction that change is possible results in an activism that consumes virtually his every waking hour. (And given that his views run counter to the Guyanese government's, that work comes with a not insignificant risk of political assassination \u2013 at one point, his girlfriend considers leaving him and Hopkinson, meeting him at a caf\u00e9, asks to change their seating so that they are both facing the door.) Hopkinson's engagement with Persaud and Johnson, as well as her reflections on the other four dissidents of the title \u2014 Kara Walker, John Berger, Walter Rodney, and Martin Carter \u2014 lets her explore everything from how a country recovers from colonialism to how dissidents handle the very real mortal threats associated with challenging those in political power. While Hopkinson gives substantially less time to these individuals, she succeeds in linking them all to the broader themes of the book and to the history of the land itself. Visiting artist Kara Walker's work, \"Sugar Sphinx,\" a 40-foot-tall sculpture, molded from sugar and \"part mammy, part sphinx,\" gives Hopkinson the opportunity to reflect on the specific ways empires are built on the backs of black women \u2014 like those toiling in Guyana's sugar plantations. We learn about British author John Berger's denouncement of the esteemed Booker Prize after tracing its roots to the Booker family's profiteering from Guyana's slave trade. Hopkinson's examinations of the Guyanese activist and scholar, Walter Rodney \u2014 who was assassinated \u2014 and Guyanese poet Martin Carter allows her to explore the tension between the state and revolutionary thought and art. Ultimately, there are far more questions than answers in Hopkinson's book, and that's as it should be. Her writing seems designed to provoke thought and inquiry as much as it is to inform. We do learn, at the book's end, who wins the 2015 national election. Other, larger, questions remain unanswered. What does post-colonial nation-building look like in a country still dealing with \"the unfinished work of liberation after Empire?\" What's the role of art in shaping a brighter, yet-unimagined future? When faced with police brutality, racism, xenophobia, and economic oppression, \"How much do we tolerate?\" she asks. \"How far are we willing to go to get free?\" Ericka Taylor is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in Bloom, The Millions, and Willow Springs.",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama speaks in Johannesburg to mark the centennial of the birth of Nelson Mandela. Obama has said Mandela inspired his political career; there was also a cautionary element to the speech.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Former President Barack Obama is delivering a speech as we speak in South Africa to mark the centennial of the birth of Nelson Mandela. It is one of Obama's most high-profile appearances since leaving the White House 18 months ago. He warned that what he called the politics of fear are on the move. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: With each day's news cycles bringing more heads spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. GREENE: Let's get some perspective on this speech from NPR's Scott Horsley, who has been listening in. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, David. GREENE: So this speech today was not supposed to be overtly political, and Obama has said that Nelson Mandela was really the inspiration for his own political career, right? So it has to be quite a moment for him to be giving this speech. What was his overall message? HORSLEY: Well, it was in general a hopeful speech. Hope is obviously a part of the Obama brand. He talked about developments over the last century, the spread of opportunity and prosperity. And he talked about how that was sort of symbolized in that moment almost three decades ago when Mandela was released from prison just a couple of months after the Berlin Wall came down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: You'll remember that feeling. It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. GREENE: Wow. So this really was a celebration of Mandela's legacy on the eve of what would have been his 100th birthday. But it sounds, though, like Obama also wanted to use this to sort of give a cautionary message, right? HORSLEY: Absolutely. He said those progressive forces were not inexorable and that even as prosperity and democracy spread, inequality and insecurity came with it. And as a result, he said, around the turn of the century there were a lot of people who missed what would turn out to be a powerful political backlash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business. HORSLEY: And that older way of doing business, he said, is characterized by strongman politics, by authoritarianism, by tribalism and xenophobia. The former president did not mention the current President Donald Trump by name, but clearly Trump is emblematic of the movement that Obama was describing here. GREENE: Interesting. Deciding not to bring up the name of his successor directly but talking more thematically. But I guess there's no hiding what he was sort of addressing there. HORSLEY: That's right. And this is not the first time Obama has done this. He has generally kept a low profile since he left office, but there have been some exceptions. For example, just a little over a year ago, Obama engaged in a conversation near the Brandenburg Gate in Germany with Chancellor Merkel where he hit on many of these same themes. This has been a long-standing concern for Obama. We heard it in his own exit speech. We heard it in his final address to the United Nations. His story is that the progressives have a story to tell, but they can't take their progress for granted and they need to make that case. And we expect we'll be hearing more from Obama making that case this fall as we get closer to the midterm elections. GREENE: The midterm elections that are very important to his party. All right.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has made her entrance into the 2018 campaign, but not by choice. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee's name is nowhere on the ballot this year, but that's not stopping some Republicans from using her words, her image and her gaffes to energize the GOP base. At a conference in Mumbai, India, earlier this month, Clinton spoke candidly about her loss to Trump and made some controversial comments about his supporters, saying they were motivated by racial and gender intolerance. Clinton summed up Trump's argument, as she saw it. \"You know, you didn't like black people getting rights. You don't like women getting jobs. You don't want to see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are,\" Clinton said. \"Whatever your problem is, I'm gonna solve it.\" Clinton apologized for her remarks in a lengthy Facebook post on Saturday, in which she said, \"I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be misinterpreted. I meant no disrespect to any individual or group.\" But that's not stopping Republicans from running with her remarks. Clinton's comments were quickly seized upon by Republicans, eager to have one of their favorite foils back in the spotlight ahead of the midterms. And now a new ad from Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley, the leading Republican in the race to challenge Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., for reelection, uses Clinton's \"backwards\" comments to suggest she other Democrats like McCaskill look down on Missourians. The state voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016 by about 19 percent. The ad begins with footage of Clinton in India describing her 2016 loss. \"If you look at a map of the United States, there's all that red in the middle where Trump won,\" she begins. The ad then shows McCaskill's early and enthusiastic support for Clinton. It continues with Clinton in India saying, \"I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic moving forward. And his whole campaign was looking backwards. You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women getting jobs, you don't want to see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are, whatever your problem is ... He stirred that up\" The ad ends by declaring that \"this is what Claire McCaskill and 'her president' think of you.\" Clinton is a potentially valuable asset for the GOP in a year when Democratic enthusiasm appears to be surpassing Republicans, in addition to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. And Republicans are eager to suggest Clinton's comments are evidence of how Democrats are out-of-touch with middle America. Bitter Hillary Clinton trashes America\u2019s Heartland, calls states that didn\u2019t vote for her \u201cbackwards\u201d https://t.co/domiT7Puqe pic.twitter.com/zhMEGN29p5 Many Democrats were quick to distance themselves from their party's 2016 nominee and her recent comments. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said Clinton's comments about Trump voters were incorrect. \"My friend Hillary Clinton is wrong. Thirty percent of the people that voted for Donald Trump had voted for President Obama,\" Durbin told Fox News Sunday. Clinton's comments were reminiscent of one of her biggest missteps during the 2016 election when she described half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\" at a fundraiser. Clinton said they were \"racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u2014you name it.\" She later apologized for that criticism. But not before the Trump campaign had appropriated it. The campaign relished the \"deplorable\" label and used it as a badge of honor to remind voters of what Clinton thought about them. Clinton has largely stayed out of the limelight, and is reportedly planning a discreet midterm campaign strategy.",

Kansas cannot require people to prove their U.S. citizenship before they can vote, a federal judge says, ruling that the state's election law is unconstitutional. The judge sharply criticized Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has based much of his political career on worries about voter fraud. Chief District Judge Julie A. Robinson sanctioned Kobach \u2014 who led President Trump's voter fraud commission \u2014 by ordering him to take a legal class on the rules of evidence or procedure. Kobach represented his office and was the lead attorney in the case. The judge said Kobach failed to show there had been a \"substantial number\" of people who managed to register to vote in Kansas without being U.S. citizens. Starting in 2013, people who wanted to vote in Kansas needed to produce documents proving their U.S. citizenship, such as a driver's license, birth certificate, naturalization papers, a passport. Robinson said that law violated the National Voter Registration Act and the 14th Amendment, in a 118-page ruling that decided two consolidated cases. Kansas had already required voters to be U.S. citizens \u2014 but before 2013, people were able to satisfy that rule by affirming their eligibility on their registration application. Kobach was a driving force behind the change. The trial, which concluded in March, was his chance to show it was based on real concerns and would protect elections in Kansas from fraud. Heading into the trial, Kobach said that since 1999, his office had confirmed 127 cases of noncitizens who had either registered to vote or attempted to do so. Of that number, 43 had succeeded in registering and 11 had voted. Those figures were just \"the tip of the iceberg,\" Kobach had vowed. But after reviewing the state's evidence and hearing from its experts, Robinson concluded that \"there is no iceberg; only an icicle, largely created by confusion and administrative error.\" Robinson noted that Kansas is a state with some 1.8 million registered voters \u2014 and that the number of people in Kansas who aren't U.S. citizens who either registered to vote or tried to do so is 0.6 percent of the state's noncitizen population. Based on the evidence, the judge ruled, Kansas' interests in preventing fraud, while legitimate, are \"not strong enough to outweigh the tangible and quantifiable burden on eligible voter registration applicants in Kansas who were not registered to vote before January 1, 2013.\" The new law also complicated the process for \"motor voter\" applicants, who might not have brought the proper citizenship documents when they applied for or renewed a driver's license. Kansas drivers are required to provide proof of lawful presence when they apply for their first license. As the judge wrote in her ruling, \"Of the 30,732 applicants whose applications were, as of March 31, 2016, suspended or canceled due to failure to provide [documentation], approximately 75 percent were motor-voter applicants.\" The American Civil Liberties Union led the legal challenge to the Kansas law. \"That law was based on a xenophobic lie that noncitizens are engaged in rampant election fraud,\" said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project. \"The court found that there is 'no credible evidence' for that falsehood and correctly ruled that Kobach's documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement violates federal law and the U.S. Constitution.\" During the trial, Kobach \"denied allegations of voter suppression and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates,\" as Celia Llopis-Jepsen of the Kansas News Service reported for NPR. The plaintiffs included the League of Women Voters of Kansas, which said it had struggled to help young voters register because of the new law. Some applicants were unable or unwilling to show their papers to a volunteer, the league said. Others balked at the time investment, after the process went from taking less than five minutes to requiring a full hour. The organization also said it was forced to halt nearly all of its operations so it could change its protocols. The main concern: that volunteers might somehow be found liable if they handled or copied applicants' citizenship documents and other records. For instance, a voter registration drive at Washburn University yielded 400 voter applicants \u2014 but most were incomplete and, after weeks of effort, only around 75 voters were registered. The evidence, Robinson wrote, backed up an expert's opinion that Kansas' law \"disproportionately affects the young and those who are not politically affiliated.\" Another issue: Before the league could help would-be voters finish the registration process, it had to buy the \"suspense list\" from the secretary of state's office \u2013 something it did several times. It also purchased the full list of voters, to verify who was on it. In sanctioning Kobach, the judge gave the secretary of state roughly one year to provide proof of the additional training, which would be part of the mandatory continuing legal education classes that many attorneys take to maintain their law licenses. Robinson cited \"a pattern and practice by [Kobach of flouting] disclosure and discovery rules that are designed to prevent prejudice and surprise at trial. It's unclear, she said, whether he \"repeatedly failed to meet his disclosure obligations intentionally or due to his unfamiliarity with the federal rules.\" Kobach, we'll note, is a Harvard graduate who earned his law degree at Yale and was a law clerk at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. He also taught constitutional law as a professor at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, according to his official biography. The ruling comes two months after the judge found Kobach in contempt of court for disobeying her order to allow some potentially ineligible voters to remain eligible to cast a ballot under a preliminary injunction. Kobach is running for governor in Kansas' current election season, locked in a tight Republican primary race against incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer \u2014 who rose to the office after former Gov. Sam Brownback won confirmation as the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom.",

Torra avoided promising to obey the constitution. A supporter of Catalan secession has become the new leader of the restive region in Spain, in a ceremony that didn't mention any loyalty to the Spanish constitution or the Spanish king, El Pais reports. Catalonia's stymied bid for independence last fall has triggered a monthslong deadlock \u2014 a crisis that sometimes feels like it's unfolding in slow motion. Spain dissolved the regional government after ousting separatist regional President Carles Puigdemont and other leaders. Madrid had direct control of the region for months. Now, Quim Torra's swearing-in brings an end to that era \u2014 but signals that there's no end in sight to the larger separatist fight. In February, NPR's Lauren Frayer recapped the story so far: \"Catalonia has its own language\u00a0and culture, and has long sought autonomy from the rest of Spain. It's Spain's richest region, and when the country's economic crisis hit a decade ago, many Catalans began to resent their tax money subsidizing poorer parts of Spain. Separatist politics moved from the fringe to the mainstream. ... \"This past autumn saw turmoil in Catalonia and its regional capital Barcelona, with daily street protests, general strikes and\u00a0violence at polling stations Oct. 1, when separatists held an illegal independence vote and the central government deployed riot police to halt it. Madrid imposed emergency rule, firing local lawmakers and forcing fresh elections. \"Carles Puigdemont, the ex-president, went into exile in Belgium. Several of his aides went to jail. \"Tourism slumped. Thousands of companies moved their bases \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 out of Catalonia and into neighboring regions deemed more stable. \"After all that, Catalans\u00a0voted in December for virtually the same regional parliament: A slim majority, 70 of 135 seats, was voted in for separatist parties. A quirky electoral system means rural votes count more than urban ones. But opinion polls show Catalans are roughly divided 50-50 on the question of independence.\" With the secessionists back in power, Puidgemont first proposed governing Catalonia from exile, via Skype. That idea didn't fly. Then he suggested a pro-secession candidate, but he was disqualified because he was jailed by Madrid. An alternate leader was proposed, and promptly arrested by Spanish authorities. Finally Puidgemont nominated Torra, who shares his separatist goals and had the advantage of being neither exiled nor incarcerated. Torra says he intends to put Puidgemont back in power, Reuters reports. \"I see myself as a caretaker president,\" Torra said, according to the wire service. Torra was narrowly elected as the region's new regional leader, on Monday, El Pais reports. His swearing-in included the Catalan flag but not the Spanish flag, and no members of the Spanish central government attended. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Madrid are considering charging Torra with hate speech for his allegedly xenophobic statements about Spaniards. The remarks include calling people \"beasts\" and saying that the Spanish \"know only how to plunder,\" The Guardian reports.",

Organizers are rallying in Las Vegas this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Shannon Stapleton/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hundreds of thousands gathered in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 21, 2017 for the Women's March. Organizers are rallying in Las Vegas this year. On Sunday, people around the country will mark one year since the Women's March on Washington, D.C. Last year it brought hundreds of thousands of liberals to the capital, many wearing pink knitted caps in solidarity. Others marched in hundreds of cities and towns across the United States and more than 80 other countries. Last year's march was definitively in protest of President Trump, coming just a day after his inauguration. A year on, the organizers of that national march are marking the anniversary with a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday as more than 300 towns and cities organize their own anniversary marches and rallies through the weekend. With midterm elections approaching, the theme this year is less outrage and more organizing, dubbed \"Power to the Polls.\" National and local organizers say they chose Las Vegas because it is an example of successful grass-roots progressive organizing. In 2016, Nevadans elected the country's first Latina senator, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. \"It was more important for us to create an event somewhere strategic to reflect the work that needed to be done in 2018. And Nevada is an example of a battleground state that went for Hillary Clinton and went blue in 2016,\" says Bob Bland, co-founder of the original march. \"There are a record number of women running for local office and then also for state and governorship and there are competitive Senate races. We want to uplift that local work on a national scale on Jan 21.\" Nevada, she says, is just the beginning. The Women's March organizers will be holding rallies in 10 other swing states. The anniversary marches and rallies come in the midst of a movement against sexual violence. Women who wrote to NPR from across the country say they are marching this weekend to express concerns about immigration policies, environmental policies, women's rights, the gender pay gap, health care and more. But mostly they're doing it to show they are a powerful voice that wants to get more women like them into positions of power at the local, state and national level, they say. That, Bland says, is the point: getting people to vote and removing barriers to voting for marginalized communities. \"If people mobilized a bus to the Women's March, they can also organize transportation routes to make sure people from low-income housing in their community can get to the polls,\" she says. \"There's a lot of different ways that all of the organizing work, all the education we've done during the 2017 resistance, can be converted to our collective power at the polls.\" Emily's List, an organization that coaches Democratic women on running for office, says it has trained more than 26,000 women to run for local, state and national office. Its motto: \"You marched. Now run.\" The march last year was criticized for being a crowd of mostly white, liberal women. Organizers say the aim this year is to harness the grass-roots work they did over the past year to represent a cross section of America, including people of color, LGBTQ people, the disenfranchised and women across the country. \"Diversity does not come without intention and it doesn't come without authentic relationship-building. And that is something that takes time,\" Bland says. \"We are making those changes and we are making a lot of progress. But this is work that we have to commit to every day. And white women in particular have to take responsibility for holding each other accountable to creating open, welcome spaces where communities of color know they are listened to.\" The roster of speakers in Las Vegas is a who's who of liberal politicians, celebrities and civil rights activists. They include Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Alicia Garza, actress Marisa Tomei, several female congresswomen including Masto, and the four co-chairs of the Women's March. While organizers say conservative women are welcome, many conservatives say they don't feel welcome at the marches and rallies because of their political leanings or support for the president. After all, organizers openly call themselves \"the resistance.\" Why you march We asked women to write to us and tell us why they marched last year and what they march for this year. Here's a sampling of what they had to say: \"For my mother, my ancestors, for those who cannot, for myself, for my nieces. To show the rest of the red state of Tennessee that women's rights are not just BLUE, they are all encompassing. You don't have to be a Democrat to support women. And just because you support Republican values doesn't mean you're against women. It's a human thing. This idea needs to change.\" \u2014 Melissa Shah of Nashville, Tenn. She plans to march in Nashville. \"Protections for the environment have been undermined, racist and xenophobic policies have been proposed. This is an election year, and we have the chance to truly let our voices be heard.\" \u2014 Julie Albert of Anchorage, Alaska. She plans to march there. \"After coming out of my shell as a brown female I've realized that women love to be feminists when it is only convenient for them \u2014 this meaning until it has to do with people of color, LGBTQ and any other forms of internationalism that there is a lack of inclusion from white women. Women of color and those who identify are still having to push themselves into spaces where they belong in the first place because feminism is about equality for all but that message seems to be lost.\" \u2014 Sanjana Stein of Denver, Colo. She marched last year in Washington, D.C., but this year has chosen not to participate. \"Now more than ever we need to speak up, show up and be active citizens. My adopted 16-year-old daughter is a biracial Latina, and I am attending the Women's March again, alongside her, in order to show her that our voices matter, and that the power of a strong, intelligent and diverse population is what makes America worth protecting.\" \u2014 Andrea Morgan of Ovando, Mont. She will march in Missoula, Mont. \"Last year's march was incredibly impactful and resonated with women internationally. After the march I felt empowered, and I was driven to be more politically and civically active. This year, I have been selected to speak on the #MeToo movement in our local march and I could not be more proud to call my fellow townspeople to action on issues that are important to me and many others. This march is focusing in large part on civic engagement and I hope to be inspired to do more and inspire others to engage in local and state elections, not just national elections.\" \u2014 Elisabeth Malloy of Statesboro, Ga. She will march in her hometown as she did last year. \"I am transgender and I'm furious. I'm tired of blatant disrespect ... I feel if I did not attend the Women's March when I am fully able to and free then I would be failing my duty to my community, fellow minority communities, and myself. I will not surrender to discrimination.\" \u2014 Coryn Rinta of Boston. She will march in Providence, R.I.",

It has been more than 100 days since Germany headed to the polls \u2014 but the next handful of days might matter more than all of them combined. Since late September \u2014 when German voters handed Chancellor Angela Merkel a fourth term, albeit without giving her party an outright majority \u2014 the country has teetered without a new formal government. Unable to win the support of another party for a governing coalition yet, Merkel is now staring down the possibility that the monthslong standoff may force a new election entirely. Enter: the Social Democrats. On Sunday, Merkel embarked on preliminary coalition talks with the center-left party, also known as the SDP. They were her second choice \u2014 after similar negotiations with a separate pro-business party broke down in November \u2014 but it appears circumstances have forced her hand: Party leaders, both for the SDP and the center-right alliance fronted by Merkel, have given themselves until Thursday to determine whether a framework agreement is possible. Now, the two sides are no strangers to one another. Far from it, in fact: They are partners in the caretaker government now steering the country, and their \"grand coalition\" of centrists has governed for eight of the past 12 years. Yet the friendship one might expect of such long-connected factions has faltered in recent months. Both groups saw disappointing results at the ballot box in September, losing dozens of votes to smaller minority parties \u2014 which many lawmakers took to be a sign of dissatisfaction with the previous arrangement. Martin Schulz, leader of the SDP, even vowed on election night that the party would outright reject a place in any governing coalition and instead act as opposition. Faced with the prospect of prolonging the political uncertainty of the past three months, Schulz relented on that pledge \u2014 at least for the sake of preliminary talks \u2014 but that does little to erase the growing policy differences between the two sides. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson noted on Morning Edition where those wedges rest: \"One is the issue of [European Union] reforms, which is on the table today. In other words: Does the EU or the member states \u2014 do they integrate more politically and economically or less so? \"The other issue is whether Germany will actually reach its 2 percent of GDP spending on defense in NATO, which is something that's being demanded by the Trump administration. The conservatives say yes, and the central Social Democrats say no. \"But the biggest hurdle is probably the refugee policy, because the conservatives are very worried that if they don't tighten this, that more voters are going to go to the Alternative for Germany party, which is a far-right party that is now in parliament.\" Indeed, the AfG looms as a silent shadow over this week's talks. The once-marginalized party, which is serving in the German Parliament for the first time, has been denounced by all the other parties as xenophobic \u2014 yet it has been gaining in popularity, particularly amid an uncertain political environment. Now the third-largest faction in Parliament, the AfG would have the opportunity to build on those gains if this week's talks fall through and circumstances force a new election. Though, as Soraya points out, the party could stand to gain even from successful negotiations, since a coalition between Merkel's conservatives and the SDP would make the AfG \"the main opposition party, which brings with it major posts within parliamentary committees and more money.\" Should this week's preliminary negotiations emerge with an agreement, it would be far from the final word on the matter. Party leaders would then need to bring the terms back to their own members, many of whom remain opposed to renewing a partnership with the other side. Only with those members' OK can full-blown coalition talks proceed. Even in the swiftest possible scenario, Germans have many weeks left before they can arrive at a settled coalition at the helm.",

            "article_content": "Growing awareness of privacy scandals and the spread of misinformation on social media may mean our love affair with technology has ended, and a new era of regulation is about to begin.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And now a look at the year in big tech in this week's All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\") CORNISH: In 2018, we've gotten a clear look at some of the uglier results of Silicon Valley's move-fast-and-break-things philosophy. Here to talk about the year that was for big tech are two members of NPR's tech team, Alina Selyukh - hey there, Alina... ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: ...And Jasmine Garsd. Welcome back, Jasmine. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So Alina, I want to start with you because you've been covering Facebook, which has had a lot of troubles this year. Give us a recap of what went down. SELYUKH: Super short - you know, Cambridge Analytica started this year on a low note for Facebook, and we went into many months of disclosures of massive Russia-backed disinformation campaigns, then a huge discovery of an Iranian-backed disinformation campaign, several data breaches and news of just how hectic it has been inside Facebook through all of this. CORNISH: What's been the fallout? For a long time, this company and especially its leadership has seemed untouchable. SELYUKH: A lot of the fallout actually had to do with the fact that Facebook stayed silent for a really long time as these crises started emerging. And then of course we did get Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill, where he was grilled for many, many hours. And there, he essentially started apologizing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ZUCKERBERG: It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. And that goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy. We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. SELYUKH: This whole year started with Mark Zuckerberg sort of offering this lofty goal of fixing Facebook and really hunkering down on what it was meant to be to begin with, which is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. It's safe to say we're now at the end of the year, and Facebook only continues to get deeper and deeper into the conversation of what really is the purpose and the effect of the social network that has now encompassed most of the country. CORNISH: And of course this isn't just about data breaches or data sharing. It's felt like this is the year that social media companies have been asked real questions about their moral obligations to society. Jasmine, can you talk a little bit about that? GARSD: Yeah. Facebook got into serious hot water this year when it stated that it would allow Holocaust deniers because that's just a matter of free speech. Also there was the case of Myanmar where military officials intentionally waged a misinformation campaign against the Rohingya Muslim population. And xenophobic fears were stoked. There was ultimately an ethnic cleansing and a mass displacement. And the United Nations condemned Facebook's role in being slow and ineffective in addressing this. So definitely these social media platforms - and it's not just Facebook - have been grappling with the question of, what is hate speech? What is a threat? Should free speech be allowed for everyone. SELYUKH: And as the companies have been trying to make moves to essentially clean up their platforms, they have also walked into hot water politically, and they've been accused of anti-conservative biases. And that has made it even more challenging for them to sort of appease the political party and appear neutral while also trying to decide just how much they should be involved in moderating speech on their platforms. CORNISH: How has this resonated among the community of workers for these companies? Have we been seeing people speak up, speak out? GARSD: I think that the best example of that is Google. This year was the year in which Google employees around the world protested, whether it was about how they are treated within the company. But also there were protests about various projects Google has embarked on with governments, with the military. And, yeah, we saw this this moment in which tech workers themselves are reckoning with these companies. SELYUKH: And there's a bit to add, too, about the interesting contrast between how the companies have been dealing with this really rough year. So Google - as Jasmine's saying, they're staging protests and walkouts. At Facebook, it has been the reverse of that, which is there's been closing of the ranks, really this unified internal comment about how, you know, we need to come together as a company but also this broader conversation about, you know, this tech work that used to be so glamorous. What does it really stand for? And did people, you know, go into this work for the purposes that they were still fulfilling? I've heard from folks inside Amazon talking about how frustrating they find it to be in this situation where in any conversation about big tech that spawns from the Facebook crisis, they end up being pulled in and being part of the criticism because they are part of this big tech, Silicon Valley community. CORNISH: Alina, catch us up on Amazon. That's a company we haven't been talking about a lot here even though they sort of had a splashy year in talking about where to put their second headquarters. SELYUKH: Yes. This was one of the biggest business stories of the year, and it became extremely anticlimactic in the end. Amazon spent months luring cities and towns from all across the country to bid for these new second headquarters. And then in the end, the company decided to split it among two communities which are really large already. It's the suburb of Washington, D.C., and then Queens in New York City. And the reaction has been disillusioned by a lot of people in the business community, including among the people in the communities that are going to play host to these new headquarters. GARSD: Yeah. I spoke to councilmember Jimmy Van Bramer recently. He's from Queens, and here's what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIMMY VAN BRAMER: I would feel much better about us throwing $3 billion at solving the crisis in public housing in the city of New York than for damn sure throwing it at Jeff Bezos. SELYUKH: And so the next question is going to be what exactly these communities get for investing a large amount of taxpayer money into helping Amazon build these really large new offices. CORNISH: Last question - it's a big-picture one, which is, how do you sum up the lasting changes to the tech industry from all of this? What lessons will they have learned? GARSD: I think this was the year in which the public fell out of love a little bit with big tech. And just for Facebook, for example, in the U.S., user growth has plateaued. In Europe, it's decreased. So I think, yeah, it's the year in which the public became disillusioned and critical of these big tech companies. SELYUKH: And it's also a year when a lot of people have come to understand at a much deeper level what exactly these companies sell. And even around dinner tables around the country, I know people are having conversations about what happens when you sign up for a free service - finally starting to talk about what the product is. And in many cases, it is the data that gets collected about you, and this data is increasingly extremely detailed and very wide-ranging. CORNISH: That's NPR's Alina Selyukh. Alina, thank you. SELYUKH: Thank you. CORNISH: And NPR's Jasmine Garsd, thanks for sharing with us, Jasmine. GARSD: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Lindsey Graham ran against Donald Trump for president in 2016 and warned he was \"crazy\" and \"unfit for office.\" Now he's the president's top defender on Capitol Hill.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Senator Lindsey Graham may be best known as a sidekick of the late Senator John McCain and a jovial man with a reputation for bipartisanship. The ongoing nomination process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh has shown a different side of the longtime lawmaker. This highlights his evolution from the man who once called Donald Trump unfit for office to one of President Trump's reliable allies. NPR's Tim Mak has more. TIM MAK, BYLINE: You might think of Lindsey Graham as a moderate voice in the Senate known for reaching across the aisle on issues like immigration, climate change and torture. But he first appeared on the national stage as a member of the House of Representatives, a manager of the House impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. Here he is speaking in 1999. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDSEY GRAHAM: Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office. MAK: His major influence when he first came to the Senate in 2002 was Senator John McCain. Like McCain, Graham also developed a reputation as something of a maverick and was a driving force for comprehensive immigration reform that passed in the Senate but was ultimately never signed into law. Here is Graham on the Senate floor after McCain passed away in August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: And the void to be filled by John's passing is more than I can do. Don't look to me to replace this man. MAK: Much like McCain, Graham also ran for president but with much more limited success. In 2016, Graham dropped out early in the race, endorsing Jeb Bush, then later Ted Cruz. A constant throughout the early campaign process was his disgust for Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: Here's what you're buying. He's a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot. He doesn't represent my party. Doesn't represent the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for. MAK: But after Trump's surprise victory in November 2016, Graham changed tactics and has become a prominent ally of Trump's. Though McCain and Trump never made peace with one another, Graham framed his work with Trump as the sort of thing McCain would have done in another era. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: I am not going to give up on the idea of working with this president. The best way I can honor John McCain is help my country. MAK: The president and Graham also have linked political fortunes. Should Graham decide to run for re-election in 2020, he'll presumably be running on the same ballot as President Donald Trump. Graham has become an outspoken supporter of the president's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In a display of anger before that Senate Judiciary Committee, Graham lashed out at Democrats who he believes brought forward sexual assault allegations at the 11th hour. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: God, I hate to say it 'cause these have been my friends. But let me tell you when it comes to this. You're looking for a fair process. You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend. MAK: Graham has been a believer in the idea that judges should be assessed based on their qualifications rather than their philosophy, so he sounded betrayed as he stressed that he had voted for two of Obama's Supreme Court picks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that Lindsey said hello 'cause I voted for them. I would never do to them what you've done to this guy. This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics. MAK: It was an angry moment that showed the stark contrast between the lighthearted political moderate he once was and the pro-Trump booster who he has become. Tim Mak, NPR News, Washington.

New York Times' Cade Metz explains how machines are learning on their own.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. There's been a huge boon in the evolution of artificial intelligence over just the past five years due to more high-powered computers, new kinds of programs and an increasing pool of data to learn from. This has led to new developments such as driverless cars, machines that can carry on a conversation and robots that can interpret medical scans. Today, we're going to talk about this rapidly changing world of artificial intelligence and how these new high-tech developments may change our lives for better or for worse. I've also just described the beat that my guest, tech reporter Cade Metz, covers for The New York Times. He was formerly a staff writer at Wired magazine. He's currently at work on a book about the visionaries behind new developments in artificial intelligence. Cade Metz, welcome to FRESH AIR. CADE METZ: Thanks for having me. GROSS: So you've been writing a lot about artificial intelligence, and you're writing a book about it, too, now. So let's talk about that. What is artificial intelligence? What do we mean now when we say it? METZ: That's a really good question. And it's, on some levels, a hard question to answer just because people tend to throw around this term, and they have for a long time, to describe almost anything. And use of this term has accelerated in recent months, in recent years. Anything that is automated in some way or even any computing technology that's advancing the state of the art, even in a small or minor way, is described as artificial intelligence. So it creates all this confusion about what that means, right? That's a grandiose term. It has a long history. It dates back to the '50s when this group of academics got together to truly build artificial intelligence, a machine that would mimic the intelligence of a human. But amidst all that hype, a lot of it which can be sort of just pushed aside, there's a very real change going on now, and it started about five years ago. And essentially, it's a fundamental change in the way that we build technology. What has changed now is that a certain type of computer algorithm - it's called a neural network - has started to work in ways that it did not work in the past. And what this algorithm allows us to do, allows those engineers to do is build systems that can learn tasks on their own. So for instance, a neural network, if it analyzes millions of photos, it can learn to recognize faces and objects in those photos. Most of us have used Facebook. If you've ever used Facebook and you've posted a photo of friends and family, it can recognize those faces. Well, that's driven by one of these neural networks, which can learn that task on its own. We're also seeing these systems in speech recognition. So you can now bark commands into your cellphone. It can recognize what you say. It's used in machine translation where machines translate from one language to another. GROSS: So let's back up. These are systems that can - what did you say? They can learn on their own. METZ: Exactly. They're called neural networks. And that's a metaphor. They're meant to mimic the web of neurons in the brain. But really, they're just math. They're mathematical algorithms that analyze data. A group of millions of photos is just data, and these systems look for patterns in that data - the way a nose curves on a person's face, the way the lines of an eye come together. They can identify those patterns, the math of those visual patterns, for instance, and then learn to recognize what is in an image. In the same way, it can recognize patterns in voice data and learn to recognize what people say. GROSS: So another example you've mentioned in your reporting is how there are now some computers that can read scans to see, for instance, if there's a nodule in a lung that might be a sign of cancer. METZ: Exactly. It's the same basic technology. The same technology that allows Facebook to recognize faces on its social network can allow machines to analyze medical scans and recognize when there are signs of illness and disease. It can be applied to lung scans helping to identify cancer, retinal scans helping to identify signs of diabetic blindness. As time goes on, we're going to see machines improve in this capacity. And what they can kind of do is provide a first line of defense against these types of diseases. That's particularly useful in, say, the developing world, where you don't have as many doctors. You can use these types of systems to analyze the scans of patients that would otherwise require a human doctor. GROSS: And so smart speakers, where you could tell the speaker what to play or what to turn on, that's also artificial intelligence, the same kind of learning pattern that you're describing. METZ: It's exactly the same thing. So the - you know, the Amazon Echo, which sits on the coffee tables of so many people now, or Siri on the iPhone, they train these systems using real human speech, and they learn to recognize what you say. The next step is really understanding what you say. I think what you'll notice, and this shows the limitations of AI today, the next step is to really, truly understand what you say and act on it in a way that a human would. We're not there yet. These systems can recognize what you say and, on some level, understand. They can answer basic questions, respond to basic commands. But they can't really have a back-and-forth conversation the way you might expect them to, or you might want them to, or that might make it easier to really interact with machines. GROSS: On a related note, like, when you talk to, say, Siri or to a smart speaker, how is the voice created that's responding to you? Is that actually a person's voice that's been programmed in such a way so that it can be responding to what you're saying? Or is that, like, a combination, like, a mashup of a lot of different human voices that have become this one robotic voice? METZ: Well, it depends on which system you use. But for instance, Google's system is now, in much the same way, trained on real human speech. So it can - it has analyzed an enormous amount of human speech, and it can use that to create its own. This was just recently rolled into the new Google phones. And you can tell the difference. You know, when I was testing one of these phones late last year, I showed it to my 13-year-old daughter, who's a Apple iPhone user. She could hear the difference between her iPhone and this new Google phone. It sounded more like a human because it had indeed been trained on human speech. It's the same basic technology - those neural networks that I was talking about. It recognizes those patterns, including the other - the way your voice may rise at the end of the sentence, or you may exhale in certain places. It duplicates those kind of things and gets a little bit closer to human speech. But I will say, and my daughter will say the same thing. It's not identical to human speech. It's still very limited. And that's the case with all these systems. As much as things have progressed in all these areas over the past five years, they still have a very long way to go to truly mimic the way you and I interact. GROSS: What are some of the limitations that researchers are trying to overcome now? METZ: Well, there are myriad limitations. For instance, researchers have realized that you can fool these systems into, say, seeing things that aren't there or to thinking they see things when they aren't really. That's a real issue if you talk to people who are kind of on the front lines of this technology. And it becomes a greater worry when you realize that these same technologies are helping in the development of the driverless cars that are being tested in Silicon Valley and Arizona and other places. In many respects, this is how these cars see and respond to what is around them. If you have flaws like that in a self-driving car or, let's say, a surveillance camera, that becomes a big issue. GROSS: So you've described that these neural networks, the algorithms that are used for artificial intelligence that can learn to do things and kind of mimic human thought and behavior, they're meant to mimic the neurons in the brain. So what does that mean exactly? Like, how do you get algorithms to mimic the way the brain works? METZ: This is a key question. So let me make it clear that is just a metaphor in many respects, right? This is an old idea. It dates back to the '50s and the late '50s when they first built these types of algorithms. And they were designed to mimic the brain. The reality is they can't mimic the brain because we don't even know how the brain works. GROSS: Yeah. I was thinking that, too (laughter). Yeah. METZ: So let's get to the point where we understand the brain completely. Then we can think about truly rebuilding the brain in digital form. That's an impossibility at this point. But essentially, you know, these algorithms are complex networks of mathematical operations. And each mathematical operation is referred to among those that build it as a neuron. OK. You're passing information between these mathematical operations. And it's - they're sort of constructed like a pyramid. So you have, you know, neurons at the bottom, mathematical operations at the bottom of this pyramid. And it will start to recognize if you're, say, trying to identify a face in a photo. It'll recognize a line here or a line there. And then that information will bubble up to other mathematical operations that will then start to put those lines together with, say, an eye or a nose. As you work up that pyramid, you get to the point where all these operations are helping the system understand what a human face looks like. This is not exactly the way the brain works. It's a very loose approximation. That needs to be understood if you're going to understand how these systems work. The problem is if you start talking about neural networks, you start assuming that the brain has been mimicked. And you said earlier in describing this that these systems are mimicking human thought. They are they are actually not mimicking human thought. We're still a very long way away from that. What they're doing is they're - they are learning specific tasks, right? Identifying a photo is a task that these systems can learn and learn to do pretty well. In some cases, they can perform on par with a human. But we are complex biological systems that do a lot of things well beyond that. And machines are a very long way from mimicking everything that we can do. GROSS: So we should take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Cade Metz. We're talking about artificial intelligence and new breakthroughs in related technology. He's a tech reporter for The New York Times. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TODD SICKAFOOSE'S \"TINY RESISTORS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about artificial intelligence and other breakthroughs in high tech. My guest, Cade Metz, is a tech correspondent for The New York Times and is writing a book about artificial intelligence. So, you know, getting back to voice recognition and trying to make computers conversational, tell the story of the - I don't know what to call it, a computer or what - that was being taught speech and ended up picking up a lot of like racist terms and Holocaust-denying expressions. And the company ended up discontinuing this. METZ: That was an earlier Microsoft project called Tay. And it's kind of a famous example of these types of systems gone wrong. It was an earlier system. And it had a - it had a serious design flaw. In many cases, it was just designed to repeat what the person had said to it in some way. And so humans interacting with this service online quickly realized this was the case and they could kind of coax the system into saying these racist and xenophobic things. Microsoft immediately took it offline. And since then, the technology has seriously improved. These systems that learn on their own have come to the fore. And Microsoft sees a real path towards creating a conversational system. The problem is that Tay, this bot designed and deployed in the past by Microsoft, has created a real conundrum, not only for Microsoft but for anyone else trying to build these conversational technologies. The thinking is that if you can get these new systems out in front of people and they will interact with them on their own and generate more conversational data that these systems can use that data to train themselves in ever more proficient ways. But these companies are wary of putting them out there because they know they're going to make mistakes. They know that they're going to learn from those human biases and the data. They know they're going to offend people in the end. And, you know, these are big companies with brands and reputations to protect. And they see this as a real stumbling block to reaching the point where they can build truly conversational systems. GROSS: As we were saying before, you know, computers have to like - robots have to learn in order to function. They first have to learn. And you write about reinforcement learning, how some bots like learn tasks through trial and error. And you describe a project that was a Google project creating a bot that could beat the world's best player at the game of Go. So how did that bot learn through trial and error and reward? It sounds like a really behavioral kind of approach to behavioral psychology - reward and punishment type of approach without the punishment. METZ: Well, I mean, you could add the punishment, to tell you the truth. GROSS: Oh, really? METZ: This project was a project out of a lab in London called DeepMind, which is now owned by Google. They built a machine, like you said, to play the ancient game of Go, which is the Eastern version of chess. It dates back thousands of years. And it's a national game in China and Japan and Korea. Just a few years ago, even experts in the field of AI assumed it would be at least another decade before we could build a machine that could crack the game of Go just because it's so complex. People like to say, including the designers of this machine at DeepMind, they like to say that there are more possible moves on a Go board than atoms in the universe. You can never build a system that could explore all the possibilities on the board and reach a conclusion. You just couldn't build a computer that was that powerful. But with these neural networks, what they were able to do is build a system that could learn to play Go on its own. And the way they did that was to supply it with millions of moves from professional human players. Once it learned the game, they essentially created two versions of the system. OK. It's a decent player at this point. And they would pit the system against itself. And it would play millions of games against itself. This is the reinforcement-learning aspect. It learned which moves in these games of self-play - which moves were successful and which were not. And in that way, it reached a level that was well above any human player. They took it to Korea a couple of years ago, and they beat the man who was essentially the Roger Federer of the Go world over the past decade. And then they took it to China, and they beat the No. 1 player in the world handily. It's a system that really shows what is possible with these algorithms. GROSS: In which part - you've programmed the bot to try to get more points and not lose points, and that's its goal. And so it learns that some decisions lead to gaining points and some decisions lead to losing points. And it tries to orient itself toward its goal of gaining points. Is that... METZ: Exactly. And if you do that on an enormous scale, over millions of games, you learn which moves are going to gain you points versus which ones are going to lose points, which ones are going to get you closer to winning the game - having more points than your opponent - and which you're going to lose. The thinking is that you can then apply this type of reinforcement learning to the real world. So, for instance, people have already started research where they try to train cars in this way. I mean, they are literally training cars in games. So, you know, you have racing games, you know, video games that teenagers play. If you can train this virtual car to play that video game with the same method - right? - certain moves mean more points or less, then you can eventually train a car to drive real roads. But that's certainly easier said than done. The real world is more complicated even than a video game, of course. And kind of transferring that knowledge that a system has learned in a game to the real world is a big step. GROSS: My guest is Cade Metz, a technology correspondent for The New York Times. After a break, we'll talk about why some artificial intelligence designers are worried about the possibility of creating intelligent machines that will refuse to allow humans to turn them off. And Milo Miles will review two Kronos Quartet albums, one in collaboration with Laurie Anderson, the other in collaboration with a group from Mali. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF EMAV'S \"TECHMO\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Cade Metz, a tech correspondent for The New York Times. He writes about new developments in artificial intelligence and robotics like driverless cars, machines that can carry on a conversation, robots that can interpret medical scans and how these and other new high-tech developments may change our lives for better or worse. He's at work on a book about the visionaries behind new developments in artificial intelligence. Now that we've learned so much about hacking through Russian interference in our election with like fake news and fake accounts on social media, the thought of there being robots that can be hacked by a malevolent actor is really scary because if robots are designed to do important things, whether it's like, you know, reading a lung scan to see if a person has cancer or whether it's a driverless car, if somebody can hack into that for devious reasons, that's kind of terrifying. So are designers worried about being able to adequately design safeguards? METZ: They are certainly worried. There was a report recently, pulled together by a group of technologists and researchers across various companies, research labs and think tanks across the U.S. and the U.K., that looked at these very issues. And, again, they are myriad. You know, you talk about the possibility of hacking in to an autonomous system. Or, you know, certainly you can exploit its mistakes. Like I said, there are situations where these neural networks can be fooled into seeing things that aren't there - or failing to see things that are. That can be exploited by bad actors. But there are other issues that may be even closer. One of the things that these systems are doing extremely well and increasingly well is essentially fabricating images that look real. There was a team out of a company called Nvidia - they're a chipmaker, but they have an AI lab in Finland. And this team of researchers put together a system where essentially they built a neural network that analyzed millions of celebrity photos. And this system learned to build its own celebrity - essentially taking all those patterns that you see in pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow, or whoever else you might imagine is in this database. And then it would build this celebrity - this fake celebrity that looked vaguely like someone you would see on the red carpet, but you couldn't quite identify. Think of the implications of that in the age of fake news, right? These techniques will soon be applied not only to still images like that but to video and virtual reality. But even in the near term, as these systems become better and better at building fake images that look real, we're really going to have to change the way we look at anything we see online. GROSS: Yeah, that's a really scary thought. I will say you had some of the images of these computer-generated celebrity faces online. And it's kind of hilarious because they look exactly like generic celebrities - like there's a certain generic celebrity look, you know? And I have to say that the computers - the artificial intelligence captured it perfectly. METZ: Well, that's what is doing. It's identifying patterns, right? There are patterns that you and I respond to. And we say, ah, that's a celebrity, right? And some cases, those are intuitive. We can't necessarily articulate them. But these systems can identify those patterns and then make use of them. And in a way, that's a scary thing as well, right? These systems are operating on such a large scale. They're analyzing so many photos. We can never be sure exactly why they're making certain decisions. And that's a big worry as well. Think about that self-driving car again. If the self-driving car makes a mistake, you want to know why it made a mistake. Well, these systems operate in ways that even the people who build them do not completely understand. GROSS: Why not? Why don't they understand them? METZ: Well, can you analyze millions of photos in a matter of minutes? You can't, right? You cannot identify the patterns that that system identified. You can't pinpoint the exact decisions it made over the course of that analysis because you cannot do it yourself. GROSS: So in other words, you have no idea why the size of the woman celebrity's lips are they are or why the length of stubble on the male celebrity's beard is - like the... METZ: Absolutely, or... GROSS: ...Or, you know, what's considered like the perfect eyes for a celebrity. Like, the artificial intelligence has made a gazillion calculations, and you're just kind of generalizing when you say something. METZ: Absolutely, or think about it like this. Think back to what we discussed about the game of Go and that system that the DeepMind Lab in London built to play the game of Go. Some of the designers on that team were very good Go players. When that system was in the middle of one of those high-stakes games in Korea and China, they had no clue what it was doing. It was operating at a level that they could not understand. And these are some of the brightest people on earth literally. And over the course of those five-hour matches, where this machine is playing in ways that no human has ever played literally - and winning in that way, beating the best humans on Earth - the people who designed that machine are unclear what it's doing and why. It is playing at the level they could never play on their own. GROSS: And the machine isn't going to be rattled by anxiety. METZ: That's also true. And it doesn't need to sleep. GROSS: Right. OK, so let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Cade Metz. He's a tech correspondent for The New York Times. We're going to talk more about artificial intelligence after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF OF MONTREAL SONG \"FABERGE FALLS FOR SHUGGIE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Cade Metz. He's a tech correspondent for The New York Times where he writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas in high tech. OK, so another fear that you were right about - that some people have about artificial intelligence - and I think these are designers who are worried about it - is the fear that AI systems will learn to prevent humans from turning them off. When I read this, of course, the first thing I thought of is the computer HAL in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" because HAL is refusing to be turned off. METZ: Right. GROSS: So how would you elaborate on what this fear is - what the danger is? METZ: You know, I like that you bring up HAL in \"2001\" - one of my favorite movies, certainly. And I have to say it's the favorite movie of many of these AI researchers who are designing these systems. If you go into the personal conference room of the top AI researcher at Facebook, he's got images from \"2001\" all over this conference room. My point is that pop cultural images, movies and books influence not only the way these designers think but the way you and I think and the people who run these companies think. We tend to think about those doomsday scenarios because we've thought about them a lot over the decades through pop culture, right? I think that's part of it - is that people on some level relate to that, and they've worried about that in some way. And so as these machines get better, you tend to worry about that as well. That said, among many of these researchers, there is a real concern that as time goes on this will be a big problem, for those reasons I talked about - that these machines learn in ways that we cannot completely understand. If you have a car, for instance, that learns by playing, you know, a video game, it happens on such a large scale. It plays the game so much that there are points where it's going to do things that we humans don't expect it to do. And as it reaches ever more for that higher point total, it's going to try to maximize its point total in every respect. The worry is that it's going to maximize it in ways that we don't want it to. That doomsday scenario is that if it is trying to get to the most points, well, it's not going to let us turn it off. Now, on some level, that again is not something that we can see happening any time soon. That said, these systems that learn on their own are getting better and better - meaning the algorithms are getting better and better. And the hardware that runs these algorithms, that allows them to train ever more - you know, with ever more speed, are getting better and better. And so the worry is that as we improve the algorithms, as we get faster computers, that we will somehow cross that threshold where the machines are really behaving in ways not only that we don't understand but that we can't really control. And among many thinkers in this area, they're worried - even at this early stage. And it is early. If that ever happens, it's years and years away. But they're worried at this early stage that we will cross that threshold and not know it. What they say is that we might as well start thinking about it now because it is potentially such a risk. And when they make that argument, it's hard to argue back. Why not start worrying now and try to build safeguards into these systems rather than wait? GROSS: Can you give us an example of the kind of scenario where a bot would not allow itself to be turned off because it was pursuing the reward that it was programmed to pursue, like getting points for making the right decision? METZ: Well, I mean, loosely speaking - right? - if you're trying to - I mean, again, this is largely theory. But if you're trying to maximize your points, you're not going to keep accumulating points if you're turned off, right? You could think about it in that respect. But think about - let's back up just a little bit. Think about it in this respect. There's a lab in San Francisco. It's called OpenAI. And it was founded by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla among others. And they specialize in this reinforcement learning technology, you know, where these systems learn by extreme trial and error. And they were recently, sometime last year, training the system to play a really old kind of laughably clunky video game from the '80s or '90s. It's like a boat racing game, OK? And they trained it through this reinforcement learning method where essentially it plays the game over and over and over and tries to maximize its points. Well, this system learned in ways the designers didn't understand. Rather than trying to finish the race, which it should have done, it realized it could gain more points if it just ran into things and then spun back around and ran into other things and sort of tried to grab these sort of baubles that were around the course that awarded more points. And so it got into this crazy loop where it was just wreaking havoc across this game solely in an effort to gain points and wasn't trying to actually win the game. That again, you know, is a metaphor for the type of thing these researchers are worried about. And what they ended up doing is they ended up building an algorithm that allowed for human input. When the machine started doing things like that that there were unexpected, the human designer could provide suggestions - give it a little nudge here or there, show that it needed to complete the race and not just wreak havoc. GROSS: Wow, that's so interesting. METZ: Isn't it? GROSS: Yeah. So are we at the point where robots are designing other robots - where artificial intelligence is creating new forms of artificial intelligence? METZ: In certain small ways - what's really interesting to me is that building these neural networks is very different than building other forms - traditional forms of computer software, OK? The people who build these things have a particular talent. Basically, you know, you're trying to coax a result out of this like vast sea of data. People often talk about it as a dark art. And they're like individuals - and they are now paid in the millions, by the way, by these companies to perform this dark art, as some call it. It is a real talent. And so what has happened is that because relatively few people know how to do this today - just because it wasn't done much in the past - that a lot of companies don't have this talent that can help them build these systems. And they want it. But what's interesting is that people are now building machine-learning algorithms that can help build these machine-learning algorithms if you can wrap your brain around that. And so essentially - let's say at Google, for instance - they now have a system that can build an image recognition system that beats the performance of a system built by their human designers. So in that respect, you do have AI building AI. They call it meta learning. Again, this work is early, and it's unclear how far this will progress. But that's a real viable area of research. GROSS: Why did you start writing about technology? METZ: Well, what I tell everybody is that I have kind of a dual background, right? My mother is a voracious reader - a fiction reader mostly. My father was an engineer. He was a career IBMer (ph), a programmer. And so when I went to college, I was an English major, but I also interned at IBM as a programmer. So I always had this kind of dual interest, and it really comes from my parents. GROSS: What was the most amazing piece of technology that you got first because of your father? METZ: Well, we had an IBM PC even before it was commercially available, as the way I remember it - about 1981 with the monochrome green display. I remember building a program that asked trivia questions. You know, it asked you who Pete Rose was, and you had to type in the answer. GROSS: (Laughter) So that helped lead you to the role that you play now. METZ: That's a big part of it. And it - a lot of it was the stories my father would tell. He worked on the original project at IBM that designed the UPC symbol, the bar codes that are on all our groceries. GROSS: No kidding. METZ: He worked to test that. And he was a great storyteller, had great stories about the development of that and all the myths that sort of surrounded. There were people who protested the UPC symbol because they said it was the sign of the beast. You know, they had proof in Revelations from the Bible that this was going to lead the world to ruin. He loved to tell those stories. And there was a certain, you know, pride that I had when you would pick up a can of peas and see that symbol on the can. GROSS: Wow. Cade Metz, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. METZ: Thank you. GROSS: Cade Metz is a technology correspondent for The New York Times. After we take a short break, Milo Miles will review two new albums by the Kronos Quartet, one a collaboration with Laurie Anderson, the other with a group from Mali. This is FRESH AIR.

            "article_content": "Ousted Trump strategist Steve Bannon was the surprise guest at the French far right's annual congress this year. But Marine Le Pen will need more than a visit from Bannon to boost her popularity.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The leader of the far-right movement in France, Marine Le Pen, presided over her political party's annual meeting this weekend. On the program, a surprise guest speaker from America, former White House adviser Steve Bannon. And as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, Bannon's message about ethnonationalism got a warm welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Mr. Steve Bannon. (APPLAUSE) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Bannon was introduced to a cheering National Front crowd in the northern French city of Lille. The American populist strategist arrived straight from Italy, where he'd gone to congratulate the Italian far-right on its victory in recent parliamentary elections. He told the French populace not to be ashamed because they're part of a growing world movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE BANNON: Let them call you racist. UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Speaking French). BANNON: Let them call you xenophobes. UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Speaking French). BANNON: Let them call you nativist. Wear it as a badge of honor. Because every day we get stronger and they get weaker. BEARDSLEY: Christian Makarian is deputy editor of news magazine L'Express. CHRISTIAN MAKARIAN: Bannon coming is a kind of blessing coming from America, from the only model that works, in a way, Trump. BEARDSLEY: Makarian says Trumpism gives hope to French populists that they too can close their borders and put up tariffs. But he says Bannon's appearance is also a sign that Marine Le Pen is finished in France so she's looking to boost her populist stature internationally. Polls show only 16 percent of the French now think Le Pen would make a good president, and fewer than 30 percent think her party should be in any kind of leadership position. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking French). LE PEN: (Speaking French). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Makarian says Le Pen has never recovered from losing to President Emmanuel Macron last year, especially her disastrous debate performance against him. MAKARIAN: This debate has shown the whole country that Marine Le Pen was not thinkable, was not possible as a president for a country called France. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Le Pen also announced a name change to the party in the hopes of completing the break with its racist, anti-Semitic image. But despite the new name, National Rally, Le Pen hammered the same old themes. She got a standing ovation for calling for an end to legal as well as illegal immigration.
