The Biden administration says it will rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, starting with a temporary moratorium on deportations.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kinnard/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption While campaigning in November 2019, Joe Biden talked with a protester about his stance on deportations at a town hall at Lander University in Greenwood, S.C. The Biden administration says it will rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, starting with a temporary moratorium on deportations. For years, immigrants in the Atlanta suburbs lived in fear that a routine traffic stop would lead to deportation. Thousands of immigrants in the country illegally have been deported for minor offenses, advocates say, because of close ties between county jails and immigration authorities. But now, there are some new sheriffs in town. \"I'm the sheriff of Gwinnett County for everybody, regardless of your race, regardless of your gender, regardless of your immigration status,\" said Keybo Taylor, the sheriff-elect in Gwinnett County, outside Atlanta. The 2020 election is expected to usher in a major shift in immigration enforcement. On the federal level, the Biden administration plans to rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, starting with a temporary moratorium on deportations. On the local level, a number of sheriffs known for their hardline immigration stances retired or lost their reelection bids. In Georgia, the blue wave that delivered the state to Biden also helped to elect several county sheriffs who have pledged to limit how they cooperate with ICE. Taylor is a Democrat and the first Black man ever elected to the job. He ran on a promise to get rid of a longstanding cooperation agreement with ICE signed by his Republican predecessor. He says he'll follow through on that promise the first day he takes office in January. Taylor says there's no evidence that the agreement was helping public safety. And, he says, it was hurting trust in law enforcement in his county, where more than one in four residents was born outside the U.S. \"It definitely undermined the confidence and trust and transparency between law enforcement and the community,\" said Taylor. In neighboring Cobb County, Democrat Craig Owens ousted the longtime Republican sheriff. Owens has pledged to end his county's agreement with ICE, too. \"There's nothing that we can find anywhere to say the program took a large scale of violent criminals off the road,\" Owens said. \"From my perspective, it seems like it's doing more profiling of individuals versus keeping our community safe.\" These 287(g) agreements, as they are formally known, have been around since the mid-2000s. They were supposed to make it easier to identify and deport dangerous criminals. But in practice, critics say these agreements have created a deportation pipeline \u2014 particularly in the Atlanta suburbs, where immigrant advocates say police use traffic violations as a pretext to pull over anyone who looks Latinx, or like an immigrant. Here's how it worked, according to advocates. First the immigrant gets pulled over and detained, often for driving without a license or insurance. Then a  sheriff's deputy at the county jail calls ICE. \"It's created an atmosphere of terror for immigrant communities going about their lives,\" said Azadeh Shahshahani, a lawyer with Project South, an advocacy group based in Atlanta. It's hard to overstate how relieved those communities are to see these agreements coming to an end. \"We are so, so happy. We were crying here at the office waiting for the results of the election,\" said Adelina Nicholls, director and co-founder of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, which has been working toward ending these agreements for years. \"This has been a long journey with a lot of suffering, and family separations as well.\" But not all immigrant communities are heaving a sigh of relief. Several sheriffs known for their hardline stance on immigration fended off challengers who said they would end local 287(g) agreements. High profile sheriffs who won reelection include Sheriff Bill Waybourn in Tarrant County, Texas, and Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County, Florida. Waybourn has been particularly outspoken about his support for ICE and its work. He drew national attention for his remarks at a White House press conference last year. Standing alongside the ICE director, Waybourn said that many of the immigrants in his jails are criminals and repeat offenders. \"If we have to turn them loose or they get released, they're coming back to your neighborhood and my neighborhood,\" he said. \"These drunks will run over your children and they will run over my children.\" In an interview, Gaultieri said: \"The perception of the program leads people to the erroneous belief that it is all bad when it's not.\" \"We have people that are in this country illegally and they've committed crimes,\" Gualtieri said. \"We don't want to release them back into the community, especially when those crimes are serious crimes.\" Federal immigration enforcement might change next year. But Gualtieri says the sheriff's office in Pinellas County will not.",

She says they fled his abusive grandfather in Guatemala five years ago, made it to the Texas border, and asked for asylum from the Obama administration. But she says their treatment under President Trump has been worse.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iv\u00e1n and his mother, Hilda Ramirez, have taken refuge in a suburban church in Austin, Texas, for more than four and a half years. She says they fled his abusive grandfather in Guatemala five years ago, made it to the Texas border, and asked for asylum from the Obama administration. But she says their treatment under President Trump has been worse. Among those anxiously watching the U.S. presidential election is a Guatemalan mother and her teenaged son who have taken refuge in a church in Austin, Texas, for the entirety of Donald Trump's presidency. Hilda and Iv\u00e1n Ramirez are ensconced in the Sunday school wing of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, which has given them sanctuary from deportation for more than four and a half years. The 32-year-old mother and 14-year-old son have chosen this kind of cozy prison because they believe that if they leave church property they'll be picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE agents generally do not make arrests inside churches, schools and hospitals. \"It's hard to have two fears,\" says Ramirez, sitting in the parish hall of the suburban church in north Austin. \"I'm afraid they'll separate me from my son, that immigration agents will come at any minute. And I'm afraid of COVID, that I won't be able to go to the doctor.\" As Election Day approaches, millions of immigrants like Ramirez are looking to Joe Biden as a savior if he gets in the White House. Trump promises to continue the crackdown if he wins a second term and warns that Biden would throw open the borders to massive illegal immigration. Biden pledges to reverse Trump's harsh immigration restrictions and reenact more lenient Obama-era policies, such as restoring the asylum process and creating a path to citizenship for unauthorized migrants already in the U.S. Biden's extensive immigration rollback runs to 22 pages. Ramirez says they fled Ivan's abusive grandfather in the Mayan highlands of Guatemala five years ago, made it to the Texas border, and asked for asylum from the Obama/Biden administration. When her asylum request was denied, they fled to the safety of the church rather than let ICE remove them. ICE has \"prosecutorial discretion\" in all deportation cases. But the agency said in an email that it is charged with \"carrying out the removal decisions made by federal immigration judges.\" \"Those who have no claim to relief will ultimately be returned to their home country,\" the agency said. Ramirez says ICE has rejected every stay of deportation she has sought. And to turn the screw tighter, the agency imposed a civil fine on her for $303,000, eventually lowered to nearly $60,000 for failing to depart the United States \u2014 a sum she has no way to pay. \"If I could vote I would prefer Joe Biden,\" she says, \"because, though he has deported lots of people, he was never as bad as Donald Trump, who has divided mothers from their children.\" In her hopes for a Biden victory, Ramirez is articulating the aspirations of some 50 immigrants who have taken sanctuary in churches across the country and are publicly fighting their removal orders. And there are millions more. The list expecting relief from a Biden admnistration includes 11 million migrants who are living in the U.S. illegally, thousands of asylum-seekers waiting in dangerous Mexican border cities for their cases to be heard, and thousands more DACA recipients, plus their parents and siblings. DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program started under Obama that gives temporary protection from deportation to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \"There are countless stories like this of people who've been terrorized because of the highly aggressive, heavy-handed, relentless efforts by this administration to push people out, to deport them, or to make them so afraid that they'll leave,\" says Angela Kelley, senior advisor at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But Kelley adds: \"Expectations need to be kept in check. This is not a light switch. It's not going to be flipped and everybody gets to come to the U.S.\" White House aide Stephen Miller \u2014 the architect of Trump's immigration agenda \u2014 says if the president gets a second term he will redouble his efforts to restrict the foreign born from coming to America, by further limiting asylum, expanding the travel ban, and slashing work visas. And he has dire warnings if Biden wins. \"No country on planet Earth has ever conceived of attempting what Joe Biden is proposing,\" Miller said in a press call with reporters last week. \"The idea that you would release every single illegal immigrant who shows up at your country's border. If it were to happen, the working class and middle class of this country would be wiped out. It's that dangerous.\" Meanwhile, back in Austin, Hilda Ramirez \u2014 approaching her fifth year living on the church grounds \u2014 spends her days sewing COVID masks for the homeless, tending a small garden, and anxiously watching Telemundo for immigration news.

I would like to go to a store. I would like to take a walk in the park. I would like to go--I don't know--everywhere,\" he says. Whoever occupies the White House next year, Iv\u00e1n Ramirez says he hopes the government will let him and his mother stay in the United States and have normal lives.",

Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption With more people voting by mail this year, Facebook and other social media companies are preparing for a potential delay in election results. Facebook said on Wednesday it would crack down on efforts to intimidate voters, amid growing concerns over potential confrontations at polling places and calls from the Trump campaign for an \"army\" of poll watchers. The company will remove posts urging people to monitor voting places if the posts \"use militarized language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters,\" Guy Rosen, head of integrity, wrote in a blog post. Yet a prominent example of such a post, in which Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, urges \"every able-bodied man, woman to join Army for Trump's election security operation,\" will remain on the platform. Facebook says it does not apply its policies retroactively. The company will remove only new posts that use militarized language such as \"army\" or \"battle,\" Monika Bickert, head of content policy, told reporters on Wednesday. \"Under the new policy, if that [Trump] video were to be posted again, we would indeed be removing it,\" she said. Facebook also announced it will stop running all political and issue ads in the U.S. for at least a week after polls close on Election Day \"to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse,\" amid growing expectations that the results of the presidential election may not be immediately known. \"We know this election will be unlike any other,\" Sarah Schiff, Facebook's product lead for political advertising, told reporters. Facebook defines \"social issue\" ads in the U.S. to cover a wide range of subjects, from civil and social rights, environmental politics and guns to health, immigration and education. The post-election advertising ban brings the company in line with Google, which last month said it will not publish political ads after polls close. Twitter and TikTok banned all political ads last year. Facebook, which has resisted calls to fact-check political ads, had previously said it would not accept any new political ads in the week before the Nov. 3 vote. Election watchers and social media companies say they are bracing for the possibility that final results will be delayed because so many people are voting by mail during the pandemic. Facebook is under pressure to rein in political content that could be used to mislead or manipulate voters, whether it comes from foreign actors like Russia, which used the platform to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, or from Americans. That includes President Trump, who has repeatedly made false claims online about mail-in voting and attempted to undermine the legitimacy of the election. Social media companies have tightened their rules against election misinformation and efforts to dissuade people from voting. But critics say Facebook in particular often waits too long to act on posts that break its rules, and has allowed the president too much leeway. On Wednesday, Facebook also gave more details on its plans to prevent candidates from claiming premature victory or misrepresenting the vote-counting process. Once polls close, it will run a banner with information about the counting process at the top of the Facebook and Instagram apps. If a presidential candidate claims victory before a race is called, Facebook says it will label such posts to \"add more specific information\" that counting is still in progress and a winner has not been declared. Once a winner has been declared, if another candidate or party contests the results, Facebook will update the notification at the top of its apps with the winner's name and label posts from presidential candidates with the winner.

Bernie Sanders signs autographs at a February campaign event with Latino supporters in Santa Ana, Calif. Some Democrats say the Biden campaign can learn from Sanders' outreach. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign has been facing pressure from Democratic operatives and activists, worried that his Latino outreach efforts are not enough and potentially a serious liability in the fall election. Some say that his campaign, which is staffing up to improve those efforts, could learn lessons from the success of one of his former rivals. \"I think there's a lot that the Biden campaign can learn from Bernie Sanders,\" said Stephanie Valencia, a co-founder of EquisLabs. \"A lot of what he did was not rocket science.\" Biden's campaign lagged behind the senator from Vermont in organizing Latino voters during this year's primaries, while Sanders focused heavily on Latinos in Iowa and Nevada and won the most votes from Latinos in the California and Texas primaries. Latinos are set to be the largest minority voting group in November, with 32 million eligible voters. Their share of the electorate is particularly large in states such as Arizona and Florida, both general election battlegrounds. Clarissa Martinez, a deputy vice president of UnidosUS, said there is a \"consistent lack of outreach to the Latino electorate, and that election eve polls of Latino voters have found that the majority of registered Latino voters say they received no contact from campaigns.\" \"When you look at the Sanders campaign and their strategy, in many ways we are not talking about a playbook that is unknown for candidates,\" she said. \"The reality is for this electorate, as well as for other segments of the electorate, candidates matter, their positions matter and meaningful outreach is essential. With Latinos, much of that outreach is not happening.\" The Sanders strategy Chuck Rocha, who built Sanders' Latino outreach program and is now launching a political action committee to target Latinos, said that one of the reasons the Sanders campaign was so successful was that it was willing to invest resources early. \"Just the raw expenditure of the money, making sure that this is not some kind of, what I call brown-washing. Just going up with one Latino commercial for a week and saying, 'We've done Latino outreach,' \" he said. \"Spending real money. If you'd spend the same percentage of money on a white voter that you would a Latino voter, then I will be very satisfied. You know, we spent a million and a half dollars on Latino outreach alone in Iowa, of all places, and it was just 6% of the population.\" By the end of the Sanders campaign, Rocha estimated, there were more than 200 Latino staffers on the payroll, and the campaign employed Latino consultants and vendors to create advertising content. \"Another part of the success was there was a Latino or a Latinx person in charge of creating every piece of material that was communicated to another Latino,\" Rocha said. \"So unlike all the other campaigns, who just have regular white establishment consultants who would horribly Google Translate something to Spanish that was made for a white person in the suburbs, we would actually use cultural competency to make sure that that piece was done through the lens of a Latino, by a Latino, for a Latino.\" Biden expands staff and outreach The Biden campaign has in recent days announced a number of high-profile staff hires that will add increased racial diversity to his campaign. This month, the campaign announced that Jason Rodriguez, who was national deputy Latino vote director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, would join the campaign as deputy national coalitions director. The campaign also brought on Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez as a senior adviser. Rodriguez, the granddaughter of the late civil rights leader C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, worked on Sen. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and is an Obama administration alum.

While in-person campaigning has come to a stop amid the coronavirus pandemic, the campaign has been doing targeted outreach, including regular \"Todos con Biden\" virtual events with supporters, and booking appearances for Biden on outlets that will reach Latino audiences. Immigration politics Biden entered the race for the presidency with a strained relationship with many Latino groups, largely tied to the Obama administration's immigration policies, particularly its aggressive deportation policy. Biden acknowledged earlier this year that the policies were a mistake and caused many families pain, and he released his own immigration plan late last year. But many activists said Biden has a great deal of work to do to earn trust and increase enthusiasm. \"Immigration is not the only important issue for the Latinx community, but it is the issue that gets at the heart of our community,\" said Cristina Jim\u00e9nez,  executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth activist group that endorsed Sanders, along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, over Biden. \"Sen. Sanders adopted one of the most progressive positions, along with Sen. Warren, of stopping deportations in the first 100 days if they were to be in the White House in 2021.\" During the primaries, groups such as United We Dream Action protested Biden, demanding apologies and explanations for the Obama-era deportations. Jim\u00e9nez said that United We Dream Action has had some conversations with the Biden campaign around immigration policy. It is pressing for Biden to include in his platform an end to the collaboration between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement, and to commit that undocumented immigrants receive benefits in future COVID-19 recovery efforts. But immigration politics in the general election differ sharply from the primaries, especially as Biden runs against President Trump, whose administration has pursued highly restrictive immigration policies following his 2016 campaign in which he frequently disparaged immigrants as bad for the country. Republicans seized on an early moment in the 2020 Democratic primary race when Biden joined nine other candidates in raising their hands when asked at a debate if their health care plans sponsored by the government would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants. Biden later suggested he would provide emergency coverage. Once again, turnout is key In 2016, Trump did marginally better among Latinos than Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit polls. But for Democrats in 2020, a lack of engagement may be the biggest risk. Valencia, the EquisLabs co-founder, warned that if Democrats don't act, her group predicts that 60% of eligible Latino voters in battleground states will stay home. In 2016, 12.7 million Latinos voted, compared with the 27 million who were eligible. \"It's a huge and scary number for us to contend with, but also is a huge opportunity because that 60% number is what we're basically calling an ambivalent voter. And basically what that ambivalent voter is is not somebody who's hyperpartisan. They're not definitely voting for Biden, or they're not definitely voting for Trump,\" Valencia said. \"There's a lot of room for Biden to reintroduce himself to the community and get these folks off of the couch, and to get them out of the house and voting or voting by mail.\" Valencia said that Latinos who were ambivalent broke for Clinton over Trump, but nearly 30% ended up not voting all. So, if Democrats want to expand their Latino electorate in 2020, they need to convince more Latinos to vote in the first place.",

But naturalization ceremonies have been suspended due to the pandemic.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Thousands of people who were scheduled to become U.S. citizens in the last few months are now waiting to see if that will even happen this year. That's because naturalization ceremonies have been on hold during the coronavirus pandemic. This has been a setback for many immigrants who were hoping to vote in the 2020 presidential election. As part of our look at how the pandemic will affect voting, Ashley Lopez of member station KUT in Austin reports. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Elizabeth Hernandez moved to the U.S. from Mexico almost 30 years ago. And she says that in that time, she never really thought much about becoming a citizen until this year. ELIZABETH HERNANDEZ: (Speaking Spanish). A LOPEZ: She says, \"I want to vote for a president who will improve the country.\" Getting the right to vote is one of the main reasons immigrants seek to naturalize before big elections, says Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center. MARK HUGO LOPEZ: A lot of that comes from not just immigrants themselves, but many organizations work to naturalize immigrants in order to set them up for participation in the upcoming presidential election. A LOPEZ: Hernandez says she was one of those people who was convinced by a local group that it's important for her to vote this year, so she did all the paperwork and was set to have her naturalization ceremony on March 15. But then the coronavirus happened, and the ceremony was canceled. HERNANDEZ: (Speaking Spanish). A LOPEZ: Hernandez says, \"it made me sad.\" She says she was emotional because she was so close to having her ceremony, and now she doesn't know if that will happen anytime soon. Diego Iniguez-Lopez with the National Partnership for New Americans says U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, should hold virtual oath ceremonies. DIEGO INIGUEZ-LOPEZ: It's not unprecedented, and it is an option. A LOPEZ: USCIS officials said in a statement that there are requirements mandated by Congress that make it, quote, \"logistically difficult for USCIS to administer naturalization notes virtually or telephonically.\" Iniguez-Lopez says an estimated 860,000 immigrants were set to be naturalized this year alone, and now that's in jeopardy. INIGUEZ-LOPEZ: And these represent rising numbers of new American voters that have the power to sway the outcome of the upcoming presidential elections, midterm elections and governorships and state legislature. A LOPEZ: And that's partly because immigrants make up a big chunk of the eligible voting population. Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center says 1 out of every 10 eligible voters in the U.S. will be a naturalized citizen in 2020. And among key demographic like Asians and Latinos, those voters are more likely to turn out. M LOPEZ: Most people who make the decision to become a citizen are, oftentimes, also somewhat more engaged than others in terms of wanting to get involved. A LOPEZ: And an important step actually happens in those naturalization ceremonies. Dr. Annie Johnson Benifield is with the League of Women Voters in Houston. One of the main things she does with the league is register voters at those oath ceremonies. ANNIE JOHNSON BENIFIELD: It makes you very proud to be an American and proud that you can be there on the spot to register them to vote at that moment after they are duly sworn in. A LOPEZ: And Benifield says she's able to register about 90% of the people in those ceremonies that day, which is unlike any other voter registration event. And Benifield says there were supposed to be 16 ceremonies in the Houston area this year. JOHNSON BENIFIELD: And the year is not over, so we have no idea how they are going to start structuring and scheduling them for the rest of the year. A LOPEZ: Benifield says she hopes government officials come up with a plan soon that allows immigrants to safely become citizens. And she says she hopes they also figure out a way to make sure groups like hers can register them to vote this year. For NPR News, I'm Ashley Lopez in Austin.

            "article_content": "President Trump said he was averting panic by downplaying the threat of the coronavirus \u2014 a shift from his more common tactic of alarming people about immigration, hurricanes and other issues.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Moving to politics now, President Trump admitted that he downplayed the risk of the coronavirus for a very specific reason. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down... BOB WOODWARD: Yes. TRUMP: ...Because I don't want to create a panic. MARTIN: That's what Trump told journalist Bob Woodward for his new book. And what you heard was an excerpt from a recording released by The Washington Post. But the president's claim of not wanting to create panic doesn't ring true when you look at his messaging over the last four years. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: It's hard to even count all the times President Trump has told the public not to worry about the corona virus, like this from March 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And we're prepared. We're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. If you stay calm, it will go away. KEITH: Trump defended this approach yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I don't want to jump up and down and start screaming death, death because that's not what it's about. KEITH: Though more than 190,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the number keeps rising. The president says he sees himself as a cheerleader for the nation, keeping panic at bay. But that is at odds with the way he's talked about other threats, those where fear might work to his political advantage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Caravan after caravan after caravan of illegal aliens. (BOOING) KEITH: That was President Trump campaigning in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, talking about Central American migrants seeking asylum. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: To flood into our country and overwhelm your communities. That's what's happening. Have you seen the pictures? KEITH: More recently, he said that everyone should be afraid, very afraid of low-income housing destroying the suburbs and anarchists coming to people's towns. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: The protections of American citizenship will be stripped away, and your community will be left at the mercy of the mob. I mean, I'm saying these things, but I mean them. KEITH: If he loses the election and Democrats win, Trump claims in apocalyptic terms that the currently struggling economy will crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Your stocks will be down to nothing. And we will have a depression like you've never seen before. KEITH: And then there are hurricanes, where, like with a pandemic, a dose of fear and preparation can save lives. And with storms, Trump is there to play up the potential for danger, the likes of which you have never seen before - every time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: It seems to be one of the biggest hurricanes we've ever seen. And that's a problem. That's a problem. JENNIFER MERCIECA: It's incongruous on its face. KEITH: Jennifer Mercieca from Texas A&M University has written a book about how Trump wields language. MERCIECA: Trump routinely uses fear appeals. He routinely tells you who to be afraid of, whether it's an internal threat or whether it's an external threat to the nation. He uses fear appeals to try to motivate voters. KEITH: But she says with this truly frightening pandemic, Trump never settled on a way to make it work for him. He went from war-time president leading America into battle with the invisible enemy to again saying it would all just go away eventually and urging everyone to return to normal life. Trump yesterday insisted he was taking it seriously and then in the next breath returned to cheerleading. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We're going to get through this. And we're right now, I hope - really think we're going to - we're rounding the final turn. KEITH: Though on the same day Trump said, we're rounding the final turn, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned, quote, \"We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it's not going to be easy.\" Tamara Keith, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Most Americans favor sweeping government action to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including temporary limits on immigration, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll.  STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST: Most Americans support stopping immigrants from coming to the U.S. as long as it's in the name of slowing the spread of COVID-19. That's one of the major findings of a new NPR/Ipsos poll. But it also found that President Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric has not done much to change public opinion on other policies, like his border wall. Joining me now with the details is NPR's Joel Rose. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Stacey. VANEK SMITH: Tell us more about this poll. ROSE: Well, if you look at the poll results, it's clear that people believe the situation with coronavirus is dire. Two-thirds think the U.S. has handled the crisis worse than other countries, and they want dramatic, aggressive action from the top down. There is broad support for requiring masks and also for schools to reopen online instead of in-person. And what really surprised us is that more than half of people would support a nationwide order mandating that people stay at home for two weeks. VANEK SMITH: Wow. Joel, you cover immigration here at NPR, and this poll also asked people for their views on immigration. What did it find? ROSE: Well, we found broad support for temporary limits on immigration during the pandemic. For example, more than three-quarters of people who responded to this poll, including Democrats and Republicans, support closing the border to nonessential travel. We also found a majority of people are in favor of temporary restrictions on legal immigration, including guest workers and asylum seekers and refugees, although that was largely driven by Republicans, people like Tammy Bunce of Queen Creek, Ariz. TAMMY BUNCE: I feel like we need to take care of America first. I think we should be staying at home, and I think other countries should not be coming in until we have the coronavirus under control. VANEK SMITH: I mean, right there, Tammy Bunce is talking about, obviously, the immediate future of the situation we're in. What did the poll results show us about people's thinking about immigration in the long run? ROSE: Well, on that front, it seems like people's views on immigration are remarkably stable. We asked some of the same questions about immigration in this poll that we asked in another poll two years ago, and we found that people's feelings have actually not changed very much at all. Mallory Newall is the public affairs director at Ipsos, which conducted both polls. MALLORY NEWALL: Americans do want to take steps to limit immigration right now, but that's not because their views on immigration have changed. It's because they want to do everything in their power to contain the spread of COVID-19. ROSE: Just like two years ago when we asked these questions, about 70% of people say immigrants are, quote, \"an important part of American identity.\" But the public is still deeply divided on other contentious policies. One of them is building President Trump's wall across the southern border. Another one is giving legal status to immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, who are often called DREAMers. Republicans overwhelmingly side with Trump on those issues. Democrats do not. I talked to another poll respondent, a woman from Houston, Texas. Her name is Jo Lee. She usually votes Democratic, and she supports some restrictions on immigration during coronavirus, but she does not want them to become permanent. JO LEE: I get right now that we've got this pandemic going on. That's fine. But once this calms down, if somebody really wants to come over here and raise their family and be a citizen, let them do that. I don't have a problem with that. VANEK SMITH: Joel, if we take a look at these respondents' views in the context of the election, Trump has made his immigration crackdown a key part of his argument for reelection. How is that resonating with people in the U.S.? ROSE: Frankly, immigration is no longer a top concern, according to our poll. It has been eclipsed by a host of other issues - coronavirus, obviously, but also racial justice, unemployment, political extremism - and immigration has fallen down the list of top concerns. It was fourth two years ago. Now it doesn't even crack the top 10. So if President Trump was planning to run on immigration, that strategy may not get as much traction as we might have expected just a few short months ago. VANEK SMITH: NPR's Joel Rose.

            "article_content": "Three years after the Trump administration announced the travel ban, it is expected to expand to 6 additional countries. Department of Homeland Security officials announced details today.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Today the Trump administration announced it is adding six countries in Africa and Asia to its travel ban - this in the same week that marks three years since the administration threw airports around the country into disarray with its first travel ban. That executive order blocked visitors and immigrants from several majority Muslim countries. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration. Hey, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: OK, so which six countries are we talking about? ROSE: Sudan, Nigeria, Tanzania, Eritrea - all in Africa - also Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia and Myanmar, also known as Burma, in Southeast Asia. And unlike the very first travel ban, there are a lot of exceptions to this latest expansion. Refugees are exempt, for example. Students, tourists, guest workers - all also exempt. This expansion only applies to people who are seeking visas to reside in the U.S. permanently. KELLY: And why? Why does the Trump administration want to add these countries to the list? ROSE: Well, Homeland Security officials were asked about that today on a conference call with reporters. In general, they say it is because these countries failed to comply with U.S. security requirements for passports and other documents and also with information-sharing requirements. For instance, officials said Nigeria is not sharing enough information with U.S. officials and with Interpol about potential terrorists and criminals. Officials said these countries could get off the list if they improve on those policies and procedures. KELLY: Joel, I noted that that first travel ban led to all kinds of chaos at airports. Do we expect chaos this time around? What's expected to happen? ROSE: I expect it will be much more orderly than with that original travel ban. Remember, three years ago, that order was signed late on a Friday afternoon at the end of the day. Nobody, including border officials, had very much time to prepare for it. This version is being rolled out more carefully. It's not set to take effect for three weeks, and Homeland Security officials say anyone who already has been approved for a visa will be allowed into the U.S. Those officials also tried to downplay the effect of this latest expansion. They estimated that fewer than 13,000 immigrants a year would be directly affected by it. KELLY: What about legal challenges? The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a version of the earlier travel ban, but are we watching for immigrant advocate groups to challenge this? ROSE: I expect that they're going to try. I mean, critics are really upset that the administration is doubling down on what they call the Muslim ban. They fear that thousands of families who are in the process of immigrating here will be separated because of this. Here's Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. She is a Democrat from Houston, Texas, a congresswoman who represents one of the biggest Nigerian-born populations in the U.S. She's also a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, and she's angry that African countries seem to be targeted disproportionately. SHEILA JACKSON LEE: It is pure discrimination and racism, and it has no basis in the security of this nation, domestic security or international security. And I look forward to fighting it every manner that we would fight it. ROSE: But that fight faces an uphill battle. I mean, the Supreme Court, as you said, upheld an earlier version of the travel ban, and the court seems inclined to give wide latitude to the White House when it comes to issues of immigration. KELLY: Just one more question, and it has to do with timing and that - we're marking the three-year anniversary of the first travel ban this week. Do we know if this new announcement was timed to that in any way? ROSE: Well, I asked Homeland Security officials about that on the conference call, and they said that this is just when the DHS security review of these countries happened to reach its conclusion. But the Trump administration's critics say it would appear that politics plays a role in the timing, right? The original travel ban, I should say, is very popular in many corners, particularly with Republican voters. And the president is set to give his final State of the Union address before he faces re-election. Hardline immigration policies like this one are a big part of the record that he's going to be running on. KELLY: Thank you, Joel. ROSE: You're welcome. KELLY: NPR's Joel Rose.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl's district sweeps from the beaches of Santa Monica to the San Fernando Valley. Among the two million people she represents are Latino communities hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic. \"Many essential workers, many market and pharmacy and food service and restaurant and hotel workers and a lot of health care workers,\" she said. \"So a lot of people just had to go to work.\" To reach them \u2014 amid a pandemic that has made face-to-face communication difficult \u2014 Kuehl turned to Facebook. When the virus surged in her district this summer, she put out ads in English and Spanish, urging people to mask up. And it worked, she says. Thanks to Facebook's targeting tools, some of the ads reached more than 100,000 people \u2014 almost four times as many who follow Kuehl's Facebook page. \"You can tell exactly how many people click on a Facebook ad,\" she said. \"We could tell that a lot more people were clicking on these ads than we got any kind of response to our own accounts.\" Now, COVID-19 cases in her district are rising again. But Kuehl's efforts to connect with her most vulnerable constituents have hit a hurdle: Facebook itself. The social network's drive to limit political misinformation has ensnared seemingly harmless public health messages from elected officials like Kuehl. Facebook halted political advertising after polls closed on Election Day. With votes being counted, President Donald Trump and his supporters spread false claims and conspiracy theories about the results. But nearly two months later, the Electoral College has affirmed Joe Biden's victory and yet Facebook's temporary pause is still in place. The ad ban illustrates the difficult tradeoffs Facebook is making, with every decision carrying ramifications for billions of users. At the same time it is restricting ads, it is also promoting authoritative information about COVID-19 \u2014 but as Kuehl's experience shows, those policies can sometimes seem to conflict. \"When Facebook makes these sweeping policy decisions, whatever their goals may be, the reach of those decisions into places where people aren't thinking about is enormous,\" said Jesse Lehrich, co-founder of Accountable Tech, an advocacy group critical of Facebook. What is \"political\"? The ban came at the end of a year of withering criticism over Facebook's refusal to fact check politicians. It was accused of turning a blind eye, letting false claims proliferate. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress after the election that Facebook paused political ads \"because of a risk of potential abuse or potential unrest or violence.\" But critics say Facebook's definition of \"political\" is way too broad. The social network doesn't only ban ads about elections and campaigns. It also includes ads about social issues like education, immigration and health. That means some businesses and nonprofits have not been able to run ads since the election either. In Kuehl's case, the issue was not the content of the ads. But because she is an elected official, Facebook told her, it considers any ads from her to be political, and therefore subject to the ban. So when she tried to run new ads in November, featuring people who survived COVID urging residents to take precautions, they were rejected. \"It was a little shocking to me because they were defining political ads as anything that my office did,\" Kuehl said. Organizers say pandemic needs \"all hands on deck\" approach Facebook says Kuehl's ads could be posted by the public health department, or anyone who is not an elected official. Facebook spokesperson Devon Kearns told NPR in a statement: \"While we have temporarily paused ads from elected officials and politicians as part of our work to protect the 2020 election, we're allowing ads about COVID-19 and have provided guidance to eligible advertisers on how to run them.\" But Kuehl and local organizers say that does not address the urgency in Los Angeles County. The county's worst hit areas include several neighborhoods in Kuehl's district, such as Pacoima and San Fernando, where infection rates are double the county average. The situation requires \"an all hands on deck approach,\" says John Kim of the Advancement Project California. His nonprofit is working with Kuehl and the county to help Latino and Black communities experiencing an outsized impact from COVID. \"We need community-based organizations and local leaders, local government departments and local elected officials all saying the same things all the time in all the channels,\" he told NPR. Facebook won't say when it plans to lift the political ad ban. But recently, the company started allowing ads about the Senate run-off races in Georgia next month. That exception rankles Kuehl. \"I certainly think if they open it up for ads in Georgia, it would make sense to allow us to do these kinds of public service ads,\" she said. In the meantime, she is working with Los Angeles County's public health department on their social media campaign. And she's posting to her own Facebook page \u2014 urging people to mask up and stay safe. Editor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.",

            "article_content": "\"It makes no difference who is elected president \u2013 things go on just as they did before.\" It's a sentiment held by 53% of non-voters in the United States, according to a new Ipsos poll commissioned by NPR and the Medill School of Journalism. A majority of respondents who did not vote in the recent presidential elections feel that voting has little impact on their lives, and that it won't change how the country is run. In addition to being disaffected, they are also more likely to be Latino, younger, and make less money than voters. They don't generally, however, believe it is difficult to vote in the United States: Three-quarters say it is at least somewhat easy to cast a ballot. Instead, non-voters feel a sense of alienation and apathy; they are generally detached from the news and pessimistic about politics. Those sentiments have proved a lasting challenge for campaigns and civic groups looking to bring non-voters into the process. Faith that the democratic process matters is a bigger challenge to overcome than simply teaching people how to vote. In particular, Latino groups say that Latinos have a lower participation rate because of a historical lack of thoughtful and sustained engagement from campaigns and lawmakers alike. A silver lining? More Americans voted in 2020 than in any other presidential election in the past century \u2014 about 67% of eligible voters cast ballots this year. It remains to be seen if that level of turnout can be maintained in future elections. That depends in part of whether voting reforms triggered by the pandemic survive into the future.

Gwinnett is one of the five Atlanta metro counties that saw a dramatic increase in turnout among Asian American and Pacific Island voters this year. President-elect Joe Biden carried Georgia with less than a 13,000-vote lead, a tiny margin made possible, in part, by historic turnout among Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the Peach State. It's the first time in nearly 30 years that Georgia voters chose a Democrat for president. By some counts, AAPI voters nearly doubled compared to 2016, and Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood of the Asian American Advocacy Fund says that's no fluke. Her organization helps turn out voters for progressive candidates and causes. \"Our playbook wasn't just the work that we did in 2020, but it's years of organizing in our communities,\" she tells NPR's Morning Edition. \"Within such a diverse Asian American community, we can't just have one AAPI organizer and call it a day. We have to have very specific ethnic organizers that are doing the very important and very specific organizing necessary for some of these communities.\" Asian American and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing demographic in Georgia, and Asian American Advocacy Fund estimates of registered voters are even slightly higher than official state totals. There are more than 300,00 registered voters in Georgia who identify as Asian American or Pacific Islander. More than 185,000 voted in 2020. And that's around a 63% increase compared to 2016, according to Asian American Advocacy Fund data. Your group did a lot of organizing work leading up to the election. Asian Americans first, we should say, are diverse socioeconomically, in regards to religion, country of origin. But they did vote overwhelmingly Democratic this election. Why? What issues matter to them? COVID and COVID relief was at top of mind for a lot of our families, as was health care. It was apparent that this year was the year for health care to be the top issue for our families because we knew how the lack of health care has come to impact our communities. Indian Americans are the largest Asian American group in Georgia. Was Kamala Harris a factor in turning them out? With the presence of Kamala Harris on the ticket, it definitely motivated them to do more and to be more loud and to be more proud of supporting a Democratic ticket. For sure it energized the community. And for a lot of people who maybe were on the fence about Trump or Biden, it really helped to tip the scales in Biden's favor. What was the playbook for how to reach voters that traditionally had really not been engaged in politics? What that [playbook] looked like was having a Korean organizer talk to Korean elders or having a younger Korean organizer talk to younger generation Korean-Americans and really replicating that for each community. ... Language access is always a big thing for us. ... We also make sure that outreach is available, and when we're knocking on doors, or talking to voters on the phone, that we have in-language volunteers and staff making those calls, but also having two way communication to let voters know that they can always reach back out to us if they have questions. So I guess the big question now is, how are you feeling about the Georgia Senate [runoff election in January]? Will Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders turn out in a few weeks in the same way that they did in the presidential race? It's really important for us to keep that momentum up, to make sure that people just don't get complacent and assume that because Georgia is blue that it will stay blue. People are also tired. Georgia became a battleground state very late in the cycle for some people. And so the last few weeks before the election were a lot for our people. They were getting calls and text messages and mail almost every day. And that has just picked right back up since the runoff. So not only are we dealing with logistical challenges with the holidays, but we're also dealing with some exhaustion with being contacted.

Since he first took office, President Trump has started construction on a wall along the Southern border, overhauled the asylum system, and implemented policies that have made it harder for people to legally move to the U.S. Many of those policies were unpopular with Democrats, and opposition to them probably helped President-elect Biden win the election.

The IRS now acknowledges that its own error caused some citizens of other countries to mistakenly receive $1,200 coronavirus relief payments \u2014 and that the mistake is likely to happen again if more stimulus money goes out. When reports of the mistake first surfaced, the U.S government placed the blame on those non-Americans, saying that many noncitizens erroneously received stimulus checks because they had filed incorrect tax returns that made them appear to be American. But many non-Americans who received stimulus money do not file U.S. tax returns. One of them is Susanne Wigforss, a 78-year-old Swedish citizen who lives in Stockholm. Wigforss was surprised in July to get a $1,200 check in the mail from the U.S. Treasury. It was followed by a letter from the White House signed by President Trump, addressed to \"My Fellow American\" and informing her that \"your economic impact payment has arrived.\" \"I thought, 'I can't believe it,' \" Wigforss recalled. \"They're sending it to me. Why? I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?\" Only U.S. citizens and U.S. \"resident aliens\" are eligible for stimulus money \u2014 \"resident alien\" is a federal tax classification, and to qualify an individual needs a green card or must have been in the U.S. for a certain amount of time \u2014 and Wigforss is neither. Asked about this by NPR, the IRS acknowledged it mistakenly sent checks to some noncitizens who receive Social Security and other federal benefits \u2014 such as Wigforss, who receives a small Social Security payment from having worked in California for several years. \"This is so wrong,\" Wigforss said, \"because I saw that a number of people were being evicted every month in Chicago, for instance, and I thought one of those families would have needed this stimulus check. Why should a Swedish citizen living abroad receive $1,200?\" \"There's no way I'm going to cash this money \u2014 it doesn't belong to me,\" she added. \"But how much money is bleeding out from the Treasury Department because of these [misdirected] stimulus checks, I wonder?\" The U.S. government cannot answer that question. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration did find that, as of late May, $34 million in stimulus money had gone to people who filed a tax return with a foreign address. But that includes eligible people, such as U.S. citizens living abroad, and does not include ineligible foreign citizens who received a check at a U.S. address. For example, NPR interviewed a citizen of the Dominican Republic who was not eligible yet received a $1,200 economic impact payment at his former address in Massachusetts. That $34 million also does not include people, such as Wigforss, who received a check but did not file a U.S. tax return.

Since Congress passed its coronavirus relief package in a hurry in March, the U.S. government has put no mechanisms in place to prevent these mistakes from happening again. As a result, if a new relief plan with more stimulus payments passes in the final weeks of the Trump administration or during the Biden administration, some of that money is likely to mistakenly end up in mailboxes overseas again. U.S. Treasury officials said they are \"continuing to assess the accuracy of the economic impact payments ... and the recovery efforts for any erroneous payments.\" In the meantime, they told NPR, the IRS is \"relying on individuals to voluntarily return these payments.\" \"I think the poor folks in the IRS don't have the bandwidth to go chasing this,\" said Enda Kelleher, a vice president at Sprintax, which does U.S. tax preparation for nonresidents, \"but it would be great if they did, because I believe that there's millions of dollars that have gone to people that weren't entitled to it, or they're certainly not the intended recipients.\" Kelleher said Sprintax has clients from about 150 countries who mistakenly received stimulus checks, mostly commonly in India, China, South Korea, Vietnam and the United Kingdom, as well as numerous nations in Latin America. \"It's awful when we hear of millions of dollars going into the wrong hands,\" he added, \"but it was probably within a somewhat acceptable threshold of error or margin of error\" because Congress opted for speed over accuracy when it flooded the U.S. economy with money last spring. Many non-Americans who erroneously received a check are trying to return it because they worry it will jeopardize their visa or immigration status, \"but there's equally thousands that are saying, 'Well, if they were silly enough to make this mistake, it's their mistake and I'm not going to give it back until they ask for it,' \" Kelleher said. Van Shockley, who gave up his U.S. citizenship and has been an Australian citizen for about a half-century, mistakenly received a stimulus check and suspects he got it because he receives Social Security from having worked in the U.S. before moving overseas.\n                \n                    \n                    Van Shockley\n                    \n                \nhide caption Van Shockley, who gave up his U.S. citizenship and has been an Australian citizen for about a half-century, mistakenly received a stimulus check and suspects he got it because he receives Social Security from having worked in the U.S. before moving overseas. Van Shockley falls in that category. He's 74 and was born in Pennsylvania, but he moved to Australia after becoming disillusioned with U.S. politics in the 1960s. \"I had always been depressed when JFK was killed,\" he explained. \"I just couldn't get over that, so I started looking for someplace else [to] start all over.\" Shockley gave up his U.S. citizenship and has now been an Australian citizen for about a half-century. His last trip to the U.S. was 40 years ago. But he, too, received stimulus money, even though he is not eligible for it and does not file a U.S. tax return. \"That was the weirdest thing ever,\" he recalled. \"I checked the mail and I pulled out a check. It had a Federal Reserve/Treasury thingamajig on it with the eagle and all that. It's made out to me. I thought: 'What's it from \u2014 America? What the hell's going on here? Why am I getting a check from the government?' \" Shockley suspects he mistakenly got a check because he receives Social Security from having worked in the U.S. before moving overseas. \"At first, I thought it was a joke,\" he said, \"and then I went down to the bank and I said, 'Do you have some way of verifying that this is legal?' And the girl came back after five minutes and said, 'It's legal. You got the money.' \" \"I didn't ask for the money. I didn't expect any money,\" Shockley added. \"But as soon as I got it, I stuck it in the bank. You ain't getting it back!\" He attributes the mistake to U.S. government incompetence. \"Oh, complete stupidity. They're just not doing their job properly,\" Shockley said. \"But I'm not complaining totally because I was happy with the money!\"",

The 2020 elections ran well and were largely free from foreign interference, U.S. officials say. That doesn't mean the story is over. Improving elections practices is a \"race without a finish line,\" as Pennsylvania's secretary of state told NPR in 2019, and big questions remain about what's to become of the fast maturing but still partly formed discipline of election security. A range of pending decisions, moves and countermoves now stands between governments, voters and their ballots in upcoming races, meaning the environment likely will continue to evolve even as the big players \u2014 the United States, Russia, China and others \u2014 likely stay the same. Here are some of the unresolved issues as the clock begins to tick toward Americans voting again in large numbers, including in important U.S. Senate runoff elections early next year in Georgia. What happened in 2020? Although this year's presidential race was declared secure and successful, there was some mischief, including cases announced by the leaders of the intelligence community such as intimidating emails traced to Iran and cyberattacks blamed on Russia. How much else remains undiscovered by cyberspecialists or not revealed publicly by authorities? Revelations about Russia's cyberattacks on the 2016 presidential election dribbled out for years with subsequent discoveries and in later reports. It isn't clear whether outgoing Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe might prepare an \"intelligence community assessment\" on 2020's activity \u2014 as his predecessor released in early 2017 on 2016's activity \u2014 or whether a congressional committee might attempt something similar or whether the new administration might. Detailing the extent of this year's activity, such as it was, might give a more nuanced view of the successes claimed by elections leaders, who said this month that the 2020 race was \"the most secure in American history.\" One big specific question posed by U.S. officials but never addressed fully was about the interference efforts of China. A top Justice Department official suggested there was more taking place than he could discuss in the open. How much of that was real, and how much was part of what critics called a political strategy to spread blame away from Russia? What's in store for U.S.-Russia relations? Foreign interference is as old as statecraft, but the huge spike that afflicted the 2016 election was a deliberate move by Russia's government to bring about what it hoped would be a more sympathetic administration in Washington following tensions over eastern Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin felt that the United States was interfering in his own front yard \u2014 and probably also Russia's internal politics \u2014 after U.S. and European condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Accordingly, Putin wanted someone other than Hillary Clinton, whom he considered too hawkish, to become president. Putin believes President-elect Joe Biden belongs to Clinton's school of European and foreign policy, and Russia's comparatively subdued efforts to interfere in the 2020 election were aimed at hurting Biden, U.S intelligence officials said. So the question about Russian attacks and American countermoves now fits into that broader context of statecraft. The last time Biden worked in the White House, as vice president to President Barack Obama, he pushed for a \"reset\" with Russia following the chill between Washington and Moscow under President George W. Bush. That is likely not in the cards this time. Biden vowed during the presidential campaign that Russia and other nations would face consequences for interfering in U.S. elections, although he stopped short of spelling out what he had in mind. Russian scheming in 2020 also specifically targeted Biden's own family \u2014 the Treasury Department sanctioned a Ukrainian member of parliament it said was acting as an agent of Moscow \u2014 making the issue personal. So continuing to defend American networks and other aspects of election security will be only a part of a new chapter in the long saga of the fraught dynamic between Moscow and the West. Attack and defense will be downstream of the diplomatic interplay between the two powers. What's to become of the Department of Homeland Security? Some of the unresolved outlook for election security depends on unresolved political questions in Washington. January's U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia will determine which political party controls the World's Greatest Deliberative Body and, very likely, how ambitious Biden and the Democrats can be. Critics angry about what they call the cruelty and misuse of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump era want Biden to take action \u2014 to smash the agency, or reorganize it, so that it can't handle immigration or domestic protests as it did. DHS has many election security responsibilities in coordination with the FBI and other agencies, including via its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. If Republicans preserve their majority in the Senate, they'll likely serve as a brake on any proposal to abolish or greatly restructure the legacy DHS, which already has endured a great deal of churn since it was created after the 2001 terrorist attacks. If Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, that would put them \u2014 with their House majority and Biden as president \u2014 in a position to contemplate bigger changes. Members of Congress to Biden's left might pressure him to abolish DHS and potentially even create a stand-alone federal agency to take more responsibility for elections, as proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The nature of the proposals and the prospect for change could dictate what follows \u2014 and whether U.S. officials are in an even stronger position than they say they were this year or whether a big shake-up might still be underway by, for example, the 2022 midterm elections. What will become of the U.S. information environment? If foreign interference boils down to two broad strategies, changing ballots or changing minds, 2020 brought another reminder about how much simpler it is to defend election infrastructure, including databases, machines and other equipment. Americans' minds and beliefs are a different story. Falsehoods and misinformation on every topic spread freely on social media. That can affect people's behavior in important ways. Americans choose not to vaccinate their children against measles; they poison themselves with chemicals wrongly believed to prevent coronavirus infection; and significant numbers of them told pollsters they don't believe the election was free or fair. The paradox in 2020 was that even years of public reports on election interference and a sustained stream of false claims by President Trump about alleged \"fraud\" didn't prompt people to opt out. Quite the opposite: Americans turned out in record numbers. So sometimes what people say they believe doesn't always determine what they actually do. Other times it does. When, looking ahead, might that prove consequential? For example: Will Republican officeholders preserve practices intended to expand access to voting during the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 or will Trump-backed false beliefs about \"fraud\" prove too durable to make that politically possible? Will members of Congress in a new administration agree on legislation that could compel social media platforms to change their practices? Can public officials do more to address voters directly? David Levine, the elections integrity fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, called for a new presidential commission that would include officials from state and local governments. Its goal, he said, should be to quash false perceptions and sell Americans on their own system. 7/We need to ensure that elections that are conducted with integrity have broad public support, even if the outcome isn't what some voters were hoping for.",

President-elect Joe Biden wants the federal government to start playing a more substantial role in combating the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 250,000 Americans. That wish, though, has so far been waylaid by the Trump administration's unprecedented refusal to participate in the presidential transition. As NPR's Brian Naylor has previously reported, a Trump appointee has refused to complete a key bureaucratic step that would allow the transition to move forward: A key, if little-known Trump administration official has yet to determine formally that Biden won the election, holding up some crucial resources traditionally available to the president-elect. Under the 1963 Presidential Transition Act, it's up to the General Services Administration, or GSA, to determine or \"ascertain\" the winner of the presidential election, at least as far as starting the process of turning over the keys to the new administration goes. Joe Biden suggested in a speech on Monday that such a lack of cooperation could have dire consequences as the nation combats the pandemic\u2014\"More people may die if we don't coordinate.\" And despite Biden's promise to be a \"president for all Americans,\" the fractious partisan divide seems likely to extend beyond inauguration. Democrats hold a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are facing an uphill battle in the fight for the Senate, meaning ambitious legislative projects will be difficult to achieve. It has led former top officials from the Obama administration to recommend that Biden make liberal use of executive power. The strategy would allow the president-elect to pursue his policy aims without wasting political capital on precarious congressional negotiations, though any executive action could be rolled back under future Republican administrations.Connect:Subscribe to the NPR Politics Podcast here.Email the show at nprpolitics@npr.org.Join the NPR Politics Podcast Facebook Group.Listen to our playlist The NPR Politics Daily Workout.Subscribe to the NPR Politics Newsletter.Find and support your local public radio station.",

Mexico is on the left. Work crews are dynamiting mountains and bulldozing access roads in the badlands of southeastern Arizona, while government lawyers have acquired a beloved birding preserve along the Rio Grande in South Texas \u2014 all to make way for a border wall that may never get built. The completion of President's Trump's signature wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is very much in doubt. Before winning the presidential election, Joe Biden flatly told NPR: \"There will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration.\" But that hasn't stopped Trump's wall builders, who are hurrying to get as many miles completed as they can before the next president can cancel their contracts. That's happening from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas to Arizona's stunning Coronado National Memorial and Guadalupe Canyon, a wildlife corridor for Mexican gray wolves and endangered jaguars. At $41 million a mile, the Arizona sections are the most expensive projects of the entire border wall. \"Every single day, the Department of Homeland Security continues to dynamite, to blow up these rugged mountains in order to clear a path for a wall that, in all likelihood, will never be built,\" says Laiken Jordahl, with the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz. \"So now it's just destruction for destruction's sake.\" The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the wall project, said it expects contractors to continue work through the remaining two months of Trump's term and \"will not speculate on actions the administration may or may not take.\" A portion of the border wall is under construction in Arizona's Guadalupe Canyon, which is a wildlife corridor for Mexican gray wolves and endangered jaguars. The United States is on the left.\n                \n                    \n                    John Kurc\n                    \n                \nhide caption A portion of the border wall is under construction in Arizona's Guadalupe Canyon, which is a wildlife corridor for Mexican gray wolves and endangered jaguars. The United States is on the left. Trump has ignored his critics and beat back nearly every court challenge to his border wall. Currently, 11 different contractors are at work on 27 separate construction contracts, including the demolition in Arizona, according to the Army Corps. So far, $8 billion has been spent, part of the $15 billion that has been set aside for the gargantuan project \u2014 more than the price tag for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Cranes and concrete trucks are erecting steel panels from the subtropics of the Texas Gulf all the way to the Pacific hills of San Diego. Last month, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf stood in the shadow of the iron bollard wall in the Rio Grande Valley to announce the completion of nearly 400 miles since Trump came into office. \"While this is an important milestone, we're building even more wall,\" Wolf said. \"Currently we have nearly 210 more miles under construction and expect to complete 450 miles by the end of this calendar year.\" And the pace is quickening. In the week after the election, government lawyers filed a \"motion for immediate possession\" against an elderly landowner in Mission, Texas, to quickly seize a strip of his family's ancestral land to raise the border wall. \"We're still seeing filings,\" says Roberto Lopez, community organizer with the Texas Civil Rights Project that represents the property owner. \"And the government isn't stopping or slowing. It seems like they're trying to speed up.\" Another case in point is the Saline\u00f1o Wildlife Preserve on the banks of the international river in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. \"The Saline\u00f1o preserve in Starr County \u2014 which is 2 1/2 acres of some of the best bird habitat, brings in birders from all over the country and the world \u2014 has been acquired by the Army Corps of Engineers and is set to be destroyed for the border wall,\" says Scott Nicol, a longtime conservation activist in the region. Customs and Border Protection says the sale was completed on Election Day, Nov. 3. After a public outcry over the voluntary sale, the Valley Land Fund, which owns the preserve, announced Friday that it had decided to cancel the whole deal and fight the government to keep out the bulldozers. A CBP statement said the property \"is necessary for the execution of planned border barrier in support of U.S. Border Patrol's operational requirement in the Rio Grande Valley.\" A spokesman added that the agency, at present, has no plans to stop construction of the border wall because of the incoming administration. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, shown at a Senate committee confirmation hearing on Sept. 23 in Washington, D.C., said last month: \"Currently we have nearly 210 more miles under construction and expect to complete 450 miles by the end of this calendar year.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Greg Nash/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, shown at a Senate committee confirmation hearing on Sept. 23 in Washington, D.C., said last month: \"Currently we have nearly 210 more miles under construction and expect to complete 450 miles by the end of this calendar year.\" Immigration hawks want Biden to keep building Trump's border wall. They want Biden to do what President Barack Obama did in 2009 when he allowed border fence construction contracts signed under President George W. Bush to be completed. Bush and Obama together installed 654 miles of barriers. Obama wanted to show he was serious about border security so that a divided Congress would pass comprehensive immigration reform, which it didn't. \"It should not be a, 'Hey, I made a political commitment and therefore on Jan. 20 at 12:01 I'm shutting this down.' I would have to say that's irresponsible,\" says David Aguilar, national chief of the Border Patrol who oversaw completion of the border fence under Obama. \"What needs to happen,\" Aguilar continues, \"is take a step back, take a look at what is in place and what the appropriate path forward should be.\" Early termination of contracts can be costly, says Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group in Washington, D.C. Setting aside the overwhelming opposition to the wall in U.S. border communities, Amey said: \"It may be easier, especially if the money has already been appropriated, to finish and complete those sections of wall to ensure we have a decent barrier down there.\" Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, is among the members of Congress who represent districts along the U.S.-Mexico border, all of whom are dead-set against the wall. He says Biden's new CBP chief can simply call for a \"termination for convenience,\" which is the right of a government agency to sever a contract, though it will likely include a termination penalty fee. Cuellar says this is what he expects of the new administration: \"One, tell the Department of Justice to stop all the condemnation lawsuits. And the second thing is send instructions to the Army Corps of Engineers to tell all those contractors to stop construction of the wall. They will have to pack up and leave.\" In Texas, where most of the borderlands are in private hands, the progress of the wall has been slowed by the tedious condemnation process that winds through federal court. The government has signed four contracts to build 121 miles of wall in the Laredo region, for instance, but they haven't acquired a single acre of land to erect it on. Many landowners have fought the government in court, hoping to run out the clock on Trump's time in office. The delay tactics appear to have worked. \"Our coalition feels confident that the wall is dead and that nothing more will happen between now and the inauguration,\" says Tricia Cortez, co-founder of the local No Border Wall Coalition. Added Ricardo De Anda, a local lawyer representing property owners: \"Landowners have been involved in hand-to-hand fighting against the government lawyers for over a year now, denying them access to their property. There's no way CBP can get a bulldozer down on the river between now and the swearing-in.\" That comes as a huge relief to Sacred Heart Children's Home, a Catholic orphanage in Laredo situated on the Rio Grande. The tall steel panels, along with a 100-foot-wide enforcement zone, would have plowed right through the campus, which is run by an order of nuns. \"I'm very happy for that,\" said Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez Jr., secretary of the Sacred Heart board of directors. \"The wall, it seems, will not be built, and that will help our cause because we would not lose any property, and we would be able to help young boys and young girls.\" That is, if Joe Biden follows through on his promise to stop Donald Trump's wall and abandon the unfinished project in the borderlands.",

President-elect Joe Biden's win has some people asking if there's an opportunity for a 2020 census do-over. The past eight months of the national head count have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, historic hurricane and wildfire seasons, last-minute schedule changes by the Trump administration and President Trump's call to leave unauthorized immigrants out of a key census count for the first time in 230 years. But whether there is a census redo is not entirely in the hands of the president \u2014 who has limited authority over the census \u2014 and it would come with a host of complications. The Constitution has required a census every 10 years since the first U.S. count in 1790. The main purpose of the census is to produce the latest population totals that are used to redistribute the seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states. During the last weeks of the Trump administration, there are two key legal deadlines for the 2020 census. Dec. 31: The commerce secretary reports to the president the numbers used to reapportion House seats and Electoral College votes. Jan. 10: The president reports the apportionment counts to Congress. It's not clear whether the state population numbers from a census do-over could be used to reapportion the 435 House seats \u2014 or whether there would be enough support in Congress to change any laws to allow that to happen. Federal law does allow for a \"mid-decade census\" in 2025, but the results cannot be used for congressional reapportionment. With the 2020 census expected to be the most expensive in the country's history at around $16 billion, there are questions about whether Congress would be willing to fund another count so soon after. \"I think a redo of the census would be the most drastic option that Congress and the new administration would consider down the road,\" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House oversight subcommittee for the census, says. \"There's a reason it takes 10 years to plan for a decennial census. A redo may not have to take 10 years if the Census Bureau were to use the same design, but it would still have to research and test a number of other elements.\" Jamal Brown, the Biden campaign's national press secretary, has not responded to NPR's question about whether the president-elect supports conducting a new census in 2021 or 2022. Lowenthal and some other longtime census watchers are calling, instead, for the Biden transition team to set up a panel of experts, both within and outside of the federal government, to review early indicators of the quality of the 2020 census and determine whether it can be used to not only reapportion House seats but also redraw state and local voting districts and guide the fair distribution of $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding. In April, the bureau asked for four-month extensions to legal deadlines for reporting census data but hasn't received any from Congress so far. Census advocates say giving the bureau's staff more time to run quality checks is one way to make sure the results of the 2020 census are accurate. Last week, the bureau's deputy director and chief operating officer, Ron Jarmin, said in a blog post that the processing of census results has \"not uncovered anything so far that would suggest\" the 2020 census won't be \"fit for its constitutional and statutory purposes.\" There are, though, preliminary findings that raise questions about the accuracy of population counts in college towns and of data about race and ethnicity. Still, this month the inspector general's office at the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau, announced it is launching an evaluation of the bureau's quality control processes. The bureau is also continuing to fight a federal lawsuit, led by the National Urban League, that includes allegations that because of pressure from the Trump administration to finish the census early, the bureau weakened its standards and processes in order to make the count appear more complete than it actually is. A task force organized by the American Statistical Association is recommending that the bureau release more detailed metrics soon in order for outside experts to check the quality of the results. That task force includes two members of Biden's transition agency review team for the Commerce Department who also served in government during the Obama administration. Nancy Potok was a former deputy director at the bureau and later chief statistician within the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Denice Ross focused on data projects and policy as a presidential innovation fellow and an adviser at OMB. The Census Bureau's public information office, however, has not responded to NPR's questions about whether it's considering releasing any of the requested metrics. Former bureau officials \u2014 including John Thompson, who served as director during the Obama administration and left months after Trump became president, and Jeri Green, who was a senior adviser for civic engagement at the bureau \u2014 tell NPR they expect a lot more transparency from the bureau's civil servants under Biden. A recent series of political appointments by the Trump administration have raised concerns about partisan interference at the bureau among longtime census watchers, who are particularly worried about the administration's push to reprioritize resources in order to try to get a count of unauthorized immigrants that would allow Trump to change the congressional apportionment numbers while he is in office. The administration's efforts have been challenged through multiple federal lawsuits, and the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Nov. 30. \"I pray that the career professionals at the Census Bureau, that the researchers and the scientists are allowed to do their work without further interference for partisan purposes,\" says Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, who has served on one of the bureau's advisory committees of outside experts. \"They've been gagged. They've been silenced and even arms twisted to a degree, and they're tired,\" says Green, who has been advising the National Urban League on census issues. \"They want the Census Bureau that they know and love to be a transparent agency that has the interest of the American people at heart.\"",

President-elect Joe Biden aims to reverse the Trump administration's dramatic cuts to refugee admissions. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to reassert America's commitment to refugees after the Trump White House's slashing of the resettlement program, part of the current president's anti-immigration drive. In 2016, President Barack Obama aimed to admit 110,000 refugees. President Trump lowered the cap on refugee admissions every year of his presidency. For fiscal year 2021, he set the cap at 15,000, the lowest on record. Biden promises to take a starkly different approach from his predecessor: to \"set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time.\" For decades, the United States led the world in offering protection to people fleeing persecution in other countries. Now the Biden presidency will mark a return to the political consensus that the U.S. should continue to do so, refugee policy experts say. But while the president has the authority to set refugee admissions numbers, it will take time to rebuild the nation's resettlement program after four years of the Trump administration largely dismantling it, according to Becca Heller, executive director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. \"The point is not to hit 125,000 \u2014 the point is to signal both to the rest of the world and also to the domestic population in our own government that this is a priority again,\" Heller says. \"It's less relevant if we hit the exact number and more relevant that we say, 'Admitting refugees is really important. We are going to aim at this high number and invest in infrastructure and get as close as we can.' \" Here's a look at some of the main challenges ahead for the Biden presidency as it seeks to roll back the sweeping changes to the refugee program. Budget cuts have gutted the infrastructure for resettling refugees Nine religious or community-based organizations known as resettlement agencies have contracts with the State Department to resettle refugees. The agencies' budgets are based on the number of refugees admitted. Low admission levels reduced government funding, which decimated programs supporting newly arrived refugees. After the State Department told them to pare their operations, many agencies had to shutter or scale back offices and lay off workers. \"We're looking at a very big ramp-up because over the last four years, there's been an 85% cut and an effective demolition of the refugee resettlement program,\" says David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, the largest of the nine resettlement agencies. The backlog is huge More than 120,000 refugees are in the pipeline, passing rigorous security and medical checks, waiting in line, sometimes for years. In addition, thousands of Iraqis who worked for the U.S. military and are now at risk are waiting too. In 2020, there were 4,000 slots for Iraqis who aided the U.S. military, but only 123 were resettled. Those seeking refuge in the U.S. have to submit to interviews with immigration officers and security officers. In Iraq, interviews slowed to a trickle last year with the withdrawal of nonessential employees from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Refugees are scrutinized more thoroughly than any group that comes to the U.S. The Trump administration added new \"extreme vetting\" requirements, and that is swelling the backlog of applicants, says Heller, of IRAP. \"Extreme vetting is really inefficient. It's not better vetting by redundancies that are unnecessary or busy work for the intelligence community,\" Heller says. The new vetting rules were kept secret until IRAP sued to force a disclosure. \"Now, you have to be able to provide every address you've lived at for the last 15 years and every passport number you had for the last 15 years, every social media handle that you've had for the last 15 years,\" says Heller. \"There's no indication that it does anything for anybody's safety.\" A divided Congress has to set the budget for refugee resettlement amid a pandemic The Refugee Act of 1980 established the mechanism for resettlement, including the president's annual determination on refugee arrivals and a provision for consultations with Congress that sets the annual budget for the resettlement program. That's the way it's supposed to work \u2014 but the Trump administration consistently ignored the provision to confer with lawmakers, according to refugee advocates. So far, the election has produced a divided Congress. Members may not have the appetite to take on immigration policy amid the coronavirus pandemic and an economic recession, says Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute. The Biden administration will also be consumed by the COVID-19 crisis. \"For the first 100 days, there will be very little bandwidth for a Biden administration to deal with anything other than COVID. We have never faced a crisis like this before,\" Chishti says. \"We can't expect a huge leap on immigration policy. If people expect that this is going to happen tomorrow, they will be in for a big disappointment.\"",

Democrats tried to replicate the \"Harry Reid machine\" elsewhere in the U.S., but some question how well the model will continue to work.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: A Democratic machine that has shaded Nevada blue has become a model for Democrats in other parts of the country. People call it the Harry Reid machine, named for the former Senate majority leader and Nevada native. NPR's Leila Fadel reports. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: On Election Day, the largest union in the state, majority-immigrant and women of color, was out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: In the Culinary Union parking lot, a mariachi band played as volunteers handed out breakfast to canvassers. Despite the pandemic and its members hard-hit by job losses, the union knocked on over 450,000 doors. The Culinary Union has been organizing for decades, but it wasn't until 2010 that Senator Harry Reid really harnessed that power. He was in the battle for his political career. And then... HARRY REID: Republicans made a big mistake because the first ads they ran against me said, Harry Reid, the best friend illegal immigrants ever had. And what that did is energize the Hispanic community. FADEL: The demonization got Latino voters to the polls, and they delivered the Senate seat to Harry Reid by a tiny margin. REID: It made them mad, and they came out in droves. I wouldn't have won that reelection but for the Hispanics. FADEL: The party woke up. Ever since, turning out the Latino, Black and Asian and Pacific Islander vote is the backbone of the Democratic model in Nevada, which means partnering with unions and community groups. It's something the Culinary Union's national group, Unite Here, replicated in Arizona, where Democrats flipped the state for Biden, and in Pennsylvania, where Biden also won. D TAYLOR: The model was Nevada, and that was really where we decided to take control of destiny. FADEL: That's D. Taylor, the president of Unite Here. The key, he says, is door-knocking, talking to people. TAYLOR: And we particularly targeted those neighborhoods that, candidly, folks don't target - largely Black and brown communities. FADEL: But in a pandemic, that was tough, as some 1,500 canvassers fanned out in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida and Nevada carefully with masks, gloves and social distancing. And it worked everywhere except Florida. TAYLOR: We were up against a Trump ground game that was good. They were much better than they've ever been in the past. They were much more active. FADEL: Without his union, Taylor says, Democrats would have lost because the Trump campaign was at the doors early when Democratic organizers, more careful about the pandemic, were largely inside. Pete Ernaut is a longtime Republican political operative in Nevada and says the Republican ground game seems to have narrowed the margins. PETE ERNAUT: Number one, it existed. Number two, it was organized. FADEL: He says the Harry Reid machine was born because the Democrats were tired of losing, and now the Republicans are taking their cues from that same machine. Register people and turn them out. ERNAUT: It's meat and potatoes, but the registration efforts and the turnout efforts the Republican Party for the last four cycles have been dismal. They finally showed up. FADEL: Just not enough. Biden won. Across the country, there was record turnout on both sides. Trump's backbone of support - white voters. Exit polls indicate, though, he made slight inroads in Black, Latino and Asian communities. YVANNA CANCELA: You cannot win without the Latino vote. FADEL: That's Yvanna Cancela, a state senator and senior adviser to the Biden-Harris campaign in Nevada. She warns that polls may not tell a full demographic picture because so many people voted by mail. What is true, she says, is the Harry Reid machine worked despite the challenges. CANCELA: Outreach to our communities of color and especially our Latino communities was at the cornerstone of our campaign's strategy, and every strategic decision we made took those communities into account. FADEL: Cancela says Democrats in states like Arizona made similar calculations, and that's why Biden won. Leila Fadel, NPR News, Las Vegas.

            "article_content": "NPR talks with Ohio voters who wanted President Trump reelected about what they see the next four years might bring under a President Biden.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Despite losing the race, President Trump did hang on to some important battleground states, including Ohio. That means for the first time in 60 years, the state did not help pick the president. And that means millions of voters in Ohio are left without the results they had hoped for. Ohio Public Radio's Andy Chow looks at what a Biden presidency means to Trump supporters in red parts of the state. ANDY CHOW, BYLINE: On a sunny morning in downtown Chillicothe, Melissa Martin is 8 feet in the air, perched on top of scaffolding set up along the sidewalk. MELISSA MARTIN: I'm just repainting the front of my business. CHOW: Along this popular strip of Chillicothe, a city of about 21,000 people 50 miles south of Columbus, Martin is about to open a new shop. MARTIN: It's actually three. It's Bee Sweet Candies, Sweet and Sassy Party Rooms and Free Spirit Threads Boutique. CHOW: Martin says this new venture would not be possible without the past four years of Donald Trump as president. MARTIN: Let's put it this way. At the end of the Obama term, I was ready to go out of business after eight years of Obama. CHOW: Martin says that's because Trump created tax reform and cut down on regulations that improved the market and her own confidence in the economy. She says the idea of a Biden presidency does not sit well with her. MARTIN: I'm scared for our taxes. They believe small businesses have all this money, which we don't. They're ready to tax the crap out of us - the Democrats are. CHOW: Rita Lewis, who drives an hour every day to work for Martin, is underneath that scaffolding, giving the trim around the store's doorway a new coat of paint. Lewis is also a Trump supporter and says her No. 1 issue is abortion. RITA LEWIS: And I think that the Democratic Party is going in the wrong direction with that. I have a problem with that. CHOW: Chillicothe is in Ross County, which Trump won with 66% of the vote. Trump won Ohio, usually seen as a swing state, by an 8-point margin over Biden. Tracey Winbush, former Ohio Republican Party treasurer, is from Mahoning County, an historically Democratic stronghold that flipped for Trump this year. Winbush has the same concerns about a Biden presidency but says she sees some hope with Biden's message of unity. TRACEY WINBUSH: Forty-seven years is a long time. And he said that he was going to cross the aisle. He said that he was going to work with us. I can only take him at his word and pray that he's had a change of heart and he's going to do that. CHOW: Out of everyone I spoke to in Chillicothe for this story, no one wanted to talk about a perceived Biden presidency without making it known that they're not convinced Biden will end up in the White House on January 20. Along with the economy and abortion, Trump supporters are also concerned about what a Biden presidency does to national security and immigration. Pat Highland is sitting on a bench as his granddaughter enjoys a treat from the ice cream shop he owns. Highland, a Biden supporter, knows he's outnumbered in his own community. But he holds out hope that this city and the country can come together. PAT HIGHLAND: Everybody has their opinion. But I think in the end run, everybody will feel that it's necessary for us to all get together. And so some things that Republicans want to accomplish and the things the Democrats - there's no reason we can't do that. CHOW: Republican Governor Mike DeWine said he congratulates Vice President Joe Biden but stopped short of recognizing his electoral win. Instead, DeWine, along with other Republican officeholders, have been waiting to recognize the results until after Trump's legal actions play out. For NPR News, I'm Andy Chow in Chillicothe.

            "article_content": "The Senate side of the Capitol is seen in Washington, D.C., early Monday. Experts say President-elect Joe Biden's ability to reshape the U.S. immigration system will be sharply limited if Republicans retain control of the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Senate side of the Capitol is seen in Washington, D.C., early Monday. Experts say President-elect Joe Biden's ability to reshape the U.S. immigration system will be sharply limited if Republicans retain control of the Senate. When President Trump took office, he quickly unleashed a torrent of immigration policies \u2014 including his first \"travel ban\" on people from majority-Muslim countries. President-elect Joe Biden is now expected to reverse that policy \u2014 along with other controversial Trump administration actions \u2014 in the first days of his administration. But other recent changes to the U.S. immigration system may take months, if not years, to unwind. And experts say Biden's ability to reshape the country's immigration system will be sharply limited if Republicans retain control of the Senate. The Trump administration has taken more than 400 executive actions, slashing the flow of legal immigrants to a fraction of what it was when he took office, according to Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. \"Protecting DACA is the floor, not the ceiling\" \"The easiest will be those that can be reversed with one administrative action, such as an executive order, but don't come with heavy logistical challenges,\" Pierce said during a conference with reporters on Monday. Trump policies that could be reversed relatively quickly include the travel bans on people from 13 countries, many of them with majority-Muslim populations. The Biden administration is also expected to extend DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era policy that protects from deportation immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Pierce said the Biden administration is expected to reinstate DACA in full, allowing applications from tens of thousands of immigrants who have become eligible since 2017, when the Trump administration tried to terminate the program. \"We're glad to see the Biden transition team is preparing to roll back Trump's policies that have detained, deported and killed immigrants,\" said Greisa Martinez Rosas, the executive director of United We Dream and a DACA recipient. \"Protecting DACA is the floor, not the ceiling, of what a Biden-Harris administration must do.\" Confront a challenging situation at the U.S.-Mexico border Many of the Trump administration's changes to immigration policy were enacted through regulation and may take longer to undo, including the \"public charge\" rule that allows the government to deny green cards to immigrants who are considered likely to use public benefits. The incoming president will also confront a challenging situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. Biden said during the campaign that he wants to lift the Trump administration's restrictions on asylum for migrants fleeing gangs and domestic violence. But it's unclear how the incoming administration would approach a central component of those restrictions known as Remain in Mexico, or, by its official title, the Migrant Protection Protocols. That policy has forced more than 60,000 migrants to wait for their day in U.S. immigration courts in dangerous Mexican border towns. Technically, the Biden administration could end Remain in Mexico with the stroke of a pen \u2014 but the logistics of what would happen next are more complicated. \"They really are in a difficult situation politically,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower levels of immigration. \"Immigration policy that will dwarf anything Trump did\" Krikorian said Remain in Mexico has been successful at deterring migration from Central America. If Biden puts a halt to the policy, Krikorian argues, \"that sends the message to people in El Salvador and Honduras and Guatemala that it's go time,\" potentially creating a new surge of migrants at the southern border. Ultimately, Biden's ability to overhaul the nation's immigration system will depend largely on which party controls the Senate. The president-elect has promised to send legislation to Congress in the first 100 days of his administration that would create a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. But that bill \u2014 as well as any other ambitious agenda items that require congressional approval \u2014 would face an uphill battle if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Short of that, a Biden administration could still use its executive authority to reshape the immigration system piece by piece, as the Trump administration has done. \"The Biden people can undertake a level of change in immigration policy that will dwarf anything Trump did even without getting anything through Congress,\" said Krikorian, who argues that federal courts may be more receptive to Biden's immigration agenda than they were to Trump's. But other observers say that's unlikely. \"During the Trump administration, immigration was the top policy priority,\" Pierce said. \"They poured everything they had into enacting their agenda. I think under a Biden administration, we're about to see the pace of immigration changes slowed down significantly.\"",

While many world leaders have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden, Russia and China have held off.\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Demianchuk/TASS via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian dolls with the likenesses of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at a gift shop in Russia. While many world leaders have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden, Russia and China have held off. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his victory. So have the leaders of Hungary, India and the Philippines, among others. But Russia, China, Brazil and Mexico have conspicuously held back, as President Trump refuses to concede election defeat. The president accuses Democrats of fraud, launching an uphill legal fight to contest the results. The Kremlin said Monday that it would be premature to recognize Biden at this point, despite major U.S. news organizations calling the election for the former vice president on Saturday. \"We believe it's correct to wait for the official results of the elections to be announced,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a telephone briefing, according to the state-run TASS news agency. \"[We] hope that we will be able to establish a dialogue with the next U.S. president and agree together on ways to normalize our bilateral relations,\" Peskov added. During the 2016 campaign, Trump talked about his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin, only to deny later that he'd ever met the Russian leader. U.S. ties with Moscow have been strained, especially due to evidence of the Kremlin's attempts to interfere in the U.S. political process. In September, Trump said of Putin, \"He likes me, I like him \u2014 not so bad.\" The administration's relationship with China has been decidedly more hostile, amid an ongoing trade dispute and the president's harsh criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Although Biden is likely to take a more measured approach to the Sino-U.S. relationship, he has nonetheless been critical of China, saying President Xi Jinping doesn't have \"a democratic \u2014 with a small 'd' \u2014 bone in his body,\" and calling him a \"thug\" for his crackdown on minority Uighurs. Beijing, like Russia, says it's taking a wait-and-see approach. \"We noticed that Mr. Biden has declared election victory,\" Wang Wenbin said at a daily media briefing in Beijing. \"We understand that the U.S. presidential election result will be determined following U.S. law and procedures.\" \"We always believe that China and the United States should enhance communication and dialogue, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and promote sound and stable development of bilateral relations,\" Wang said. China hasn't congratulated Biden on his victory as quickly as Western countries did. I think it's because China needs to keep larger distance from the US presidential election to avoid getting entangled in its controversy. This actually shows that China respects the US as a whole In a tweet, Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said he thinks China hasn't congratulated Biden because it \"needs to keep larger distance from the U.S. presidential election to avoid getting entangled in its controversy.\" So far, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has been in no rush to congratulate Biden. Despite Trump's border wall plan and his threat last year to slap tariffs on Mexican products unless L\u00f3pez Obrador's government cracked down on Central American migrants seeking to cross into the U.S., the two leaders have maintained cordial relations. Speaking on Saturday, L\u00f3pez Obrador said: \"President Trump has been very respectful of us, and we have reached very good agreements, and we thank him because he has not interfered and has respected us.\" Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, often referred to as the \"Trump of the Tropics\" for his bravado, right-wing politics and populist message, openly rooted for Trump to win reelection. In the final stages of the campaign, Bolsonaro talked about attending Trump's inauguration. Bolsonaro has been silent on the matter since the election was called for Biden. The president-elect has made it clear that, unlike Trump, a Biden administration will confront Bolsonaro over his government's handling of the Amazon rainforest. The Brazilian leader has allowed farmers and loggers to clear rainforest land. Bolsonaro has also insisted that it is a \"fallacy\" to see the Amazon as the heritage of humanity, saying it belongs to the people of Brazil.

That's something he'll need to consider as he sorts through which parts of his agenda to push first. Updated at 2:42 p.m. ET President-elect Joe Biden will take office in January with a lot of promises to keep. He has pledged to enact new policies swiftly that veer the U.S. off President Trump's current path. Biden ran a heavily policy-focused campaign, releasing dozens of lengthy and ambitious plans ranging from large-scale economic and environmental initiatives to broad actions on racial justice, education and health care. A significant amount of Biden's agenda also centers on reversing or updating positions taken by the Trump administration, especially on immigration and foreign policy. Biden heads into office with strategies to address the COVID-19 crisis and the search for a vaccine as well. The sheer volume of Biden's plans could make it a challenge to execute them all. On immigration alone, he has proposed more than a dozen initiatives to complete within 100 days of taking office, a feat that could prove difficult to execute. As the president-elect sorts through which priorities to push first, he'll need to consider that he is likely to face a divided Congress. Control of the Senate is still up in the air, with two Georgia runoff elections set for January, but Republicans are poised to maintain control. Democrats also have a slimmer majority in the House of Representatives, where the GOP made gains contrary to most party leaders' and analysts' predictions. The political dynamic on Capitol Hill means Biden may have to pull back from some policy proposals that many on the left of his party have been pushing on health care and the environment. He will likely need to focus more immediately on issues that could attract bipartisan support, such as providing COVID-19 relief and improving U.S. infrastructure. NPR has taken a look through some of Biden's promises and short-term goals for his presidency, some of which are laid out on a new transition website. Here's what might be coming: COVID-19: Assemble a coronavirus task force during his presidential transition Days after becoming president-elect, Biden announced a team of advisers that will spearhead his pandemic response once he takes office. The task force will be led by Dr. David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner; former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine. \"The advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations,\" Biden said in a statement Monday morning. COVID-19: Push for immediate coronavirus legislation As part of this initiative, the president-elect has also promised to begin working on a new coronavirus aid package before officially taking office, vowing to coordinate with state governors, mayors and other local politicians. \"I'll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January with all the resources to see how both our public health and economic response can be seen through the end,\" he said at an event in late October. Biden's proposed COVID-19 response plan calls for expanding coronavirus testing resources as well as for increasing the country's capacity to make personal protective equipment by leveraging the Defense Production Act. He has also backed legislation that would create a separate COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, which Vice President-elect Kamala Harris proposed in the Senate in the spring. As part of a COVID-19 relief package, Biden has in the past called for at least $10,000 in student loan debt to be canceled for all Americans. COVID-19: Release a vaccine distribution plan Biden has said he'll start working to install \"an effective distribution plan\" for a potential COVID-19 vaccine on the first day of his presidency. His plan would spend $25 billion on vaccine production and disbursement, and calls for an eventual vaccine to be free for all Americans. Biden has expressed skepticism over the Trump administration's promises to provide a vaccine quickly.  Trump has said he will have a vaccine ready for distribution by the end of 2020. COVID-19: Listen to science by rejoining WHO and keeping Fauci as a close adviser As president, Biden says he will mend the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization, rejoining the body on his first day in office. Trump pulled out of WHO over the summer. Biden also said that he plans \"immediately\" to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, to stay in his post as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a job he's had since 1984. Trump had hinted that if he won the election, he might fire Fauci. Economy: Reverse Trump's corporate tax cut Biden has pledged that on his first day as president he will raise corporate income taxes to 28% \u2014 compared with the current 21% rate set by the GOP-led tax cuts of 2017. Also, this promise falls under Biden's larger proposed tax plan, which stresses that Americans making less than $400,000 would not pay more in taxes. Environment: Make the U.S. an international leader on climate change In one of his longest-standing campaign promises, Biden heads into office planning to reenter the U.S. immediately into the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015. Trump's move to pull the U.S. out of the agreement became official this month after a mandatory one-year waiting period that started when the president formally notified the United Nations. Racial equity: Extend the Voting Rights Act Biden has pushed for the passage of laws to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Legislation to do so passed the U.S. House last year but not the Senate. Biden advocated for extending the original 1965 legislation following the death of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. Immigration: Comprehensive immigration changes Biden has said that on his first day as president he will produce comprehensive immigration legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship for 11 million migrants living in the U.S. illegally. It would also provide a pathway to citizenship for people commonly known as DREAMers, who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Biden has additionally pledged to make the DACA program permanent on his first day in office, a move that comes after years of Trump administration attempts to rescind the program. Immigration: Stop family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border The president-elect has vowed to stop the practice of separating immigrant families trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. On Day 1 as president, Biden has said he plans to pass an executive order establishing a task force focused on reuniting children and parents separated at the border. Immigration: End Trump's executive order banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries Biden says he will \"immediately rescind\" current restrictions that bar people in some Muslim-majority countries from traveling or immigrating to the United States. He supports legislation that would outlaw such restrictions and has vowed to sign off on it as president. Immigration: Reverse a slew of Trump policies, including the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall Within the first 100 days of his administration, Biden says he wants to reform the U.S. asylum system and the treatment of people at the border with Mexico, specifically calling for a stop to the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols as well as to the policy of \"metering\" asylum cases. The president-elect also pledges to take away funding toward continued construction of a wall along the southern U.S. border. But Biden says he wouldn't take down parts of the wall that have already been built. The president-elect's immigration plan also would increase government supervision over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, calling for the need to hold personnel \"accountable for inhumane treatment.\" This comes as a whistleblower complaint was filed in September concerning medical conditions at a Georgia immigrant detention center. Criminal justice: Increase police reform In response to the national outcry that erupted over police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans, Biden said he will institute a national police oversight commission within his first 100 days of taking office. It's part of a larger plan to help overhaul policing, including investing $300 million into community policing measures across the U.S. and tasking the Justice Department with investigating possible issues of police and prosecutorial misconduct. Criminal justice: Enact comprehensive criminal justice reform As the first step in a set of goals addressing prison reform and crime prevention, Biden says he will quickly push Congress to pass the SAFE Justice Act, proposed by Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. The legislation would include taking steps to reduce the use of mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenses and institute policies geared at lowering recidivism. Foreign policy: Repair alliances and plan a global Summit for Democracy Biden has said he intends to \"pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy,\" vowing to reach out to U.S. allies soon after taking office. Within his first year, Biden wants to plan an international summit where democratic leaders will discuss ways to push back against corruption and authoritarian practices as well as expand human rights. Biden also wants to organize a \"climate world summit\" to assist nations with high carbon emissions to take climate action. Questions remain about how either summit would be doable during a global pandemic. It's not clear when we might start seeing some of Biden's big plans for the economy, environment, education system and health care take form \u2014 especially as the president-elect may enter the White House with a divided Congress. That said, these plans were substantial parts of his campaign, and his administration is likely to begin addressing them. Economy: Make major investments in the U.S. economy to boost domestic growth Biden hopes to create 5 million jobs through a series of large investments geared at benefiting different business areas. His proposed \"Made in America\" plan would pour $400 billion into procurement measures to boost domestic manufacturing as well as an additional $300 billion into research and development. Environment: Start on a $2 trillion climate plan The president-elect also heads into office with an extensive set of environmental goals proposed through his clean energy plan, which includes getting the country to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The proposal calls for a $2 trillion investment, throughout his term, to boost reliance on clean energy and climate sustainable practices. Biden also says that 40% of the funding will be used to support communities disproportionately affected by climate change, as laid out in his environmental justice plan. Health care: Build on the Affordable Care Act if it isn't too late A large part of Biden's health care proposal offers a new public option plan that builds on the existing Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But the ACA's fate remains in question during the rest of Trump's term and into next year. On Nov. 10, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments against the ACA from the Trump administration and multiple states. If the justices side with Trump next year when they make their decision, Biden's plans for health care could completely change. Education: Make first moves in a large education agenda Biden has laid out extensive plans for changes to higher education as well as pre-K through high school, but he has not expressed many clear deadlines during his first year. Notably, the president-elect has expressed support for the College for All Act, proposed in 2017 by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., which would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities for families making up to $125,000. Biden also is advocating for private historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions to be tuition-free.

Though he is now U.S. president-elect, Biden will have to await outcomes of January run-off races in the Senate to know much support he's likely to get there for his health care agenda.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Biden rallied supporters Wednesday, Nov. 4, in Wilmington, Del. Though he is now U.S. president-elect, Biden will have to await outcomes of January run-off races in the Senate to know much support he's likely to get there for his health care agenda. As of Jan. 20, 2021 \u2014 Inauguration Day \u2014 the federal government is about to get much more involved in health care and the COVID-19 pandemic response. Exactly how much more involved, now that Joe Biden is president-elect, depends on whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. And that likely won't be determined until early January, when Georgia's two Senate run-off races are held. Trump's nearly four years as president have been marked by a scaled-back federal investment and involvement in health care in a range of ways \u2014 giving states more authority to run their own health insurance markets, for example, and leaving them to come up with their own strategies for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and more. Biden's pledge during the campaign was to reverse that trend. He wants to double-down and invest in the changes the Affordable Care Act made to the country's health care system, he says. He wants to pour trillions into a unified coronavirus strategy. And he wants to work with Congress to create a Medicare-like public insurance plan that anyone can buy into \u2014 what he's called the \"public option.\" Here's a guide to his policy platforms and promises related to health care. Again, how much he's able to deliver on will in some cases depend on what happens in the Senate. ISSUE: The Affordable Care Act Starting Tuesday, long before Biden is inaugurated in January, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The court's decision likely won't come until spring, and in the meantime, the Biden administration could try to make the case against the law moot. \"There are a couple of things Congress could do to make it so there's actually no nothing to litigate \u2014 so the Supreme Court wouldn't have to decide this case, it would just go away,\" says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Even if Republicans control the Senate, she says, it still might be possible for Congress and the White House to find a compromise. \"I don't think the litigation is a win for Republicans politically, and so they may just be perfectly happy to work out a deal.\" If the Supreme Court does overturn the law next spring and Congress fails to make that deal, President Biden and Congress would have to work quickly to come up with another way to address the possibility of tens of millions of people becoming uninsured amid a pandemic. \"I think it would be savvy for the Biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care.\" Jamila Michener, Cornell University Assuming the ACA does survive this latest Supreme Court challenge, Biden has said he wants to \"build on\" the law. For example, he wants to address complaints that ACA premiums are unaffordable \u2014 the current law only provides federal premium subsidies for households that make up to 400% of the federal poverty level. Biden's plan would expand these subsidies to include people who make more money than that. He would also reverse some of the ways the Trump administration has tried to undercut the exchanges; Biden says he would restore funding for ACA consumer outreach and for help with ACA sign-ups. The most significant change he would like to make to the ACA is creating a Medicare-like program that would be a \"public option\" \u2014 a health insurance program administered by the federal government, just as Medicare is, but available to people of any age \u2014 that could compete against private insurance plans in the marketplace. This idea was part of the original ACA but did not make it into the final law. \"A Medicare-like public option would likely be substantially less expensive than current private insurance plans,\" explains Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"That's because of the leverage the government would have to drive down the prices of doctor visits and hospital care.\" One example of how this works is in payment rates for doctors and other providers: \"Medicare pays hospitals about half of what private insurance companies pay, so a Medicare-like public option at Medicare prices would be much less expensive than private insurance plans,\" Levitt says. Plus, he says, \"the government-sponsored insurance plan also wouldn't have a profit margin like private insurers have, which would also help lower premiums.\" But, Levitt says, the public option is one of many health care ideas Biden campaigned on that \"are likely dead in the water if Republicans keep control of the Senate.\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, agrees: \"I don't see any of that being easy for Republicans in the Senate to tolerate.\" ISSUE: COVID-19 Pandemic Early Monday morning, Biden announced a COVID-19 advisory board to, as he said in his victory speech, \"help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January 20, 2021.\" Also Monday, Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate appears to be working, at least in preliminary evidence from tests in people. Biden released a statement calling the news \"excellent\" but warned that widespread vaccination is many months away and that \"Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year.\" Biden will be taking office with the coronavirus blazing through the country \u2014 new records of cases and deaths are becoming routine, and more than 237,500 Americans have already died from COVID-19. \"Among health care issues, there's no question the pandemic is top of the list right now,\" notes Levitt. \"The pandemic will still be with us for quite some time and will likely dominate the next presidential term.\" Biden has remarked often that he would \"listen to science\" in his approach to stopping the pandemic, whereas Trump has repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials. Biden has pledged to put the federal government in charge of a nationally coordinated COVID-19 response, once he has the presidential reigns in January, and to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other personal protective equipment. While Trump has deferred to the states to come up with and implement testing strategies, Biden wants to establish a Pandemic Testing Board that would coordinate a nationwide response. Among other goals the board would increase drive-by testing twofold and push for the creation of at-home tests and instant tests. Like Trump, Biden has pledged to guarantee free coronavirus testing regardless of a person's insurance status. He also has said he would subsidize health insurance coverage for people who are relying on COBRA health insurance because of a job-loss during the COVID-19 emergency. Contact tracing has also been left to the states until now, though few states have enough contact tracers to help keep the spread of the virus at bay. An NPR survey estimates there are 53,000 contact tracers across the country \u2014 Biden would like to create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize 100,000 contact tracers. Similar ideas have been floated already by Democrats in Congress, although \u2014 again \u2014 whether such a plan could be passed into law depends in part on which party controls the Senate. And while the Trump administration invested around $12 billion in the development of potential vaccines to fight COVID-19, negotiations between the White House and Congress over a new COVID-19 relief bill that would include money to distribute those vaccines along with other stimulus measures, have stalled. There does seem to be bipartisan support for this funding, but it's unclear if a new relief bill can happen before inauguration day. Biden will likely push hard for this and other vaccine-related funding: His platform calls for an investment of $25 billion in vaccine manufacturing and distribution. \"I think it would be savvy for the Biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care,\" says Jamila Michener, co-director of the Center for Health Equity at Cornell University. \"The pandemic gives you an opening to, for example, rebuild and further build the public health workforce.\" Michener says Biden could also support federal health agencies such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 agencies \"that the Biden administration has immediate and influence over, that [under Trump] have very much been eroded and are just kind of flailing in the wind.\" ISSUE: Medicare & Medicaid When it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health programs that together provide coverage to 115 million people, Biden has signaled he wants to expand eligibility for these programs. For Medicare, the federal program for people over 65, and certain younger people with disabilities. Biden has said he would like to allow people to enroll as early as age 60 and make dental, vision and hearing coverage standard issue in traditional Medicare. Currently, most Medicare beneficiaries have to buy a supplemental policy to add on those benefits. In a divided Congress, these changes to Medicare that would cost taxpayers more money aren't likely to make it into law. \"I've never seen any appetite on the Republican side of the aisle for something that would have greater Medicare spending,\" says Holtz-Eakin. \"That's not the way they typically run.\" In terms of Medicaid, the state-run program for low-income adults, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, \"we shouldn't underestimate the powers that lie in the executive branch,\" Michener says. States and the federal government jointly fund Medicaid. Trump's administration has been creative in how it encouraged states to change the program, she explains, \"like allowing for eligibility and enrollment restrictions, restricting benefits, increasing co-pays, increasing or requiring premiums, [and] implementing work reporting requirements.\" There's no reason why the Biden administration couldn't do the same, although to very different policy ends. More progressive or liberal states might ask the federal government to be able to use Medicaid funding for housing costs, for instance, Michener says. \"Because the notion is that housing is health,\" she explains. \"So if we can support people in keeping them housed in a variety of ways, whether it's paying for legal services for people who are being potentially evicted, or what have you, then that might be part of how we think about what a program like Medicaid can do to maintain health outside of the narrow confines of hospitals or doctors offices.\" Biden has also talked about Medicaid expansion, a key part of the ACA that expanded coverage to more than 12 million people. Only about a dozen states have declined to adopt expansion of the program. Biden campaigned on the idea that the new public option could help fill the need for low-income people who don't qualify for Medicaid in those states that haven't expanded eligibility. If the public option can't get through Congress, though, it's unclear how the Biden administration might address this issue. Biden may also move to reverse the executive actions Trump took to limit health care options for immigrants, which is another \"one of the areas where Biden could do a lot administratively without Congress,\" Levitt says. That may include reversing the \"public charge\" rule, which aimed to deny green cards to some immigrants who use food stamps or other public benefits. (On Nov. 2, a federal judge blocked enforcement of Trump's public charge rule.) Biden has also said he wants to expand ACA coverage to DACA recipients, and allow undocumented immigrants to purchase plans in the ACA marketplaces, although without federal subsidies. ISSUE: Drug & Health Care Costs This is the area in health policy where Biden's policies might be most like President Trump's. Both of them have said they want to end surprise medical billing and bring down prescription drug prices, and they even agree on some ideas about how to do that. A key way in which Biden differs from Trump in his favored way to lower drug prices is Biden's support for allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. This was an important part of the drug pricing law the House of Representatives passed in 2019, but was a nonstarter for the Senate led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. If Republicans maintain control of the Senate and McConnell remains majority leader, this is very unlikely to get through Congress. But there is the potential for bipartisan agreement on other measures to bring down drug costs, and to help remedy the problem of sky-high medical bills. \"I could see surprise medical bills being dealt with\" in the next administration, Holtz-Eakin says. The practice of surprise billing \u2014 when, for example, a patient goes to an in-network hospital but is treated by out-of-network providers who then bill the patient directly \u2014 is a particular problem that Congress has tried to address. Out-of-network surgical assistants (health care providers the patient never met) have become an increasing problem in this regard, policy analysts say, and surprise \"hospital facility fees\" are another problem. Surprise bills and skimpy, or high deductible-insurance plans have forced many Americans into medical bankruptcy. Trump pushed hard on Congress to deal with surprise billing from out-of-network health care providers, and lawmakers got close last December, but ultimately failed to come to an agreement about how to get it done. Biden has also said he would like to end the practice, but hasn't explained which approach he would support. ISSUE: Other Key Health Issues Beyond the big ticket health policy items of the Affordable Care Act and the pandemic, \"there are a whole host of health care issues where I would expect a Biden administration to move to reverse much of what President Trump has done,\" says Levitt. \"For example, in reproductive health, President Trump has restricted federal funding for agencies that provide abortion counseling like Planned Parenthood,\" Levitt says. \"Biden has opposed that and I would expect him to reverse those restrictions.\" Not only does Biden support Roe v. Wade, he has said he wants to codify its protections in law. His administration would likely make moves to allow more federal funding for abortion and to ensure no-cost contraception coverage for more employees. Trump put some effort into the opioid crisis \u2014 he declared in a public health emergency and created a plan to address it, though the Government Accountability Office and other opioid policy experts say the implementation of that policy has fallen flat. Biden has said he wants to increase access to treatment services for opioid use disorder, curb opioid prescriptions and prosecute pharmaceutical companies that helped feed the nation's addiction problems. Then there are the significant racial health disparities laid bare by the pandemic. \"Some of the bigger picture health policy pieces that the Biden administration is going to pursue are going to be kind of disproportionately beneficial for people of color,\" Michener says. She's also heard the Biden campaign pledge to address racial disparities more head on, for instance by addressing maternal mortality. The Trump administration also has been criticized for not doing enough to address the significant racial disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic, including by not releasing demographic data that demonstrated how communities of color were significantly harder hit in terms of cases of the illness and deaths. Better access and analysis of data around racial health outcomes for COVID-19, Michener says, is \"the low-hanging fruit that will easily be plucked by the Biden administration.\"",

Kamala Harris at his side. World leaders reacted to Biden's victory, mostly congratulating the president-elect and vice president-elect. Updated at 12:44 p.m. ET Sunday World leaders have acknowledged \u2014 and even celebrated \u2014 the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in the 2020 United States presidential election. Even one of President Trump's most fervent allies, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, eventually congratulated Biden, tweeting on Sunday that he was a \"great friend\" of Israel. But there are still holdouts. Russia's Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro remain silent. And the leader of Melania Trump's home country, Slovenia, is spreading conspiracy theories about a rigged vote. The Slovenian prime minister, Janez Jansa, belongs to a clique of European populists who share Trump's disdain for migrants, dissent and the media. These populists, led by Hungary's Viktor Orban, claim Brussels is run by liberal elites working with George Soros, the financier demonized by far-right nationalists on both sides of the Atlantic. Orban finally acknowledged Biden's win on Sunday, telling a news agency that Biden had run a \"successful campaign.\" The lukewarm tone mirrored that of another Trump ally in Europe, Polish president Andrzej Duda. Jansa, who served prison time on corruption charges, is known for using Twitter to attack his political opponents. Jansa was ridiculed for (prematurely) congratulating Trump on Wednesday, when the president declared himself the winner, and has since tweeted baseless accusations of voter fraud. Government-controlled media in Slovenia and Hungary have repeated that false claim. Here's a snapshot of reactions from around the world: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he looks forward to working with Biden, Harris and the incoming administration. \"Our shared geography, common interests, deep personal connections, and strong economic ties make us close friends, partners, and allies,\" Trudeau said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also congratulated Harris' historic win as the first woman to be vice president-elect, and praised the relationship between Germany and the U.S. \"Our transatlantic friendship is irreplaceable if we are to master the great challenges of our time,\" Merkel said. Chancellor #Merkel congratulates @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. #Election2020 pic.twitter.com/A9Vwy1XYAR French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted, \"The Americans have chosen their President. Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris! We have a lot to do to overcome today's challenges. Let's work together!\" Macron had tried to develop a working relationship with Trump during the president's 2017 visit to France. But the leaders failed to see eye to eye on the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal: Trump withdrew the U.S. from both. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Twitter that his country \"is optimistic about the future of the strategic partnership\" with the United States. An alleged U.S. attempt at a quid pro quo with Ukraine over military funding was at the center of Trump's impeachment. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also offered a statement on Biden's election. \"I know Joe Biden as a strong supporter of our Alliance & look forward to working closely with him. A strong #NATO is good for both North America & Europe,\" Stoltenberg tweeted. Trump has been a vocal critic of NATO, which he called \"obsolete\" at one point. But he has also shown some enthusiasm for it. In the Middle East, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, tweeted that he looked forward to working with a Biden administration \"to continue strengthening the friendship between our countries.\" Trump was seen as siding with Saudi Arabia in 2017 during a rift that pitted other Gulf states against Qatar. Congratulations and well wishes to Biden and Harris also came from some leaders who have been Trump's closest international allies. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has had a cozy relationship with Trump, echoed other European leaders' sentiments as he looked toward the future. \"The US is our important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security,\" Johnson said in a statement posted to Twitter. Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris pic.twitter.com/xrpE99W4c4 Days ago, a spokesperson for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he was confident he could establish \"equally warm personal relations\" with Biden as he did with Trump. Duterte openly rooted for Trump during the election, and he had a remarkably poor relationship with former President Barack Obama over his criticisms of Duterte's bloody drug war. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 a right-wing nationalist who calls Trump a close friend \u2014 said Biden's work as vice president had been \"critical and invaluable\" to strengthening the India-U.S. relationship. Modi also praised the vice president-elect, who has Indian heritage through her mother. He called Harris' success \"pathbreaking and a matter of immense pride\" for Indian-Americans. \"I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership,\" Modi tweeted. Heartiest congratulations @KamalaHarris! Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi \u2014 whom Trump once reportedly referred to as \"my favorite dictator\" \u2014 was one of the first Arab leaders to congratulate Biden.  The Trump administration has removed blocks on military aid to Egypt that were previously imposed due to human rights concerns. But while most world leaders highlighted Biden's victory, others celebrated  Trump's defeat. Iran's state news agency quoted President Hassan Rouhani as saying the U.S. must now correct its \"false approach toward Iran in the past three years.\" In his comments, Rouhani made apparent reference to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world's major powers, which called for easing sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran pulling back on its nuclear program. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018 and has since reimposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Iran. Rouhani said the Iranian people had stood up to American \"economic terrorism\" under Trump and that it was time for the U.S. to return to \"honoring its commitments.\" Some Palestinian leaders also expressed relief at Trump's loss. \"America Detrumped! The world also needs to be able to breathe. Trumpism must be carefully scrutinized & remedied to restore the human, moral & legal equilibrium within and beyond the US,\" Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi tweeted. In Gaza, the political leader of the militant group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, called the Trump administration \"the most extremist in supporting the occupation at the expense of Palestinian national rights.\" Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy there \u2014 even though Palestinians seek part of the city for their future capital. \"We call on the elected administration to abandon the so-called deal of the century and to cancel the decision to consider Jerusalem as the capital of the occupation and to transfer the American embassy to it, \" Haniyeh said in a statement.

Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would be allowed to continue, and hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients breathed a collective sigh of relief. Writer Karla Cornejo Villavicencio has been one of those DACA recipients \u2014 but she's not interested in writing about \"Dreamers.\" And she doesn't want to be a poster child for the \"American Dream.\" She could be. She has the bonafides: former undocumented immigrant who graduated from Harvard and is now getting a Ph.D. at Yale. \"The American Dream is a pyramid scheme,\" she said. \"I am like one of the top sellers at Mary Kay, and I am recruiting so many people, and I need to warn them that they need to take care of their mental health. Because that is going to be the casualty, the price they pay for the American Dream.\" Her new book, The Undocumented Americans, is that warning. In it, Karla profiles people who've paid a steep price for the so-called American Dream. Including herself. She writes about her own struggles with mental illness. She weaves stories from her life with reporting and narratives of undocumented people she meets in five different cities: New York, Flint, Miami, Cleveland and New Haven. Their names have been changed and it's possible their stories have changed a bit, too. Karla leaves it up to the reader to decide what is fact, what is fiction and whether that even matters. In this episode, we hear why Karla wrote The Undocumented Americans : \"I wanted to tell the stories of people who work as day laborers. Housekeepers. Construction workers. Dog walkers. Delivery men. People who don't inspire hashtags or t-shirts.

Women from the Latinx community are being hurt more by the coronavirus pandemic than any other group. Not only are they facing higher infection rates but many are also losing their jobs or getting their work hours reduced. As a result of these hardships, a growing number of women say they are now motivated to vote for Democrat Joe Biden in the upcoming election, according to recent polling data by the Pew Research Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Among them are Latina workers like Gloria Mar\u00eda J\u00edmenez, of York, Pa., who lost her job at a local beauty supply distributor at the end of March due to the pandemic. J\u00edmenez was unemployed for almost half of this year, but last month she was lucky to find temporary work at a different beauty supply distributor a 35-minute drive away in Harrisburg, Pa. It will keep her employed through December, but she says the future is uncertain. 'Things have been tough' J\u00edmenez, 57, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who came from the Dominican Republic in the late 1980s. She lives with her adult daughter, Adelaida S\u00e1nchez, in battleground state Pennsylvania. \"Things have been tough,\" she says, noting she fell behind on rent. \"And the father of my children died in March of COVID. It's been too much for my daughter, who also lost her job at a restaurant. She's fallen into depression.\" Unemployment hits Latinx women harder because they are more likely to be the head of a single family and are the primary caretakers at home, caring for sick relatives and helping children navigate distant learning in this pandemic \u2014 an added stress, according to the Economic Policy Institute. J\u00edmenez says she wants the next president \"to create good jobs, affordable health care, housing and education.\" She says she takes medication for high blood pressure and that she and her daughter are covered under Medicaid. J\u00edmenez says she voted for both President George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush, but also for President Obama and Hillary Clinton. She says she didn't like what she heard from Trump on the campaign in 2016. J\u00edmenez's 28-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter are planning to vote for the first time for Biden. Gloria Mar\u00ed\u00ada J\u00edmenez, says she's voting in person in York, Pa., in this election not only to make her voice heard, but also to give voice to Latinx who can't vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Gloria Mar\u00ed\u00ada J\u00ed\u00admenez\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gloria Mar\u00ed\u00ada J\u00edmenez, says she's voting in person in York, Pa., in this election not only to make her voice heard, but also to give voice to Latinx who can't vote. Latinx women are heavily employed in some of the industries hardest hit by COVID-19. In the hospitality industry alone 14.6% of Latinas make up the workforce, higher than whites at 9%, as well as Latinx men at 11.6%. Retail and \"other services\" also employ a large percentage of Latinas, according to the Economic Policy Institute. In April one in five Latinx women workers were unemployed. \"They still haven't quite recovered in terms of their job market opportunities like men have,\" says Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew Research Center's director of Global Migration and Demography. Lopez says Latinx women are becoming more politically engaged and it could perhaps reflect a \"political awakening.\" He says the coronavirus pandemic is pushing women to vote for democratic candidates in this election in numbers greater than men. The 2018 elections showed historic participation with the number of Latinx voters nearly doubling from 2014 to 2018, according to the Pew Research Center. Many Latinx women are voting for the first time. Women like Lourdes V\u00e1zquez who is voting for Biden. After more than three decades living in the U.S. as a permanent resident, V\u00e1zquez became a U.S. citizen two years ago, she says. \"It's the dehumanizing rhetoric President Trump uses when referring to immigrants\" that drove her to file for U.S. citizenship, she says. \"Hearing the president calling us 'animals' and 'roaches' was very hurtful, very painful,\" says the 66-year old Mexican-born woman. \"I needed to raise my voice for change.\" V\u00e1zquez works for a local human rights organization but says she doesn't have health insurance. She decided to vote for Biden because among other things, she says Trump's rhetoric and policies have polarized the country and she thinks Biden can unite people. \"I hope he condemns racism and discrimination,\" she says. Lourdes V\u00e1zquez became a U.S. citizen two years ago and she's voting for the first time in this election. She's here with her daughter Yuridia Cruz, 30, a U.S.-born citizen.\n                \n                    \n                    Lourdes V\u00e1zquez\n                    \n                \nhide caption V\u00e1zquez says that she raised her two U.S.-born children to be politically engaged, even though she didn't have the privilege to vote, until now. \"Mama, I'm going to vote for you and me,\" her daughter, Yuridia Cruz, 30, would tell her. V\u00e1zquez voted already in Las Cruces, N.M., where she lives. \"I'm relieved,\" she says in a soft voice. Lourdes V\u00e1zquez is among more than 18,000 immigrants in New Mexico who have become citizens since 2014. About 57% of them are women and a majority from Mexico, according to a recently released report. These new citizens are expected to play a key role in this year's elections though the impact will depend on how many go to the polls. Despite the growing Latinx eligible voter population in the U.S., currently at 32 million, their electoral power has been historically limited by low voter turnout, according to the Pew Research Center. \"Latinos and Latinas are energized to vote now,\" says Clarissa Mart\u00ednez De Castro, deputy vice president with UnidosUS, the largest nonpartisan Latinx advocacy organization in the country. Mart\u00ednez De Castro says campaigns need to do a better job at voter registration outreach, especially targeting Latinx women. \"Often women are apolitical due to language barriers, feeling insecure about navigating the voting process and thinking that their vote won't make a difference,\" she says. She says Bernie Sanders' campaign successfully registered a high number of Latinx. \"It's not rocket science. It boils down to get to be known by the community, get your positions known in the community and do outreach. It pays off,\" she says. A recent UnidosUS survey shows that the issues energizing Latinx women in this election include \"an effective response to the pandemic, lowering the cost of health care and job creation,\" followed by growing concerns about discrimination against immigrants and Latinos, Mart\u00ednez De Castro says. \"I'm tired of seeing so much injustice,\" says voter Rosa Mar\u00eda Capell\u00e1n. \"Dreamers should be allowed to stay in this country,\" she says referring to participants of Obama's program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. It protects undocumented persons from deportation \u2014 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Capell\u00e1n, 66, is retired. She worked as a nurse in her native Dominican Republic, but in York, Pa., she sorted recycled materials in the office of waste and management, she says. She lives with her husband, her grown son and his family, including two grandchildren. Capell\u00e1n is the main caretaker in the family, she says. She and her diabetic husband tested positive for COVID-19 in June. Both have recovered. \"The stress of testing positive was worse than the symptoms,\" she says. She says she \"worried to death\" about her husband whose high fever would not subside for weeks, and also about infecting her son's family. Capell\u00e1n, who describes her family and herself as devout Christians, says, \"President Trump lacks humanity, he's selfish and arrogant.\" She says Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic reflects that. \"People, especially people of color, are dying from COVID-19 and he's not doing anything.\" She says the administration's inaction feels racist to her. According to a recent survey, Latinx women could change the election. With the crushing impact of the coronavirus on the Latinx community, more than 50% of Latinx women disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic, 77% say Trump ignored early COVID-19 warning signs and downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic, and 67% say they'll vote for Biden. \"These are the most important elections of our lives as immigrants, as people of color and women,\" says Jossie Flor Sapunar, communications director at Casa in Action, an organization that has been doing voter outreach work in immigrant and people of color communities in the Mid-Atlantic region for the past 10 years. She says the Trump administration has demonstrated it's \"very anti-immigrant, very anti-Black.\" If these elections don't bring about change, she says, \"We as Latinos, as immigrants, as people of color are in big trouble because that means the policies that will turn out in these next four years are going to attack us.\"",

The public option plan is described as available to all Americans, \"whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether,\" adding that the option is \"like Medicare\" \u2014 but is not Medicare. The public option would be offered with no premiums to Americans who live in states that don't have access to Medicaid benefits that they would qualify for in other states. Though not explicitly mentioned in his proposal, Biden has said that undocumented immigrants would be able to buy into the public option plan and receive unsubsidized coverage \u2014 an option currently not allowed under the Affordable Care Act. In terms of lowering costs on the individual health insurance marketplace, his proposal would do away with the \"income cap\" \u2014 which currently stands at 400% of the federal poverty line \u2014 that enables eligibility to receive a tax credit to help pay for premiums. The plan also would ensure that no household is putting more than 8.5% of their earnings (instead of the current 9.86%) into health insurance plans. Biden's proposal would work to lower prescription drug prices within Medicare, create an independent commission to oversee and regulate the price of new drugs, and get rid of the tax breaks given to pharmaceutical corporations on advertising. On abortion access, Biden is in favor of restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. He does not support the so-called gag rule or the Hyde Amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortions. Biden backed the Hyde Amendment for a significant portion of his career and only came out against the legislation in July 2019, saying he could \"no longer support an amendment that makes that right [to an abortion] dependent on someone's ZIP code.\" Biden also wants to allocate $775 billion toward a plan for child and elder care. A lot of the funding would go toward cutting Medicaid waitlists for people needing home and community care, and to provide tax breaks to people who care for older family members. Biden also pledges to invest in further health care employment, training 35,000 workers on how to aid Americans suffering from opioid addictions and adding \"tens of thousands\" of new jobs caring for veterans. Biden also calls for the creation of a public health jobs corps, which would employ more than 100,000 Americans as health care workers in medically underserved communities to work in disease prevention. Among items on his second-term agenda bullet points, Trump wants to lower the prices of prescription drugs, lower insurance premiums and provide access to coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. Trump is against keeping the Affordable Care Act, but he hasn't proposed a detailed alternative. During an ABC town hall last month, Trump was unable to explain his campaign's proposed alternative other than saying the current law is \"too expensive.\" He also did not outline a plan in the first presidential debate against Biden. The Trump administration and several Republican-led states are arguing at the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act should now be void \u2014 an argument that would end existing protections for those with preexisting conditions. Trump has attempted to usher through prescription drug reforms via a series of executive orders signed in July and September, though the timeline for seeing these policies implemented remains uncertain. A notable order would lower drug prices for those on Medicare parts B and D to comparable costs seen internationally. He also pledged to send $200 drug cards to all Americans using Medicare in an effort to supplement the cost of prescription drugs \u2014 though health experts are skeptical of the plan's long-term benefits for lowering prices. Plus the White House's suggested process for paying for the plan remains uncertain. Trump has also backed an end to surprise billing, which members of Congress have sought to take up.

This includes stopping construction on the border wall, fully eliminating the practice of separating immigrant families at the U.S. border and ending current bans on people from certain Muslim-majority countries traveling to the United States. Biden also calls for a reversal of Trump's restrictions toward granting asylum and temporary protected status and instead wants to raise the cap on the number of refugees brought into the country to 125,000 per year. Biden additionally has pledged to work to make the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, permanent on his first day as president. His immigration plan notably pushes for further oversight, regulation and instruction of Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, saying the agencies must \"abide by professional standards\" as well as be \"held accountable for inhumane treatment,\" given a series of reported abuses. As for new policy implementation, Biden says he will \"modernize\" the nation's immigration infrastructure, vowing, on Day 1, to send legislation to Congress that would offer a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented people in the country. He's also called for a moratorium on deportations during the first 100 days of his administration. On obtaining visas, Biden says he wants to make both permanent and temporary work visas more accessible. Biden is additionally proposing several initiatives through the federal government's Task Force on New Americans, aimed at supporting immigrants living in the United States. This task force would create local offices of immigrant affairs and informational hubs throughout the country that would provide resources on accessible health care and education systems as well as employment opportunities. Trump's second-term agenda on immigration builds on the foundation he set in his first term, notably continuing construction of the border wall, restricting immigration and opposing so-called sanctuary cities, where local law enforcement has limited coordination with federal immigration officials. His campaign singles out the need to end human trafficking and remove \"non-citizen gang members\" from the country but gives no plan or further explanation on those processes. His campaign has not released further details on any of these goals. Recently in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Trump has tightened regulations on legal immigration and international work travel to the U.S. by limiting the distribution of visas, arguing it will help boost American employment. The U.S. has also taken steps to limit people successfully obtaining asylum. See more of the major presidential candidates' key policy agendas here.

            "article_content": "President Trump has warned voters about an influx of immigrants if Joe Biden takes the White House, while Biden has promised to dismantle the Trump administration's immigration policy.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Election Day is less than three weeks away, and we're going to spend the next few days digging into the candidates' positions on some of the key issues. We begin with immigration. It has been a consistent policy priority since Day 1 of the Trump administration. AILSA CHANG, HOST: And, indeed, President Trump continues to crack down on immigration, closing the southern border to migrants and slashing the number of foreign workers allowed into the country. But on the campaign trail, he rarely brings the topic up. Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, promises to systematically undo nearly every one of the changes Trump has made to the nation's immigration system. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration, and he's going to give us more detail about how each man would handle immigration policy. Hey, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So tell us what President Trump has been saying about immigration in the closing weeks before the election. ROSE: Well, it has come up but not as much as you might expect. Remember; immigration was one of Trump's signature issues in 2016. He kicked off his campaign five years ago talking about Mexican immigrants as rapists and rolled all the - rode all the way to the White House on chants of, build the wall. In a second term, we could expect more of the same. He's still using that kind of rhetoric, painting immigrants as a threat and a burden. Here he is talking a few weeks ago in Minnesota, which has the country's largest population of Somali refugees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp - and he said that - overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools and inundating your hospitals. You know that. It's already there. It's a disgrace what they've done to your state. It's just - it's absolutely - it's a disgrace, OK? ROSE: But that was only one line in a long speech. And often, immigration is not a major focus in his stump speeches. CHANG: Why do you think that is? ROSE: Well, for one thing, it's just not a burning issue for voters anymore. Polling shows that it's been overshadowed by the pandemic, by the economy and by racial inequality. There is also a theory among immigrant advocates that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has not been popular with moderate suburban voters that he needs to win over in some crucial swing states, especially the family separation policy of a few years ago. I talked to Marielena Hincapie, who's with the Biden campaign, who's - sorry - who's worked with the Biden campaign - excuse me. She's also the director of the National Immigration Law Center. MARIELENA HINCAPIE: On any given day, he's still scapegoating immigrants. And most importantly, we're seeing the policies are still - anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies are still being put in place. What's different now is that his attacks don't seem to be resonating as much as they have in the past. CHANG: Interesting - well, what about the president's most fervent supporters? I mean, what do they think of his relative silence on immigration right now? ROSE: Well, immigration restrictionists seem a little surprised. They think the president is missing an opportunity to tout his successes here. Overall, immigration plummeted by almost half in the first three years of his presidency. And since the pandemic began, he has cracked down even more. The administration is also racing to construct hundreds of miles of border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. I talked to Dan Stein. He's the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports lower levels of immigration. DAN STEIN: Trump, in a sense, is a victim of his own success between the travel ban and the security lockdowns and the suspension of various categories. For a lot of reasons, the immigration issue has dissipated as the administration has made these needed changes. And yet, for whatever reason, the campaign has decided not to move this issue front and center. ROSE: Stein thinks that Trump has a great story to tell American workers about how he is protecting their jobs. But Stein is concerned because a lot of Trump's accomplishments have come through executive actions, so they could be reversed by a President Biden. CHANG: OK, so that's President Trump's side of the immigration issue. What is former Vice President Joe Biden saying about how he would handle immigration? ROSE: Well, he has indeed promised to undo as much as he can of Trump's immigration agenda. Biden would end the travel ban on people from majority-Muslim countries, put a 100-day moratorium on deportations and stop building Trump's border wall. Here's Biden addressing a group of Latinx elected officials. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Trump fails to understand the basic truth of immigrants - that they're the incredible source of our nation's strength, and they always have been. On Day 1, I'm going to send Congress a bill - immigration reform. We'll focus on keeping families together. It's about families, including providing a clear road map to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. CHANG: Wow, a roadmap to citizenship - so Biden's agenda is not just about dismantling what Trump has done. ROSE: That's right. It's actually a very long and ambitious platform that would not only provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants here illegally, including the so-called DREAMers, but would also expand the number of visas that the U.S. issues and would end the use of for-profit immigration detention centers. In other words, Biden's agenda really has moved to the left a lot, even from the Obama platform of a few years ago. Remember; President Obama deported more than a million immigrants in his first term, far more even than President Trump. And immigration hardliners want to see Biden challenged on these positions, which they call amnesty and an invitation for more Central American migrants to flood the southern border. But so far, immigration just hasn't come up at either of the debates. CHANG: That is NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you, Joel. ROSE: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

These days, Miriam Robles spends a lot of time on the phone. In between her day job as an environmental justice organizer at Mi Familia Vota, a Latino political advocacy group that opposes President Trump, Robles phone-banks to register new voters. One new voter she's worked with is her 18-year-old brother, Kevin. \"I was super excited to get him registered,\" she says. \"I helped him fill out his primary ballot and made sure that he applied for [Arizona's] Permanent Early Voting List. For him, he is looking at this fiercely as something that he could do for his family.\" Robles says it's a bittersweet feeling, helping her brother perform his civic duty while she is unable to vote. Their father came to the United States from Mexico through a temporary work program in the '90s. Robles and her mother joined him in Phoenix when she was 3 years old under a visitor's visa. They all stayed. Her brother and sister were born in the U.S. and are citizens, but Robles remained undocumented and applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, better known as DACA, in high school. DACA is an Obama-era program that currently shields from deportation roughly 640,000 immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as children. Robles says growing up, there was always a looming fear for the safety of her family. \"That's definitely something that all children of undocumented parents have to go through, whether they're documented or not, is having that conversation of, 'If I get deported, this is what you need to do.' And that's a really scary conversation to have at any age,\" she says. \"Even today, I'm a 24-year-old, and I still have plans if something were to happen and I know exactly how I would make sure my siblings are safe and things like that.\" Only recently has Robles felt comfortable sharing her family's story. \"I grew up in a majority-white neighborhood,\" she says. \"So for me, it was even hard to talk about my status. I have friends who I've known 10 to 15 years, and I'm just now letting them know what my situation is because, you're obviously scared. I've had friends who have had their parents deported because someone called [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] on them.\" Of particular concern to Robles is a path toward protected status for her parents, and the DACA program itself. Shortly after taking office, Trump attempted to dismantle DACA. The Supreme Court recently sided with recipients in protecting the program, but the administration is still trying to scale it back. It has reduced the renewal period for current recipients from two years to one year, which doubles applicant fees, and has stopped processing new applications. Robles says she feels compelled to speak up now in a year that has brought a national reckoning on racial injustice. \"If I can see Black activists going out there and getting arrested and getting beaten, then why would I not want to do the bare minimum and share my story, you know?\" In her work and activism, Robles often faces a common refrain: that people have no plans to vote. \"They're like, 'Well [the impact of voting is] very marginal.' And so for me, what's been really important is to just come from a place of a lot of vulnerability and say, 'Some of us actually live in those margins and some of us, our lives are decided by those margins.' \" Robles also says it can feel disheartening to push so hard for people to vote, knowing it's not possible for her. \"I definitely get a little sad, but it also gives me hope. I think a lot of people have these fantasies of like what their future [will be] like. A lot of little girls always imagine, 'Oh, my wedding day.' For me, that's always been, 'Oh, the day that I become a citizen and get to vote!' \" Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, co-founder of United We Dream Action, an immigrant youth-led organization, says people such as Robles are the most effective messengers for political participation. \"When you hear from people whose lives have been impacted by a policy and by how we vote, that really builds the consciousness of people around us, that our vote matters a lot,\" she says. It's a story that's personal for Jim\u00e9nez, too. \"Growing up undocumented, not having the right to vote and living in this country for over 20 years, I will be voting for the first time after becoming a citizen last year,\" she says. \"This is my first presidential election. And when people [ask] me why am I passionate about this election, it's because I have experienced directly how policies that are voted on by elected officials have a direct impact on people's lives.\" Loading... United We Dream Action is also trying to organize as Trump runs for reelection, four years after building a base of support among mostly white, native-born voters, with an anti-immigrant platform that he's built on while in office. Though polls show Trump performing better with some minority groups than he did in 2016, his record while in office may help organizers such as Robles make voters who oppose Trump's policies more motivated to turn out than four years ago. She recalls a conversation with a white man who said he wasn't planning to vote because it wasn't worth it. \"There's a certain subset of Americans who definitely treat politics as a spectator sport as opposed to how I see it as a means of survival,\" she says. \"I did bring up how it's really easy to make these judgment calls when your life and your well-being isn't the one at stake. At that point, I don't know if changed his mind, but he definitely left with that to think about.\" Robles says she'll keep having those conversations right up to Election Day.",

SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: This year, Latinos will make up the nation's largest non-white voting bloc. Historically, they have supported Democrats by large margins. But this year, Latino leaders fear that an enthusiasm gap could keep many Latinos from voting. NPR's Adrian Florido reports. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Gabriel Carlos Leon is a 24-year-old Democrat from Arizona. He is going to vote for Joe Biden in November, but... GABRIEL CARLOS LEON: I don't feel good about it. I feel gross. I feel icky. FLORIDO: Leon wanted a more progressive candidate. He also has lots of undocumented friends, so immigration reform is important to him. But he worries that a Biden administration, just like the Obama administration, won't deliver that reform. LEON: Right now the Latino community is in a position where - like, we're held captive because the only people who are going to make the kind of political reforms, especially in the age of Trump, is going to be the Democratic Party. And I don't see anyone in the Democratic Party right now prioritizing it. FLORIDO: Thus his reluctant support for Biden - that disenchantment with this election, especially among many young Latinos, is something Maria Teresa Kumar has hurt a lot of this year. She's president of Voto Latino, which is trying to register half a million voters. It worried her when she started seeing young Latinos on social media saying there was no real difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. That's one reason Voto Latino issued its first-ever endorsement this year for Biden. MARIA TERESA KUMAR: What we didn't want to happen was what happened in the 2016 election, where once Bernie Sanders was no longer on the ticket, a lot of their supporters who happened to be a lot of young Latinos sat it out. FLORIDO: Her worry that many Latinos won't vote this year has been expressed by a lot of Latino leaders in recent days and speaks to what they say is a deeper problem - that Democrats aren't targeting Latinos hard enough. Sonja Diaz directs the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Initiative. SONJA DIAZ: I don't know that it makes sense for any voter to be enthusiastic about a product that is not clear and is not marketed to them. One of the things about the Latino vote is it seems like it's expected. FLORIDO: She says it's like how politicians have treated Latinos during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of them, including citizen children born to undocumented parents, have been excluded from relief programs. And yet... DIAZ: We're just expected to show up to work and keep America fed, safe and housed and die or become infected and infect our families. FLORIDO: Diaz says speaking directly to Latinos about their top concerns - the economy, health care, education - would build crucial support among the huge population of young Latinos just now aging into the electorate. The Biden campaign has said it's ramping up Latino outreach; so has the Trump campaign, targeting conservative Latinos in states like Florida where Trump and Biden are polling about even among Latino voters. Stephen Nuno-Perez of the polling firm Latino Decisions says despite a real enthusiasm gap among younger Latinos, Biden is enjoying overwhelming Latino support overall. STEPHEN NUNO-PEREZ: There is a well-settled, you know, up-and-coming middle class, largely Mexican American, who really just want to get past Donald Trump, right? They really just want to come back to some sense of normalcy. FLORIDO: The firm's polling also showed Biden's choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, a mixed race daughter of immigrants, gave him a boost among Latinos. NUNO-PEREZ: I think the question is, does that support hold? So far, we just don't see that it's not. FLORIDO: Erika Andrade lives in Connecticut. She's 50, an immigrant from Ecuador, teaches English to adult Spanish speakers. In 2016, she voted for Donald Trump. ERIKA ANDRADE: As much as I'm a Democrat, I have some liberal tendencies and very conservative tendencies - the Latina and I was raised Catholic. FLORIDO: But she soon came to believe Trump was threatening the democracy her family came to the U.S. for. This year, she is an enthusiastic Biden supporter. ANDRADE: Biden impressed me because he seems to be the one unifying force. And I just hope that Latinos come out and vote. FLORIDO: She said some of her English students have recently become U.S. citizens, and so she's asking them to please register and vote. Adrian Florido, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed to roll back many of President Trump's immigrations policies \u2014 but he faces obstacles.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed to roll back many of President Trump's immigrations policies \u2014 but he faces obstacles. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is pledging to dismantle the sweeping changes President Trump has made to the American immigration system, if he wins the White House in November. But that's easier said than done. \"I don't think it's realistic that Biden in four years could unroll everything that Trump did,\" says Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C. \"Because of the intense volume and pace of changes the Trump administration enacted while in office, even if we have a new administration, Trump will continue to have had an impact on immigration for years to come,\" Pierce says. The Trump administration has undertaken more than 400 executive actions on immigration, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Those include tougher border and interior enforcement, restricting asylum, rolling back Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), slashing refugee visas, streamlining immigration courts and creating Remain in Mexico. \"What the administration has sought to do is to simply turn off immigration and to do it unilaterally by presidential edict, without the approval of Congress or the consent of the American people,\" says Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. \"That project should be reversed.\" That's exactly what Biden pledges to do. His position paper on immigration \u2014 51 bullet points that fill 22 pages \u2014 seeks to roll back Trump's accomplishments and reenact Obama-era policies. \"If I'm elected president, we're going to immediately end Trump's assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. We're going to restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum-seekers,\" Biden said in his acceptance speech at the virtual Democratic National Convention. The former vice president has an exhaustive to-do list. Within his first 100 days, Biden says he would implement a wide range of policies: not another mile of border wall, no more separating families, no more prolonged detentions or deportations of peaceable, hardworking migrants. Biden also says he would restore the asylum system and support alternatives to immigrant detention, such as case management, that allow an applicant to live and work in the community while their case works its way through the hearing process. Trump has derisively called this \"catch and release.\" And Biden would fully reinstate DACA, which allows migrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to live and work without fear of deportation.

But if he's elected, Biden would face a host of obstacles that could slow his immigration counter-revolution. First, there's the specter of renewed chaos at the Southern border. Last year, groups as large as 1,000 Central Americans at a time waded across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Texas, to request asylum. The Border Patrol was overwhelmed and ended up detaining families in primitive, unsanitary conditions. Immigration hawks are wary that Biden would throw open the gates again. \"They don't want to create such a chaotic situation at the border by welcoming or incentivizing another massive influx from Central America,\" says Jerry Kammer, who is affiliated with the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on immigration. Federal border officials are worried what would happen if Biden cancels bilateral agreements with Mexico that have dramatically slowed the migrant flow. \"If Mexico right now decided they weren't going to continue to help us, people would start coming through like we saw in the caravans two springs ago. There's no reason that it wouldn't come back as bad as it was,\" says Ron Vitiello, former deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. NPR asked a senior adviser to the Biden campaign what would happen if a new president gave migrants a green light. The adviser said they are cognizant of that \"pull factor.\" In fact, the people most closely watching to see if Biden defeats Trump and reverses his immigration crackdown may be beyond U.S. borders. Some 700 migrants languish in filthy tents pitched in a public park amid mud, rats and clouds of mosquitoes. The encampment is in Matamoros, just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. They're seeking asylum in the U.S. but are stuck there under a Trump initiative known as Remain in Mexico. \"We place our hope in Joe Biden, who is the Democratic nominee, because he would treat the immigrants very differently than Trump has,\" says Carla Garcia, speaking at her cluttered campsite. She and her 7-year-old son are seeking protection in the United States after fleeing criminal gangs in Honduras. \"We hope he wins and changes all of this that Trump has created,\" Garcia says, motioning to the bedraggled camp. \"This is discrimination and racism.\" President Trump delivers remarks on Sept. 11 in Shanksville, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption For his part, the president is touting the success of Remain in Mexico, which the administration calls the Migrant Protection Protocols. \"We don't want 'em here. We want 'em outside,\" Trump told cheering supporters in Yuma, Ariz., last month. \"We got sued all over the place, and we won. So now they don't come into the United States. They can wait outside.\" While the president says he has single-handedly restored a broken immigration system, human rights advocates are appalled at what they call the cruelty of his policies. And immigrant advocates say they have high hopes that a new administration would rebuild the immigration system based on \"American values.\" \"There's no doubt about it, this is a monumental challenge,\" says Heidi Altman, director of policy for the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"That means a complete and utter reorientation of the culture of the agencies that administer immigration law and policy in the United States.\" But that's a tall order \u2014 and another obstacle Biden would face. Immigration agents have enjoyed extraordinary support from the White House over the past 45 months. The Trump administration has bragged about \"unshackling\" them to let them do their jobs more aggressively. \"That isn't something that's a light switch. You can't change culture within an organization that vast overnight,\" says Angela Kelley, senior adviser to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"So I agree that it's going to be a long, long road.\" For an example of how the Border Patrol is marching lockstep with the White House, look to a video titled \"The Gotaway,\" posted earlier this month. CBP produced an ominous, fictionalized video on the Border Patrol's YouTube channel that depicts a Latino migrant who had just escaped from agents, attacking and knifing a man in a dark alley. The video was released at a time when Trump has been stoking fears about violent immigrants at his campaign rallies. NPR inquired why the video was made and why it was removed a week later before being re-posted. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott said in a statement that the video was produced \"to enhance awareness that effective border security helps keep all Americans safe,\" and it was briefly pulled because they misused copyrighted materials. A Biden presidency also would likely find itself skirmishing with conservative lawyers the way the Trump administration has been tied up in federal courts fighting immigrant advocates. \"If Biden is elected and his administration starts rescinding executive actions that Trump had firm legal authority to do, groups like us will sue. That is a fact,\" says R.J. Hauman, head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"We did so under President Obama, and we'll do so again.\" Finally, there's the pandemic. An NPR/Ipsos poll shows that a majority of Americans support Trump's decision to shut the nation's borders to all types of immigrants to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Biden has not said if he would reverse that order to reopen the borders and jump-start the asylum process, which has been suspended. So it's anybody's guess when the virus will subside and the nation can welcome immigrants again.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris has been a senator for nearly four years before becoming Joe Biden's VP pick. She doesn't have a long list of passed legislation, but she's known for aggressive questioning of witnesses.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Joe Biden is following in the footsteps of his former boss, President Obama, in picking a former rival as his running mate. But before Kamala Harris ran for president and challenged Biden on the debate stage, she was the junior senator from California. Well, she's still the junior senator from California, and it's in that role that she has made a name for herself as an aggressive questioner in Senate committee rooms. We're going to talk about Harris' Senate career and how that career has positioned her for this moment with NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So Kamala Harris has only been Senator Harris for about 3 1/2 years - not so long in the grand scheme of Senate careers. How has she used her time there so far? SNELL: You know, not only is it not a lot of time in Senate time, but it's also time spent in the minority where it's notoriously difficult to get legislation passed. You know, her very first speech on the Senate floor was all about the DREAM Act, and that's the legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are brought to the country as children. And that has been kind of a central issue for her. She also works on justice-related issues like due process for immigrants. And that police reform bill that passed the House earlier this summer, she was a major figure in that. You know, at the same time, she was one of the main sponsors of a bill to make lynching a federal crime. Here's how she talked about the convergence of those issues. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: Black lives have not been taken seriously as being fully human and deserving of dignity. And it should not require a maiming or torture in order for us to recognize a lynching when we see it and recognize it by federal law. SNELL: So those are major issues for her. And, you know, she has been criticized for her background as a tough-on-crime attorney general back in California. But supporters say her record in the Senate has really been focused on justice and due process. KELLY: Speaking of the background that propelled her to the Senate, among other past lives, she was a prosecutor. How she used that experience? SNELL: You know, it has given her a reputation as a person who will ask direct and pointed questions. I'm thinking about the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She asked him to address specific abortion-related cases and whether or not they were correctly decided. She also got into a contentious exchange with him over his insistence that the investigation into allegations of his past sexual misconduct was a witch hunt. You know, that got a lot of national attention. And she - you know, her tough questioning really did frustrate President Trump, and it's something he's brought up repeatedly. He's called her treatment of Kavanaugh nasty, which is a term he has typically reserved for women. KELLY: So that is how the president says he sees her. What about how her colleagues in the Senate see her, Kelsey? As somebody who has walked those halls at Capitol Hill and watched a lot of Senate hearings, how is she perceived there? SNELL: You know, I've talked to a lot of her colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, and they say she's a very active member on the committees she works on. She does Intelligence and Judiciary and Homeland Security. People say she's the kind of member who does her homework, and she's a person who really wants to understand policy. They say she's tried to find bipartisan co-sponsors when she could, though we know that that is often difficult in Congress. They point to things like election security and maternal health. Though, I will say a major criticism that I've heard is that she doesn't have much of a track record of actually passing laws. Though, it is actually a tale of legislating in the Trump era writ large. It's hard to get legislation passed right now, and it hasn't really been the story of this Congress in general. So she works on some very sought-after committees, and it's given her a really big opportunity to be in the mix on issues like immigration that would be very important to the American story no matter who is president. KELLY: So pull it all together for us. What does her Senate career tell us about what kind of vice presidential candidate she's going to be? SNELL: Well, as we've said, we know she's not afraid of conflict and that she's direct and known for her follow-ups like we saw in primary debates where she was criticizing her running mate, Joe Biden, you know. And she's got a quick and ready response. I think a good example of her using that technique in the Senate was when she was questioning Attorney General William Barr. Here she is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRIS: Attorney General Barr, has the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone? WILLIAM BARR: I wouldn't... HARRIS: Yes or no. BARR: Could you repeat that question? HARRIS: I will repeat it. SNELL: So you hear there her kind of catching him off guard and moving him into a place where he had to come up with a response. And she's not afraid to step in if someone appears to be filibustering or answering insufficiently. So I expect to see more of that when she debates Vice President Mike Pence in the fall.

            "article_content": "Credit:  Video: NABJ-NAHJ, Image: KC McGinnis for NPR Joe Biden says that he believes prosecuting a former president would be a \"very unusual thing and probably not very ... good for democracy,\" but he would not stand in the way of a future Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump after he leaves office. The comments from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee came during a virtual interview Tuesday with members from the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists. \"Look, the Justice Department is not the president's private law firm. The attorney general is not the president's private lawyer. I will not interfere with the Justice Department's judgment of whether or not they think they should pursue the prosecution of anyone that they think has violated the law,\" Biden told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Trump has been connected with alleged illegal activity by his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and investigators working for former special counsel Robert Mueller. What isn't clear is whether federal authorities are investigating the president or whether prosecutors might take action against Trump if he no longer enjoyed the privileges that protect him from being indicted as a sitting president. Biden made clear that any future prosecution against Trump would not be directed by him if he's elected president. \"In terms of saying, 'I think the president violated the law. I think the president did this, therefore, go on and prosecute him' \u2014 I will not do that,\" he said. \"If [a case] prove[s] to be a criminal offense, then in fact, that would be up to the attorney general to decide whether he or she wanted to proceed with it. I am not going to make that individual judgment,\" Biden added. Sen. Kamala Harris of California told The NPR Politics Podcast last year that if elected president, her administration's Department of Justice would bring criminal charges against Trump after his presidency, saying, \"I believe that they would have no choice.\" Harris is a top contender on Biden's shortlist for vice president. Immigration Biden also told Garcia-Navarro that he would not tear down parts of the wall along the U.S. southern border built during the Trump administration, but he vowed to end its construction. When asked about asylum-seekers waiting in camps in Mexico due to the Trump administration's policy known as \"Remain in Mexico,\" Biden said reversing Trump's policies will have to be done with care. \"Because if we just say, 'OK, all done. I've withdrawn the order,' you're going to have a crisis on the other side of the border as well,\" Biden said. \"And we shouldn't be putting these people when they come across the border in jail; we should be monitoring them.\" Watch Biden's response on rolling back Trump immigration policy: Credit:  Video: NABJ-NAHJ, Image: KC McGinnis for NPR The controversial \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, officially named the Migrant Protection Protocols, was first implemented in January 2019 and mandates that asylum-seekers coming through Mexico wait outside the U.S. while their immigration proceedings take place. As NPR's Vanessa Romo reported, the policy has led to 60,000 migrants getting sent back across the border, with tens of thousands still there. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in March to allow the program to continue. Biden added that a push for more humanitarian resources is needed and said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"is going to go back to school.\" \"The idea that ICE is sitting outside of a Mass on Sunday to arrest a parent coming out as undocumented, the idea that they're going to schools, the idea they're going to doctors' appointments is wrong,\" Biden said. \"You have so many young children, so many young children under enormous ... psychological pressure wondering whether or not they're going to come home and there's going to be no one there.\" Choosing a running mate Biden declined to offer new insight into his thinking for a vice presidential pick, telling the journalists, \"You'll find out shortly.\" CBS' Errol Barnett pointed to reports that former Sen. Chris Dodd, who's on Biden's vice presidential search committee, has been critical of Harris for not having a more conciliatory tone toward Biden in the early primary debates. \"Well, [Dodd] didn't say that to the press. He was talking to somebody offline, and it was repeated,\" Biden said. \"Now, I don't hold grudges, and I've made it really clear that I don't hold grudges. I think it was a debate. It's as simple as that. And she's very much in contention.\" Watch Biden's response on VP speculation: Credit:  Video: NABJ-NAHJ, Image: KC McGinnis for NPR Reopening schools and businesses Biden said it's challenging to foresee what the country would look like in January if he were entering office then, but he said he would scale back reopenings in places seeing spikes of the coronavirus if he were president today. \"Everyone, wherever there is a significant percentage of people with COVID, should be required to keep social distancing and masks,\" Biden said. \"Bars should not be open. There should not be congregations of more than 10 people.\" As for the Trump administration's desire to reopen schools this fall, Biden said it only works if it's done safely. \"Look, I want our schools to open. The question is, will the president do the work he needs to make them safe? Just ordering your schools to open, like Trump has done, isn't going to be good enough,\" he said. Biden's plan includes giving school districts \"uniform guidance without political interference\" on safety protocols for schools that are able to reopen, directing resources to districts to implement guidance and bolstering virtual learning for districts that can't reopen safely. \"Start working now to close the learning gap in terms of distance learning because of COVID. President Trump should stop tweeting and start doing his work,\" he said. Election security \"Frankly, this is the thing that keeps me up most nights,\" Biden said in response to a question from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Tia Mitchell about voter confidence in a secure election. \"Making sure everyone who wants to vote gets to vote, making sure that everyone's vote is counted. And we're going to undertake a historic effort in terms of resources, commitment to beat back every voter suppression effort.\" \"No campaign has ever built anything to the scale that we've built to make sure we can get out the vote. We have a major, major dedicated operation in states to address the head-on voter suppression in any form that it's going to take, and steps we can take to go to court as well,\" he said. The pandemic has caused election experts to worry about a shortage of poll workers for the general election, and states are preparing for an increase in mail-in voting this fall. The White House has repeatedly advanced conspiracy theories surrounding the integrity of mail-in voting, and Trump went so far as to suggest delaying the November election based off the false claim that mail-in voting can be \"rigged.\"",

Eliot Engel in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th Congressional District. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party couldn't break through in the presidential race, but in congressional races, younger, more diverse, progressive candidates are enjoying a recent surge in support. \"The logic of COVID-19 as well as the logic and the righteousness of the movement for Black lives, I think, is forcing all of us to re-imagine both what is necessary and what is possible, and I think it's having an impact on our politics,\" said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, a New York-based minor political party. Progressive Black, male candidates in New York's June 23 primaries (results have not yet been officially called by the Associated Press) are on track to win in three safe Democratic seats, virtually ensuring they will win in November and serve in the next Congress. \"Have I benefited from the newfound realization by some folks that we live in a severely unjust society as it concerns issues of race? Yes. Is that why I won? No,\" Mondaire Jones told NPR. Jones, 33, is also openly gay. He is on track to win a contested open seat primary for the seat of retiring Rep. Nita Lowey, who represents a mostly white, wealthy, suburban district home to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jones said he is winning because of his support of unabashedly liberal ideas. \"I am the only candidate in a crowded Democratic primary who supports the only policy that would literally ensure everyone has health care in this country and that is Medicare for All,\" he said, in reference to the government-run health care proposal championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2020 presidential primary race. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden opposes a government-run health care system, and he secured the nomination in part by locking down the more centrist wing of the Democratic Party. But in these contested congressional primaries, progressive candidates made races competitive running on some of the party's most provocative ideas: Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, paths to citizenship for all undocumented workers and dramatic redistributions of wealth. Another progressive, New York City Councilman Ritchie Torres, 32, who like Jones is also openly gay, is on track to win a Bronx-based seat to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano, the most Democratic congressional district in the country. Middle school principal Jamaal Bowman is expected to defeat veteran incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel for his his Bronx-based seat. Engel has not yet conceded the race. Bowman attacked Engel for his absence from the district \u2014 one of the hardest hit in the nation by COVID-19 \u2014 and ran an energized campaign focused on redirecting help to the poor and working class. \"Poverty is by political design and is rooted in a system that has been fractured and corrupt and rotten from its core from the inception of America,\" Bowman said in a primary night speech to supporters. In the Kentucky Senate Democratic primary, another progressive Black candidate, Charles Booker, gave establishment-backed candidate Amy McGrath a close race \u2014 coming within 3% \u2014 despite raising around $3 million to McGrath's over $40 million and relying on volunteer progressive activists. Evan Weber, the co-founder the Sunrise Movement, a progressive group focused on combating climate change, backed Booker's campaign. He's clear-eyed about where the progressive wing still stands right now. \"We're sort of like a junior party in a governing coalition,\" he said. But progressive activists are energized by these races and what they could mean. Waleed Shahid is with Justice Democrats, a group closely aligned with Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Looking ahead, Shahid says that if Biden wins, the progressive wing will have leverage. \"The Congress that Joe Biden is inheriting, if he becomes president in 2021, looks really different than the one Barack Obama did in 2009, in terms of how much more muscle the progressives in Congress have, how much more media attention they get, how much more they can hold the president accountable,\" he said. And there could be a fresh crop of lawmakers, like Jones, Torres and Bowman, among others, coming to Washington to take on the establishment and push the party to the left. \"I am excited. I am happy. I am fired up. And I can't wait to get to Congress and cause problems for the people in there who have been maintaining a status quo that is literally killing our children,\" Bowman said last Tuesday. Progressives are now working against Democratic incumbents in upcoming primaries in Massachusetts and New Jersey.",

            "article_content": "President Trump travels to Arizona to talk about his southern border wall. Five states hold primary elections. And, an update on the first U.S. patient to get treatment from a gene-editing technique.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, his first campaign rally in a while was a bit of a bust. Today, President Trump will try again. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump's going to Arizona to talk about his southern border wall. He's giving a speech to thousands of young people. But he is doing this in a state - one of many - that is seeing a rise in cases of COVID-19. GREENE: Let's bring in NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez, who is following the president's activities this week. Hi, Franco. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So take us through the day in Arizona. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, he's going to start in Yuma to mark progress on the border wall. The wall's been a signature part of his time in office, as is his push to keep undocumented migrants out of the United States. You know, it's a message aimed at energizing his base in a state ahead of the election. He's then going to go to Phoenix to give a speech to young supporters in a large church. This is all on the heels of the rally in Tulsa on Saturday, as you mentioned, where turnout was lower than the campaign planned. But the president really is trying to rev up his campaign and kind of move past the damper that the pandemic put on the economy and, frankly, his reelection message. GREENE: Well, so he's doing this in a border state just after signing an executive order yesterday on immigration, right? And this is an executive order that, really, is related to the coronavirus outbreak. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. That's right. It's an order that responds to job losses caused by the pandemic. Basically, it freezes new immigration until the end of the year, extending a measure the White House put in place in April. It also restricts new visas for temporary workers in the tech sector and management positions, and even for some foreign students who provide child care as au pairs. The White House says that it will mean about 525,000 jobs are protected for Americans. And it's being welcomed by people who want to see less immigration, especially when jobs are in short supply. GREENE: But these kind of moves are usually not welcomed by the business community, which can get up in arms with orders like this. What are they saying about this one? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, business groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, say the visa suspensions will - right - hurt economic recovery. It will affect tech companies and other businesses that rely on foreign workers to fill jobs because, they argue, there aren't enough U.S. workers to fill those roles. And it will also affect other people who count on some of these foreign workers so they, themselves, can go to work. I talked to Dawn Gile (ph), who runs a network for military spouses. She's had four au pairs during the past 20 years while her husband has been on active duty. DAWN GILE: His schedule is not like the typical type schedule. And for me, I work full-time. I need flexible, in-home child care that the au pair program provides. And by removing that, it's frustrating for us and scary for us because we don't know what we're going to do for childcare, especially given the current situation with the coronavirus pandemic and daycares being closed. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, so there are a lot of concerns out there. But President Trump, in his order, said many of these J visa holders in this category compete with young Americans for jobs. And the unemployment rate is particularly high for young Americans ages 25 and under. And that could actually also be something that President Trump talks about during his speech in Phoenix. GREENE: All right. So President Trump giving that speech in Phoenix, visiting Arizona today. And NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez will be watching. Franco, thanks so much. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. So this Tuesday is primary day in a number of states. MARTIN: Right. So in two of the most notable races, there's something interesting happening. Newcomer Black Democrats are mounting progressive challenges against white candidates who are backed by the party establishment. GREENE: And we want to bring in NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to talk about these races. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, guys. GREENE: So take us through who is voting today, where this is happening. MONTANARO: We've got five states voting today in primaries in the South - in Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia and Mississippi - and also in New York. The big races people are watching are in Kentucky and New York where we have those two races that you mentioned. GREENE: Well, let's talk about Kentucky. I mean, talk politics in Kentucky. It's hard not to mention Mitch McConnell, right? MONTANARO: Right. You know, and this is the Democratic primary for the Senate. And the winner would take on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. It's been a wild race, frankly, between State Representative Charles Booker and Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot. We've really seen a change in trajectory in this race since the death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville. Taylor is the Black woman who was shot and killed by police after they used a no-knock warrant to get into her apartment. Before Taylor's death, McGrath was the overwhelming frontrunner. She'd taken in $41 million for this race, which is huge for a Senate race, and had the backing of Democratic Party establishment figures. That's all changed. Booker, who's Black, has taken a real leadership role in speaking out after Taylor's death and taking part in Black Lives Matter protests. He has all the momentum now and at least one poll showing him ahead. High-profile progressives have come to his backing - think about, like, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren. And Booker has a new video out that really encapsulates a lot of messages that national Democrats are trying to push now about working-class economics, protests and Black Lives Matter. Here's a bit from that. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) CHARLES BOOKER: Finally, the power of the people is beginning to show. We've seen who keeps society running, it's the black janitors, the brown cashiers, the white folks stocking the shelves. The essential people are rising up. MONTANARO: Now, look; I mean, while this primary is interesting - it's going to get a lot of attention because of who the winner will face off with. But this is Kentucky in a presidential year, a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. So whoever wins is going to be an underdog against McConnell. GREENE: But, I mean, as Rachel mentioned, I mean, this dynamic is not just in Kentucky. This dynamic playing out in this race we're seeing in New York state as well, right? MONTANARO: That's right. Especially look at this challenge to longtime Congressman Eliot Engel in New York. He's the House Foreign Affairs chairman. He might be best known for trying to grab the best seat during State of the Union addresses when there's a Democratic president. You'd always see him right there for the cameras when President Obama would walk in. GREENE: Oh, that's right. MONTANARO: But Engel represents the Bronx, parts of southern Westchester County. He's been in Congress for more than 30 years, close to establishment leaders. But he's got his hands full with Jamaal Bowman, a former middle school principal from the Bronx. He's been endorsed by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. And this race really took a turn after this hot mic moment from Eliot Engle. He was caught on tape by News 12. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIOT ENGEL: If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care. RUBEN DIAZ: Say that again. ENGEL: If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care. MONTANARO: So he's saying if he didn't have a primary, he wouldn't even care. But he wanted to be able to speak there. And this is a big deal for him. Once this came out, Bowman started to raise a ton of money. He was able to speak out a lot. And, look; he's got all the momentum in this race. And I don't think anybody should be surprised if he winds up winning. GREENE: All right. A lot to watch today on primary day in several states around the country. NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks. MONTANARO: You got it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. We're going to bring you now the latest on CRISPR. This is a story that our science desk at NPR has been closely following now for the last year or so. MARTIN: Yeah. So just a reminder, CRISPR is this revolutionary gene-editing technique. And a woman named Victoria Gray volunteered to become the first patient with a genetic disease to get treated in the U.S. using CRISPR. GREENE: And NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has had exclusive access to watch her progress. Hi there, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So introduce us to Victoria Gray. And talk to us about what she was getting treated for. STEIN: Sure. Victoria, she's 34 and lives in Forest, Miss. She was born with sickle cell disease. It's a terrible genetic disease that turns red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen, into deformed sickle-shaped cells. They get jammed inside blood vessels causing horrible attacks of pain and other complications that often cut life short. Doctors took cells out of Victoria's bone marrow, rewrote a gene in the cells with the gene-editing technique CRISPR and infused billions of these modified cells back into her body. And it looks like it worked. She hasn't had any of those awful pain attacks since she got treated, hasn't needed any blood transfusions. It's essentially transformed her life. Here's how she describes it. VICTORIA GRAY: It's hard to put into words, you know, the joy that I feel and being grateful for a change this big. It's been amazing. GREENE: Wow. I mean, it's great to hear that. Still, I just can't imagine what she's been through with this treatment, I mean, given that we're in the midst of a pandemic and so much else in the country right now. STEIN: Yeah. You know, like the rest of us, life hasn't been easy. Right after she got home from months in the hospital recovering from the treatment, her husband got deployed by the National Guard, leaving her home alone with three kids. And then the pandemic hit and she lost a great aunt, a pastor from a childhood church. Friends of hers have been getting sick. And even though her immune system is still weak, she has to keep going out, you know, to do things like buy groceries. And then George Floyd was killed by police in Minnesota, triggering all the nationwide protests. So she's had to explain all that to her kids. GRAY: It's a lot. So it hasn't been easy. GREENE: I'm getting a sense she's a very resilient woman, Rob. STEIN: Oh, yeah. She really is. I mean, she's had to deal with so much. And she's just, you know, so grateful for this treatment. She doesn't know how she would've coped with all this the way she was before the gene-edited cells. She would've been too weak to care for her kids. And she probably would've ended up in the hospital. Let's listen to a little more of what she told me. GRAY: It gave me hope when I was losing it. So I feel joy, you know, knowing that there is hope. STEIN: Now, you know, Victoria, she's just one patient. And doctors will have to follow her for years to make sure the treatment continues to be safe and keeps working. But because her gene-edited cells have been working so well for so long, they're increasingly confident they will keep helping her and that this gene-editing technique, CRISPR, can help other patients, too, with sickle cell disease and with a long list of other diseases as well. GREENE: All right. CRISPR, it's a story that our science desk has been following for some time. And we'll continue bringing you updates. That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with the story of one woman who has gotten this treatment. Rob, thank you so much for all your reporting on this. STEIN: You bet, David.

Republicans and Democrats seldom agree on much in 21st century politics \u2014 but one issue that divides them more than ever may be voting and elections. The parties didn't only battle about whether or how to enact new legislation following the Russian interference in the 2016 election. They also differ in the basic ways they perceive and frame myriad aspects of practicing democracy. Republicans' and Democrats' vastly different starting points help explain why the politics over voting and elections have been and likely will remain so fraught, through and beyond Election Day this year. Sometimes it seems as if the politicians involved barely live in the same country. It has become common for one side to discount the legitimacy of a victory by the other. And the coronavirus pandemic, which has scrambled nearly everything about life in the United States, makes understanding it all even more complicated. Here's what you need to know to decode this year's voting controversies. The Rosetta stone The key that unlocks so much of the partisan debate about voting is one word: turnout. An old truism holds that, all other things held equal, a smaller pool of voters tends to be better for Republicans and the larger the pool gets, the better for Democrats. This isn't mathematically ironclad, as politicians learn and relearn regularly. But this assumption is the foundation upon which much else is built. Traditionally, Republicans have tended to support higher barriers to voting and often focus on voter identification and security to protect against fraud. All the same, about half of GOP voters back expanding vote by mail in light of the pandemic. Democrats tend to support lowering barriers and focus on making access for voters easier, with a view to encouraging engagement. They support expanding votes via mail too. The next fight, in many cases, is about who and how many get what access via mail. All this also creates a dynamic in which many political practitioners can't envision a neutral compromise, because no matter what philosophy a state adopts, it's perceived as zero-sum. Or as former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, told NPR, there are no \"fair\" maps in the discussion about how to draw voting districts \u2014 because what Democrats call \"fair\" maps are those, he believes, that favor them. No, say voting rights groups and many Democrats \u2014 the only \"fair\" way to conduct an election is to admit as many voters as possible. Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has charged authorities in her home state with suppressing turnout, named her public interest group Fair Fight Action. Access vs. security The pandemic has added another layer of complexity with the new emphasis it has put on voting by mail. President Trump says he opposes expanding voting by mail, and his allies, including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, call the process rife with opportunities for fraud. Even so, Trump and McEnany both voted by mail this year in Florida, and Republican officials across the country have encouraged voting by mail. Democrats, who have made election security and voting access a big part of their political brand for several years, argue that the pandemic might discourage people from going to old-fashioned polling sites. If there's rough agreement about that away from the White House, there are many disputes about the specifics \u2014 what practices will be permitted based on what the parties perceive as beneficial for them. A study by Stanford University found that voting by mail yielded a small but roughly equal increase in turnout between the parties. It isn't clear yet how much voting by mail might expand by Election Day, but it's the subject of lawsuits across the country; apart from the politics, absentee ballot-printing is a boutique business and its capacity will be tested \u2014 as may that of the Postal Service. How common is voter fraud? It exists, but it's very rare. Despite anecdotal cases of people voting fraudulently in person or suspicious ballots appearing in the mail, most of the time, in most places, the way elections in the U.S. are processed is legitimate. Since the pandemic, some Republican officials at the state level have acknowledged that the party's language around fraud may now be putting voting at risk by amplifying fraud concerns out of proportion. Read more from NPR's Miles Parks about the integrity of voting by mail. Trump sometimes says that large numbers of people vote illegally in the United States, but a panel he appointed to investigate that ostensible problem could not substantiate it. Listen to an interview with a member of that commission. Still, anecdotal cases of fraud crop up across the country. Voter suppression Activists frequently call out what they term suppression. In a dispute this spring in Nevada, for example, Democrats sued to stop the state from sending mail-in ballots only to people who had voted in recent elections rather than to all registered voters. Democrats said the state's plan would disenfranchise some citizens by leaving them out of the primary; Republicans argued that states' voter rolls are often inaccurate and that sending out ballots to everyone could lead to the ballots getting lost or winding up in the wrong hands \u2014 opening up the prospect for fraud. Voter rolls are often the focus of disputes for these reasons. People die, move \u2014 and move out of state \u2014 and so authorities periodically need to delete names. How frequently that happens, and for what reasons, can become controversial and the kernel of legal and political warfare between the parties. Likewise with voter identification documents. In Texas, for example, the Republican-dominated state legislature deemed that handgun licenses were acceptable identification at the polls \u2014 but student IDs, even those issued by the state's own universities, were not. For all the discussion about the effect of voter ID laws, however, a study last year found that whatever impact those laws might have is offset by increased organization and activism by nonwhite voters \u2014 leading to no change in registration or turnout. Another battleground is early and absentee voting. Rules vary by state, with some requiring more explanation than others as to what's permissible. Bitter lessons The parties today have arrived at this moment after years of what they would argue were bad experiences with elections at the hands of their opponents. Republicans, among other things, sometimes point to what they believe was cheating in the 1960 presidential race. Alleged Democratic chicanery, in this telling, threw the results to John F. Kennedy and cost the race for Richard Nixon. Fraudulent IDs, undocumented immigrants voting, people being \"bused in\" on Election Day remain consistent themes when Republicans talk about elections. Democrats look to the decades of Jim Crow discrimination that kept many black voters out of elections. More recently, they look at the Supreme Court's 2000 decision that handed the outcome of that election to George W. Bush over Al Gore. The court halted the counting of ballots that Democrats argued could have changed Florida's results, swinging the state to Gore. Abrams' group perceives what it calls a deliberate campaign by the establishment to purge Georgia voter rolls of mainly black or Democratic voters. Problems with voting in Georgia's primary in June underscored those problems and that history, Abrams and other critics said. Voters in Georgia are facing outrageous voter suppression resulting from years of election system sabotage by Republican lawmakers. If Republicans actually wanted you to vote, they would support #VoteByMail and hand-marked #PaperBallots. https://t.co/L6WFHKUlne Matters of principle Many party leaders describe at having arrived at their positions based upon principle. Republicans are more likely to argue that casting a vote is a privilege of citizenship to be earned and safeguarded with restrictions and security. They also point to what they call the principles of federalism and the need for people to be engaged at the state and local level with the conduct of elections \u2014 not for broad mandates from Washington. Democrats are more likely to argue that voting is a right and that the barriers to casting a ballot should be as low as practical. President Lyndon Johnson and Democrats in the 1960s used the Voting Rights Act and federal power to dismantle racist state laws designed to prevent African Americans from voting, but those actions were later weakened by the Supreme Court. Some current Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have called for new action by Congress and the federal government that could involve new funding, legislation and administration from Washington. Whatever the outcome of this year's election, these disputes over elections themselves likely will continue well into the future.",

The lockdown countries imposed to stop the coronavirus pandemic have cut off the usual flow of seasonal farmworkers.\n                \n                    \n                    Alfonso Di Vicenzo/LightRocket via Getty \n                    \n                \nhide caption A Senegalese migrant collects oranges on the plain of Rosarno and San Ferdinando in Calabria, Italy, on Feb. 6. The lockdown countries imposed to stop the coronavirus pandemic have cut off the usual flow of seasonal farmworkers. The novel coronavirus is reviving one of Italy's fiercest debate topics \u2014 immigration. The Italian government is considering giving work permits to thousands of undocumented immigrants in the country, as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens crop harvests. Seasonal farmworkers usually go to Italy each year from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, but recent lockdowns have kept them home. That's creating a critical shortage of labor for picking fruits and vegetables needed for food and exports. To fill the gap, Italian Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova wants to grant work permits to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the country. The proposal comes as Italy braces for deep economic impacts after bearing the brunt of Europe's COVID-19 outbreak. If approved by parliament, the move would signal a change in a country that in recent years took strong measures to limit immigration \u2014 and the proposal has riled up Italy's right-wing populist leaders. But Italy can no longer act \"as if migrants were our enemies,\" Bellanova told Radio Capital in early April. \"They are vital to our food supply chain.\" Bellanova also alluded to humanitarian reasons for the plan: Many of the undocumented live in \"ghettos\" where \"desperation from hunger and solitude is growing,\" she said. One such area is in Italy's southern countryside, where lush vegetable fields are dotted with dilapidated shacks housing largely African migrants, living without running water, electricity or windows. Castel Volturno, about 20 miles north of Naples, is known as Little Africa, where thousands of people eke out a meager living in the underground economy. Jean-Ren\u00e9 Bilongo, a social worker from Cameroon, was a resident of Castel Volturno. In a 2009 interview with NPR, he said the migrant community was \"considered as ghosts, as something just less than human beings.\" Bilongo now lives in Rome and is a leader of migrant farmworkers in the agriculture section of Italy's biggest trade union, CGIL. In a recent phone call, he said the undocumented remain in \"miserable conditions\" and that he would welcome the new migrant work permits. But politicians who became popular with anti-immigration policies are furious with the proposal. Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing opposition League party, slammed the idea. \"A blanket amnesty for 600,000 illegal migrants \u2014 you heard that right,\" Salvini said in a video on April 16, after Bellanova had outlined the proposal in parliament. \"The League's proposal is vouchers for students, the unemployed and retirees \u2014 all preferably Italian.\" Italy has an estimated 600,000 undocumented migrants, but it isn't clear how many would get permits under the agriculture minister's plan. Bellanova said the country has a shortfall of up to 350,000 workers, out of the 400,000 farmworkers it needs. When Salvini was the interior minister, he sponsored legislation that blocked Italian ports to humanitarian ships carrying migrants rescued at sea, curtailing asylum requests. The League became Italy's most popular party. Even after Salvini's dramatic exit from government last year in a failed attempt to force new elections, the League remained on top. But the Lombardy region in northern Italy, a League stronghold, is an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Local leaders and health officials have been criticized for bad management and delays in imposing quarantines, which has battered the party's reputation. Nationally, the League's approval rating has now sunk to 25.4% from over 31% a month ago, though it remains the most popular, according to an Ipsos poll published Sunday in the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Italian economist Tito Boeri says Salvini's anti-migrant rhetoric no longer seems to be a winning strategy. \"I think that right now [the] Italian population is aware \u2014 the contagion is such a serious risk that something has to be done, that our health depends on the health of our people,\" said Boeri, a former head of Italy's Social Security Agency. Boeri has long favored granting legal status to undocumented migrants for their contribution to the economy. It's more urgent than ever now, he says, as Italy fights to contain COVID-19. Legal status \u2014 even if temporary \u2014 would give migrants access to health care. \"The key thing is that [work permits] should not be done for labor simply or economic reason, that should be done for health reasons,\" he says. The entire population would suffer further if the most vulnerable people don't receive help, according to Giovanni Visone, communications director at InterSOS, a humanitarian group that works with migrants. \"Living in the streets as homeless or living in informal settlements, especially squats,\" Visone says, \"it's very hard to be compliant with all the [COVID-19] protective measures.\" The minister for southern Italy, Giuseppe Provenzano, stresses that \"it's thanks to these workers that food reached our tables during the lockdown.

            "article_content": "The U.S. is just a few months away from the end of Donald Trump's first \u2014 and maybe his last \u2014 term as president of the United States. And while it's unclear how this election will turn out, it is clear that the past four years have been ... different from past presidencies. People have talked about Trump breaking norms, especially when it comes to talking about race, going as far as to say that he's the \"most racist president in modern history.\" There are plenty of things you could point at to augment that argument: embracing birtherism, referring to African nations as \"shithole countries,\" telling congresswomen of color to go back to where they came from, calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists,\" refusing to denounce white supremacists during a presidential debate and so on. But when it comes to calling Trump the most racist president, it's tough to make such a definitive characterization. After all, racism was baked into the founding of the United States, a country built on the genocide of Native American people and slavery; 12 of the first 18 presidents actually owned slaves. So on this week's episode, we ask: Is Trump the most racist president in the history of the country? How do you even go about measuring such a thing? (And just to be clear, when we say racist, we're not talking about what Trump or any former president believes in his heart of hearts; as we've discussed before, that rubric is a trap. We're talking about using rhetoric and creating policies that marginalize people of color.) To help us answer those questions, we talked to Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public policy at Princeton University. He, like many other people we talked to for this episode, shied away from an easy yes-or-no answer \u2014 and instead homed in on a few defining moments in Trump's presidency and how they compare with those of previous Oval Office residents. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. We've heard over the past four years that Donald Trump is an exceptional figure in a lot of ways. People describe him as violating political norms in a really dramatic fashion, especially with regards to his racism or the racist behavior that is ascribed to him. Do you think that he is exceptional in that regard? I do think he's exceptional in many ways. At the same time, I think he's totally rooted in the politics of the moment. If you want to take, for example, his statements about race, including during the first debate, when he wouldn't back down on the issue of white power and the Proud Boys \u2014 that's a pretty stunning thing to do. That is not to say that there haven't been presidents who weren't profoundly racist. Obviously, before the Civil War, presidents stood in favor of slavery. Before the 1960s, presidents opposed civil rights. But today, in 2020, for someone to be so defiant on the issue of white power, that's exceptional. But just because a president is exceptional doesn't mean they come out of nowhere, and I think that's an important way to think about President Trump. So, for example, President Trump has expressed and supported very hard-line views on immigration since the very start of his presidency, in his rhetoric and his executive policies. In what he's called upon for Congress, he's trying to shift American politics very far to the right on how we think of having immigrants in this country and who we let in. That's not a creation of Donald Trump. The Republican Party since the 1990s has moved in a very sharp direction to the right on this issue. President George W. Bush, who was liberal on immigration, found that he had very little support from his own party to try to pass some kind of reform that would allow those who were here to stay in the country. In terms of the way he campaigns, President Trump is pretty notorious for saying anything about his opponents, for trying to smear them and paint them as radicals who seek to endanger the country. The way he does it is pretty striking and is certainly exceptional in how far he'll go. But we've seen other presidents do stuff like this, like President George H.W. Bush. So you're saying that Trump is not unique \u2014 but has he upped the ante on race? He is upping the ante, and he is saying the silent part out loud, which matters. By saying it out loud, he grants it more legitimacy, and he gives it presidential weight in a way that's different. Since the 1960s, lots of presidents have played to the racial backlash in the United States. Richard Nixon ran a whole campaign in 1968 about \"law and order,\" which was basically a coded way to talk about, in his perspective, what radical civil rights organizations were doing to the health of the country. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan constantly spoke about \"welfare queens\" and characterized poverty as an African American issue and was criticized rightly for using that kind of rhetoric and tapping into this kind of anger and anxiety in white America. But Donald Trump just says it out loud \u2014 he's very direct. And I'm not surprised when I hear it, because I think this has been a much bigger part of Republican politics than people have acknowledged. And I'm not surprised, because he's been doing this since he first ran. When we were telling you about this episode, you told us that in comparing presidents to Trump, we should really be looking at post-bellum presidents \u2014 not presidents from the Civil War to the beginning of the nation. Why is that? Sometimes I listen to people debate this question, and there's always a response for whatever words President Trump uses or whatever signals that he sends: Look at presidents before the Civil War. They supported, by and large, the institution of slavery many times. What could be worse than that? And that is absolutely true. So I think that comparison gets thin very quickly. We are not in that period. And so I think it's important to measure what President Trump does based on where we are today. When you do these long comparisons, you miss and lose perspective on why his statements are so dangerous and so off-center from what we should expect in this period. So would we be on safer ground comparing, say, Trump to Nixon? Yeah. The reason this kind of conversation works is that you're talking about presidents since the civil rights revolution, and you're talking about presidents who you could argue are in the modern era of American politics. I think there are a lot of similarities. Nixon certainly liked to use presidential power aggressively. Nixon liked to capitalize on the backlash that had formed against civil rights \u2014 that's what he did with his law-and-order rhetoric. And Nixon was someone who could just be incredibly rough with his opponents \u2014 from creating an enemies list of people who were out to get him, in his mind, to the way that he treated people close to him. What are the differences, though? Nixon still understood, at some level, the importance of governing. He was still committed to the idea that the job of a president was to preside and was to try to work out deals with Congress on problems of the day. I think Trump throws a lot of that out the window. I think he is not as concerned with hiding some of his bad behavior. He'll do it out in the open. He's not concerned about using code words and sending signals. He'll just say very clearly what he feels like on these very divisive issues and even on presidential power. Nixon was still within a world of constraints and guardrails. And I think what we're seeing now is that those are gone, and that's what sends some people into a very concerned state. In terms of personality, I'd say that some presidents are definitely more user-friendly than others. But Trump is notorious for his brashness and his politically incorrect and racist language. Have we ever had another president in recent memory get anywhere near to that? No, not in recent memory. People sometimes talk, for example, about Lyndon Johnson's language behind the scenes. If you listen to private tapes of him talking to different politicians, he often did use very racist language. Richard Nixon famously had just a horrible vocabulary about almost every social group. So lots of presidents have used words that are not nice or openly racist in private, and lots of presidents have not been nice people. Johnson is an example of someone who could be pretty rough and ruthless, even with people who worked for him and supported him. Bill Clinton famously had a temper that could come out at any moment, and people didn't like really being in the crossfire. But that's different from what people are talking about with President Trump. In his case, it's his use of all that language in 2020 rather than 1964, right out in the public on his Twitter feed, in a presidential debate or at his rallies. It's also about the way he treats people, people he fires within his administration, people who oppose him right out in the open. There's often a difference in how we think about presidents and how they actually behave. So does Trump's reputation actually match his record, or are we maybe looking at this the wrong way? That's a good question. And I think it is important to remember when we look at presidential history for sure, there are lots of horrible things. Franklin D. Roosevelt and the internment of Japanese Americans is one of the biggest examples of that. Here's a president who saves the country from the worst economic crisis and helps lead the nation in this war against fascism successfully, but it's hard to get around how bad internment was. John F. Kennedy is remembered as someone who came out in favor of the civil rights movement. But until 1963, his record was anything but. He was very resistant to get behind this cause because he was fearful about what it would do to him politically and to the coalition he was building. I think it's important, once the Trump presidency is over, that we actually look at the question you're asking: How much does the rhetoric match the policy? I think there's some areas you'll see the match is pretty clean. For example, in terms of the rhetoric of anti-immigration, he's taking a lot of steps since the refugee ban that follow through on exactly what he wanted to do. And then there are ways in which the rhetoric is what matters. Presidential rhetoric is so important. It's not a disconnect from the real record. What a president says is often one of the things that has the biggest impact on our country. And I think that Twitter feed is something that we're going to be looking at in the presidential archives. The kinds of words he legitimated and normalized will be part of the record. And then there's other areas where it's fair to ask historians once we have that record to see. Are there areas of disconnect between some of the things he said, which were mostly reactionary, and what he actually did in terms of policy? I don't know what those would be yet. But I think that's something we should ask of any president.

Most Americans support Trump administration efforts to stop immigrants from coming to the United States as long as it's done in the name of slowing the spread of the coronavirus, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll. But Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric during the pandemic has done little to budge public opinion on other immigration policies, the poll found. Most of Trump's policies, including his border wall, remain unpopular except among Republicans. \"Americans do want to take steps to limit immigration right now,\" said pollster Mallory Newall. \"But that's not because their views on immigration have changed. It's because they want to do everything in their power to contain the spread of COVID-19.\" Loading... Meanwhile, immigration is no longer a top concern ahead of the November election. The poll shows it has been eclipsed by the coronavirus, racial justice, unemployment, political extremism and a range of other pressing issues. The poll was conducted July 30-31 and surveyed 1,115 adults from the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii. The poll found broad support for a single, national strategy to address the pandemic and for more aggressive measures to contain it. Two-thirds of respondents said they believe the U.S. is handling the pandemic worse than other countries, and most favor more aggressive action, including a nationwide order making it mandatory to shelter at home for two weeks. Since March, Trump has taken broad actions to curtail legal immigration during the pandemic, imposing new limits on green cards and visas for guest workers, and turning away asylum seekers at the southern border. The administration also closed the southern and northern borders to all but \"essential\" travel. There is sizable bipartisan support \u2014 85% of Republicans and 75% of Democrats \u2014 for temporarily shutting down the borders. And more than half overall support limits on legal immigrants, though that is largely driven by Republicans. \"I feel like we need to take care of America first,\" Tammy Bunce, a Republican respondent from Queen Creek, Ariz. \"We should be staying at home, and I think other countries should not be coming in until we have the coronavirus especially under control.\" Another respondent, Robert Torres of San Leandro, Calif., is a third-generation immigrant from Mexico who identifies as politically independent. He said: \"Right now is not a very good time to be immigrating.\" That's partly because of the pandemic, Torres says, but also because \"there's a lot of undocumented here that should be documented before we start adding to the immigration.\" President Trump has made his immigration crackdown a signature policy and key to his argument for reelection. From the outset of the pandemic, Trump has blamed foreigners for bringing coronavirus to the United States, calling it the \"China virus\" and \"kung flu.\" He's also returned to a familiar refrain about protecting American jobs as justification for the latest immigration restrictions, pointing to the battered economy. But Americans remain divided on immigration policy when it's not tied to stopping the spread of the virus. \"I get right now that we got this pandemic going on, that's fine,\" said Jo Lee of Houston, Texas, in a follow-up interview. \"But once this calms down, if somebody really wants to come over here and raise their family and be a citizen, let them do that. I don't have a problem with that,\" said Lee, who says she often votes for Democrats. That divide was clear when poll respondents were asked about whether the federal government should provide stimulus relief checks to undocumented immigrants who pay U.S. taxes: 49% of respondents said yes, including 71% of Democrats; 43% said no, including 66% of Republicans. The NPR/Ipsos poll found that underlying attitudes about immigration are deeply entrenched, remaining remarkably stable since a previous poll in 2018. For example, about 70% of respondents \u2014 then and now \u2014 say immigrants are an \"important part of our American identity.\" And efforts to build a border wall and limit immigration still fail to garner majority support, except among Republicans, according to the poll: What has changed, according to the new poll, is how much weight Americans place on immigration as an issue. Loading... Two years ago, one in four respondents cited immigration as one of their top concerns, and it ranked fourth behind health care, crime and terrorism. Now 46% of respondents say COVID-19 is a top concern, while immigration has fallen out of the top 10, with only 11% of respondents saying it's one of the topics they find \"most worrying.\" Immigration is no longer \"a major factor when it comes to deciding who to vote for,\" Ipsos pollster Mallory Newall said. \"That's where we're sort of almost seeing bipartisan agreement,\" she said. \"People may not have the same stance when it comes to how to deal with the virus, how to deal with immigration. But what they do know is that taking care of COVID, and addressing that and taking care of the economy, is priority number one, full stop.\" NPR's Senior Producer Marisa Pe\u00f1aloza contributed to this report.",

When public schools shut down in the spring, Cotton had no one to watch her young children who are 8 and 10. So she quit her job in social work \u2014 and lost her health insurance \u2014 in order to start her own business. Despite strong opposition from Republicans and rural voters, Missouri on Tuesday joined 37 states and the District of Columbia in expanding its Medicaid program. Voters in Missouri approved creating a state constitutional amendment that will open Medicaid eligibility to include healthy adults starting on July 1, 2021. Voters approved expansion by a vote of 53.25% to 46.75%. A total of 1,263,776 voters weighed in on the measure. Missouri joins five other mostly conservative states that have passed Medicaid expansion via ballot initiatives, most recently Oklahoma, which voted in the measure on June 30. Most of the remaining 12 states that haven't expanded Medicaid are Republican-leaning states in the South. Nika Cotton, the owner of Soulcentricitea, a newly opened tea shop in Kansas City, Mo., woke to the news on Wednesday morning. Cotton, whose children are 8 and 10, says she will qualify for health care coverage under expansion. \"It takes a lot of stress off of my shoulders with having to think about how I'm going to take care of myself, how I'm going to be able to go and see a doctor and get the health care I need while I'm starting my business,\" Cotton says. Medicaid expansion, which states have the option of adopting as part of the Affordable Care Act, opens eligibility in the program to individuals and families with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The federal government covers 90% of expansion costs.  A family of three, like Nika's, could make up to $29,974 to qualify Researchers from Washington University in Saint Louis estimated in 2019 that around 230,000 people in Missouri would enroll for Medicaid if it were expanded. As of 2018, 9.3% of Missourians were uninsured. The study also showed expansion would save the state an estimated $39 million a year, largely by eliminating the need for other state health spending. Missouri's adoption of expansion follows a trend of increasing support in largely Republican states, according to health policy expert Rachel Nuzum of the Commonwealth Fund. \"What we've seen in our surveys over the years is when you take the labels off of the policies, when you take the Affordable Care Act label off, when you take Medicaid expansion off and just start asking people whether or not you think low-income families should have access to Medicaid coverage, the support is overwhelming,\" Nuzum says. Support for expansion came largely from voters in and around the urban centers of Kansas City, Saint Louis, Springfield and Columbia. Voters in Kansas City, Mo., for example, approved the measure by 87.6%. Amendment 2 was rejected overwhelmingly by conservative voters in the mostly rural parts of the state that have the highest uninsured and poverty rates. Voters in McDonald, Morgan and Scotland counties, which have the three highest uninsured rates in the state, rejected the measure by margins of nearly 2 to 1 or greater. Expansion opponents warned that high enrollment in the program could lead to the state's 10% share of the costs becoming a significant burden, especially when state revenues are down. \"When state revenues fall, it begs the question, how are you going to pay for this?\" said Ryan Johnson, senior adviser for United for Missouri, a conservative policy advocacy organization, in late July. \"We're concerned that they are going to have to raid public education,\" he said, \"and that's a disservice to the kiddos who hope to go back to school this fall, the teachers, the administrators and everyone involved in the public education system.\" Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, has already withheld nearly $449 million from the 2021 fiscal budget, with education taking the hardest hit, because of declining revenue. Health care experts agree that the economic effects of the pandemic, including high unemployment and lower state revenue, could strain the capacity of state Medicaid programs. However, health care advocates argue that expansion benefits individuals and families who are struggling as a result of the pandemic and that the influx of federal dollars and the jobs that result from expansion could help the economy. \"If we're worried about the economy and we're worried about people working, Medicaid expansion is actually a way to encourage people to work and not have that worry they're going to lose health insurance for themselves or their families,\" says Ryan Barker, vice president of strategic initiatives for Missouri Foundation for Health. Medicaid expansion has been fiercely resisted by Republican lawmakers and was placed on the ballot as the result of a petition. Expansion advocates enlisted the Fairness Project, a Washington, D.C.-based campaigning organization, in developing and executing their campaign strategy. The Fairness Project has been involved in successful Medicaid expansion campaigns in other mostly conservative states, including Utah, Idaho, Nebraska and Oklahoma. The YES on 2 campaign was supported by a wide range of interests, including the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, the Missouri Hospital Association, the NAACP, the AFL-CIO and the AARP. The coalition forged some unlikely alliances, including Planned Parenthood supporters and Catholic Charities of St. Louis, which is operated by the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Missouri YES on 2 campaign material made almost no mention of the Affordable Care Act, which has been unpopular in Missouri, and some of its flyers didn't even use the words \"Medicaid expansion.\" Though support for the measure was much lower in conservative rural areas, Fairness Project executive director Jonathan Schleifer says Missouri's expansion success relied on both activating progressive urban voters and engaging rural voters. Still, he said, conservative resistance remained a significant obstacle to reforming health care policy. \"I think there's still a lot of work to do to push back against the hundreds of millions of dollars, the public messages coming from as high as the White House, that there's something wrong with the Affordable Care Act,\" Schleifer says. Opponents to expansion included Gov. Parson and other Republican lawmakers, Missouri Right To Life, Missouri Farm Bureau and Americans for Prosperity. In the days leading up to the election, the \"No On 2 in August\" campaign sent a mailer suggesting that expansion would lead to an influx of undocumented immigrants seeking health care, even though people in the country illegally are not eligible for Medicaid and would not be under expansion. The flyer, which featured a man in a medical mask emblazoned with the Mexican flag, read \"Amendment 2 means Illegal Immigrants Flooding Missouri Hospitals...While We Pay For It!\" The No On 2 in August campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the flyer. Between serving customers on a busy morning on Wednesday, shop owner Nika Cotton said that her excitement about expansion was only slightly diminished by the fact that it won't take effect for almost a year. \"It's better late than never,\" says Cotton. \"The fact that it's coming is better than nothing.\" This story was produced as a collaboration between KCUR, NPR and Kaiser Health News.",

The Trump administration on Tuesday moved to continue its rollback of the program, despite court rulings. The Trump administration on Tuesday continued its push to roll back DACA \u2014 the program that protects young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 by refusing to accept new applicants. A number of courts had given those immigrants hope. Last month, the Supreme Court blocked the administration's effort to end the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Then two weeks ago, a court in Maryland told the administration to start accepting new DACA applicants. But the administration is refusing to do that, saying it will reject new applicants while launching a \"comprehensive review\" of DACA and whether to go forward with a new plan to end the program. \"I have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,\" said Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in a memo explaining the administration's decision. According to that memo, the administration will continue to renew DACA protections for the roughly 640,000 immigrants who already have them \u2014 but only for one year, not for two years, as was previously the policy. Immigrant advocates assailed the administration's move, saying it hurts DACA recipients and their families. The program protects recipients from deportation and allows them to work here legally. \"It is unconscionable for the Trump administration to circumvent the rulings of a federal court in order to once again thrust into uncertainty the families and communities who rely on DACA to stay together and for protection from unjust deportations,\" said Vanessa Esparza-Lopez, an attorney at the National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago. Immigrant advocates say it's clear that the administration is preparing to rescind the popular program again but postponing that until after the November election. \"Trump's announcement today lays the groundwork to kill the DACA program and confirms what we have long said: DACA is on the ballot in November,\" said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, which helped bring one of the cases the Supreme Court decided last month. After that high court ruling, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to restore DACA to its status in September 2017, when the program was in full swing. Still, the Trump administration continued to reject new applicants, despite growing calls to fully restart DACA from immigrants and their allies in Congress. Ken Cuccinelli, a top immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security, defended the decision not to accept first-time DACA applications in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition. \"It is entirely within the legal authority of the Department of Homeland Security to do that and to set a system in place,\" Cuccinelli said. \"And the system does not allow new applicants.\" The White House also defended the decision not to accept new DACA applications on a call with reporters. When asked how that decision could be reconciled with the Maryland court ruling, a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the memo from Wolf is an \"intervening action\" that makes that decision moot. When reporters asked whether the administration expects to face further litigation over the memo, the official said simply: \"Yes, of course.\" The Trump administration has long argued that DACA was created illegally by President Obama, but no court has ever reached a final conclusion on that question. A group of Republican state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, are making that same argument in a lawsuit still pending in federal court. Immigration advocates are likely headed back to court as well. The group Make The Road New York, one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case, is building a possible test case with a pair of brothers who filed first-time DACA applications this week. Once they are rejected, the plaintiffs are likely to go back to court to argue that the Trump administration is defying the Supreme Court's ruling. Antonio Alarcon, a DACA recipient and activist with Make The Road New York, called today's move by the administration \"an attack on me and my family.\" \"Our communities are paying close attention to this administration's attacks. And despite its attempt to distract and blame others we know where the blame lies,\" he said.",

Updated at 9:15 p.m. ET The legal fight is heating up over President Trump's call to make an unprecedented change to the population numbers used to divide up seats in Congress among the states. Trump now faces a total of three new federal lawsuits that are joining ongoing legal challenges surrounding the 2020 census. A fourth lawsuit may be coming from California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office, which is planning to file a complaint against the Trump administration, Sarah Lovenheim, an adviser to Becerra, tells NPR. Groups led by Common Cause, a government watchdog group, launched the first federal lawsuit this week. Their complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, two days after Trump issued a memo calling to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the constitutionally mandated count of every person living in the country that is used to redistribute seats in the House of Representatives. On Friday, a New York state-led coalition of 20 states, plus some cities and other localities, filed a challenge in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In their complaint, which cites NPR's reporting, the challengers allege constitutional violations, as well as a claim that the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act by making an \"arbitrary and capricious\" decision to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment count when they don't have the data to reliably do so. In this week's third complaint, which also cites NPR's reporting, immigrant rights groups represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union argue that the directives of Trump's memo also violate administrative law by effectively ordering the Census Bureau to produce population data in a way that has not gone through the proper rulemaking process. \"Government action denying the personhood of people living in the United States echoes the darkest chapters of American constitutional history,\" the complaint says, citing the 1857 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford that declared Black people could not be U.S. citizens but was later overturned by the 13th and 14th Amendments. The Constitution \u2014 which empowers Congress, not the president, with final authority over the census \u2014 requires a once-a-decade count of the \"whole number of persons in each state\" to determine how to reapportion congressional seats and, by extension, Electoral College votes. Trump, however, has ordered information to be produced that would allow him to exclude the number of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization from the latest state population counts that the president is legally required to deliver to Congress after the census is complete. \"It's another election-year tactic to fire up his base by dehumanizing immigrants and using them as scapegoats for his failures as a leader,\" said New York State Attorney General Letitia James in a written statement. \"No one ceases to be a person because they lack documentation, which is why we filed this lawsuit.\" If unauthorized immigrants are left out of the apportionment count, California, Florida and Texas are each likely to end up with one less House seat, while Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio are each likely to hold onto a seat they would have otherwise lost after the 2020 census, according to estimates the Pew Research Center released on Friday. Connecting the memo with the administration's failed attempt to add the now-blocked citizenship question to the 2020 census, the plaintiffs in Common Cause's lawsuit allege that all of the efforts are \"part of an unconstitutional concerted effort to shift political power away from racial and ethnic minorities, chiefly Latinos\" to Republicans and non-Hispanic white people. They are asking a federal judge to declare the president's memo in violation of the Constitution and federal laws as well as to block the administration from carrying it out and the clerk of the House from certifying an apportionment count delivered by the president that does not include people \"on the basis of their citizenship or immigration status.\" Among the other plaintiffs in Common Cause's lawsuit are the cities of Atlanta and Paterson, N.J., a refugee advocacy organization based in San Diego called Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans, and a group of individual U.S. citizens who live in New York and Florida \u2014 all of whom allege that because they are in areas with an \"above-average number of undocumented immigrants,\" Trump's memo would hurt their rights to fair representation in Congress. The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuits, DOJ spokesperson Brianna Herlihy said in an email. The White House did not respond on the record to NPR's request for comment. The Census Bureau and the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau and is named as a defendant in the new cases, did not respond to NPR's inquiries. These new lawsuits join an ongoing legal challenge based in Birmingham, Ala., about who counts for congressional apportionment. The state of Alabama filed that suit in 2018 to try to avoid losing a U.S. House seat. It is arguing against the Census Bureau's long-standing policy of including unauthorized immigrants in the apportionment count. Attorneys with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC are also preparing to challenge Trump's memo as part of an ongoing federal lawsuit over the administration's efforts to use government records to produce citizenship data. They are expected to file an amended complaint with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by Aug. 12 \"We, unfortunately, anticipated that this kind of lawless memorandum would one day come from this administration,\" says Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In a court filing released Wednesday, Terry Ao Minnis \u2014 an attorney who directs census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC \u2014 argued that there is a \"close relationship\" between the administration's efforts to produce more detailed data about U.S. citizens and its efforts for a count of unauthorized immigrants. Both come with the \"same attendant issues of lack of accuracy and discrimination against Latinos, non-U.S. citizens and those who live near non-U.S. citizens,\" Minnis wrote. During a hearing for that same lawsuit, comments by a Justice Department attorney provided some insight into how far along the administration is in producing data to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment count. \"We don't have all the administrative records yet. We haven't formulated a methodology for how we would do this and things of that nature,\" Stephen Ehrlich told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland on Wednesday, adding later a potential need for \"some statistical modeling.\" In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that census data produced using statistical sampling cannot be used to reapportion Congress. The latest legal challenges push the 2020 census further into a growing political firestorm as the national head count struggles to overcome pandemic-induced delays. It is still unclear whether Congress will grant the Census Bureau's request for a four-month extension to the current legal deadline of Dec. 31 for delivering the 2020 census apportionment count to the president as well as the deadline for redistricting data on March 31. Since Tuesday's announcement of Trump's memo, Democratic lawmakers have been quick to condemn the move. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., introduced a bill Wednesday that would ban using federal funds to \"implement, administer, enforce, or carry out\" the memo's directives. The House Oversight and Reform Committee is planning to hold an emergency hearing on Wednesday. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham and the bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, have been invited to appear as witnesses, along with three former directors of the agency, according to a statement by the committee's chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said the president's move \"appears to be a blatant attempt to politicize the 2020 Census, depress participation, and undermine its accuracy.\" Minutes after Common Cause issued a press release Thursday announcing its legal challenge, Trump's reelection campaign sent an email to supporters soliciting $23 donations by offering \"an exact replica\" of the pen the president used to sign the memo. The president's memo makes no mention of excluding unauthorized immigrants from the census in general, only from the \"apportionment base\" used to redistribute House seats. But the campaign's email described the memo as an \"executive order\" that was signed to \"put America FIRST by blocking illegal aliens from receiving congressional representation and being counted in the U.S. Census.\"",

Updated at 6:34 p.m. ET President Trump released a memorandum Tuesday that calls for an unprecedented change to the constitutionally mandated count of every person living in the country \u2014 the exclusion of unauthorized immigrants from the numbers used to divide up seats in Congress among the states. The memo instructs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Commerce Department, to include in the legally required report of census results to the president \"information permitting the President, to the extent practicable\" to leave out the number of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization from the apportionment count. But the move by the president, who does not have final authority over the census, is more likely to spur legal challenges and political spectacle in the last months before this year's presidential election than a transformation of the once-a-decade head count, which has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. \"The House of Representatives will vigorously contest the President's unconstitutional and unlawful attempt to impair the Census,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a written statement. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee say they are preparing to hold an emergency hearing about the census next week. Groups who fought against the administration's efforts to add the now-blocked citizenship question to the 2020 census \u2014 including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and the state attorney general's offices in New York and California \u2014 signaled on Tuesday they're preparing legal action against Trump's memo. \"His latest attempt to weaponize the census for an attack on immigrant communities will be found unconstitutional. We'll see him in court, and win, again,\" said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project. \"No one ceases to be a person because they lack documentation,\" New York State Attorney General Letitia James said in a written statement. \"Under the law, every person residing in the U.S. during the census, regardless of status, must be counted.\" Since the first U.S. census in 1790, both U.S. citizens and noncitizens \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 have been included in the country's official population counts. The fifth sentence of the Constitution specifies that \"persons\" residing in the states should be counted every 10 years to determine each state's share of seats in the House of Representatives. The 14th Amendment, which ended the counting of an enslaved person as \"three fifths\" of a free person, goes further to require the counting of the \"whole number of persons in each state.\" It is Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 that Article 1, Section 2 of the country's founding document empowers to carry out the \"actual enumeration\" of the country's population in \"such manner as they shall by law direct.\" In Title 2 of the U.S. Code, Congress detailed its instructions for the president to report to lawmakers the tally of the \"whole number of persons\" living in each state for the reapportionment of House seats. In Title 13, Congress established additional key dates for the \"tabulation of total population.\" The state of Alabama, however, is arguing in an ongoing federal lawsuit that the framers of the Constitution did not intend for the term \"persons\" to include immigrants living in the country without authorization. Alabama says it's trying to avoid losing a seat in Congress after the 2020 census by seeking to leave out unauthorized immigrants from the results of the national count that are used to reapportion the U.S. House. U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who joined the state's lawsuit, and Alabama State Attorney General Steve Marshall both praised Trump's memo in statements released Tuesday. \"Representation should be based on those people who reside in their states and this country lawfully,\" Marshall said in a statement. \"A contrary result would rob the State of Alabama and its legal residents of their rightful share of representation and undermine the rule of law.\" Attorneys with civil rights groups and a coalition of states led by New York have intervened in the Alabama lawsuit to defend the Census Bureau's policy of including unauthorized immigrants in the counts for apportionment, which under current federal law is not set to happen until early 2021. \"The fact that he's publicly announced it months ahead of when that might occur is somewhat surprising. Obviously, he feels the need once more to distract from his failed leadership,\" says Thomas Saenz, MALDEF's president and general counsel, of Trump's memo. \"This is all about trying to suppress the growing political power of the Latino community.\" Citing a 1992 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in Franklin v. Massachusetts, Trump's memo argues the president has the discretion to determine who should be included in the apportionment count. But according to Title 2, it is the clerk of the House of Representatives who is supposed to send to the state governors a \"certificate of the number of Representatives\" each state receives. It is unclear exactly how the Census Bureau can produce population counts that only include U.S. citizens and green card holders and do not involve the use of statistical sampling, which, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999, is not allowed for numbers used to reapportion Congress. The forms for this year's census, which officially began in January, do not ask about a person's immigration status. Still, Trump's announcement, first signaled in a Politico newsletter last week, comes just over a year after the administration backed down in its failed attempt to add the now-blocked citizenship question to the 2020 census. In July 2019, the president issued an executive order to use government records, including from state departments of motor vehicles and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, to produce anonymized citizenship data that could be used to redraw voting districts in a way that, a GOP strategist concluded, would politically benefit Republicans and non-Hispanic white people. That same order notes that government records on citizenship would help \"generate a more reliable count of the unauthorized alien population in the country.\" \"Data tabulating both the overall population and the citizen population could be combined with records of aliens lawfully present in the country to generate an estimate of the aggregate number of aliens unlawfully present in each State,\" the order says. There is a decades-long history of lawsuits going back to the 1980s that tried to get unauthorized immigrants excluded from the apportionment count. The cases, which were led by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an immigration restrictionist group, were ultimately dismissed. But Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who is now running in a Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat, has raised with the Trump administration the \"problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional reapportionment purposes.\" With the national census self-response rate at just over 62%, the White House announcement threatens to derail the Census Bureau's efforts to finish tallying up roughly four out of 10 households that have not filled out a census form on their own. When the bureau will deliver the results of the count is an open question. While the apportionment count is due to the president by Dec. 31 under current federal law, the bureau's officials have asked Congress to pass four-month extensions to their deadlines because of the pandemic. So far, only Democrats in the House and Senate have introduced bills that would grant extensions. The agency's operational plan for the 2020 census includes specially designed efforts, such as providing online forms and call centers in 13 languages, to try to make sure the census includes undocumented immigrants and other populations the bureau considers \"hard-to-count.\" According to the Census Bureau's residence criteria for determining how to count different groups of residents for the 2020 census, citizens of foreign countries who are living in the U.S. are supposed to be counted \"at the U.S. residence where they live and sleep most of the time,\" while international visitors should not be counted. The bureau has been relying on ads and community groups to help ramp up its outreach to households with immigrants, people of color and other historically undercounted groups, many of whom remain distrustful of sharing their information with the government despite federal laws that require the Census Bureau to keep personally identifiable census information confidential until 72 years after it's been collected and prohibit that information from being used against an individual. Many organizations that have been leading efforts to boost census participation have condemned Trump's memo. \"Trump is attempting to upend the $16 billion, half-finished census, leaving states with inaccurate numbers that will deprive communities of federal assistance to recover from the pandemic,\" said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a statement. \"As we are in the middle of a pandemic, the timing of these developments adds a transparent layer of cruelty to the Administration's actions,\" said Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, adding that the memo \"would waste billions of taxpayer dollars that have already been spent to carry out the count thus far.\" The administration has also raised concerns in recent weeks by making two new political appointments at the bureau. The move has sparked an inquiry by the inspector general for the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau. Democratic lawmakers and professional associations, including the American Statistical Association and the American Economic Association, are questioning whether the appointments of Nathaniel Cogley, a political science professor, and Adam Korzeniewski, a former political consultant to a YouTube personality known for racist pranks, are a partisan attempt to interfere with the census.

            "article_content": "President Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone on Friday, just days before he was set to report to prison. Scholars say Trump's clemencies have rewarded friends and allies.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone on Friday, just days before he was set to report to prison. Scholars say Trump's clemencies have rewarded friends and allies. President Trump issued his first pardon in August 2017, just about seven months into his presidency. Three years and three dozen clemencies later, some patterns have emerged. One clear pattern is Trump's tendency to grant clemency to prominent political figures and people who have shown loyalty to him, clemency scholars say. That propensity was on full display on Friday, as Trump commuted the sentence of his former campaign adviser Roger Stone. Stone was just days away from beginning a 40-month prison term for lying to lawmakers investigating Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election. \"Modern presidents have sullied clemency through disuse (both Bushes) and occasional self-serving grants (Clinton),\" Mark Osler, a law professor and clemency scholar at the University of St. Thomas' School of Law, told NPR via email. \"However, no president has ever used clemency primarily to reward friends and political allies\" \u2014 until Trump. In announcing the commutation Friday, the White House called Stone a \"victim of the Russia Hoax\" and said he \"has already suffered greatly.\" Presidents can grant clemency through both commutations, which reduce a prison sentence but do not erase a conviction, and pardons, which express presidential \"forgiveness\" and can restore certain civil rights. With only a handful of exceptions, Osler said, Trump's clemency grants have gone to \"people he knows or learned about from Fox News.\" On a single day in February, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, all of whom had one thing in common: either their cases were promoted on Fox News or they had an inside connection to the president. Trump also prefers to disregard the advice of the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice, said American University professor Jeffrey Crouch, who has written extensively on the presidential pardon power. That office is responsible for vetting the thousands of clemency requests the government gets every year. For over a century, presidents have relied on the recommendations of that office. Not so for Trump, who prefers to make his own decisions. A Washington Post investigation found that most of Trump's grants of clemency \"have gone to well-connected offenders who had not filed petitions with the pardon office or did not meet its requirements.\" \"He has largely ignored the little guy, or anonymous offenders who apply for presidential mercy through the usual channels,\" Crouch told NPR. \"Under President Trump, the old back door to clemency \u2014 getting the president's attention somehow \u2014 seems to have become the new front door.\" Trump's first pardon went to former Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio was convicted of contempt of court after he continued detaining suspected undocumented immigrants after a judge warned him to stop targeting Latino drivers. Arpaio's pardon did not go through the pardon attorney's office. And that first pardon would set the tone for many of Trump's pardons and commutations to come. The president's clemency power is supposed to exist solely to protect the national interest, said professor Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Rozell cited Alexander Hamilton's pronouncement in the Federalist Papers that it's better to give this power to the president \u2014 \"a single man of prudence and good sense\" \u2014 than to a legislative body like Congress. The Founding Fathers never anticipated that a president would use his power as Trump has, Rozell said. \"There is nothing in Trump's pardons of political allies and cronies that meets the national interest standard,\" Rozell told NPR. \"It is a mockery of the constitutional power vested in him.\" Trump isn't the only president to use his power to help allies. Rozell cited what he called \"some egregiously bad examples of the use of the pardon power\" \u2014 Bill Clinton's pardons of Marc Rich and others on his last day in office, and George H.W. Bush's pardons of six Iran-Contra scandal figures, issued after he lost his bid for reelection. But \"no one has violated the principles underlying the pardon power so much as [Trump] has,\" Rozell said. Trump's immediate predecessor also faced criticism for his use of clemency powers. By the end of his two terms, Barack Obama had proudly granted more commutations than any other president in history \u2014 most of his later clemencies went to low-level criminals, especially those convicted of drug offenses with harsh penalties. And some of Obama's clemencies drew harsh criticism, especially from conservatives \u2014 such as his commutation for Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of sharing classified information, or Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera, a Puerto Rican activist who had served 35 years of a 55-year sentence after his organization set off more than 100 bombs in the 1970s and '80s. \"I don't see these in the same category, though, as granting clemency to someone who was convicted of lying to protect the president who later pardoned him,\" Rozell said. The Roger Stone commutation has been highly controversial, both among Democratic lawmakers and among some members of Trump's own party. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney called it \"unprecedented, historic corruption.\" But Trump doesn't seem so concerned about how his clemency decisions could impact his approval rating, Crouch said, calling the timing \"very unusual.\" Most controversial clemency grants by several recent presidents came only after those presidents were \"free from electoral consequences,\" Crouch said. But the Stone commutation \"came just four months before the president will stand for reelection.\"",

David Litt, author of Thanks, Obama and a speechwriter for the 44th president, has a prescription: Democracy In One Book Or Less: How it Works, Why It Doesn't, and Why Fixing It Is Easier Than You Think. Litt refreshingly debunks myths about our founders, pointing up false narratives and warped historical perceptions.

Until President Trump, \"no politician ... has so openly treated accumulating power as a sport,\" Litt writes. McConnell's political ideal: Constituents have nothing to do with it. Litt presents statistics that prove our democracy is ill: Since 1980, the number of Americans legally barred from voting has more than doubled. Since the 1990s, the odds of living in a competitive congressional district have fallen by half. Since 2000, money spent on lobbying in Washington has risen by 100 percent. Democracy In One Book Or Less explores egregious injustices throughout our system and proposes solutions. Voting inequities serve as illustration. Contrary to common perceptions, nonvoters are not \"couch potatoes,\" abjuring their civic duties. Litt discusses Rick Scott, a white man who ran a Florida hospital system that committed massive Medicare fraud. The Justice Department obtained a $1.7 billion settlement from the company but charged no executives. Litt then considers Ricky Scott, a black man charged with \"grand theft\" in Florida, which can be something as trivial as removing a fire extinguisher from a wall. The white man is the junior senator from Florida following two terms as governor; the black man was found guilty of a felony and barred from voting for life. Before 2006, no state required an ID to vote. Today, Litt says, 17 states do. In Tennessee, a voter with a gun permit can vote, while a student using a University of Tennessee ID cannot. ID laws, however, aren't the biggest problem. Voter \"purges\" result in glaring injustices. A chapter outs the \"godfather of the modern purge,\" Hans von Spakovsky, former member of the Federal Election Commission and the Republican party's standard bearer for shrinking the electorate. Litt spotlights Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the white gubernatorial candidate who happened to be the state official in charge of voting, as responsible for purging 1.5 million names from the rolls under a new \"Use It or Lose It\" rule he put into place. Moreover, Litt recounts, on election day 2018, Fulton County, which includes much of metro Atlanta (read, African American), locked up a quarter of its voting machines. Abrams \"lost\" by 55,000. It is an ugly truth that in red and blue states alike, \"The less white your neighborhood, the longer you wait,\" Litt writes. We don't have to have million of adults legally barred from voting. Litt offers solutions, showing their success in other countries. He suggests we automatically register voters as soon as they turn 18; help disabled people get to the polls; vote by mail so people don't miss work, or, in the age of pandemic, risk their health. He notes we can vote on weekends, when it's easier for low-wage workers, and abolish voter ID laws because despite false claims by President Trump, voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. The franchise can and has been expanded. Litt reports that 40 states have allowed non-citizen immigrants to vote at one time or another, but not since 1926. He believes there's no reason why long-term undocumented people shouldn't be allowed to vote, to say nothing of greencard holders. Litt examines the flaws of the Electoral College, which can result in the winner of the popular vote losing the presidency, as happened with Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. Although the Electoral College is constitutionally mandated, there are ways to fix it. Using Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson as an example, Litt probes the evils of money in politics. \"Dark,\" unreported money donated to candidates of both parties severs them from constituents, making them accountable only to their wealthiest donors. Although a majority of Americans care deeply care about a range of issues, including gun control and curbing global warming, politicians can not only ignore, but also escalate these problems with impunity. Here's Litt on the Trump administration, where there is no daylight between official government and special interests: A coal-mining lobbyist was appointed to run the Environmental Protection Agency, an oil-and-gas lobbyist the Interior Department, a banking lobbyist the Labor Department, and a steel industry lobbyist to serve as U.S. Trade Representative. The book has a long section on the negative impacts of gerrymandering congressional districts and ends with the challenges of getting a bill through Congress, two phenomena that are not unrelated. The good news is that there isn't space to describe most of Litt's proposed solutions. Democracy In One Book Or Less is a no-nonsense guide for how we, the people, can fix ourselves. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, \"Democracy is direct self-government over all the people, for all the people, by all the people.\" \"I'd sure like to live in a country like that,\" Litt concludes. Me too. Martha Anne Toll's writing is at www.marthaannetoll.com, and she tweets @marthaannetoll. She was the founding executive director of the Butler Family Fund.",

Today, the 643,000 DACA recipients in the United States can breathe a little easier. After the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision allowing the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Program to remain in place, calling the Trump administration's rescinding of the program \"arbitrary and capricious\", it's been a cause for celebration\u2014if a cautious one\u2014 by advocates and the \"Dreamers\". Since the program was announced in 2012, DACA has been a lifeline for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Their two-year permits allow them to work and defers deportation. And, depending on state law, DACA status can mean access to a slew of other benefits, such as in-state college tuition, drivers' licenses and health insurance. Roberto G. Gonzales, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, calls DACA the \"most successful immigration policy\" since 1986, when Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act and, when signed by President Ronald Reagan, legalized the presence of almost 3 million immigrants. Gonzales, the director of the Immigration Initiative at Harvard, has witnessed firsthand the life-changing effects of the program. For the past two decades, he has studied the outcomes of undocumented youth, before and after DACA was put in place. In his 2015 book Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America, he profiles young adults in Los Angeles who, despite their best efforts, couldn't access most life opportunities because they didn't have a Social Security number. And since the program's inception, he has surveyed over 2,600 recipients about how it has affected their lives \u2014 overwhelmingly, he says, for the better. I spoke with Gonzales, before and after the Supreme Court handed down its decision, to talk about the program's impact, and what comes next for the Dreamers. He'll also join us on an upcoming episode of the Code Switch podcast \u2014 stay tuned. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. When you first read the court's opinion, what went through your mind? I've heard from several colleagues, and the consensus is that the Supreme Court got it right, that today is a day to celebrate. But this issue is not going away, and so this is not over yet. The courts didn't rule on the program, but rather on how the Trump administration terminated the program. So the ball goes back to the Trump administration's court, even to Congress, to try to do something. The life of DACA really hangs in the balance. So, we know what's going to happen over these next several months will critically determine the future of this program, but also of young people. And not only for a segment of young people, but for their parents, for siblings, for romantic partners, for a broader community. Today, many people will celebrate. But people are well aware that there's a lot more work to be done. You had worked with, and profiled, young undocumented people before the creation of the DACA program. What had their lives looked like pre-2012? Before graduate school, I worked as a youth worker at a neighborhood social service agency. Working alongside immigrant kids and families gave me a worm's eye view of the ways in which immigration and schooling were framing kids' everyday worlds. Over time, I started to realize that many of our neighborhood youth were hitting walls at around 14 to 16 years old as their friends were moving forward, obtaining driver's licenses, taking after school jobs and starting to prepare for college. They were realizing the limitations of their of immigration status and they weren't able to join their friends. Fast forward a few years later, I was in a graduate program in California and doing volunteer work in Southern California communities. I started meeting other young people who had moved to California with their families at 6 months old to 5 years old. And again, at a really critical time in adolescence, they started running into dead ends, running into the limitations of their immigration status. By now, I've met hundreds who had this kind of pivotal moment, when they come to realize that their undocumented status will block them from the means through which to achieve their goals, their dreams and aspirations. And since DACA was implemented, you've been following and studying its trajectory. What are your biggest takeaways from that research? The evidence is clear and indisputable. DACA has made a tremendous impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people over the last eight years. Just 10 months after the implementation of DACA, our respondents were obtaining driver's licenses, acquiring new jobs, increasing their earnings and had access to new forms of health care through new work and educational opportunities. They were starting to build credit by opening up bank accounts and applying to credit cards. And as a result, they were able to play a more meaningful role for their families. This meant being able to drive parents to and from work, and having the opportunity to take on extra jobs and larger responsibilities for paying rent and mortgages. All of the young people that we've met through this research have used their DACA benefits and status to benefit family members. They have been excited and proud to be able to do more to help their families. And having the ability to pursue careers, to provide daycare for their children, to provide assistance to their parents, to contribute to local economies in more meaningful ways, it's a net benefit to entire households and their larger communities. For example, one woman we surveyed has done remarkably well with her DACA status. She's making upwards of $65,000 a year. She's moved into her own apartment. She's saving up money to buy a house. And every month she sends her grandmother in Mexico $400. She knows that that money goes a long way to help her grandmother and to help other members of her extended family. They may be divided by borders, but there's an opportunity to play a more meaningful role, at least financially. This is a group of young people who want to go forward and progress in their lives, but want to go forward with their parents, with their family members, with their entire community. Besides the material benefits, what other changes have you seen take place? Prior to DACA, the young people that I met were experiencing mental and physical manifestations of stress, because of the stress of of leading undocumented lives. They often had chronic toothaches, headaches, sleeping problems, trouble getting out of bed in the morning, eating disorders, depression and suicidal ideation. It became very clear to me there's a very strong link between undocumented status and strained well-being. In our survey, nearly 70 percent of almost 2,700 young people told us that they felt less stress in their everyday lives. Two thirds of them said that they were less afraid of being deported, and about equal numbers said they were less afraid of the police. Because of DACA, they don't have to live everyday lives always looking over their shoulders and worrying. How did their emotional state change when when the Trump administration first announced it was rescinding DACA? Shortly after the announcement, I fielded many calls by young people across the country, and I spoke to a lot of our students at Harvard. People were really stressed out. For many of them back in 2012, they feared what it meant to come forward and submit their documentation to the federal government. And now, there was this moment where the status that had been a tremendous boost for them and their families could be taken away. They were really struggling to grasp what life might look like and feel like living with an expiration date. A young man from Atlanta I talked to had all of these thoughts running through his head: Do I stay? If I stay, what is going to happen? Do I leave college? What would it look like if I go back to Mexico? What would it look like if I have to start from scratch? He was really struggling with the choice between what he felt were really terrible alternatives: staying without DACA and trying to make things work for himself, or going to Mexico, and trying to navigate a system that he didn't know. I met another young woman from California, who I think represented the spirit of a lot of older DACA beneficiaries. And she told me: \"We've been here before.I can still remember what life was like for me prior to DACA. It was a hustle and it was a struggle every way, at every turn. But I came out of it successful. This is not going to be what I've been planning for. But we've got a really powerful youth movement. And I will put all of my time, all my energy into organizing.\" I've met a lot of young people who hold one or both of those perspectives, often at the same time. There's a worry and despair, but also the thought that \"I don't really have time to worry about this, to think about it too much. I really need to take action.\" Do you have a sense of what comes next in these upcoming months? Where do Dreamers go from here? That may be today's $64,000 question. I think that so many people have been holding their breaths for this decision for so long, that now is a time for stepping back and reflecting, and understanding that there is now a window of time and an opportunity to push. This is an issue that's not going away, and it's going to be front and center for the next several months during the presidential campaign heading up to the election. I can imagine that advocates and activists are trying to think of the particular pressure points around which to organize and to raise awareness. I think that there will be connections between the immigrant-rights movement, Black Lives Matter, and the LGBTQ movement, articulating a more nuanced and wider reaching message that connects the dots on these issues. But at least for now, many young people will breathe a huge sigh of relief and know that they can lead their lives, in the coming weeks and months, perhaps with a little more security and a little more comfort.",

            "article_content": "So it seems the country is having a racial reckoning \u2014 again. Protests and marches have erupted across the country in broad support of the Black Lives Matter movement, even in alabaster-white cities with negligible black populations. The top of The New York Times' bestseller list was seemingly fueled by the same energy \u2014 White Fragility, Me and White Supremacy, How to Be an Antiracist, So You Want to Talk About Race \u2014 undoubtedly as a result of the many, many reading lists published in the last few weeks meant to help white people think more critically about race in the United States. Our own podcast shot up to No. 1 on the Apple Podcast charts; it was frequently mentioned on the aforementioned lists. And with it, our social media accounts gained tens of thousands of new followers, many of whom appeared to be white, over the course of just a few days. At the same time, several major polls showed that white support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which was underwater at the time of the Ferguson, Mo., protests in 2014, had spiked in recent weeks. Some major shift appears to be happening with a large cohort of white people. But why now? The events that catalyzed this zeal among them were clear in their urgency. There was the horrific video of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck, which followed the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, which followed the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. But, of course, the recent history of the United States is replete with disasters such as these. Eric Garner's death on Staten Island in 2014 at the hands of police was eerily similar to that of Floyd's. Philando Castile was killed by an officer in 2016 in a shooting not far from where Floyd was killed. Both those encounters were captured on videos that went viral and became national news. Weren't those cases sufficiently outrageous? So I decided to ask our new white followers on Instagram what had changed \u2014 either in the world or in their personal lives \u2014 that moved them to \"finally get off the sidelines,\" as many of them were putting it in their posts on the platform. Their responses (and there were many) were a stew of zeal, frankness and some embarrassment. Many people said they weren't sure why this moment was different. There was nuance and personal texture to the responses, but several overarching themes quickly emerged. The first, perhaps not surprisingly, was President Trump, who was referenced directly or obliquely in almost every message I received. Some people said that his demagoguery on race made the problem of American racism legible to them in a way it hadn't been before. (\"If more than half of my country supports Trump and agrees with his views, we have much more work to do [than] I had previously imagined,\" one person admitted.) Others said the shock of his election sparked their personal political awakenings, after which they attended Women's Marches and became more active in their communities and online. So by the time this current moment arrived, they were more plugged in and experienced political actors, more habituated to protest. Still other people saw Trump and the federal government's mishandling of the pandemic response as a big factor. Indeed, the role of COVID-19 in general was another major theme in the responses: as a threat to their own health, for example, or as a disrupter of routine. Some people said straightforwardly that the moment has caused them to worry about their physical and economic well-beings, and the lockdown had taken away many of the distractions that allowed them to ignore inequality. \"During COVID I've also felt a physical vulnerability in the face of the virus that's made me more empathetic and shifted my priorities to some degree,\" one person wrote. \"In some ways I think that increased vulnerability has also re-sensitized me toward images of violence against black bodies, which my privilege had allowed me to tune out to some degree before.\" And the final major theme among these respondents? To them, it seemed that their (white) peers had become more outspoken this time around. Some people I talked to wondered if perhaps the people around them were being pulled along with the current. \"[O]ne motivating factor that I am not proud of but that I have recognized as relevant \u2014 in my personal circle, a larger number of white people are speaking up, and unconsciously I think that makes it feel safer and more important to care,\" one person wrote. \"I recognize that this is ... highly problematic ... [b]ut I wouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't recognize this as a layer of this moment for me.\" Another person echoed that idea. \"From what I noticed in my own feeds, in the past it was conspicuous to be speaking out about BLM as a white person,\" they wrote. \"Now it feels conspicuous to NOT be sharing a post, linking to places to donate, etc. [A repeated] claim I'm seeing from white friends is 'notice who of your friends is not posting right now.' \" But this wave of anti-racist signaling didn't just create pressure from white peers \u2014 it also created permission. \"It became inappropriate to be silent, and seemed like there would be less social [repercussions] from being that white girl who is always talking about race and equality,\" a person wrote. \"Which is extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing to admit.\" What people didn't say was also illuminating. Few people who responded to me said that they had become activated because of social proximity to black people \u2014 which isn't surprising, given how few white people have nonwhite friends. So while much of the conceptual space and groundwork for this moment was laid by black organizers, these messages suggest that much of this political foment among white people is happening because of contact with other white people.",

A man on stilts wears State of Jefferson regalia at a Timber Unity rally in front of the Oregon Capitol in Salem, Ore., this month. The push for a State of Jefferson began in 1941. Some rural Oregonians are so frustrated by Democratic politics that they want to leave the state. But not by moving elsewhere. Instead, a group is seeking to change the map itself, so that most of Oregon and a chunk of Northern California would break off and join Idaho, a Republican-majority state. Move Oregon's Border For a Greater Idaho succeeded in getting petitions approved for circulation in two rural Oregon counties this month. This is only the latest separatist cause in Pacific Northwest history to spark popular interest, despite being practically infeasible for a long list of legal, political and economic reasons. \"It's a movement to try to maintain our rural values,\" said Move Oregon's Border spokesman Mike McCarter, a 73-year-old retired nurseryman and firearms instructor from the Central Oregon town of La Pine, population 1,900. More than half of all Oregonians live in the Portland metro area, 200 miles from McCarter. He said policy set by a predominantly urban, Democratic supermajority in the state legislature is fomenting frustration in the conservative, rural areas of the state. \"We're afraid of what's coming down legislatively. It'll destroy rural Oregon,\" he said, adding: \"I grew up in the '50s and '60s, and it was a great time. It was a blue-collar state, a state of hardworking people.\" The messaging hits cultural flashpoints. Idaho has more permissive gun laws, and more restrictions on abortion. The state doesn't allow sanctuary cities, nor does it issue driver's licenses to immigrants in the country illegally, according to a proposed ballot measure in the group's literature. National media coverage exploded the group's social media following last week, after officials in Douglas and Josephine counties approved language for petitions to put a measure on the ballot. But, even a widespread yes vote by the rural counties in an election wouldn't change any state boundaries. Doing so would require agreement from three state legislatures and Congress. The ballot measures direct individual county commissions to become advocates for the cause. \"One of the ways to see this moment is as a form of political protest and political theater,\" said political scientist Joe Lowndes, an associate professor at the University of Oregon specializing in populist movements. Rallying people around state lines and secessionist causes has a rich history in the Pacific Northwest. In 1941, ranchers, miners and loggers on the California-Oregon border staged a rebellion and proclaimed themselves citizens of the State of Jefferson. The symbols of this cause continue to dominate flags and T-shirts, like those seen at a recent protest in Salem over cap-and-trade legislation to address climate change. Then there's the Cascadia Independence movement, which seeks to erase state lines and form an environmentally conscious bioregion. Meanwhile, numerous right-leaning groups and militias energize followers across the West by challenging federal authority and trumpeting county-based rule over natural resources. The movements veer all over the political map, Lowndes said, but there are threads to bind them, like an emphasis on local control and self-determination. He traces the ideas back to Manifest Destiny, a 19th century doctrine that was used to justify white supremacy and the colonization of indigenous lands. Spokesman Mike McCarter called Move Oregon's Border For a Greater Idaho \"a movement to try to maintain our rural values.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Emily Cureton/OPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption Spokesman Mike McCarter called Move Oregon's Border For a Greater Idaho \"a movement to try to maintain our rural values.\" Moving state lines is a process laid out in the U.S. Constitution, \"particularly Article 4, Section 3,\" said Shaakirrah Sanders, professor of constitutional law at the University of Idaho. But even with a road map, there are likely deal-breakers. California and Oregon would lose population, and therefore representatives in Congress, \"and that's usually not something that states like to have happen,\" Sanders said. There's another big, green problem: the growing and selling of marijuana. Legal cannabis has become a pillar of the rural economy in Oregon and California, while Idaho still has some of the harshest laws in the country criminalizing it. Sanders, a black woman who lives in Boise, said she has gotten used to contradictions in American society. She has devoted a career to a document that when it was written, codified both freedom and slavery. \"It's not that strange to me that the same constitution that protects an LGBTQ person's right to marry, is the same constitution that someone wants to use to create a superconservative megastate,\" Sanders said. Now, that same constitution sets the rules of engagement for a conflict over what it means to be an Oregonian.",

Trump said the two leaders were discussing a possible trade deal and called Modi \"a very tough negotiator.\" Updated at 9 a.m. ET \"America loves India, America respects India, and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people,\" President Trump told a cheering crowd of more than 100,000 people in India's huge Motera cricket stadium on Monday. \"From this day on, India will always hold a very special place in our hearts,\" Trump said. He referred to his host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as \"a man I am proud to call my true friend.\" Despite some economic friction between their countries, Trump and Modi have fostered a warm personal friendship. And Modi evidently knows just how to greet the U.S. president when he drops in for a visit \u2014 with throngs of adoring fans. It was the second time the pair have basked in a campaign-like atmosphere together, after a similar scene played out during Modi's visit to the U.S. last year. \"Both of us understand that when leaders put their citizens first, we can forge strong and fair partnerships to build a safer and more prosperous world,\" Trump said. The president also noted the contributions and heritage of 4 million Indians who have immigrated to the U.S., saying, \"They are truly spectacular people.\" \"Nearly 1 in 4 Indian Americans trace their roots right here in Gujarat,\" Trump said as the crowd cheered. Calling for even stronger economic and cultural ties between the two countries, Trump sought to paint an enticing picture of the U.S. under his leadership. \"This is truly an exciting time in the United States,\" he said. \"Our economy is booming like never before. Our people are prospering and spirits are soaring. There is tremendous love, tremendous like. We like and we love everybody.\" Shortly after Trump and first lady Melania Trump touched down in Ahmedabad, the largest city in Modi's home state of Gujarat, they headed to a rally at the Sardar Patel Gujarat Stadium, named for a key architect of independent India and billed as the largest cricket stadium in the world. Monday's celebration at the newly renovated facility was titled \"Namaste Trump\" \u2014 a nod to the similarly gargantuan \"Howdy Modi\" fete for the prime minister last fall at Houston's NRG Stadium.

People attending were handed white baseball caps with the words \"Namaste\" \u2013 hello, in Hindi \u2014 and \"Trump,\" in orange letters, as they entered the stadium ahead of the event. Indian folk dancers performed to thumping music and flashing lights. Famous Bollywood singer Kailash Kher belted out popular Hindi songs. Lawyer Kelly Dhruv, who was watching from the stadium's premium section facing the main stage, described the atmosphere as \"like a concert but for political leaders.\" Trump's daughter Ivanka walked in with India's foreign minister and shook hands with people in the front row as well as with India's controversial home minister, Amit Shah \u2014 the author of Hindu nationalist policies that have prompted widespread protests in recent months. Then it was time for the main event. As Trump and Modi emerged onto the stage, the song \"Macho Man\" blasted through the stadium. The rally also attracted members of Modi's party, business leaders and groups of schoolchildren. Pooja Jahani, a local Gujarati artist, brought a 5-foot-wide oil painting that depicts a map of India inside a map of the United States. She said it symbolizes how \"the United States is in India's heart, and India is in the United States' heart.\" Trump repeatedly drew cheers from crowd, particularly when he used Indian terms such as chaiwala -- the tea-selling job that Modi famously rose from to lead his country. Trump was applauded at least 57 times during his 27-minute speech, according to the official White House transcript of the event. The U.S. president would be the first to tell you: He and Modi share a warm personal friendship. And Modi, as Trump's friend, evidently knows just how to greet the U.S. president when he drops in for a visit \u2014 with throngs of adoring fans. For all the physical enormity of the event, though, expectations of Trump's two-day visit remain modest \u2014 even from Trump himself. The president has carefully downplayed the prospect of a major trade deal anytime soon. \"We will be making very, very major \u2014 among the biggest ever made \u2014 trade deals,\" Trump said Monday. But he added that the discussions are still in their early phases. And while Trump said he's optimistic about reaching an agreement, he said of Modi, \"Except that he's a very tough negotiator.\" The two countries enjoy a robust trading relationship, totaling more than $142 billion as of 2018, but as that relationship has grown, so too have the tensions between them. The U.S. runs a goods trade deficit with India that crested $23 billion last year alone, and the Trump administration has chafed at the tariffs protecting Indian markets from foreign competition as \"the highest of any major economy.\" \"We're doing a very big trade deal with India. We'll have it. I don't know if it'll be done before the [U.S. presidential] election,\" Trump told reporters last week at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, \"but we'll have a very big deal with India.\" \"We're not treated very well by India,\" Trump added, \"but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.\" The newly renovated Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, billed as the largest cricket stadium in the world, is the centerpiece of President Trump's two-day visit to India, where the president and his wife, Melania, are getting feted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his home state of Gujarat.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Panthaky/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The newly renovated Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, billed as the largest cricket stadium in the world, is the centerpiece of President Trump's two-day visit to India, where the president and his wife, Melania, are getting feted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his home state of Gujarat. For Modi, in some ways, Ahmedabad makes for a logical choice to host the president. The city is the major population center of Gujarat state, where Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014. Its booming development was one of the linchpins of his successful run for India's top political office. At the same time, the setting recalls some bitter, bloody associations for Modi. He was in office during a wave of anti-Muslim violence in the state in 2002, after a fire on a train left dozens of Hindu activists dead. The region was racked with riots, during which more than 1,000 Muslims are believed to have been killed. Critics blamed Modi for intentionally failing to protect the religious minority during the unrest. The U.S., under President George W. Bush, even denied him a visa due to his \"severe violations of religious freedom,\" and the American government effectively boycotted him until shortly before he became prime minister. A special investigation ultimately exonerated Modi in 2013, around the same time Modi wrote a long blog post explaining that he was \"shaken to the core\" by the violence. But the violence in Gujarat continues to shadow his legacy. So, too, have suspicions of anti-Muslim bias. Modi's Hindu nationalist government last year pushed through Parliament a controversial law offering amnesty to undocumented migrants from three nearby Muslim-majority countries \u2014 so long as the applicants are religious minorities and not Muslim. The law has prompted nationwide demonstrations, some of which have devolved into deadly clashes between police and protesters. Trump, for his part, has attracted similar criticism with his own rhetoric and administration policies. During his campaign, the president proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. \u2014 a campaign pledge that, after several attempts, ultimately became a Supreme Court-approved ban on travelers from about half a dozen countries, most of which are majority Muslim. The pair of leaders didn't spend all their time in Gujarat. Trump also toured the Taj Mahal, in Uttar Pradesh state, before wrapping up his trip in New Delhi, where they are expected to deliver a joint statement Tuesday.",

Now, he's working to make changes and revive the plan ahead of the 2020 election.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jared Kushner first tackled a merit-based immigration proposal last year. It landed with a thud. Now, he's working to make changes and revive the plan ahead of the 2020 election. Updated at 9:10 p.m. ET Jared Kushner has been quietly trying to resurrect discussions to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, multiple people familiar with the conversations have told NPR. President Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law has been meeting with business leaders, immigration hard-liners and other interest groups important to Republicans with the goal of rolling out a new immigration plan once Trump's impeachment trial ended. The effort responds to a lobbying push by business groups, which have sought to use the booming economy \u2014 a core part of Trump's 2020 campaign message \u2014 to make their case for more workers to fill critical job openings. But Kushner's plan faces daunting odds. There is a gulf between what business interests want and what immigration restrictionist groups are willing to accept. And Democrats are expected to denounce any effort that does not address the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. or the DREAMers \u2014 undocumented people brought into the country as children. The White House declined to respond to specific questions about the plan. The details of the plan have not been finalized and could change, or even be shelved. \"There have been no final decisions on specific policy proposals; however, the President has been clear we must have sane, rational immigration policy to keep American citizens safe that includes finishing the wall, securing our border, and a merit-based immigration system that protect American wages and jobs,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. The strategy is part of White House efforts to demonstrate that it is making progress on Trump's previous promises while uniting Republicans on a list of principles as they head into the 2020 election. \"The Kushner plan on behalf of President Trump has a lot to like,\" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for stronger immigration enforcement. \"While it has zero chance of moving through a divided Congress this year, over the coming months we'll hear why it's better than the ideas coming from House Democrats, mayors with pretensions to bigger things and an open-borders socialist,\" Stein said, alluding to Democratic candidates. Elements of the new plan The new plan would boost the number of legal immigrants by increasing visas for high-skilled workers \u2014 something Trump has argued is needed for the tech industry and manufacturers to expand in America. It would reorganize the Department of Homeland Security to streamline the leadership of its three immigration-related agencies, creating a new director position, or immigration czar, who would be in charge of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The plan would increase the number of federal departments and agencies required to use E-Verify, a database that helps check the immigration status of employees, but would not make E-Verify mandatory for all businesses to use. Keeping E-Verify voluntary is one of the reasons groups that favor immigration restrictions are questioning the plan and pushing for stronger enforcement measures. They are also concerned that Kushner's plan doesn't cut \u2013 and likely increases \u2014 the number of green cards issued each year. This year, about 1 million immigrants were given permanent resident status. \"What they do is they take Tom Cotton's RAISE Act, which created a merit system which the president liked, and they basically puff it out to cover more people, more types of applicant types and a huge increase in numbers,\" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that wants tighter immigration controls. Vaughan has been briefed on elements of the plan. The plan includes several border security measures, such as stricter visa screening, clamping down on sanctuary cities and tighter rules for asylum-seekers. The plan would eliminate many current categories for family-sponsored immigration but would allow family members of immigrants to apply for a new \"Build America Visa.\" This new visa category would be for \"extraordinarily talented individuals,\" high-skilled professionals and top graduate students from American universities. Business groups say they're encouraged by the renewed effort to focus immigration on workforce needs but raised concerns that the plan wouldn't go far enough to increase the number of workers. Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the United States needs to increase legal immigration to keep the economy booming. At a minimum, he said, Trump's plan should not reduce levels of legal immigration. \"Every incumbent president is interested in a growing economy, particularly in an election year,\" Bradley said in an interview. \"One of the headwinds that the economy is facing is a lack of available workers and no sense that there's any relief in sight.\" Second time around This is not Kushner's first attempt at trying to address this perpetually complicated issue. He led a similar effort last year to create a merit-based immigration system like ones used in Canada and Australia.

The proposal was released last spring with great fanfare but failed to gain momentum. It landed as Trump shook up DHS leadership. In the course of a few weeks, he fired Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna and pulled the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead ICE. The plan also failed to catch fire with factions in the Republican Party: the hard-liners who seek greater reductions in the number of immigrants and business groups that want more foreign workers. The current plan faces those same challenges. And some Republican senators have privately expressed discomfort with the idea of the Trump administration dictating what immigration legislation to introduce, sources said. Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the southern border with Mexico and end the Obama-era DREAMers program. But there have been some shifts in his position on legal immigration. During his State of the Union address this year, Trump alluded to Kushner's efforts to bring in more legal workers to help fuel the U.S. economy. \"To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially and uphold our values,\" Trump said. It's a shift from his \"Buy American, Hire American\" agenda from the early days of his presidency; that agenda included promises to curtail programs that brought in foreign workers who displaced or competed with U.S. citizens. Trump addressed skepticism about that shift during a recent interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, who reminded Trump that he ran for office with a message that he would not allow foreign labor to replace American workers. Trump pushed back, arguing that U.S. companies, particularly tech companies, were running out of workers. \"We have to allow smart people to stay in our country,\" Trump said. \"We don't have enough of them. And we have to be competitive with the rest of the world too.\" Those comments raised alarm bells among immigration hawks like Vaughan. While she supports many elements in Kushner's plan, she worries there is too much focus on increasing the number of workers. \"The main problem is trying to do too much in one bill,\" Vaughan said.",

The Biden administration promises to allow refugees into the U.S. at much higher numbers than the Trump administration did.\n                \n                    \n                    Muhammed Muheisen /AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yazidi refugees from Iraq are among those fleeing religious persecution. The Biden administration promises to allow refugees into the U.S. at much higher numbers than the Trump administration did. As president, Donald Trump slashed refugee admissions to the United States to a record low. Paradoxically, his administration also took major steps to highlight the persecution of religious minorities around the world, a key driver of global refugee movements. President-elect Joe Biden promises to reverse Trump's refugee policy, raising the annual ceiling for refugee admissions to 125,000. President Trump ordered last month that no more than 15,000 refugees be admitted to the United States in 2021, the lowest level in the history of the modern refugee program. Speaking to the Jesuit Refugee Service after his election, Biden said his administration \"will restore America's role in protecting the vulnerable and defending the rights of refugees everywhere.\" \"The United States has long stood as a beacon of hope for the downtrodden and oppressed, a leader in resettling refugees in our humanitarian response,\" Biden said. \"I promise as president I'll reclaim that proud legacy for our country.\" At the same time, human rights advocates are encouraging Biden to carry forward the Trump administration's promotion of international religious freedom. During Trump's term, the State Department hosted two international meetings focusing on the need to end the persecution of religious minorities. Trump also issued an executive order mandating that support for global religious freedom become a guiding principle of U.S. foreign policy and boosting funding for programs that, among other goals, \"anticipate, prevent, and respond to attacks against individuals and groups on the basis of their religion.\" Religious freedom Among those impressed by such efforts was Knox Thames, a special advisor for religious minorities under President Obama who stayed on at the State Department as part of the Trump team. \"I think, on promoting international religious freedom, it's safe to say they did more than any other administration has,\" Thames says. Thames says he and others working on religious freedom issues at the State Department were nevertheless disappointed at how the initiative proceeded. \"On other things that were closely related, they came up short of where we hoped they would be,\" Thames says, citing Trump's ban on immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries and the lowered number of refugees allowed into the U.S. \"Here we are, working to defend the right of people to believe anything, or nothing, [or] to change faith,\" Thames says. \"We're pushing governments to reform their laws. We're asking like-minded governments to elevate this issue. And then when you see thousands of people, who are being persecuted for their beliefs, needing to flee their homes, suddenly we're at the back of the line. We're no longer a leader. And people know we used to be.\" Thames left the State Department in July of this year and is now working on a book about his experiences. His own disappointment with the Trump administration's attitude toward refugees, he says, was shared by State Department colleagues. \"When we'd ask questions about why the big [refugee] drawdown, they would always [say], 'Well, the White House...' There was no conversation you could have in the State Department to debate the merits of this policy,\" Thames says, \"because it was coming directly from the White House. And that was just understood.\" The refugee admission cutbacks came at a time when the need for refugee resettlement was high. According to the UN refugee agency's 2021 Global Needs Assessment, 1.4 million refugees are currently awaiting resettlement around the world. Many have fled religious persecution. Open Doors USA, an evangelical Christian organization, estimates that as many as 260 million Christians are living in countries where they experience high levels of persecution. In his campaign speeches, Trump rarely mentioned his administration's promotion of the religious freedom cause, but he trumpeted his cutback on refugee admissions. At a rally in Minnesota this fall, Trump predicted that refugees would be \"a vital issue\" in the presidential election. \"You know it perhaps better than almost anybody,\" he said, presumably referring to the large number of refugees from Somalia who have been settled in Minnesota. \"Lots of luck,\" he said, sarcastically. \"You're having a good time with the refugees.\" A Biden presidency, Trump told the rally crowd, would bring a seven-fold increase in refugee admissions \"from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves, because if I'm not here....\" He did not finish the sentence. In his October executive order on refugee policy, Trump justified the record low refugee admissions ceiling by saying, \"The threat to United States national security and public safety posed by the admission of refugees from high-risk areas of terrorist presence or control is significant and cannot be fully mitigated at this time.\" Rebuilding resettlement infrastructure For groups that have worked to assist with refugees in the United States, Trump's steep cuts have been disheartening, in part because other countries have followed the U.S. example, leading to reduced refugee resettlement around the world. \"Just in the past few years, there has been a decline of over 40% of countries that are admitting refugees,\" says Jenny Yang, vice president for advocacy and policy at World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. \"It's because, if the United States is not taking its position as a world leader, other countries are effectively shutting their doors as well,\" Yang says. \"When the United States leads, it allows other countries to also accept a higher number of refugees, but any time the United States has declined its numbers, we've seen a corollary decline in other countries,\" she says. The sharp reduction in refugee admissions under President Trump has meant a drop in funding for refugee resettlement, so agencies devoted to that mission have seen an erosion of their capabilities. According to a report by the Center for American Progress, refugee assistance agencies have experienced a 38% decrease in their overall resettlement capacity. A revival of the refugee program under President-elect Biden would therefore present a challenge. \"Not only do we need to hire staff that have expertise in this area, we need to train them,\" says Yang. \"We need to prepare our offices, even reopen offices in certain communities where refugees are going to be going. That takes a lot of time and investment.\" President-elect Biden is promising to \"dramatically increase\" funding for refugee and asylee assistance. His administration may also want to follow through on the Trump administration's support for international religious freedom efforts as a key part of U.S. foreign policy. Those efforts have been praised by some of the same groups that have decried the cutbacks in refugee admissions under Trump. \"There's no doubt the [Trump] administration has had a historic commitment to promoting international religious freedom,\" Yang says. Among those applauding the notion of giving religion-related issues more attention in foreign policy is Chris Seiple, president emeritus of the Institute for Global Engagement and a long-time advocate for working with faith groups around the world. \"The next steps would be, 'How do you equip diplomats and development experts and our military to engage religious actors,\" Seiple says. \"We need to think about how we train all U.S. personnel with religious literacy as a function of a broader engagement strategy,\" he says. \"Religion is not something you tack on, as another box. Religion is in all the boxes.\" One indication of the Biden administration's plans in this area will be whether it would support a continuation of the international meetings on religious freedom that began under President Trump. State Department officials have hoped that other countries would continue those efforts independently of the United States. An \"International Religious Freedom Alliance\" was organized for that purpose. After two meetings that brought foreign ministers to Washington, D.C., to discuss religious freedom issues, a third ministerial meeting was held this week in Poland.",

They had waited for this moment for years, as Syrian war refugees living in Jordan. But because of President Trump's new immigration policies, their extended family was not allowed to join them, and the America they'd dreamed about seemed full of hidden dangers. Were they wrong to have come? Should they have never left Jordan in the first place? The weight of this decision lay most heavily on the shoulders of 15-year-old Naji Aldabaan, the oldest boy, who had stepped into the role of family protector while his father was in a Syrian jail cell and never stopped trying to keep the family safe from harm. Jake Halpern, a freelance journalist and young adult novelist, followed the Albadaan family story from the first day of their arrival, chronicling their experiences in a Pulitzer-prize winning comic strip for The New York Times. The complete story is available for the first time in a graphic novel, Welcome To The New World. Halpern took on the project because he was interested in telling the refugee experience from a young adult perspective. But very quickly he realized that Naji Aldabaan no longer saw himself as a kid. As a reporter, Halpern found himself chronicling not only the family's attempt to settle in the U.S., but also Naji's complicated quest to \"be a kid again\" and reclaim a childhood cut short by war.

Aung San Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy appear set for another five years in power, and analysts expect to see few changes in her second term. Myanmar's general election, held on Sunday, was the Southeast Asian nation's second since the military relinquished absolute power in 2011. It was largely seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi's first term as state counsellor, which began after her party's landslide electoral victory in 2015. Suu Kyi's party, which claimed victory before official results came in, had clinched 397 seats in Myanmar's 664-seat parliament by Thursday, according to Yway Mal, an independent vote-counting group. That's more than it won in 2015. Twenty-five percent of the parliament's seats are appointed by the military, which remains powerful. A military-backed political party has rejected the election results as unfair. The NLD was heavily favored to win, but the election was criticized for disenfranchisement of minority voters and was dogged by voting safety concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite Myanmar's nearly 66,000 cases and over 1,500 deaths, turnout was reportedly higher than expected and millions cast ballots for candidates vying for nearly 1,200 seats at the national, state and regional levels. Voters wearing protective face masks line up to cast their ballots at a polling station in Yangon, Myanmar, on Sunday. Turnout was reportedly higher than expected, given concerns over voter safety during the coronavirus pandemic.\n                \n                    \n                    Thein Zaw/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voters wearing protective face masks line up to cast their ballots at a polling station in Yangon, Myanmar, on Sunday. Turnout was reportedly higher than expected, given concerns over voter safety during the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the issues that will define Suu Kyi's second term. The economy Yangon-based historian Thant Myint-U predicts that Suu Kyi \u2014 a Nobel Peace laureate who spent years as a political prisoner and remains beloved at home despite international criticism \u2014 will continue to focus on priorities such as a stalled peace process with ethnic minority groups and relations with China. But the most important issue, he says, is Myanmar's economy. Nearly 25% of Myanmar's more than 53 million people were under the poverty line in 2018, according to the Asian Development Bank. And while the country has seen about 7% economic growth every year since opening up in 2011, projections show the coronavirus pandemic will shrink growth to 1.8% this year. \"It's not simply a matter of liberalizing that economy as it is,\" Thant Myint-U says. \"I think it needs basic structural transformation.\" The economy needs to shift from the \"incredibly corrupt and cronyist capitalist system\" that has evolved over the last 25 years, he says, to one that is \"green and sustainable\" and \"industrialized and urban.\" While resource- and capital-rich Myanmar has experienced swift economic growth since opening up in 2011, years of poor economic management and armed conflicts with the country's ethnic minorities have taken a toll. Thant Myint-U says the ongoing and sometimes violent tensions also make it unlikely that Suu Kyi will pursue any changes to the country's latest constitution, enacted in 2008, which gives autonomy to the military. The constitution \"was the instrument through which they felt comfortable in beginning to release power and move from a pure military dictatorship to what we have now, which is a hybrid political system,\" Thant Myint-U says. Moving to a full democracy is going to take longer, he says, especially because of the armed conflicts. The Rohingya crisis Another major issue that will continue to demand Suu Kyi's attention is the Rohingya crisis. The Muslim minority group, which is denied citizenship in Myanmar, drew worldwide attention in 2017, after some 750,000 fled across the border to Bangladesh following a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military. Suu Kyi has stood by the military's actions, even defending the country against genocide charges during a trial at the International Court of Justice last year in The Hague. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya continue to languish in refugee camps in Bangladesh, while most of the 600,000 or so Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are confined to camps, their movements heavily restricted. They were not allowed to vote in Sunday's election. Abdul Rasheed, a Rohingya politician and human rights activist whose application to run for election was rejected, tells NPR that any Rohingya policy change \"is completely dependent\" on Suu Kyi \"and what she wants.\" But, he warns, without resolving the crisis \u2014 by recognizing Rohingya as citizens, allowing them freedom of movement and repatriating those who fled abroad, among other things \u2014 Myanmar cannot be a true democracy. Myanmar and the U.S. The U.S. is among the countries that have pressured Suu Kyi to hold the Myanmar military accountable for its actions against the Rohingya in 2017. Since 2012, Washington has provided $1.5 billion in aid \"to support Burma's democratic transition and economic transformation.\" The U.S. has been openly critical of the country's treatment of the Rohingya \u2014 though it has stopped short of calling it genocide. In a statement on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday's elections \"mark an important step in the country's democratic transition,\" but expressed concern over disenfranchisement and the number of legislative seats reserved for the military. \"We look forward to continuing to work with Burma's new government to promote inclusive economic prosperity, achieve lasting peace throughout the country, and foster respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all,\" the statement said. While Thant Myint-U would like to see the new administration of President-elect Joe Biden place development and investment \"front and center\" in the U.S. relationship with Myanmar, other analysts believe the relationship will likely remain business as usual. \"I would imagine that, at best, we get a pragmatic engagement that balances a human rights approach with more development assistance,\" says Hunter Marston, a doctoral candidate at the Australian National University who studies U.S. foreign policy toward Southeast Asia. Yangon has grown closer to Beijing in recent years, he notes. And Suu Kyi has brushed off criticism from the West of her handling of the Rohingya crisis. \"She's essentially burned those bridges,\" Marston says. \"And I don't think there's much hope for significant repair of those relationships. It'll be a slow process that happens.\"",

Above: Members of the Honduran Armed Forces carry a box of COVID-19 diagnostic testing kits donated by the United States Agency for International Development and the International Organization for Migration. This election season \u2013 like many before it \u2013 has been dominated by domestic issues. But whether Americans elect Donald Trump or Joe Biden president will also have significant consequences for the rest of the world, especially those countries that count on U.S. foreign aid. And when it comes to aid and other global issues, Trump and Biden's policies are starkly different. While former Vice President Biden has outlined some of his plans and priorities for the future, President Trump's campaign has focused more on what he's done in his first term. Still, Trump's past words and actions should be a good indicator of how he intends to move forward if re-elected. Below is a summary of what Trump and Biden have said (or done) on these matters. Donald Trump: Trump's \"America First\" mantra extends to his foreign aid philosophy. In 2018, he told world leaders at the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly, \"Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends.\" For example, last year, he froze $450 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for what he described as their failure to stem migration. He later resumed aid, sending $143 million to the region. Under his administration, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) also underwent some reforms that have been largely praised by the development sector, like moving away from a traditional donor-recipient model of aid to more partnerships. However, former USAID Administrator Mark Green who oversaw the changes says the president was \"not really\" involved in the work. Joe Biden: \"We'd bring aid back to the center of our foreign policy,\" Antony Blinken, a foreign policy adviser for the Biden campaign, said in a May online event. Biden's campaign website makes it clear that he views development aid as a \"vital investment\" in the success of other countries but also U.S. security and prosperity. The Central American migration crisis is a key example of this: Biden intends to expand a $750 million aid program that he spearheaded as vice president into a four-year, $4 billion regional strategy to tackle the root causes of emigration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, namely poverty, violence and corruption. Donald Trump: In April, as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded, Trump threatened to freeze U.S. funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) unless it underwent \"major, substantive improvements\" and became less \"China-centric\" within 30 days. Then, in July, he formally began the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the institution, saying that China has \"total control\" over WHO and had pressured the agency to \"mislead the world\" regarding COVID-19. Because the U.S. is the top WHO donor, the withdrawal, which could take at least a year, could threaten health programs around the world, according to global health experts. Joe Biden: Biden vowed on Twitter to rejoin WHO on his first day as president if elected, reversing Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. He's also said he would restore funding to the institution. Biden and his campaign have described WHO and other global institutions as \"not perfect\" but say that the U.S. must resume its leadership role in order to influence reform. That doesn't \"necessarily\" mean the U.S. must remain the WHO's top donor, according to the Biden campaign's foreign policy adviser. Donald Trump: The Trump administration has donated ventilators and equipment to other countries to help with COVID-19, while USAID and the State Department have provided about $508 million to the U.N. and other aid organizations to help fight the pandemic in more than 100 countries. However, Trump refused to join the COVAX initiative, an international effort to develop an affordable COVID-19 vaccine, because of its affiliation with WHO. According to WHO, the COVAX effort would be especially helpful for sharing safe and effective vaccines across the world, including lower-income countries. Trump's priority is \"Operation Warp Speed\" \u2014 his administration's partnership with private companies to accelerate the development of COVID-19 drugs, vaccines and tests. Joe Biden: In a March speech, Biden said that the U.S. will \"never fully solve [COVID-19] if we're unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the rest of the world.\" His COVID-19 plan includes a global response with USAID at the helm to assist \"vulnerable nations.\" He also plans to \"re-launch and strengthen\" USAID's pathogen-tracking program, PREDICT, which the Trump administration cut three months before the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in China. Regarding vaccines, Biden hasn't specifically said whether he would join the COVAX initiative. Donald Trump: Trump rejects established peer-reviewed science showing that human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and industrial agriculture, is the main driver of climate change. Last year, he formally began the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, saying that it is too costly and \"disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\" Officially, U.S. participation ends the day after the election. He also ended U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund and has frequently rolled back fossil fuel regulations. Joe Biden: Biden has a $2 trillion climate plan and vows to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, in which countries committed to limit warming this century to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. He also promises to recommit the U.S. to the Green Climate Fund, which would help low- and middle-income countries \"better manage the adverse effects of climate change, including conflict, migration and state fragility.\" Donald Trump: Every Republican since Ronald Reagan has implemented a form of the Mexico City policy, also called the \"Global Gag Rule\" by those who oppose it. This policy prohibits U.S. aid from going to any foreign nongovernmental organizations whose family planning efforts provide any services related to abortions, even if they're just offering information. Under Trump, the policy was expanded to not only funds designated for family planning efforts but nearly all U.S. funding for global health. This means that if a staffer at an HIV/AIDs, malaria, nutrition or other health project  even refers a client to a family planning service that talks about abortion, their agency's funding could be affected. This broader application of the policy increased the amount of aid affected by the policy from roughly $600 million to $12 billion of planned assistance in 2018. In 2018, Trump's Justice Department also narrowed the definition of domestic violence to harms that constitute a felony or misdemeanor, effectively eliminating nonphysical violence such as psychological, emotional or economic abuse. Joe Biden: Biden has promised to end the Mexico City Policy. However, critics say he has an inconsistent record on abortion rights. (He once voted in favor of an amendment to allow states to overturn Roe v. Wade.) Biden has made ending gender-based violence a key focus of his platform. In 1994, he co-sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, and he plans to enact the 2019 Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act if the Senate doesn't pass the bill. Donald Trump: Under the Trump administration, the U.S. refugee admissions cap repeatedly hit a record low: from 45,000 in fiscal year 2018, to 30,000 the next year, then 18,000 and finally 15,000 in fiscal year 2021, which began this month. Despite the 18,000 cap for the fiscal year that just ended, admissions reached only 11,814 due to what the International Rescue Committee called \"massive bureaucratic impediments\" and COVID-19. \"I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent!\" Trump claimed at a rally in Minneapolis in 2019. He told another crowd in Duluth that Biden's plan will \"[open] the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism.\" Joe Biden: Biden says he will raise the U.S. refugee admissions cap to 125,000 and \"seek to raise it over time, commensurate with our responsibility and our values.\" However, some advocates have noted that it likely won't be a quick or easy task to rebuild the asylum and refugee resettlement system after years of Trump scaling it back. Biden says he will also end Trump's ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen). Donald Trump: As president, Trump has repeatedly tried to slash foreign aid spending \u2013 including a 21% proposed cut this year. However, the budget has remained largely intact throughout his presidency due to opposition from Congress. He has also repeatedly proposed drastic cuts to global HIV programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program started by George W. Bush to combat the spread of HIV around the world. Instead Trump has boosted domestic HIV funding in line with his commitment to eradicate HIV in the U.S. by 2030. Again, Congress has managed to preserve PEPFAR funding, though it also hasn't increased since 2009. However, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Deborah Birx said that the stagnant budget and Trump's threats to cut PEPFAR funds have pushed the program to find ways to make a bigger impact without additional fundings. Joe Biden: The Biden campaign's foreign policy adviser Blinken said that Biden would expand foreign aid funding even amid a costly COVID-19 recovery effort because \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" This includes funding for PEPFAR. Biden described PEPFAR in a 2018 op-ed as \"one of the most-successful, effective and world-changing initiatives ever put forth by the United States government .... It's proof that our foreign aid dollars are a smart investment that deliver real results.\" Joanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequity.

VotER is an initiative to register new voters at ERs and clinics.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah Francois/Progressive Community Heath Centers\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Madelaine Tully, left, and medical assistant Marshae Love hold up their VotER badges at Progressive Community Health Center in Milwaukee. VotER is an initiative to register new voters at ERs and clinics. This year, there aren't as many large public events with volunteers signing people up to vote in the weeks before the election, due to the pandemic. But doctors' offices are stepping in to fill the void, through programs like VotER and Vote Health 2020, nonpartisan efforts to register patients in free clinics, community centers and emergency rooms. In Wisconsin, when patients come in to talk weight loss, high blood pressure or other issues, medical assistant Marshae Love, who works at Progressive Community Health Centers in Milwaukee, has also started chatting with them about getting registered, often spurred on by the badge that dangles from her neck with information from VotER. \"So, when I go in the rooms, just having conversation once I'm checking in the patients, they'll ask like, 'Hey, what's that around your neck?' So I'll let them know it's just a way for them to register to vote,\" Love says. Patients can scan a QR code from the badge with their cellphone, and it takes them to a website about registering to vote and even a live person and helpline if the patient gets stuck. \"Because people are on their phones all the time anyway, it's just something quick they can do and it's one more thing they can knock off their to-do list,\" Love says. Progressive also sends out monthly text messages asking about 9,500 patients to register. More than 80% of Progressive's patients are Black, with a growing population of Hmong and Burmese refugees. About 90% of clinic's patients are also low-income. Dr. Madelaine Tully of Progressive says it's a population that's been hit hard by the pandemic. \"With people having to move in with family members, people having real issues with their financial security, their food security and all that,\" Tully says. \"So, you can imagine that registering to vote is not high on that list when you have issues of basic shelter, safety and food.\" There's a disparity in the registration rates of Black and Latino voters as compared to white voters, in Wisconsin and across the country. To bridge that gap, Dr. Alister Martin, an ER physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, founded VotER, which is being used by more than 300 hospitals nationwide. Martin's experience getting health care as a kid was similar to those in low-income communities across the country. His mom worked two jobs and couldn't always make it to a pediatrician. Sometimes they had good health insurance, sometimes they didn't. \"What I came to learn from my own experience, which I brought, to me as an emergency room doctor, was this idea that emergency rooms play a very important role in the lives of folks who are coming from low income communities,\" he says. \"Yes, they address emergency. Yes, they address acute medical issues. But they also address issues that are more to do with the social determinants of health, things like homelessness, access to food, access to good insurance to be able to pay for the medications that you need.\" He also saw an overlap between the millions in the United States who are using emergency rooms for health care and those who are not registered to vote. So he started thinking about ways to offer voter registration in a way that's nonpartisan and would encourage voter participation among vulnerable groups. It was also a plus if it could be easy and done while patients wait, he says. \"Registering to vote in this country is like running an obstacle course,\" Martin says. \"The rules to register vary widely by state and in some places require tracking down disparate pieces of information in order to begin the process.\" Martin says health care professionals are in a good place to start the conversation, because the pandemic has made voting a public health issue. \"Who better than health care workers to be able to advise folks on, 'Look, you know, this is, this is not the sort of the usual way that this works. And you ought to think about taking extra precautions and voting in a safe way this time around.' \" It's a nonpartisan program and health care workers help patients figure out how to vote, but not who to vote for. Another program, called Patient Voting, helps patients who are unexpectedly hospitalized during the days and weeks before the presidential election cast a ballot. So far, about 40,000 patients have gotten help registering or requesting ballots through VotER. Vote Health 2020 also says it's helped thousands nationwide. John Curiel of MIT's Election Data and Science Lab says the programs are a good idea and will almost certainly pay off with more political participation. \"If you look at past American historical trends, participation, politics and registration to vote, usually it was done not by going door to door, but rather by going to a central location where everyone was,\" says Curiel. \"So, in that sense, the hospital idea, that will be one way to get everybody in one place.\" While hospitals around the country are part of VotER, Curiel notes these efforts have already been successful in swing states like North Carolina and Florida. Curiel says North Carolina counties with participating hospitals at Duke University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are shaping up to be some of the highest participation areas in the state. With the 2016 election having come down to about 100,000 votes in swing states, Curiel says any registration or turnout efforts could be the deciding factor in this year's election.",

            "article_content": "With the election fast approaching, the country is at an inflection point. \"And the question is where do we turn,\" says civil rights attorney and professor John A. Powell. \"Do we turn on each other or do we turn towards each other?\" Bitter political divisions were already plainly on display even before the added stresses of 2020 \u2013 the pandemic, nationwide protests against racial injustice, the contentious election campaign and rising threats of political violence. Could it help if more people took the time to talk with someone on the other side? This special program, One Small Step: Courageous Conversations Across A Growing Divide, explores the idea that intentional conversations between partisans could be a catalyst for national healing. StoryCorps and NPR Member stations, such as WBHM in Birmingham, have been putting that idea to the test in a project called One Small Step, pairing people of opposite political views to have a conversation. Participants talk, listen, and get to know each other for 40 minutes, not to change each other's minds, but to respect each other as people. \"We're sliding in the wrong direction in this country,\" says StoryCorps founder Dave Isay. \"We're going to try to convince the country that it's our patriotic duty to see the humanity in people that we disagree with.\" The effort is based in a theory of psychology known as the contact hypothesis, which suggests that contact between people of different backgrounds, under certain conditions, can melt away conflict.

They were joined by political thinkers such as LaTosha Brown of the Black Voters Matter Fund and conservative talk show host Erick Erickson, to explore the idea of a less divided America.

Hu also talked with Joseph Weidnecht and Amina Amdeen, who met when they took opposite sides in a political protest in 2016. Weidnecht and Amdeen told of a \"life-changing\" moment when that protest in Austin, Texas, was threatening to turn violent. Amdeen, who wears a hijab, retrieved Weidnecht's Make America Great Again hat, which had been snatched from his head by Amdeen's fellow anti-Trump protestors. A fight was avoided and the two formed an unusual bond. Both became proponents of conversation to bridge differences.

To be sure, talking is not a panacea. Americans' disagreements are quantifiably intense and getting more so. On issues from race and gender, to policing, to the coronavirus pandemic, partisans often have trouble finding agreement on basic facts as a starting point for dialogue. And while both Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly reject violence as a tactic, a small but growing number (one in five, according to one survey) now say it's justified, especially if the opposing party wins the election. It is this \"culture of contempt,\" along with the threat of political violence, that convinces Isay, Powell and others that there is no alternative to dialogue. Says Powell: \"If we don't learn to share the planet with each other... we don't survive.\" This audio program weaves new studio interviews together with stage conversations and music by Jimmy Hall with Southern Culture Revival, recorded live at the Alys Stephens Center in Birmingham.

It's been a long road for the family, from Homs, Syria, where a civil war drove them to find safety in a Jordanian refugee camp in 2011. The long-awaited approval to resettle to the U.S. came in 2016 but posed another agonizing decision: Only Ibrahim, his wife and five children could travel. Approval for the extended family still pending. Naji says the choice as to whether to stay or go was wrenching. They were following the U.S. presidential election, where candidate Donald Trump vowed to suspend refugee resettlement, especially for Muslims. \"My dad's mother, she told my dad if we go to the United States and Trump wins, 'I might not see you again,'\" Naji recounts. Ibrahim was so conflicted he considered a longer stay in Jordan to wait for approvals for his mother and brothers.

But Naji insisted that any delay was risky. He argued that a better future was only possible in America. His father was prohibited from any work in Jordan, where they had been living. Naji had been out of school for five years. \"This was a big part of why Naji was pushing so hard for the family to come to America,\" Halpern says. \"Relentlessly pushing his dad.\" Naji ended up being the driving force in the family's move to Connecticut.

Looking through the pages of Halpern's book, recounting their experience in intimate detail, the family is reminded of surprising terrors along the way. Bears, for example. Ibrahim spotted them in suburban Connecticut while delivering packages for Amazon. Another initial fear? Basements. The family had learned from American films that basements, unknown in Syrian homes, are scary. \"I see the movie in my country,\" Adeebah laughs.

The book also recounts real hazards, like a middle-of-the night apartment fire that forced them to find shelter in a hotel. \"It was night in winter, there was a snow storm coming,\" Halpern says. They had to move again after a frightening death threat on Ibrahim's cell phone. But the family has taken the setbacks in stride and built at new life through hard work and resilience, Ibrahim says. And, he says, they made the right decision to move ahead with the resettlement in America. \"I have my children, I have my family, I am like any American. Yes, I'm lucky,\" Ibrahim says. Halpern has observed that Ibrahim makes his own luck: \"I've just seen this man worry and push for his family for four years and yeah, I admire him for that.\" Rahaf is 10.

The Aldabaans cannot forget all they have lost, but Halpern's book also documents what they have gained. \"Now, we all realize that it's a good thing for us, especially now that we are helping our family back home. So, at the end, it helped both of us,\" Naji says. \"If we were there, we wouldn't be able to help them. We always make sure we take from us and give to them.\" Naji still hopes that the extended family will eventually be approved for resettlement in the U.S. \"Every day, we hope something new is changing. This election will be better,\" he says. \"We are expecting them to be here.\"",

Ron DeSantis picked her for the state Supreme Court. Federal appeals court Judge Barbara Lagoa is high on President Trump's list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court seat left open by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Although she has been a federal judge for less than a year, Lagoa has a background and judicial philosophy with attractive qualities for the president and conservatives. She's Cuban American and speaks fluent Spanish; she's a conservative Catholic, thus appealing to an important religious constituency; and perhaps most important of all, she is from Florida, a pivotal state in the upcoming presidential election. \"She's excellent,\" Trump said Monday on Fox News. \"She's Hispanic. She's a terrific woman from everything I know ... [but] I don't know her. Florida \u2014 we love Florida.\" Daughter of refugees The 52-year-old Lagoa is the daughter of parents who fled Fidel Castro's communist regime in 1966 after the revolution. She got her law degree from Columbia University in 1992, and she practiced law in Miami for 10 years before, representing, pro bono, the Miami relative of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in 2000. Gonz\u00e1lez was the 5-year-old boy found floating in the ocean after his mother and others drowned while trying to flee to the United States. Eli\u00e1n's father then sought to return the child to his custody in Cuba. The political flap over Gonz\u00e1lez's case highlighted tensions over federal power in the United States and the political influence of the Cuban American community in South Florida. Republicans sought, and continue to seek, support there by promising a tough policy against Havana. Appointment to Florida Supreme Court In 2006, then-Gov. Jeb Bush appointed Lagoa to Florida's 3rd District Court of Appeal in Miami, where she served for 13 years, rising briefly to chief judge. In 2019, newly elected Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed her to the Florida Supreme Court, making Lagoa the first Latina on that bench. She served for less than a year before President Trump nominated her to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta later that year same year. During her 11 months on the 11th Circuit, she has written seven opinions, the fewest of all of her colleagues during that same period. Recusal controversy Lagoa pledged in her U.S. Senate confirmation hearing that she would recuse herself from any case in which she had participated as a judge. At the time she was not viewed as a particularly controversial nominee, and she was confirmed by an 80-15 vote. Once on the federal court, however, Lagoa did not recuse herself from a case that she had heard while on the Florida Supreme Court. Though she was gone from the state court by the time the advisory opinion in the case was issued, judicial ethics rules require a judge to recuse herself if she has previously participated in any \"proceeding\" at \"any stage of litigation.\" The case was a consequential one. It involved a Florida referendum, passed by a large majority of Florida voters in 2018, that amended the state constitution and restored the right to vote to more than 1 million ex-felons in the state. The federal courts upheld the measure three times against a law passed by the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature that sought to neuter the constitutional amendment. But the 11th Circuit, with Lagoa participating, intervened earlier this year to prevent the ex-felons from voting. That prompted Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to write a letter asking for an explanation for her apparent contradiction of the pledge she made at her confirmation hearing. \"We ask you to explain how your involvement in the decision ... and your continued participation in the case \u2014 is consistent with the commitments you made to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the code of conduct,\" the 10 Democrats on the committee wrote. Here's how the Tampa Bay Times described her position: \"Lagoa and her supporters counter that the cases were technically different \u2014 even though the issue was basically the same. While she had heard arguments and commented on the case as a Florida justice, she did not vote on it because she was appointed to the federal bench before the state court ruled.\" Record supporting Republicans In addition to the controversy over felon rights, Lagoa, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel: Lagoa has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1998, and if nominated and confirmed, she would be another conservative Supreme Court justice who subscribes to \"originalism.\" She described the depths of her beliefs in that doctrine in her Senate confirmation hearing. \"If we are not bound by what the Constitution means, and it is ever changing, then we are no different than the country that my parents fled from, which is Cuba,\" Lagoa said during her 2019 confirmation hearing. \"Cuba has a constitution and a bill of rights, and it means nothing,\" she said, \"because there is no one to hold it and to say, 'This is what the definition of this constitution means' if it is always ever-changing. ... The principles that were articulated in the [U.S.] Constitution at the time of ratification have a meaning \u2014 that meaning is constant.\" Lagoa also said she is not a fan of the philosophy put forward by former President Barack Obama that empathy was important in a judge. \"A judge's decision must be governed by the law and the facts and cannot be affected by sympathy for one party or another,\" she wrote in response to questions from Senate Democrats in 2019 for her confirmation to the federal bench. \"That obligation is embodied in the judge's oath to 'administer justice without respect to persons.' ... Empathy does not supersede a judge's obligation to follow the law.\"",

Here he prays at Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha, Wis., on Sept. 3.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption If elected, Democratic nominee Joe Biden would become only the second Catholic president in American history. Here he prays at Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha, Wis., on Sept. 3. When Joe Biden seeks to inspire or comfort, he turns to his faith. He speeches are woven with references to God, biblical language or the pope. On Monday, the Democratic presidential nominee spoke to the faith-based anti-poverty group the Poor People's Campaign, and described the United States under President Trump as a \"nation in the wilderness.\" \"All of you remind me of how Scripture describes a calling born out of the wilderness,\" Biden told the virtual audience. \"A calling to serve, not to be served. A calling toward justice, healing, hope \u2014 not hate. To speak the good news, and followed by some good deeds. It's not just enough to speak the good news, but good deeds.\" This wasn't a one-off religious reference; this is how Biden routinely speaks. The former vice president launched his candidacy by referring to his campaign as a \"battle for the soul of the nation.\" It was the central theme of his primary run, and remains a core tenet of his campaign. If elected, Biden would become only the second Catholic president in American history. It's not a detail he highlights, but people who know him well say his Catholic faith is central to how he sees the world. Biden, who carries a rosary in his pocket and attends Mass every Sunday, is known as a deeply devout person of faith, and his campaign sees electoral implications in that \u2014 in part because Biden has tried to frame this election as a clear moral contrast between Trump and himself. Some Democrats would go so far as to say that Biden is running perhaps the most overtly devout Democratic presidential campaign since Jimmy Carter in 1976. John McCarthy, Biden's deputy political director, worked on faith outreach for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and acknowledges Biden's campaign is different than others. \"Campaigns obviously stem from who a candidate is, and because this is such a true part of Joe Biden, this is something that is just in the core messaging of our campaign,\" McCarthy said. Part of that distinction is about values and policy, but the other part is cultural. \"Part of him being who he is, he has these kind of touchstones that so deeply resonate with the kind of cultural Catholicism in those kind of places like the Ohio and Pennsylvania of the world,\" McCarthy said. During Holy Week this past spring, the campaign released a video in which Biden spoke about faith seeing best in the dark, juxtaposed with images of the coronavirus pandemic. And when he delivered a eulogy for George Floyd and called for racial justice, he spoke of growing up with a Catholic social doctrine that taught him \"faith without works is dead.\" \"It's not like we are just talking about faith to faith voters, but instead the vice president is being who he authentically is \u2014 which is a person of faith \u2014 and that is obviously coming across,\" McCarthy said. Allies say Biden's faith informs his values and, in turn, his values shape his politics. \"Joe is someone for whom the ways in which he sees issues around racial justice, around the treatment of refugees and immigrants \u2014 all of that is connected to a view of other people \u2014 who he sees as neighbor, who he sees as being made in the image of God,\" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who's known Biden for decades. And so Biden's stances on a range of social and environmental issues, Coons added, are not \"casual political positions;\" they're informed by his upbringing and go back, he said, to \"a deeply rooted sense of fairness that he learned from his parents and from the nuns and priests who educated and helped raise him.\" Sister Carol Keehan, who's often credited as a key player in the passage of the Affordable Care Act when she was president of the Catholic Health Association, agreed. \"He's very clear about justice,\" she said. \"When Joe Biden talks about faith, he talks very much about things like the Gospel of Matthew \u2014 'what you've done to the least of my brother, you've done to me.' \" Friends and staffers say Biden focuses on faith, rather than religious doctrine; he prays with voters, rather than proselytizes. And yet for some religious conservatives, all of that pales in comparison to the single issue of abortion. Earlier this week, the conservative group Catholic Vote released an ad referring to \"Joe Biden's radical stance on abortion.\" \"Joe Biden would force American Catholics to pay for abortions, sacrificing his Catholic values to kneel before the leftist mob,\" the narrator warns. Over his years in public life, Biden has become more consistently liberal on the issue of abortion. Last year, he reversed his decades-old position on the so-called Hyde Amendment, which bans federal dollars from funding abortion in most cases. Polling from the Pew Research Center finds that a majority of American Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. For his part, Trump has tried to portray Biden as a heathen. Last month the president attacked the Democratic nominee for being a man \"against God.\" And more broadly, Trump and his supporters have made religion a cultural issue, painting Democrats as the party against religious freedom. The struggle for Trump in trying to define Biden as a godless man is that Biden is the rather rare Democratic politician whose faith has been in public view for decades. And Sen. Coons thinks that's an asset. \"I think one of the mistakes Democrats have made over decades is to be very private about the values that move them into public life,\" he said. \"If we \u2014 as many Democrats in elected office have for 20 years \u2014 hide that or don't speak about it, millions of Americans are left wondering what drives you.\" With Biden, staff and allies say, it's obvious what drives him. Josh Dickson, national faith engagement director for the Biden campaign, says the former vice president \"wears his values and his faith on his sleeve.\" And because faith is such a core part of Biden's identity, some staff say it's become a core part of the campaign. But it's also a tightrope for religious Democrats to walk. Fewer voters identify as Christian, as the share of people who identify with no religion has jumped in recent years, according to polling from the Pew Research Center. In 2019, almost 40% of Democratic-leaning voters were religiously unaffiliated.",

Things didn't turn out as she expected.\n                \n                    \n                    Gretchen Sisson\n                    \n                \nhide caption For election night 2016, Gretchen Sisson had a sheet cake made for her friends, expecting to celebrate the election of the first woman president of the United States. Things didn't turn out as she expected. On election night 2016, Gretchen Sisson was so sure Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump that she and her husband invited 80 people to their San Francisco home for a party. They even had a giant sheet cake made that celebrated suffragists and the Equal Rights Amendment. On the side was written, \"Madam President.\" That's not how it turned out. Trump won in a stunning outcome, and no one could bear to eat. Afterward, Sisson and her family ended up eating the cake themselves for weeks. It was, she says now, a lesson in hubris. But as time passed, a despondent Sisson decided to channel her unhappiness into political donating, a world where women like her are increasingly making their voices heard. Loading... This election cycle, the share of women giving money to political campaigns has already risen to 43.5% after never topping 28% in the 1990s \u2014 \"a pretty significant jump,\" says Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics. (The group looked only at donations larger than $200.) That surge provides women with greater political clout, and it could make a big difference in some of this year's closest political races. While donations to both parties have risen, women tend to favor Democrats. President Trump has received 37% of his donations from women so far during this election cycle, while almost 48% of the contributors to former Vice President Joe Biden have been female, Krumholz says. After Trump's 2016 win, Sisson and her husband, who owns a tech startup, donated to groups that support people they thought might be vulnerable under the new administration, such as refugee organizations and press freedom groups. But as the 2018 midterms approached, she hooked up with the Women Donors Network and other Bay Area groups and began looking for candidates to give to directly. \"I'm an academic by training and I am really moved by a good data-driven case, and so I really started to immerse myself in figuring out where the best places to put our money would be,\" she says. Early on, someone gave her a valuable piece of advice: Anyone can feel good by donating to political candidates who stand a good chance of winning already. What's harder is finding those who might be able to eke out a victory with a little financial help. \"For me, it became important to find the candidates that had a solid shot, if not a favorable shot, where money could actually move the needle,\" she says. It was Moneyball meets Emily's List: Sisson learned all she could about the political leanings of various congressional districts and delved into the minutiae of Senate and governors' races. Politics became a kind of third job, says Sisson, an academic researcher with three children. Efforts by her and thousands of other people bore fruit in 2018, when a record number of women were elected to Congress, helping Democrats take control of the House. During this election cycle, Sisson has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to candidates, most but not all of them women, and in the process has become one of the country's top female Democratic donors. She gets dozens of calls seeking money every day. Democrats' success in electing women to Congress hasn't gone unnoticed by Republicans. The 2018 election may have been a huge success for Democratic women, but it was something of a debacle for their GOP counterparts, who lost almost every election they were running in. In the election's aftermath, some Republicans have taken a hard look at the party's problems with women and decided to redouble their efforts to attract female candidates. It hasn't always been easy, concedes Ashley Davis, a Republican fundraiser who sits on the board of Winning for Women, a political action committee headed by former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte. \"I always joke that men feel that they were born to run for office and never have to be convinced. They have to be convinced not to run for office,\" Davis says. Women \"need a little more persuasion about it.\" Winning for Women has also sought to teach female candidates the necessary skill of asking donors for money, something women aren't always naturally good at, Davis says. With time, the group has also had some success reaching out to female donors, and in doing that, it has learned a thing or two from the other party, she says. \"I think the confidence that the Republican candidates received by watching the Democrats do it last cycle has been helpful.\" One big factor driving the surge in giving by women this year may be the coronavirus. Because so much of the burden of dealing with the pandemic has fallen on women, it has spurred them to become more engaged politically, says longtime Democratic fundraiser Sally Susman. \"They're anxious. They're concerned for their families. They're worried for their livelihoods. They're worried for the future of our world,\" she says. Another factor is the unprecedented number of female Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris, now the vice presidential nominee. \"I think women are stimulated by a range of issues that are not necessarily gender specific,\" Susman says. But, she adds, \"they get often excited by a very compelling and charismatic female candidate.\"",

The 2020 Republican National Convention this week began and ended with two performances by the man who designed it all, President Donald J. Trump. Most of the attention went, of course, to the final night's event, when a live audience saw him \"profoundly accept\" his renomination in an hourlong speech delivered on the South Lawn of the White House. Backed by a forest of American flags, the president looked out upon members of his family and staff, members of his Cabinet and members of his party in Congress. They sat side by side in close rows of chairs. Few wore masks. There was little sign of the pandemic that had cost the president the big show he had originally planned for Charlotte, N.C., or in his backup venue in Jacksonville, Fla. Unlike most of the speakers during the week, Trump did not ignore the disease that has killed 180,000 Americans or speak of it in the past tense. But he cast it as less than central to the moment, a kind of speed bump for his parade of triumphs: \"We are meeting this challenge,\" he said proudly, \"delivering lifesaving therapies and we will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner.\" Few experts have seen a realistic possibility of a vaccine that would be regarded as safe by year's end, let alone sooner. In recent weeks, the White House has barred TV appearances by such figures as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's longtime leading immunologist, who has contradicted the president without criticizing him. Trump displayed a portrait of three presidencies \u2013 his own, his predecessor's and the one he said Democratic nominee Joe Biden would create if elected. Most of the attention focused on Trump's own four years, which he sketched as a montage of success upon success. He spoke of having conquered the vexing issues of taxes and trade, European allies and Middle East rivals, refugees and immigrants and most notably \u2013 the pandemic itself. Uplifting or unloading? The White House had promised a speech that would be \"uplifting,\" unbowed by the virus, the consequent recession or the widespread racial unrest following multiple killings of Black people by police. The speech was defiant, to be sure, but the inspirational elements were less salient than Trump's relentless attack on his Democratic foe. \"Joe Biden is not a savior of America's soul,\" the president said. \"He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America's greatness.\" Overall, the speech sounded a great deal like an earlier acceptance speech by an angry outsider running for president four years ago at the Republican convention in Cleveland. That night, candidate Trump railed against the work of Democrats and Washington insiders, whom he would displace. \"Only I can fix it,\" he said then. And four years later, the message was much the same, although he had been working for most of that time inside the building that served as the backdrop for his speech on Thursday. (Throughout the week, government watchdogs and other critics of the administration noted the wanton disregard being shown for previous norms and regulations regarding the use of government officials or taxpayer property to promote a campaign for office. The Hatch Act, an 81-year-old law, prohibits such uses but has not been used to send anyone to jail. When asked about this during the week, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said: \"No one outside of the Beltway really cares.\") Trump's case for himself may have been even sharper on Monday, when he made an unscheduled appearance in Charlotte. Here, instead of the 50,000 attendees originally anticipated, a remnant of 336 delegates had done the official business of renominating the incumbent. The unopposed incumbent had won every state, and in fact every vote from every state. Many states had canceled their primaries or caucuses on the Republican side. As he followed Vice President Pence onstage in Charlotte, Trump was greeted with chants of \"four more years.\" He replied: \"If you want to really drive them crazy you say: 'Twelve more years.' \" The president did not explain how a four-term presidency might happen, given the constitutional limit of two terms set by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution halfway through the 20th century. But the president did offer an hour's worth of free-form, wide-ranging ruminations on everything from the state of the national economy to trade deals with China and South Korea and the kinds of people most likely to die from COVID-19. (\"It affects older people, the elderly, people with problems, with heart, diabetes, other problems.\") By Friday, two attendees at the Charlotte event and two support staff had tested positive for the virus. But in that hour in Charlotte, the president was loose and very much among friends. His language veered beyond informal to crude at times, but no one in the hall seemed to mind. The shouts of \"we love you\" and \"thank you, Mr. President\" were recurrent, persistent and well-amplified to be clearly audible on TV. Monday's midday walk-on was not widely seen, but clips were great fodder for cable TV. And the prime-time TV audience began tuning in that same night, when Trump was not featured but did make a cameo appearance. The same happened on the second and third nights, posing the president for pictures with Melania, his wife, or Pence, his vice president, just as the TV anchors were signing off. A creature unto itself This Republican gathering was sui generis, a creature unto itself, unlike any preceding convention any major party held since such gatherings began in the 1830s. The Democrats the week before had met almost entirely online, but the Republicans managed to perform before live audiences that were small but vocal and highly enthusiastic. The overnight reviews split along partisan lines as sharply, and predictably, as the votes on impeachment in Congress last winter. It is hard to remember now that President Trump is the only president ever to face the voters after being impeached (or forced from office under threat of impeachment). But if that was any inhibition for him, it did not show. It was not in his prepared remarks, but he again asserted in his concluding speech that \"Obama and Biden spied on me and got caught\" \u2013 an allusion to his explanation for the investigation of his ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Multiple investigations have yet to find evidence to prove this accusation. Trump did not mention his actual impeachment, but several other speakers from his retinue did during the week. It was noted that the Democrats, who impeached Trump in the House and pressed for his removal from office in the Senate, did not mention impeachment in their prime-time speeches the previous week. But sadly for the president, impeachment was only the first dire challenge to face in his reelection year. And it has proven more difficult to elide the facts and consequences of the others. Despite the president's assertions, the crisis over the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, with more than 180,000 dead and still nearly a thousand dying each day. The U.S. also adds thousands of new infections each day (leading the world with 5.9 million as of Saturday), while the administration responds by trying to limit the number of people getting tested and promoting various therapies that have not been shown to be helpful. The president has repeatedly blamed the testing for the high numbers of new cases. He and others in his orbit have suggested only people showing symptoms of the disease should be tested at all. Still, flashing the bravado that characterized his business career, Trump has insisted his handling of the virus has been not only defensible but exemplary. Recession the larger threat? What has seemed to concern the president more is the dislocation the pandemic has caused in the economy, which crashed in March. The gross domestic product for the second quarter fell by nearly a third (on an annualized basis), and unemployment soared to nearly 15%. Both measures were the worst since the Great Depression. Aggrieved by the shutdown of schools and workplaces, Trump began saying, \"The cure cannot be worse than the disease.\" Today, Trump can point to some bright spots. The stock market has rebounded to regain its previous highs. Partial reopening of many businesses has allowed many laid-off workers to return to work. But the positive jobs trend at mid-summer has since reversed itself, and a million or more people are again filing for unemployment compensation each week. At the scaled-down RNC this week, all talk of the economy was spun to highlight the happier times of last winter and look forward to a snapback next winter. As he usually does, Trump took credit for the \"strongest economy in history\" and a record number of people with jobs. But both claims, while often repeated, are shaky. As was noted the previous week by the Democrats, there were more jobs created in the U.S. in the last three years under Obama than in the first three under Trump. More than a million more. But whatever the validity of of Trump's claims about the past, current reality for millions of the unemployed is dire. With the virus still far from controlled, the economic climb could get steeper as well. Given all the strange and strained circumstances, no one can be surprised that this convention seemed so different from all its historic analogs. But the starkest contrast was with those past conventions staged by incumbent presidents seeing a second term \u2014 especially those in the era of TV coverage. Looking just at GOP conventions renominating incumbents, the record is impressive. Four of the five incumbents in this era went on to win a second term (George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower). The latter three won reelection in landslides: Ike carried 41 of 48 states, Nixon and Reagan each carried 49 of 50. Those campaigns featured supremely confident conventions with little or no controversy touching the candidate (other than health concerns following Eisenhower's 1955 heart attack). George W. Bush was renominated in 2004 in New York City to celebrate that city's comeback from the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001. The stars of that show were the city's former mayor Rudy Giuliani (also on the program Thursday night, although with far less starpower impact) and the movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, then a newly elected governor of California, who has since disappeared from Republican politics. The one renominating GOP convention in these five that presaged a losing November was the 1992 event on behalf of President George H.W. Bush in his hometown of Houston. And a review of that episode turns up some similarities in rhetoric to what we heard this week. Rich Bond, the party's national chairman, told the convention hall \"We are America, they [the Democrats] are not America.\" This week, Pence told the crowd at Fort McHenry that \"America is on the ballot.\" It has often been said that the elder Bush's show fell flat for two reasons. First, it failed to address the big negative story hanging over the country \u2013 lagging recovery from a recession that had lingered in some swing states. But the other problem for the incumbent nominee was one Trump did not have: speakers whose performance overshadowed the nominee's own. One was Reagan, then just four years out of office and still immensely popular. In the last major address of his career, Reagan reminded the audience he had chosen Bush as his vice president; but many in the audience were reminded how much they preferred Reagan. A speech sets campaign tone A larger problem was the indelible opening night speech by Patrick Buchanan, a former journalist and speechwriter both for Reagan and the previous Republican president Richard Nixon. Buchanan had run against Bush, his party's incumbent president, in the GOP primaries that year. While he had just 18 delegates, the Bush team wanted his help with the party's more populist, nationalist wing. (Buchanan would later run for president as a third-party candidate on the campaign slogan \"America First.\") Buchanan's outsider campaign had been about reducing immigration and resisting social changes such as abortion rights, gay rights, women in combat units and multicultural education. In Houston, he said these were \"not the kind of change America wants and not the kind of change we can abide in a nation we still call God's country.\" He spoke of \"a cultural war\" in America and said that summer's Democratic Convention had featured \"20,000 radicals and liberals dressed up as moderates and centrists.\" Buchanan closed by paying tribute to National Guard troops sent to Los Angeles that summer to quell street riots after a jury acquitted police officers videotaped beating Rodney King, a black man. Buchanan said the soldiers, with bayonets fixed, were \"taking back America, block by block.\" The speech lit up the Astrodome, unleashing a roar from the crowd that seemed to reverberate throughout the week and beyond. It would be widely criticized as incendiary and contradictory of Bush's \"kinder, gentler\" conservatism. But it overshadowed the incumbent president's own speech at week's end, which lacked the force of his first acceptance speech four years earlier. All conventions have their memorable moments, positive or otherwise, and their connection to either victory or defeat will always be subject to debate. This year's versions, one online and one largely a hybrid, were both scaled way back from historic expectations. Their actual effect on the campaign's outcome may be similarly reduced, perhaps even marginal. In 2024, we may be eager to hold traditional conventions again, or we may have come to regard them as an anachronism. Much may depend on who is in the White House at that time and on how much of a contribution that person believes the 2020 convention made to the November outcome.",

How? We might not have moved the needle on the nomination, but I think we certainly have moved the needle on the national conversation on the particular policies we've advocated for. \"Medicare for All\" is much more popular than it was before this election cycle, and we're having an honest discussion about canceling student debt. We're talking about economic and social injustices in ways that we haven't before. Taxing the wealthy is not just something that you say and people go, \"Oh, my God.\" It's something that people are now actually debating and thinking about ways to be able to do that. And to see so many people now running for office with the policy positions that we ran on and continue to advocate for really is a testament on how much we've changed the narrative of what is electable and what is debatable in Congress. On why Biden should choose a person of color as his running mate I think it would be really helpful for our party to continue to have diversity as not something we talk about, but something we celebrate and push forward. ... To have somebody who is really connected to the people who have been the backbone of the Democratic Party will help create, I think, the enthusiasm that Biden lacks right now with the majority of the base. On what she wants to see in the next coronavirus relief package There are musts, right? We want to make sure that there is direct cash payment. We want to make sure that there is hazard pay for essential workers. We want the OSHA protections to remain as part of the final bill. We want increase in SNAP funding. We want to make sure that we're not just expanding COBRA, but getting emergency Medicare for All. We want rent and mortgage cancellation. We have to act comprehensively to stop the kind of economic crisis that is staring us in the face. On why the conservative former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is a political role model It's interesting, right? Oftentimes, we're told who our heroes can be. And for me, I find it to be inspirational for a woman, when there were really no other women around who were leading, to say, \"I can do this.\" And I think as I think about my own journey, dealing with the ideas that many within my own community had about, \"a boy should be the first.\" I needed to have sort of an inspiration, and obviously, she's left a very dark mark in history. But we can't take away how inspirationally bold she was to believe that she can lead as a woman in her time. NPR's Hiba Ahmad and Ed McNulty produced and edited the audio version of this interview.",

            "article_content": "Indian Americans generally vote with Democrats and identify with other immigrant groups, but the stirrings of Hindu nationalism may be shifting that alignment.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump leaves this weekend for India, where he's set to get a warm welcome from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The visit is likely to be followed closely by Indian Americans, especially those who consider themselves Hindu. Many American Hindus are big supporters of Prime Minister Modi, in part, because of his embrace of Hindu nationalism. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Indian Americans, about half of whom are Hindus, are the second-largest immigrant group in the U.S. after Mexicans. In 2016, fewer than 20% of Indian Americans supported Donald Trump, but Republicans think they can get a bigger share this year. One reason - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a big Trump fan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: A great American president, Mr. Donald Trump. GJELTEN: Modi and Trump bonded at a big Indian American rally last fall in Houston. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can tell you you have never had a better friend as president than President Donald Trump. That I can tell you. GJELTEN: With Trump now set to visit Modi in India, that friendship will get even more attention. Trump has made no criticism of Modi's drive to give Hindus a favored place in India, for example, by promoting a citizenship law that treats Hindu and Muslim refugees differently. Democrats and some progressive Indian Americans have criticized Modi over that campaign, but more conservative American Hindus endorse it. RAKHI ISRANI: I mean, these are highly emotional topics for Hindu Americans. GJELTEN: Rakhi Israni (ph) runs an education tutoring firm in California and serves on the board of the Hindu American Political Action Committee. ISRANI: And the stance that a lot of the liberal left within the Democratic Party is taking, I think they may just serve to push more Hindu Americans away from the party. GJELTEN: Among those who think there is a Hindu American drift toward Republicans is A.D. Amar, a management professor at Seton Hall University. He leads the Indian Americans for Trump movement, but his focus is on Trump's economic policies, ones he says can resonate with Indian Americans. A D AMAR: Most Indians, as you know, are highly educated. They are also relatively quite well-off, and they want low taxes, and they want people to be responsible for their own lives. GJELTEN: In his speech in Houston, President Trump took care to distinguish between successful Indian immigrants and those coming into the country illegally. But Karthick Ramakrishnan, who directs the Asian American Voters Survey at the University of California, says many Indian Americans still identify with other minority groups, especially at a time of rising white nationalism. KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Not only are they immigrants, but also, they are brown-skinned, often in minority religions and discriminated in society in various ways. So, yes, people could try to drive a wedge between Indian Americans and other immigrant communities, but the reality of racial discrimination in the United States makes it more difficult. GJELTEN: Ramakrishnan thinks Indian American voters, including American Hindus, focus mostly on such traditional policy issues as access to health care, ones that incline them more toward the Democrats. RAMAKRISHNAN: My hunch is that there's probably some movement towards President Trump but still overwhelming support for the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates as opposed to President Trump. GJELTEN: A final point - by census estimates, there may be 400,000 more Indian Americans in the U.S. now than there were four years ago. Tom Gjelten, NPR News.

More than anything, this election is about President Trump. For most incumbent presidents running for reelection, approval ratings really matter. With Trump, there are several different striking ways to look at those numbers. He's historically unpopular \u2014 the most unpopular incumbent ever to stand for reelection. He has a very locked-in base, with sky-high approval in his own party. But those who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve. Likewise, no modern president has had such high numbers of people who say they will definitely vote against him for reelection. There is tremendous intensity that motivates Trump's supporters and opponents. Despite the many advantages he has (more on that later), he is incapable of sticking to a message that highlights those benefits. For every tweet about the great economy, there's another that picks a fight with a movie star or retweets something offensive. Trump remains impulsive and undisciplined \u2014 something he thinks works great for him, even though many Republicans (privately) disagree. Trump also enjoys particular structural advantages, starting with the Electoral College. He received 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016 and won only 46% of the popular vote, a smaller percentage than Mitt Romney received when he lost to Barack Obama in 2012. But America picks its presidents in a state-by-state, winner-take-all system, and Trump's voters are more efficiently distributed among battleground states than Democrats'. So how big of an advantage does he have going into 2020? One way to think about it is that Trump could lose Michigan and Pennsylvania but still win by holding on to all the other states he won in 2016. Some estimates say he could lose the popular vote by as many as 5 million votes and still win the Electoral College. Also, Trump has the advantage of incumbency. Only two incumbent presidents have lost in the last 40 years: George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter \u2014 and they were facing a recession and a hostage crisis, respectively. All the tools of the presidency are at Trump's disposal, including an early start on fundraising, and he commands the bully pulpit \u2014 and dominates news coverage \u2014 like no other president. Democrats' choice While Democrats might hope that Trump is so unpopular that a ham sandwich could beat him, that is not the case. The Democrats' choice for a nominee matters, because an election is not just a referendum on the incumbent; it's a binary choice between two candidates. Trump and others who want him reelected (foreign and domestic) will be putting tremendous time, effort and billions of dollars into demonizing the Democratic nominee. And the president encourages these efforts, including his open calls for Ukraine and China to investigate candidate Joe Biden. This year, despite the Democrats' overwhelming enthusiasm for defeating Trump, no Democratic candidate currently running looks like a slam dunk against him. And that's why the Democratic primary race is so unsettled. The weaknesses of the Democratic candidates that Trump can exploit are already well known: from Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American ancestry and Bernie Sanders' socialism to Biden's age (and, yes, Ukraine) and Pete Buttigieg's inexperience. Trump has megabucks to spend, but often overlooked is that the amount the Democratic candidates raised as a group in the last quarter was twice as much as Trump raised during that time. That shows how much grassroots enthusiasm Democrats could tap into if and when they unify behind one candidate. This year there's the rare possibility that the challenger will not be outspent by the incumbent. Another reason that might be the case this year is Mike Bloomberg. Even though he's unlikely to become the nominee, the former New York City mayor says he will spend up to $1 billion to defeat Trump, even if the nominee is a left-wing candidate like Sanders or Warren. The economy and capitalism Every presidential election revolves around this simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? For most people \u2014 at least in terms of the economy \u2014 the answer is yes. Unemployment has continued to tick down the last few years, and the stock market is booming. Gross domestic product growth is not what Trump wanted, but fears of a recession have not materialized. And notably, wages have risen faster for low-income workers since 2018 than for others. One unusual factor of Trump's presidency is that his approval rating has not tracked with the economy in the same way it did for other presidents. But it remains Trump's greatest strength and Democrats' greatest challenge. It's likely Democrats will focus on how the economy should provide more broadly shared prosperity and better economic mobility, like it used to do. And they'll raise structural issues. Economic disparities are extreme. The top 1% holds nearly as much wealth as the middle class and upper-middle class combined. Trump touts historically low unemployment rates for Hispanics and African Americans, but the racial wealth gap has expanded for decades. And base costs for big-ticket items such as college, health care, housing and retirement continue to rise. The Democrats will focus on middle-class families' anxieties about the future \u2014 even if things seem OK in the present for many. Indeed, a growing number of people no longer believe in the American dream: work hard, play by the rules and your kids can do better than you did. Trump will counter that Democrats are socialists who will raise taxes. That argument will be stronger if Sanders \u2014 an avowed democratic socialist \u2014 is the Democratic nominee. He summed up his economic identity in October 2019: \"There are differences between Elizabeth [Warren] and myself. Elizabeth ... has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not.\" Socialism has a clear negative connotation to many in the electorate, and Republicans use \"socialism\" as a dirty word, but it's not among younger voters \u2014 the heart of Sanders' base in the Democratic Party. Still, this debate is occurring at a time when trust in institutions, public and private, remains in the basement. So it's a challenge for Democrats' argument that giving government a much bigger role in the economy is a good thing. The culture war It's possible this will not be an \"it's the economy, stupid\" election, but an \"it's the culture, stupid\" election. Despite his bragging on the economy, Trump is a culture warrior at heart and plans to run another us-against-them campaign, ratcheting up the grievance among his base against East Coast liberal elites, the media, immigrants and kneeling black athletes. For many of his supporters \u2014 farmers, white evangelicals, non-college-educated rural voters, for instance \u2014 economics takes a back seat to the cultural issues Trump champions, including immigration, abortion, school prayer and gun rights. For many Republicans, the number of conservative judges Trump has nominated \u2014 and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed through the Senate \u2014 is a key accomplishment of the administration. So are the steps to limit migration at the southern border, reduce refugee resettlement and enact travel restrictions from an increasing number of countries. Trump will surely continue to train his ire at the news media, as well. This remains a rallying cause for his base. Who shows up Every election is determined by who goes to the polls. This year, the shape of the electorate is harder to discern than ever, because it's likely we'll see a historically large number of voters. Democrats hope it's like 2018, when turnout surged among Democratic-leaning groups: Latinos, young voters and, especially, college-educated women. Trump, on the other hand, is counting on being able to bring out many more of his core voters \u2014 the white working class \u2014 who did not show up in 2016. He's using his massive campaign apparatus, including social media, to identify them and try to persuade them to turn out. There was skepticism that Obama could replicate the turnout among key parts of his base when he ran for reelection, but the turnout rate for black voters increased from 2008 to 2012. And because the overall turnout rate in 2016 was about 60%, both sides have more potential voters to tap. Also, while the electorate continues to get younger, browner and more female, a lot of those voters live in the wrong states as far as Democratic hopes at winning go. In other words, it doesn't matter as much if there's a huge surge in turnout in California and New York (two states where Hillary Clinton got one-fifth of all her votes from); it matters who shows up in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Michigan and Pennsylvania, white, working-class voters make up 56% of eligible voters; in Wisconsin, it's 61%. And that is why Democrats are spending so much energy on voter-registration drives and on fighting voter-suppression efforts by Republicans. Ballot access is a top priority for Democrats. It was among the first priorities they focused on when they took over the majority in the House in 2019.",

The Department of Homeland Security has agreed to share its records with the U.S. Census Bureau to help produce data about the U.S. citizenship status of every person living in the country, as ordered by President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Bryan R.

The Department of Homeland Security has agreed to share its records with the U.S. Census Bureau to help produce data about the U.S. citizenship status of every person living in the country, as ordered by President Trump. The Department of Homeland Security has agreed to share certain government records from its databases to help the Census Bureau produce data about the U.S. citizenship status of every person living in the country. DHS quietly announced the data-sharing agreement in a regulatory document posted on its website on Dec. 27. It marks the latest development in the Trump administration's ongoing effort to carry out the executive order President Trump issued in July after courts blocked the administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year to keep the citizenship question off, President Trump said in the executive order that releasing citizenship data based on existing records would allow states to redraw voting districts using the number of eligible voters rather than all residents in an area \u2014 a method of redistricting that a prominent GOP strategist concluded would politically benefit Republicans and non-Hispanic white people. According to the DHS document, which was first reported by Federal Computer Week, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is sharing personal information about naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders from records going back to as early as 1973. More recent records dating to 2013 from Customs and Border Protection, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will provide the Census Bureau with data such as noncitizens' full names, birth dates, addresses, Social Security numbers and alien registration numbers. CBP is also sharing the travel histories of visitors to the U.S., including those who have overstayed their visas. Federal law restricts the release of immigration records about survivors of human trafficking and of certain other crimes who have applied for special visas, as well as survivors of domestic abuse who have applied for immigration benefits under the Violence Against Women Act. Still, USCIS has asked for permission to release to the Census Bureau data about refugees and asylum-seekers, whose records generally cannot be shared without their consent or a waiver signed by the Homeland Security secretary. The bureau plans to use the data it does receive to try to match the DHS records with those from other agencies about the same person. Each individual's records would then be used in a statistical model designed to produce anonymized estimates of U.S. citizens and noncitizens living in the country. It is unclear, however, whether this process will be able to accurately determine the citizenship status of individuals. \"No one source of citizenship information is complete and up-to-date,\" the DHS document \u2014 known as a privacy impact assessment \u2014 warns, while noting that misidentified individuals would receive \"no adverse impact\" because the efforts are only for \"statistical purposes.\" Still, Latinx community groups represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC are currently suing the administration, arguing that its data efforts are part of a conspiracy to stop Latinx communities, noncitizens and other immigrants from receiving fair political representation. Meanwhile, the administration has spent months trying to amass citizenship records from other federal agencies, including the State Department and the Social Security Administration, plus states. In November, Nebraska became the first state to agree to share its driver's license records with the Census Bureau. The data DHS provides \"will not be used to make programmatic or administrative enforcement decisions,\" according to the document the department released last week. Instead, the document says DHS is providing the records as required by Trump's executive order to help determine numbers of three specific groups: \"citizens, lawfully present non-citizens, and unauthorized immigrants in the United States during the decennial census.\" While Trump's order does reference a need for a \"more reliable\" count of unauthorized immigrants to better inform public policy about immigration and eligibility for public benefits, the Census Bureau has not publicly acknowledged any plans to create such an estimate. During public meetings in September, the Census Bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, confirmed that the executive order \u2014 along with a filing to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which reviews all federal government efforts to collect information \u2014 \"commit\" the bureau to releasing citizenship data by the end of March 2021, in time for the next round of redistricting. The bureau's public information office has not responded to NPR's questions about whether it's planning to produce a count of unauthorized immigrants in response to the executive order. The bureau is currently fighting off a lawsuit by the state of Alabama and Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from that state, which is arguing in court to get unauthorized immigrants excluded from census numbers used to determine the distribution of congressional seats among the states. Both the bureau and the Department of Homeland Security's office of public affairs have also not responded to NPR's questions about when the new data-sharing agreement was signed and if any data have been transferred yet. Plans for DHS to share data with the bureau through this agreement have been in negotiations since early 2018, when the bureau officials began scrambling to respond to the Trump administration's last-minute request to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Census Bureau officials have long advocated for the administration to rely on existing government records as a way to produce citizenship information that the bureau's researchers say is more accurate and less expensive than collecting self-reported responses to a census question. In 2018, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, approved adding the question to census forms and directed the bureau to request records from other agencies and state governments. Still, the DHS document lays out a number of risks involved with sharing data with the bureau, including a concern that doing so is \"not compatible with the original purpose\" of DHS agencies collecting the information. It also flags the risk that the people whose information DHS is sharing with the Census Bureau may not want that to occur. The document says, however, these risks \"cannot be mitigated\" and that Trump's executive order requires DHS to comply with the bureau's data requests. Some privacy advocates have raised their own concerns about the potential misuse of data, especially at a time of increased immigration enforcement. Using the information to try to identify noncitizens \"implicates fundamental due process rights and will impact both citizens and non-citizens,\" wrote Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, in a July letter to leaders of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On top of those concerns, it's not clear exactly how accurate the data produced using the existing records will be. The DHS document acknowledges it is \"notoriously difficult\" to use data to determine a person's current immigration status because \"individuals can have multiple immigration statuses through their lifetime.\" \"Because DHS is providing information at a point in time,\" the document says, \"it is reasonable to believe that eventually data accuracy issues may arise.\"",

Meuthen criticized the party's right wing in his speech. The AfD held the two-day congress in person, as total confirmed coronavirus infections passed the 1 million mark. Like many other far-right political parties, Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) was founded on outrage. It began as a response to the anger and fear some Germans felt when their stable and secure currency, the Deutsche Mark, was subsumed by the euro. It grew in popularity as it shifted its attention to immigration, and peaked when it attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to allow a record number of asylum seekers into Germany. In 2017, the AfD won 94 seats in the German parliament, the Bundestag. It became the country's third-largest political party and the official opposition to the centrist coalition government. The AfD's supporters and enemies alike expected the party might grow even stronger in the next election, in 2021. The pandemic of 2020 changed all that. After polling around 15% for most of 2019, the AfD's support plummeted this year. The latest surveys show it polling at around 9%. At first glance, this decline has a simple explanation. Like governments elsewhere, Germany's ruling centrist coalition gained support as it confronted the coronavirus. Public approval of Merkel herself skyrocketed. Uwe Witt, an AfD member of the Bundestag, tells NPR the government stole the AfD's thunder. AfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\n                \n                    \n                    Maja Hitij/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption AfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people. \"The main topics of the AfD \u2014 such as a greater stress on German national interests, closed European external borders, support of local small and medium-sized industry \u2014 were temporarily realized by the government during the corona pandemic,\" he says. \"That is why opposition parties always have polling losses in a crisis.\" But there is more behind the AfD's current crisis. The AfD has made a significant U-turn in its approach to the pandemic. In March, the party's parliamentary leader, Alexander Gauland, was complimentary about the Merkel-led government's handling of the crisis. \"Government policy contains many insights that we believe are correct and that we share,\" Gauland told the Bundestag. Seven months later, though, he described the government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people. The AfD's attempts to reposition itself have exposed deep splits in the party and its leadership, and confusion about what its policies really are. \"Right at the beginning of the pandemic, the AfD even criticized the federal government for not fighting the pandemic consistently enough,\" says political scientist Ursula M\u00fcnch of Munich University. \"But since the AfD always strives for a unique selling point in political competition, it quickly decided to take a completely different course.\" For some AfD members, that new course meant cozying up to the Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") movement \u2014 a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists that has steadily gained support for its protest rallies against government health restrictions and lockdowns. A demonstrator holds a sign saying Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") during a protest against Germany's coronavirus measures in D\u00fcsseldorf in September. The embrace by some AfD members of the Querdenker movement \u2014 a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists \u2014 has cost the party support.\n                \n                    \n                    Fabian Strauch/picture alliance via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A demonstrator holds a sign saying Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") during a protest against Germany's coronavirus measures in D\u00fcsseldorf in September. The embrace by some AfD members of the Querdenker movement \u2014 a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists \u2014 has cost the party support. A significant section of the AfD holds similar views. A recent poll showed that 24% of AfD supporters believe the \"pandemic is a conspiracy to oppress people.\" M\u00fcnch says the embrace of the Querdenker movement has hurt the AfD among its usual supporters. \"The 'moderate' former AfD voters, who voted for the party mainly because they rejected Angela Merkel's refugee policy, are obviously not looking to be ruled by populist gamblers,\" she says. Undeterred, some AfD members have continued to push the new agenda, encouraging supporters to describe face coverings as \"a muzzle\" and attacking government health restrictions as arbitrary and inconsistent. Some data on the spread of the virus suggests Germany's recent spike in COVID-19 infections is particularly severe in areas with a high proportion of AfD voters, although health experts caution that any apparent link needs a lot more research. Matters came to a head in November, while the Bundestag discussed the government's latest legislation aimed at controlling the pandemic as protesters tussled with police outside the parliament. Two AfD representatives invited some militant \"guests\" into the building, who then harassed and harangued other members of the Bundestag, including ministers. The episode was condemned by all the other parties and led to a rare apology from the AfD leadership. During the AfD's convention, also in November, its co-leader J\u00f6rg Meuthen criticized the right wing of the party, its proximity to the Querdenker movement and use of the term \"corona dictatorship.\" Gauland later claimed that Meuthen had rejected half the party with his speech. At this point, there are two wings of the AfD fighting each other, says M\u00fcnch. \"Some want to get out of the ungrateful role of the opposition and participate in government,\" she explains. \"The others despise this accommodation of the system they hate and want to become more radical.\" M\u00fcnch predicts the AfD will perform significantly worse in next fall's election than it did in 2017. \"Although the relatively small group of hardcore AfD supporters remains set,\" she says, \"more moderate voters could be deterred by the party's quarrels and self-centeredness.\"",

Rallies occurred in multiple cities in support of the government's military offensive against the Tigray People's Liberation Front. For more than a week, Ethiopian government forces have been fighting against a powerful regional government in the country's north and hundreds are reported to have died. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel Peace laureate, ordered the government offensive after accusing the rival Tigray People's Liberation Front of launching an attack against Ethiopia's military last week. Thousands of people have been displaced, as government planes bomb targets in the Tigray region. The rhetoric is hardening on both sides of the conflict, raising fears it could escalate into a full-out civil war and destabilize an already fragile region. In a nightmare scenario, the conflict could pull in neighboring countries, including Sudan, which is working through a delicate transition of if its own, and Somalia, which is still fighting an Islamist insurgency. Here are some key points to understand: How did this conflict start? It has deep roots. But essentially, it's a power struggle that goes back to 2018, when a popular uprising brought Abiy to power. He ushered in democratic reforms and negotiated an end to what had become a cold war with neighboring Eritrea. But he also dismantled Ethiopia's ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which had run the country for almost 30 years. The EPRDF, which appointed Abiy, was a coalition of ethnically based political parties. The Tigray People's Liberation Front dominated the coalition and had amassed a lot of power as an ethnic minority. Tigrayans make up about 6% of Ethiopia's population. A member of the Tigray special forces casts his vote in a local election in the regional capital Mekelle, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, on Sept. 9. The election took place in defiance of the federal government.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A member of the Tigray special forces casts his vote in a local election in the regional capital Mekelle, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, on Sept. 9. The election took place in defiance of the federal government. When Abiy sidelined them, TPLF leaders retreated to their home region in northern Ethiopia. Since then, Abiy has accused them of trying to destabilize the country. In a briefing document sent to journalists on Thursday, his office directly accused the TPLF of orchestrating ethnic violence across the country. \"Hidden hands of the TPLF were there in the killings of civilians in many different parts of the country,\" the document read. It cited intelligence, but didn't provide evidence. The TPLF has in the past denied similar accusations. Regardless, that violence has displaced more than 3 million people over the past two years, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. But things worsened dramatically once COVID-19 hit Ethiopia, the African continent's second-largest country by population. Abiy was supposed to guide the country through its first truly democratic elections this summer. But citing the pandemic, he postponed them. The TPLF argued that amounted to an unconstitutional extension of the federal government's term. So they defied Abiy's orders, created their own electoral commission and held their own regional elections. The federal government declared the Tigray elections unconstitutional and both sides began trading accusations of illegitimacy. Abiy said the TPLF crossed a red line last week, when it allegedly organized a multi-pronged attack on the Ethiopian military's Northern Command \u2014 a \"treason that will never be forgotten,\" Abiy said. Abiy Ahmed is sworn in as Ethiopia's prime minister in April 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Mulugeta Ayene/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abiy Ahmed is sworn in as Ethiopia's prime minister in April 2018. The TPLF denied the attack. On its television station, after the fighting broke out, the region's president, Debretsion Gebremichael, called for dialogue. In a letter to the African Union, he accused the government of a power grab, and accused Abiy of imprisoning his opponents and trying to turn Ethiopia's ethnic federalism into a system where the prime minister holds all the power. \"Dr. Abiy Ahmed's one-man dictatorial regime has started to unravel the constitutionally-established state institutions,\" he wrote. \"He is also endangering the unity of this ancient country.\" How serious is the fighting? The internet and phone lines have been shut off in the conflict zone, so it has been a hard story to report. But things look grim. The Ethiopian military has said its forces have killed some 550 fighters. Redwan Hussein, a spokesman for Ethiopia's State of Emergency Task Force, told a news conference he doesn't have exact numbers of casualties because forces are still trading fire. He says the communications blackout, for which he blames the TPLF, has affected even the government. So, he says, when the government takes control of territory, they will collect bodies and count. On Thursday, Amnesty International said scores \u2014 likely hundreds \u2014 of apparent civilians were killed in a town at the western edge of the conflict. Amnesty said it hasn't been able to confirm who was responsible for the killings, that but witnesses told the group that TPLF-affiliated militias attacked with machetes, axes and knives. NPR has been unable to reach TPLF officials for comment. The government is also bombing targets across the Tigray region and the United Nations' refugee agency says that some 7,000 Ethiopians fleeing the fighting have crossed the border into Sudan. The U.N. says that even before this conflict started, there were already about 96,000 Eritrean refugees and another 100,000 people who had been internally displaced in this part of Ethiopia. \"Roads are blocked and electricity, phone and internet are down, making communication nearly impossible,\" the agency said in its statement. \"There is a shortage of fuel, and banking services have halted resulting in a lack of cash.\" Will the situation worsen? This conflict has the potential to be devastating. Some scholars have warned Ethiopia could break apart in the way Yugoslavia did in the 1990s. The government has downplayed the fighting, calling it a \"law enforcement operation.\" Kiya Tsegaye, an Ethiopian political analyst, says the government has alienated the TPLF from its neighbors. Abiy has made deals with Eritrea and the new government of Sudan, leaving the TPLF with few ways to receive the weapons it would need to keep fighting. But he says the TPLF is no ordinary militia. \"They have dominated the security and the military for almost three decades, and they have all the information and the top secrets of this country,\" he says. \"They know the Achilles' heel.\" The government alleges that when TPLF fighters attacked their troops last week, they also stole missiles that may be able to reach the capital Addis Ababa. Another worry: an unstable Ethiopia could destabilize the region and perhaps even other parts of the country, which were already on edge. One African diplomat, who follows Ethiopia closely and spoke on condition of anonymity to be able to speak candidly, says the warnings of a explosive conflict had existed for a while. Just as Abiy came to power, a grenade was thrown his way at a public rally, and in late 2018, his own soldiers marched into his palace in an attempted coup. Everyone knew, the diplomat says, that this brew of ethnic states within Ethiopia, a government struggling with legitimacy and decades of built-up grievances could someday explode into war. \"Nobody seems surprised,\" the diplomat tells NPR. \"But nobody seems to know what to do.\" Are there any signs that the two sides can come together? Not at the moment. The African Union has called for an immediate ceasefire. But Abiy has made it clear he will not negotiate until TPLF leaders are in custody and the cache of weapons held by the regional government is destroyed. Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. And now he is presiding over a brewing war? It's surprising. When he came to power, taxis and buses across Ethiopia plastered pictures of Abiy right next to those of Jesus. People on the streets said he had been sent by God. Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his democratic reforms and for officially ending Ethiopia's war with Eritrea. In his acceptance speech, he railed against war. He himself fought in the Ethiopia-Eritrea war in the late 1990s, a war he described as the \"epitome of hell.\" \"I've seen brothers slaughtering brothers on the battlefield,\" he said. \"I have seen older men, women and children trembling in terror under the deadly shower of bullets and artillery shells. War makes for bitter men, heartless and savage men.\" Now, just a year later, his jets are dropping bombs in some of the same places that war was waged. Abiy, says Hussein, the government spokesman, is faced with a threat to the \"very existence of the nation.\" \"The only thing he has to do is to defend it,\" he says. \"So if there is a second Nobel Peace Prize, then he has to win it again, because he is still salvaging his country. He is still bringing hope to Ethiopians and defeating some terrorist gang leaders.\"",

And we didn't see the sun the entire day, but in lieu of the sun was this really eerie orange pall.\" Compared to a lot of people, Nguyen says, she recognizes she had a relatively easy time with the fires. Still, the moment felt like a bleak distillation of everything that had happened in 2020 so far. \"It was just was this culminating event to capture unspeakable despair and defeat,\" she says. \"You can't help but reckon in a more existential way \u2014 to ask, what have we wrought? What have we desecrated? What is sacred, and how do we protect it, and are we willing to? I mean that in the environment, I mean that in people. What lives matter? Where is our grace? Anyway, that's what happens when you look at kind of the physical manifestation of a deeply dark time.\" NPR's David Greene spoke with Nguyen about finding humor in darkness, embracing her Vietnamese heritage and turning the day smoke blotted out the sun into a new song, \"All This and More.\" Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read on for an edited transcript. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. David Greene: The title of the song, \"All This and More\" \u2014 I wonder how it came to you. I couldn't tell if there was a little a slice of humor there, because that sounds sort of positive. Thao Nguyen: Yes, I did want to include dark humor in it, because it is \u2014 I mean, at this point, we're beyond absurd. It was a nod to not only the fires, to the pandemic, to our state as a nation. What kind of Groupon discount did we sign up for? Thinking about the moment when you and I are talking right now, our country has gone through quite a political moment in recent days with this presidential election. How did you react to that? I was [laughs], um, incredibly stressed out. I don't know what happens as far as moving forward and how divisive things are. And I, again, want to consider how I can be a more productive part of all of us moving forward. I am so struck by your personal story \u2014 and especially the image of you as a kid, a pre-teen, writing songs, playing your guitar while you were working with your mom in her laundromat in Virginia. She's a refugee from Vietnam. How do you reflect on those beginnings, your journey since and your family, in the context of this political moment? Thanks for bringing that up \u2014 I haven't taken much of an opportunity to pause and reflect on that. You know, I'll say that I was much more politically involved in this most recent election than I have been. And it was because I found this progressive Vietnamese-American group called Pivot [aka The Progressive Vietnamese American Organization]. I spent a long time more distanced from my family \u2014 for many reasons, but one was being queer in the culture, I wasn't quite sure how to navigate that. And then another was, I didn't feel that my progressive values had a place in the culture. But with this group, it offered me a chance to really appreciate who I come from, to be so proud of my family and my mom and how she built a life in which I could pursue my love of music and writing. When I was coming up in music, I didn't ever reference my Vietnamese heritage \u2014 to avoid being reduced or distilled to it, I avoided it. So it's been so gratifying and so overdue to come back and be quite open with what my heritage is, and be proud of it. I have to ask, at the end of the song, you say you want to feel light. Are you feeling it? You know, what's so funny is that I actually feel lighter than I ever have in my life \u2014 outside of what's happening. But sometimes I think the service of a song is just to capture a moment or an emotion, and I really loved the catharsis of a more plaintive and plain statement.",

On Wednesday, Abiy ordered the military to confront the Tigray regional government after he said it attacked a military base overnight, citing months of \"provocation and incitement\" and declaring that \"the last red line has been crossed.\" As the world's attention remained on the American elections, Ethiopia seemed on the brink of war. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered an attack against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the state government in charge of Ethiopia's northernmost region. Abiy accused the TPLF of attacking a federal military base in the overnight hours on Tuesday. \"The last red line has been crossed with this morning's attacks and the Federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,\" a statement issued by his office read. In a statement on state television, Abiy said that the initial attack by Tigrayan forces had resulted in \"many martyrs, injuries and property damage.\" Phone lines and the Internet were interrupted in Tigray, so it was not possible to independently assess any damage or casualties. Abiy's government also announced a six month state of emergency in the Tigray region. On a television station run by the Tigrayan government, the TPLF looped a recorded statement, announcing the closure of their airspace and promising proportionate retaliatory attacks against Ethiopian forces. A member of Tigray Special Forces casts his vote in a local election in the regional capital Mekelle, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia in September. The vote defied the federal government and increased tensions in Africa's second most populous country.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A member of Tigray Special Forces casts his vote in a local election in the regional capital Mekelle, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia in September. The vote defied the federal government and increased tensions in Africa's second most populous country. This is a major escalation between the state and federal government in Ethiopia. The TPLF controls the most powerful regional force in the country. They are well-armed and well trained and analysts fear that if this leads to a full-scale war between the TPLF and Ethiopia's federal government, it could not only destabilize the already fragile Horn of Africa, but lead to humanitarian disaster in the country of more than 100 million people. \"Ethiopia [is] an anchor state in the Horn,\" analyst Rashid Abdi wrote on Twitter. \"[This] implosion [is] bound to have devastating consequences across the entire sub-region.\" Abdi has warned that a war in Ethiopia could open the floodgates for the Islamist group al-Shabab in neighboring Somalia. It could also further destabilize Sudan, whose transitional government is trying to keep the country together, and South Sudan, which has been trying to maintain a peace deal supported by Ethiopia. Ethiopia's internal conflict, however, is a long time coming. The TPLF was thrown out of power when a popular uprising led to the dismantling of the ruling coalition the TPLF had built in Ethiopia. Abiy took power in April of 2018 and has since accused the former regime of trying to destabilize the country, in part, by fomenting ethnic divisions and violence. The TPLF has given refuge to former government officials wanted by the new regime and in September, they held regional elections that had been declared unconstitutional by the federal government. On Monday, Debretsion Gebremichael, the president of the Tigray region, said the Ethiopian government was plotting a war against them in retaliation for holding elections. This afternoon, the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa urged \"an immediate de-escalation of the current situation in Tigray.\" \"We strongly encourage all parties to prioritize civilians' safety and security,\" the statement read.",

Days later he told Fox News that he condemned right-wing hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Proud Boys. Soon after being discharged from the hospital for treatment for COVID-19, President Trump tweeted the slur \"Chinese virus\" to refer to the coronavirus, something he's often repeated during the pandemic. It's the latest example of Trump's alarming language that critics charge is xenophobic, discriminatory and even white supremacist. While Trump denies those labels, he has increasingly returned to the issue of race in the runup to the November election. ....invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well. He will show America we no longer have to be afraid.\u201d\u00a0@MirandaDevine @NYPost\u00a0 Thank you Miranda. Was over until the Plague came in from China. Will win anyway! Last month he barred racial sensitivity training for federal workers and then expanded it to contractors in an executive order. At the first debate last month, to an international audience, he called the trainings \u2014 aimed at creating an inclusive work environment \u2014 \"racist.\" He's also attacked The New York Times' 1619 Project \u2014 which some schools are adopting into their curriculum to center the consequences of slavery in U.S. history \u2014 as anti-American propaganda. Then he formed the \"1776 Commission\" for what he called a \"patriotic\" education. And Trump paints the largely peaceful protests for racial justice across the country as violent riots and tries to portray himself as the \"law and order\" candidate. Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said in a statement that labeling the president racist is a \"pathetic attempt to negate his incredible accomplishments for Black America.\" \"Democrats, with the help of the mainstream media, try to label this President as something he's not,\" she said. She points to Trump's record on criminal justice reform, support for funding of HBCUs and unemployment numbers and accused Joe Biden of failing \"minority communities.\" Trump has attacked Biden for his role in the 1994 crime bill and accused him of hurting the economy for Black Americans with his trade policies. The White House has repeatedly pointed to the record low Black unemployment rate before the coronavirus pandemic. But it shot up during the pandemic to 13 percent, above the national unemployment rate of about 8 percent. And the president's language and policy changes over the last month are less blips and more features of  his reelection campaign, said Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro, a professor of political science and gender studies at the University of Southern California. \"Part of the strategy is to create enough chaos and confusion and to create enough anger, frankly, in his base that they will make sure that they continue to kind of agitate during the electoral process,\" Alfaro said. \"Based on what happened in 2016, he and his campaign see this as a successful strategy. I think what's different in 2020, though, is that you can't just do the same thing that you did four years ago. You actually have to amp it up.\" Alfaro said Trump is stoking racial tensions and playing on fears among some white voters to portray himself as the one who can save them from chaos. She pointed to a rally last month in Bemidji, Minn., where Trump falsely said former Vice President Joe Biden would flood the majority-white state with refugees from \"Somalia and all over the planet.\" Then to the almost exclusively white crowd, he invoked the \"racehorse theory.\" \"You have good genes, you know that right? You have good genes. A lot of it's about the genes, isn't it? Don't you believe?\" he told the crowd. \"The racehorse theory you think was so different? You have good genes, Minnesota.\" Trump tells an almost exclusively white crowd in Minnesota they have \"good genes.\" That theory is a discredited, discriminatory belief from the eugenics movement that some genes are superior to others. These are the theories that shaped Nazi Germany's policies. Eugenics was also behind the forced sterilization of women  in the 1950s in North Carolina through the early 1970s in Puerto Rico. The pseudo-science led to the coerced sterilizations of Native American, Latina, African American and poor women. \"Then now, most recently, we started to hear reports of women in detention, in [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention, who were being sterilized without informed consent and certainly against their will,\" she said. Even if Trump loses to Biden in November, Alfaro said, his actions have normalized racist fringe ideologies and encouraged extremists. \"There's been this emboldening of violence, this emboldening of a certain kind of rhetoric that I think really could become a problem,\" she said. \"So even if there is a peaceful transfer of power in January, we do have to be very concerned about the legacy of what we've seen over the past four years.\" There already appears to be a chilling effect as a result of Trump's executive order to \"combat offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating.\" This week actor William Jackson Harper tweeted about his experience with a nonprofit he works with, Arts in the Armed Forces. He said the organization asked him to choose a film for cadets of all academies to screen virtually and discuss. They settled on the movie Malcolm X, but the executive order led some cadets to back out of the screening. In addition to barring racial sensitivity training, the order instructed federal and military institutions not to use material that promotes a \"pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country; that some people, simply on account of their race or sex, are oppressors.\" \"This executive order denies the very real experiences of so many minorities in this country. This executive order is rooted in the fictitious idea that the scourges of racism and sexism are essentially over, and that the poisonous fallout from centuries [of] discrimination isn't real,\" Harper wrote on Twitter. \"But all of these things are real, and they remain to this day some of the most salient malignancies in our society.\" Harper called it \"selective censorship.\" \"It's no accident that all of these kinds of flagrant comments, which feel really spontaneous, they all cohere around a narrative of elevating white Americans as the real Americans and around excluding those who don't fit into that as unworthy or unequal,\" said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, a New York-based historian of contemporary politics and culture. She points to what she calls the whitewashing of America's history through attacking efforts to teach about systemic racism. \"It's about dismissing the idea that racism is real,\" Petrzela said, calling it a strategic attack \"on the idea that we must take seriously the experiences of people of color and the exclusion and racism that they have faced as a defining aspect of American society.\" Trump's not the first president to be accused of using dog whistles and race in his campaign. One example is Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. During his campaign in 1976, he warned about low-income housing in the suburbs and used terms such as \"ethnic purity,\" and \"Black intrusion,\" when discussing all-white neighborhoods. M.E. Hart is an attorney who's conducted hundreds of racial-sensitivity trainings for the federal government and American businesses. He said maligning efforts to create inclusive environments feels dangerous. \"The trainings are designed to help people understand and work better across cultures, to help people to create a culture of psychological safety and belonging so people can bring their best to work,\" he said. \"They're not anti-American; they're pro-American, pro-business.\" Hart was diplomatic before the presidential debate last week. But after watching Trump choose not to condemn white supremacy and then again attack mail-in voting as fraudulent with zero evidence, he no longer uses that diplomatic tone. \"The president laid down the gauntlet, and I'm concerned for the safety of American citizens, regardless of race, of gender, ethnicity,\" Hart said. \"Every American should be concerned when our president is using race to divide us.\" Days after the debate, Trump said on Fox News that he did, in fact, condemn white supremacy. \"Let me be clear again: I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists,\" he said.",

Last week's explosion has prompted new hopes for political change, but enormous challenges remain.\n                \n                    \n                    NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People wave Lebanese flags at a protest near the Beirut port on Tuesday. Last week's explosion has prompted new hopes for political change, but enormous challenges remain. As terrible as last week's explosion at Beirut's port was, killing 172 people and injuring some 6,000 others, it has prompted new hopes for political change in Lebanon. On Monday, Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his cabinet resigned, as it emerged that the blast was likely the result of government negligence. Now Lebanese are calling for major reforms. Daily protests have continued for more than a week on Beirut's debris-strewn streets, with citizens calling for removal of the entire political class and a restructuring of the country's political system. They want to sweep away the corruption and cronyism that have plagued governmental institutions for decades. The combination of last week's explosion and the financial crisis may have created a rare window for removing Lebanon's despised political class altogether, political analysts suggest. This moment represents a \"once-in-a-lifetime battle for the soul of Lebanon,\" says Nadim Houry, a Lebanese citizen and director of the Paris-based Arab Reform Initiative, a pro-democracy think tank. Enormous challenges remain. Here's what's at stake and how things may play out: Immediate elections are unlikely Although Diab's administration has stepped down, it continues to meet as a caretaker government, meaning the cabinet can still convene but does not have the power to create new legislation. Thus far, Lebanon's leaders have made no mention of early elections. Instead, Lebanese law allows President Michel Aoun, who did not resign, to consult with the parliament on forming a new government. Even before this crisis, putting together a new government involved a complicated discussion. After the previous government fell last year, following massive anti-corruption protests, it took more than two months of political wrangling among the country's different political blocs before Diab's government was appointed. Now many Lebanese do not trust Aoun and other leaders to choose the honest, independent administration for which they are desperate. They worry that any new government formed this way will be stacked with or influenced by the same political figures, whom Houry calls \"oligarchs,\" who have long controlled the country. \"We'll have to re-live the same scenario from the beginning, until we bring all the political class down,\" warns Ghina Nizar Harb, a schoolteacher who took to the streets to protest following Diab's resignation. Protesters' demands Since the start of demonstrations against government corruption and dysfunction 10 months ago, protesters have insisted on one thing: the ouster of not just the government, but the entire existing political class. Protesters have a clear message about who must go: \"All means all.\" The clean sweep they demand would include octogenarian President Aoun and parliament speaker Nabih Berri, along with the heads of political parties and religious sects. And they want to see the installation of a new prime minister and cabinet with no connections to any of those who have for decades controlled the state coffers and manipulated Lebanon's politics. During the protests that began last year, demonstrators called for the president and parliament to appoint a technocratic government that could steer the country away from its traditional leaders and reform electoral laws. Now protesters have little or no faith in either the president or leaders of parliamentary blocs to appoint a truly independent government. And there isn't yet an agreed path forward on how such a transition would occur. Maha Yahya, the director of the Beirut-based Carnegie Middle East Center, says if a new, independent leadership could somehow be put in place, it should push through painful and necessary economic reforms, like strengthening accountability in state-owned enterprises, which would allow Lebanon to obtain an International Monetary Fund bailout \u2014 and then set free and fair elections for Lebanese to choose their next leaders. \"If you're going to ask people to take an incredible amount of economic pain on top of the pain they're now taking because of the explosion, you've got to give them a roadmap,\" says Yahya. An entrenched political class Lebanon has been controlled for years by a small set of powerful players from different sects. A key challenge now is identifying figures who could be part of a new government independent of those players. The protest movement that began last October spanned the country's religious groupings and sects. By not having an agreed leadership, it was more palatable to all. The challenge now, though, is for Lebanese to agree on individuals who could lead them. Houry says the resignation of Diab's government has sparked a flurry of meetings among protest movement activists, with some names of potential leaders put forward. Few have been made public. Lebanon's political system, established at the end of the civil war in 1990, is based on a power-sharing agreement among representatives of the country's primary religions and sects, including Sunni Islam, Shiite Islam and Christianity. Back then, it provided a path out of bloodshed. But it has also given rise to a state essentially run by a handful of figures around whom \"there is a whole system of power, corruption and economic interests,\" says Houry. These figures include Aoun, Berri, Samir Gagea, the executive chairman of the Christian party the Lebanese Forces, Walid Jumblatt, the leading Druze politician, former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, and Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia. Despite their differences, Houry says, they \"come together when it suits them\" and any divisions are due to \"financial interests\" rather than politics or religion. Though there are other players, too, who wield some influence, he says it is these men who have primarily placed loyalists at all levels of government, taken over the country's institutions and drained the public coffers. Sami Nader, a political analyst and the director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs, describes a complicated system of patronage where these leaders and their party members \"have turned every single ministry, every single economic sector into a private property, into a private farm.\" He says: \"You have the same ... party controlling the ministry of electricity for the last decade, the same other party controlling the port for the last more than a decade, the same party controlling the telecom sector for more than a decade.\" Over time, he says, \"they transformed these public service sectors and infrastructure into the private property, bringing in their own people and more importantly, getting financed through these sectors or these ministries.\" The judiciary's role Now, though, with the country and its financial institutions mostly bankrupt, the \"golden goose of state institutions is dead,\" says Yahya. The appointment of a new, independent leadership would further weaken the existing leaders' political clout. True reform would have to undo the corruption baked into Lebanon's political system and culture, Houry says. The judiciary would necessarily play a key role in this \u2014 and would itself have to reform to strengthen its independence. \"You're going to have to take each of small corruption cases to court,\" he says. \"And maybe you don't win the first time, but hopefully you'll get a judge who will be sufficiently emboldened the second time to actually take the decision. And you start rolling back. I'm not saying we're going to win, but you start rolling back their influence.\" The international community's role Last week's explosion damaged and destroyed buildings across Beirut. The city's governor estimates it may cost as much as $15 billion to repair the damage. Offers of aid have come from countries around the world. At a donor summit led by French President Emmanuel Macron, countries pledged 253 million euros ($299 million). But the assistance would depend on structural reforms. Lebanon's leaders have ignored past calls for such reforms, including in 2018, when international donors pledged $11 billion, and in April, when the International Monetary Fund said a loan would be subject to reforms. Critics say Lebanon's leaders assumed that donors, fearing the country's collapse, would eventually pay up to avoid fallout for neighboring Israel and a potential influx of refugees to Europe. Lina Khatib, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House in London, says often aid \"that is meant to help the residents of Lebanon ends up being stolen or appropriated by the country's political class, and the money never reaches its intended recipients.\" One way political leaders \"get their hands on public funds,\" she says, is by setting up non-governmental organizations and private companies \"that end up getting government contracts.\" Procurement, she says, is \"done very often in secret\" and so a project intended to aid refugees, for example, might be channeled to one of the leaders' companies or organizations. \"And the projects would, in many cases, not be implemented,\" she says. In a remarkable scene last week, a crowd gathered around Macron as he stood on a half-destroyed Beirut street and begged him not to give aid to their government. Instead, they begged him and other international donors to give funds directly to civil society and local Lebanese charities, fearing that politicians would squander it on patronage and self-enrichment. \"You are sitting with warlords, they have been manipulating us for the past year,\" a woman told Macron, according to the BBC. He hugged her, saying: \"I'm not here to help them, I'm here to help you.\" Across Lebanon, citizens wait to know if this is true. Nada Homsi contributed to this story from Beirut.",

In a letter, 1,000 current and former employees are accusing the aid group of racism and white supremacy.\n                \n                    \n                    David Gilkey/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A dirt road cuts through a sprawling refugee camp in South Sudan where Doctors Without Borders has a hospital. In a letter, 1,000 current and former employees are accusing the aid group of racism and white supremacy. Over the last month more than 1,000 current and former staffers with the aid group Doctors Without Borders have signed a letter with an explosive accusation: The vaunted organization, they say, is built on a mindset of \"white supremacy\" that perpetuates \"racism by our staff, in our policies, in our hiring practices, in our workplace culture, and through the imposition of dehumanising 'humanitarian' programmes by a privileged, white minority workforce.\" Among the signatories is Margaret Ngunang, a clinical social worker whose experience offers a window into why the grassroots campaign has become so impassioned. Ngunang, who is originally from Cameroon, joined Doctors Without Borders just three years ago after a long career in the U.S. She says she was inspired by what she'd heard about the group from her daughter, a pharmacist already working with Doctors Without Borders. Its 65,000 members provide critical care to people in some of the most desperate and dangerous places in the world. In 1999 the group was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace. \"I thought it was a great organization given the work that they were doing in countries that have experienced war and famine,\" Ngunang says. The possibility that she'd face racial discrimination from them? \"It did not cross my mind at all,\" says Ngunang. But Ngunang says the microaggressions began literally the moment she reached her first posting \u2014 a hospital run by the aid group in South Sudan. Suitcases still in hand, Ngunang and another new arrival \u2014 also an African immigrant based in the U.S. \u2014 walked into the office of a top official: \"A white female, talking to two people. And when we said hello to this woman, she ignored us. You know, she turned, looked at us and continued talking.\" Ngunang told herself that maybe this woman was just very busy \u2014 or an unusually rude person. But over the following weeks, again and again Ngunang would notice white staffers treating white colleagues warmly while ignoring \"people with my skin tone, people with my accent. It was this sense of being invisible because you're black.\" When many of her white colleagues did notice her, Ngunang adds, it was often to second-guess her judgement and decisions. \"You have everything that you do being put under the microscope,\" she recalls. \"Everything that you do is questioned.\" But Ngunang says the situation was far worse for local South Sudanese staff. For them a job with Doctors Without Borders was too precious to risk complaining about any problems \u2014 even when white staffers would talk down to them and berate them. \"For me,\" says Ngunang, \"it was just very traumatizing to hear that and see that because [as someone who comes] from Cameroon, it brought back the colonial mentality.\" Christos Christou is president of the international board of Doctors Without Borders. In an interview with NPR about the letter, he questioned how widespread incidents of outright racism are across the organization's dozens of missions. But he says there is no question the organization is built on a problematic model. \"It's this idea of the white savior \u2014 the white doctor going and providing assistance to the people in Africa and especially to little African kids.\" Christou says it's time for a total revamp: \"Being clearly anti-racist in this organization is not just about dismantling and overcoming all these barriers that may have been created over all these years,\" he says. \"It's about rethinking the humanitarian model: The whole way of distributing the decision-making power and also the resources.\" As a start, on Thursday he is convening a meeting of the international board to vote on a range of measures \u2014 including setting metrics for progress that will be regularly monitored. But how much of this talk will translate into a new reality on the ground? Africa Stewart is the president of Doctors Without Borders' U.S. board. She points to her own election back in 2017 as a sign of the appetite for change. Consider, she notes, who raised her: \"A surgical scrub tech, my mom \u2014 who could not go to nursing school. A Black Panther dad, [who] named [me] Africa,\" says Stewart, laughing. \"I mean, was I not born for this?\" And she says she's part of a wave of more diverse leaders. The U.S. board of 13 members is now majority women, with two other Black members and a Mexican American. Similarly, over the last decade the share of program leadership positions throughout Doctors Without Borders that are filled by people from the global south \u2014 as opposed to Europeans and Americans \u2014 has increased from 24% to 46%. But Stewart also notes that various measures that she and others have pushed in the past several years are taking a long time to implement \u2014 including a plan adopted by the international board to reduce the pay gap between international staff and local staff. \"It feels like we're part of the solution. But it also feels like, 'Well, damn it. How long does it take to wear down a mountain?' \" As for Margaret Ngunang, she says when she returned from South Sudan, she confronted her daughter about all the racism she'd witnessed there. \"I said, 'Why didn't you tell me about that part of it?' My daughter laughed and said, 'Then you wouldn't have gone.' She just really believes in the mission of [Doctors Without Borders].\" On reflection, Ngunang says she still does too. \"That's the the reason I'm doing what I'm doing now,\" she says. \"Is it going to make a change? Maybe not. But at least I will know that I added my voice.\"",

In the 1970s, Cohn would become a mentor and lawyer to Donald Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Joseph McCarthy (right) consults with attorney Roy Cohn, circa 1954. In the 1970s, Cohn would become a mentor and lawyer to Donald Trump. On Feb. 9, 1950, Joseph McCarthy, a junior senator from Wisconsin, stunned the nation \u2014 and stoked the paranoia of the Cold War \u2014 when he alleged that there were 205 spies working within the U.S. State Department. It was the beginning of a four-year anti-communist, anti-gay crusade in which McCarthy would charge military leaders, diplomats, teachers and professors with being traitors. Author Larry Tye chronicles McCarthy's infamous smear campaign in the new book Demagogue. He describes the Republican senator as an \"an opportunist and a cynic\" who deliberately preyed on public fears. \"His tactics included playing the press brilliantly,\" Tye says. \"He understood that if you lobbed one bombshell and that [proved] to be a fraud, rather than waiting for the press the next day to expose it as a fraud, he had a fresh bombshell ready to go.\" Many of the people McCarthy accused lost their jobs. Others went to prison. Wyoming Sen. Lester Hunt killed himself in his Senate office after McCarthy and his allies tried to blackmail him into resigning. In 1954, McCarthy's campaign finally ended when the U.S. Senate voted to censure him. More than 70 years later, Tye draws a parallel between McCarthy's tactics and President Trump's divisive rhetoric. He notes that McCarthy's chief legal counsel, Roy Cohn, served as Trump's lawyer and mentor in the 1970s. But beyond that, he says, both McCarthy and Trump are \"bullies\" who exploit fears and \"point fingers when they're attacked.\" \"If there's any lesson to be learned from Joe McCarthy, it is that we are no less vulnerable to demagogues in our midst than Russia or than Italy or than Brazil,\" Tye says. \"We've got to learn from our history to recognize these bullies at an early point \u2014 and to understand how to stand up to them.\" On McCarthy's initial claim that communist spies were working inside the State Department His crusade was launched one night in February 1950, in an out-of-the-way community, Wheeling, W.Va., and Joe McCarthy was there to deliver the famous Republican speech on the night of Abraham Lincoln's birthday. ... Joe McCarthy went there that night with the briefcase that contained two speeches and he wasn't sure which one to give until the last minute. One was a snoozer of a speech on national housing policy, and had he delivered that speech that night, you and I wouldn't be here 70 years talking about him. Instead, he pulled the other speech out of his briefcase and it was a barn burner on anti-communism and it was the speech that launched his crusade. ... I think it was a matter of opportunism when he started out this crusade. He was looking for any issue that would give him the limelight. He wasn't sure until the last second which issue that might be, only when he got the response that he did that night, which was within two days, every newspaper in America put Joe McCarthy and his charges of 205 spies in the State Department, they put those stories on Page 1. Joe McCarthy was off and running and he never turned back. On how McCarthy decided who he would target When he stood up in the first famous speech in Wheeling, W.Va., and waved around a sheet of paper saying he had in his hands the names of 205 spies at the State Department, those were, in fact, recycled versions of lists that were old and the people often didn't work at the State Department anymore. ... He waved the list around. But any time a reporter said, \"We want to see that,\" he said, \"I left it in my briefcase. I left it on the plane.\" He had an excuse for everything. And some people said that he actually came up with his list by tripping around in the dark and just picking up any piece of paper he could, because they had so little basis in fact. On how McCarthy didn't necessarily believe his own rhetoric at first [McCarthy] was the cynic. He was an opportunist, and he knew that he was embellishing, if not outright lying. Larry Tye At the beginning McCarthy ... clearly didn't believe what he was saying. And he had fun with it, waving around the sheets, saying he had this list in his hand when he knew he didn't have a list in his hand. Calling up everybody from J. Edgar Hoover to friends in the media after he created this firestorm, saying, \"You've got to help me come up with some evidence to prove the things that I've said.\" He was the cynic. He was an opportunist, and he knew that he was embellishing, if not outright lying. But by the end, I am convinced that Joe McCarthy actually believed his own rhetoric. If you say often enough that there are spies in the State Department or that refugees coming across the border are ruining America, if you say it often enough, you might actually begin to believe it. And I'm convinced by the end Joe McCarthy was a true believer in his own opportunistically created cause. On why McCarthy targeted people who were gay He said he targeted gay people because he said their being gay, and their being closeted, and their being in government, made them a risk of the Soviets turning them ... threatening [them] with exposure, and that that would make them spill secrets. The fact was that most of the people that he was targeting were reliable citizens, that if anybody was subject to that kind of blackmail, it was Joe McCarthy himself who had endless secrets: His gambling, his drinking, all kinds of things that made him especially vulnerable. And his going after gays was just a convenient scapegoat, the same way his going after leftists was. On what exclusive access to medical records revealed about McCarthy's alcoholism He had always been a heavy drinker. And you can see in the records of his closed-door hearings that there was a different Joe McCarthy who was showing himself in the morning sessions and then after a lunch where he would generally have a hamburger, a raw onion and whiskey. In the afternoon sessions, he was more irritable. He was more likely to give lectures and berate witnesses. So we knew that even in his heyday as a senator, in the heyday of his crusade, that he had had a drinking issue. But after he was condemned by the Senate in December of 1954, the drinking got out of control. And that's always been speculated, but we can now see in his medical records, his doctors documented the rising level of his alcohol consumption, the fact that he would get delirium tremens \u2014 the DTs \u2014 when he would come into the hospital. And in the end, while the coroner listed as the official cause of death as \"acute hepatitis,\" and while the press repeated that as what killed him, we now know that what killed him was his drinking. On how McCarthy's career ended in his condemnation The hearings ended by ending Joe McCarthy's career. They gave his fellow senators the courage to finally take him on. In December of that year, 1954, the Senate, in a very rare move, formally condemned him. And that was the end of Joe McCarthy's political career. And it spelled a beginning of a downward spiral in his own life that ended with him tragically dying three years later. ... By the time he died in 1957, McCarthy was an afterthought to the press, to the public and certainly to his fellow senators. He hadn't been on the front page [in] forever. He was likely facing a reelection loss even if he even ran for reelection in Wisconsin. And he had a movement named after him that became the kind of smear: the word McCarthyism that he understood and couldn't spin away.

            "article_content": "by Masha Gessen Hardcover, 240 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life. All of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy. Gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory. \"He may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation,\" Gessen writes, a climate of \"more anxiety and fear of change.\" Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability \"while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.\" In uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness \u2014 all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin. For many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets. Gessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin \u2014 as someone who can return his country to the glories of \"an imaginary past.\" Gessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran \"not for president but for autocrat,\" and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future. Born in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history. Brought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office. Gessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs. Gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist B\u00e1lint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a \"mafia state,\" ruled by a crime family in which \"one man distributes money and power to all other members.\" (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation. Gessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power. \"The first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding,\" Gessen writes. \"Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics.\" Gessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven \"weak\" because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be \"the magic bullet\" that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing \"in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.\" Since 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College.  Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple \u2014 The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker. Gessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions \u2014 for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next. Gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much \u2014 noting how the words \"immigrant\" and \"refugee\" (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as \"migrant\" or \"invasion.\" Gessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled \"The Power Lie,\" Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may \"collapse in the face of facts\" and \"the Trumpian lie.\" The latter is \"the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it \u2014 while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' \" The media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations \"fact-check\" the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued. Gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable \u2014 or simply not objectionable at all. But getting back to the word \"surviving\" and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this: \"Recovery from Trumpism \u2014 a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends \u2014 will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be.\" At this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by \"we.\" One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office. Gessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans. In a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called \"the forgotten man and the forgotten woman,\" the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades. What if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts \u2014 the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.",

Kurdish refugees are streaming in to Tal Tamr and nearby villages in Syria.\n                \n                    \n                    Marisa Pe\u00f1aloza/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A soldier holds his hands up trying to tell the children he is out of lollipops. Kurdish refugees are streaming in to Tal Tamr and nearby villages in Syria. U.S. Army Capt. Cedric Pollard strolls into the business district of Tal Tamr, Syria, like a mayor at election time. \"Hello, how are you,\" he says, greeting everyone who comes out to see the Americans. Polland, a former school teacher from Orlando, has a commanding presence with a friendly demeanor. Kids dart along beside him, pulling his sleeve to get his attention. His soldiers hand out lollipops. Pollard's first stop is an open storefront on a dusty corner, where Abdullah Abdo sells soft drinks, candy and cookies. Abdo has lived here more than 20 years and he's a good source of information. Abdo says what's new in Tal Tamr is the high number of refugees streaming in to town and nearby villages. \"Almost every day we get to see refugees,\" Abdo says through an Army interpreter. \"People running away from Turkish militias.\" Located in northeast Syria, the village of Tal Tamr is a community cloaked in fear. When President Trump decided to withdraw a large portion of U.S. forces last October, Turkey quickly invaded the area. Many fled to Tal Tamr, including most recently Syrian Kurds seeking shelter. Capt. Pollard and his soldiers are in Tal Tamr to gather information. They are surrounded by locals eager to talk or just watch the Americans as they walk through town. Just steps away a man sells fruits and vegetables, bins filled with tomatoes, onions and bananas. He says business is slow. Few people from the nearby villages dare to leave their homes. \"All the civilian people are scared to travel on this road,\" says the vendor, who doesn't want to be identified for security reasons. \"The only thing you're going to see is military vehicles, whether it is Russia or you guys or the [Syrian Democratic Forces] traveling on it.\" The SDF is made up of Kurdish and Arab fighters allied with the Americans, still fighting remnants of the Islamic State. The man points to the main road. \"Every morning, when I come in and I spot [an American] vehicle over there, I say, 'Oh, it's a safe day. The Americans are here,'\" he says. American forces are here, but they used to have a wider area of control. Now this is as far west as they go. The area is mostly controlled by Syria, and Turkish militias hunker down not far away. They're part of last fall's invasion by Turkey, which sees these Syrian Kurds as enemies aligned with deadly Kurdish separatists inside Turkey. The vegetable store owner glances at the road again and he's suddenly agitated. \"They will shoot you or kidnap you and ask for ransom money from your family,\" he says in Arabic through an interpreter. \"People will not dare travel on that road going west.\" Critics say Trump essentially gave Turkey a green light to invade when the White House sharply reduced the number of U.S. soldiers last fall. This put Tal Tamr at a fault line, caught between remaining U.S. forces and Turkish militias. Pollard says his soldiers are trying to help. He points to an abandoned school building across the road that's become a refugee haven. Mostly women and children live in the three-story brick building. \"What we're looking at doing is building a playground, a soccer field and put nets out for the basketball goal,\" says Capt. Pollard. That project will be funded by private donations through the nonprofit group Spirit of America. Pollard is also using Pentagon funds to award contracts to local Kurds, for everything from gravel to construction work. One of those hoping to get work is a woman named Mehmed. She's 28 and a trained architect. She wears an orange sweatshirt with the words Los Angeles on it. Mehmed asked that her full name not be used for security reasons. \"I'm really glad because always it was like a dream for me to build this area,\" she says with a big smile. Mehmed fled the town of Kobane when the Turks invaded and headed east, following the Americans. Suddenly her gaze turns intense. \"Turks will kill every Kurd,\" she says. \"Turks is the big, big problem.\" Ibrahim Abdullah, a 35-year-old father of three, couldn't agree more. \"As soon as the Turkish militia invaded my village we had to run, flee for our lives,\" he says. \"The kids were scared, crying,\" Abdullah says. \"We had to leave right away with the air strikes launching at us. As adults we were scared, you can imagine how the kids felt.\" Abdullah was a farmer and grew wheat, barley and watermelons. \"Now the only job I have is to carry a weapon and fight with the SDF,\" he says, adding that's the only way he can make money and feed his family. Abdullah is part Armenian. In a bitter historical twist, he says his great grandfather came to Syria from Turkey to escape the Turkish genocide of Armenians during World War I. \"And now we're running again from the Turks because they're launching air strikes at us,\" he says. If things don't change he hopes to leave the country and head for Armenia. Abdullah is glad the Americans are here, but also frustrated that the civil war in Syria, in its ninth year, has no end in sight. But not everyone here in this village is glad American troops are here. A tall, slender man with darting eyes and a scowl pushes his way through the crowd. Zayd Ali is a Kurd and also a refugee. He faults the United States for what happened last fall when the Turks forced thousands to flee for their lives. \"The U.S. and the coalition betrayed us. You're not fighting our fight,\" he says. \"You don't stand next to us, what are you doing here? I don't know what you're doing here.\" There is anger in his voice. But as Zayd Ali spoke, the Americans loaded up in their armored vehicles, soon heading back east to their compound.",

Communal violence in India's capital killed more than 50 and injured more than 200 as President Trump was visiting the country. The violent clashes between Hindu and Muslim mobs were the capital's worst communal riots in decades and saw shops, Muslim shrines and public vehicles go up in flames. From outside a garage door in India's capital, you can hear the sound of wailing. Inside, dozens of women in colorful headscarves sit cross-legged on the cement floor, in concentric circles, crying. At the center is the mother of a 17-year-old boy. The hospital just called: Her son is dead. More than a week after the capital's worst religious riots in decades, violence has mostly abated. But hundreds of wounded are languishing in understaffed medical facilities. Corpses are still being discovered in drainage ditches. Victims are still dying in hospitals. The death toll has reached 53. Most of the casualties are Muslims, who comprise about 14% of the population, nearly 200 million people in Hindu-majority India. In New Delhi, mosques have been burned, schools looted and thousands of families displaced. Police are facing accusations from victims, witnesses, human rights groups, opposition politicians and Muslim leaders worldwide that they failed to protect Muslim citizens, and in some cases, even incited attacks themselves. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed \"great concern,\" and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes the allegations come amid \"efforts within India to target and potentially disenfranchise Muslims.\" Tension had been building for weeks over the Hindu nationalist government's new citizenship law, which excludes Muslim refugees. New Delhi saw a growing number of street demonstrations. Some ruling party politicians labeled Muslim protesters \"traitors\" and even called for them to be shot. Saira, the 42-year-old mother who's just learned of her son Mohammad Aakib's death, doesn't know exactly what happened. He was on his way home from a religious gathering on the night of Feb. 24, she says, when Hindu mobs rampaged their Muslim enclave. He never made it back. \"No help from the government\" At Al-Hind Hospital in Delhi's New Mustafabad neighborhood, one of the worst-hit by violence, Dr. Meraj Ikram walks past a row of beds, rattling off each patient's injuries: gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, shot at close range with a tear gas canister. Inside the main ward at Al-Hind Hospital in northeastern Delhi, the only doctor on duty on a recent day was a dentist who had volunteered to help, but had never treated gunshot wounds.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Inside the main ward at Al-Hind Hospital in northeastern Delhi, the only doctor on duty on a recent day was a dentist who had volunteered to help, but had never treated gunshot wounds. Ikram, 29, is a dentist, the only medical professional staffing this small hospital when NPR visited Tuesday. He dashes back and forth between a sink where he sterilizes instruments, and a row of prone patients, where he stitches up gaping wounds, some of which appear infected. A patient grimaces. The stench \u2014 perhaps from vomit, pus and blood \u2014 is powerful. This is nothing compared to the scenes at the hospital soon after the riots erupted, Ikram says. \"We had 60 to 70 healthy families take refuge here last week, fleeing violence outside. We didn't have enough beds. The dead bodies, we had to lay them out on the floor,\" he recalls. \"For the first 24 hours, we got no help from the government.\" Neighbor against neighbor This week, thousands of Indian police and troops in camouflage are manning yellow metal roadblocks in the dense warren of streets in northeastern New Delhi that was worst hit by the riots. It's a religiously mixed area, where neighbors took up arms against neighbors. Authorities have since registered more than 600 official complaints and detained nearly 2,000 suspects. Attackers \"were wearing helmets and waving swords,\" says 50-year-old Anisha. Among them were neighbors she recognized. \"Suddenly they were threatening to kill my family,\" she says.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attackers \"were wearing helmets and waving swords,\" says 50-year-old Anisha.

Anisha, a 50-year-old grandmother who goes by one name, says she dialed police in a panic as she watched a mob of angry young men approach her home, where she lives with 15 relatives. \"They were wearing helmets and waving swords. I recognized them! Some of them were my neighbors \u2013 [Hindu] boys I've watched grow up.

I called the police again and again \u2014 but they never came.\" Videos recorded last week show police throwing stones and egging on Hindu mobs. In one clip that's gone viral, police taunt five Muslim men lying on the ground, wounded. The officers force them to chant patriotic slogans \u2014 as someone hums the national anthem. The message is that if you're Muslim, you have to prove your loyalty to India. One of the men later bled to death. Piles of donated clothing lie outside tents in a relief camp in northeastern Delhi.

The problem is lack of leadership, he believes. Officers were caught off-guard by the timing and severity of the riots, he says. The violence began with isolated attacks Feb. 24, when Indian security services and media were all focused on President Trump's first official visit to the country. Meanwhile, local officials from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party were getting increasingly irritated by months-long street protests over the new citizenship law. Some of those protests were Muslim-led. BJP officials demanded that police clear out protesters from the capital once and for all, or they'd take matters into their own hands. \"We'll hold back only until Trump departs,\" Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader, told his supporters on Feb. 23. And that's what appears to have happened. On the night of Feb. 25, violence erupted on a much larger scale, as Trump departed. Mobs torched Muslim homes, chanting \"Jai Shri Ram\" \u2014 praise Lord Ram, one of the Hindu gods. They appear to have targeted Muslims indiscriminately, rather than targeting protesters.

Several Hindus were killed in the violence too \u2014 including a policeman and an intelligence officer. Videos also show police coming under attack. Kumar, who retired as police commissioner in 2013, vehemently denies the Hindu-majority Delhi police force showed bias during the city's riots. \"Please understand: The cruelty and the barbarity and the inhumanness \u2014 it is both-sided,\" he says. \"Someone told me that there was a hole drilled into the head of a Hindu.\" He added that the way in which the intelligence officer was stabbed to death \u2014 allegedly near a Muslim politician's house \u2014 was \"something like what ISIS does.\" \"Living on a tinderbox\" Tales of torture are being traded on both sides, ratcheting up fear, tension and trauma. \"We are living on a tinderbox now,\" says Arundhati Roy, one of India's most famous writers. She is a vocal critic of Modi, who was re-elected as prime minister in a landslide last spring. Modi's ruling BJP has long been accused of sowing communal hatred to gain votes in Modi's home state of Gujarat, in Muslim-majority Kashmir and in New Delhi. Roy says this used to be a BJP tactic only during election campaigns, but the party now appears to be inciting communal hatred all the time \u2014 with the help of private, pro-BJP TV channels. \"You run a government in which you marinate people in propaganda. Now, you have 400 television channels. They're just pouring out this poison, night and day, night and day,\" she says. No wonder violence erupted, Roy says. She wonders what India's Muslims are supposed to do now. On top of the most recent attacks, they also face unprecedented legal challenges to their very identity as Indian. Modi's Hindu nationalist government, with its new Citizenship Amendment Law, has revised the rules about who can become Indian, excluding Muslim refugees. The country's National Register of Citizens has slated nearly 2 million people \u2014 mostly Muslims \u2014 for removal from citizenship lists in the country's northeastern state of Assam. Modi's home minister has threatened to expand that process nationwide. This week, Freedom House issued a report saying the Indian government's \"Hindu nationalist agenda\" seeks to \"abrogate the rights of different segments of its Muslim population, threatening the democratic future of a country long seen as a potential bulwark of freedom in Asia and the world.\" \"Are you awake?\" Rosia Siddiqui and her husband Mehtab Qamar stand in the charred ruins of their family business in northeastern Delhi.

All that's left now is a blackened hole in a city block. Qamar sits on a bench on the curb, with his head in his hands. He says he has no money to rebuild. The fire also destroyed his home upstairs. After the attack, he didn't eat for several days and had to be hospitalized. Qamar and his family are now staying with friends. \"Our two children are too scared to ask us about what happened, and we don't really know how we would answer them,\" says Qamar's wife, Rosia Siddiqui, 42, who's draped in a black shawl. \"How do you explain such violence?\" It's the worst she's ever seen, she says. Roy fears it won't be the last. In a recent essay, she wrote that she \"smells more blood on the breeze.\" The question of what happens next keeps her and many others up at night, she says. \"The night before last, I was awake. I just couldn't sleep, because I was thinking about all this. I just keep getting messages. All my Muslim friends are awake. People keep messaging, 'Are you awake? Are you awake?'\" she says. \"I'm awake. Are you awake?\" NPR producer Sushmita Pathak contributed to this report.",

In its latest report, the U.S. ranking has dropped 8 points, behind Slovakia and Mauritius and just ahead of Argentina and Croatia. Much of the blame for the slide in the U.S. standing gets placed on President Trump. \"The Trump administration has failed to exhibit consistent commitment to a foreign policy based on the principles of democracy and human rights,\" the report states. \"[Trump] has also given a pass to tyrannical leaders whom he hopes to woo diplomatically, including Vladimir Putin of Russia and Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\" \"Fierce rhetorical attacks on the press, the rule of law, and other pillars of democracy coming from American leaders, including the president himself,\" are also noted by Freedom House, which relies on federal funding for most of its $38 million annual budget. \"An ongoing decline in fair and equal treatment of refugees and asylum seekers,\" the report adds, \"is also particularly worrisome for a country that takes pride in its traditional role as a beacon for the oppressed.\" The report is also unsparing in its appraisal of India, identifying \"alarming setbacks in the world's largest democracy.\" While Freedom House continues to count India among the 43 percent of the world's nations it considers \"free,\" it warns that through discriminatory actions against the Muslim minority and a crackdown on the country's Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party \"has distanced itself from the country's founding commitment to pluralism and individual rights.\" Both Trump and Modi are described as part of a larger \"drift from the ideals of liberal democracy\" in which \"freely elected leaders distance themselves from traditional elites and political norms, claim to speak for a more authentic popular base, and use the ensuing confrontations to justify extreme policies \u2014 against minorities and pluralism in particular.\" Among such leaders cited: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"He has countenanced no criticism, denouncing his perceived enemies in the parliament, civil society, the media, and law enforcement agencies,\" the report notes, pointing out that things came to a head last year, \"when he was indicted on three separate corruption charges, refused to step down, and actively sought immunity even as he ran for re-election.\" Forty nine nations are listed as \"not free\" in the report, with Syria ranking dead last among the 10 nations identified as the \"worst of the worst.\" Others earning that dubious distinction include Eritrea, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Somalia. Among the nations ranked \"not free\" is China. Beijing is accused of mass violations of basic freedoms of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, which is described in the report as \"a dystopian open-air prison.\" Russia is also labeled \"not free,\" although the description of its suppression of political opposition is limited to a scant two sentences in the 33-page report. Other large nations, among them Brazil and Mexico, are not even mentioned. The Freedom House report comes on the heels of another global survey on the health of democracy by the Pew Research Center. \"Democracy remains a popular idea among average citizens,\" the Pew 34-nation survey reports, \"but commitment to democratic ideals is not always strong.\" Unlike the Freedom House report, which ranks countries' degrees of freedom based on an array of indicators, the Pew study actually polled citizens last year on their attitudes toward democracy and elected leaders. A fair judiciary and gender equality were the two highest ranked attributes for a democracy among the 38,426 persons polled; the ability of human rights groups and political parties to operate freely ranked the lowest. Abramowitz, the Freedom House president, finds a bright spot in an otherwise largely dismal outlook for freedom last year in the rise of street protests in Hong Kong, Bolivia, Chile, Sudan, Russia, Algeria, India and Iran. \"The protests show that people want to be free,\" the former Washington Post White House correspondent says. \"But we have to also acknowledge that these movements frequently run up against deeply entrenched interests, and thus far, we have not seen a material improvement in global freedom.\"",

Daniel B. Shapiro (@DanielBShapiro) is a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. He served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and on the National Security Council during the Obama administration. When President Trump issued his \"Vision for Peace, Prosperity, and a Brighter Future for Israel and the Palestinian People\" at the White House on Tuesday, I was reminded that no one should be more humble about critiquing new Middle East peace initiatives than those who have taken part in previous ones. I am in the club of U.S. government officials who poured thousands of hours into that effort \u2014 and failed. So I appreciate President Trump, Jared Kushner and their colleagues' hard work over three years to advance this noble cause, as well as their attentiveness to Israel's security. I wish them success \u2014 but worry that a failure in this instance could come with severe ramifications that would set back prospects for an end to the conflict irreparably. The major problems with the president's plan result from having talked to only one side in the conflict \u2014 Israel. Ever since President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, the Palestinian Authority boycotted any contact with his administration. That was surely an overreaction, although Trump failed to offer the Palestinians any signal that he recognized their legitimate aspirations for a capital in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the communication breakdown handicapped all efforts that followed. When I was involved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations while serving on the National Security Council and as U.S. ambassador to Israel, I could summarize the stance of officials on either side in one sentence: \"If you, the United States, would just adopt our positions as your own and impose them on the other side, everything would be fine.\" That always struck me as an odd definition of a mediator's role. A mediator does not need to show perfect balance, but does need to earn the parties' trust about taking their concerns seriously. At a minimum, a mediator needs to be to be able to talk with both sides. But for over two years, the U.S.-Palestinian diplomatic channel has been completely silent. The results are as you would expect. On nearly every major issue in dispute, the president's \"Vision\" comes down firmly on the side of Israeli preferences. On territory, it permits Israel to annex some 30% of the West Bank, including all Israeli settlements, while leaving a semi-state of Palestine with some 70% \u2014 far less than contemplated in previous negotiations \u2014 in disconnected chunks. On Jerusalem, it allows Israel to hold the entire city as its capital, while giving Palestinians a few outer neighborhoods beyond an Israeli security barrier. It bars the return of Palestinian refugees to Israel (a reasonable restriction, because no Israeli leader could agree to absorb such a large population that would change Israel's Jewish character), but does not permit meaningful immigration of Palestinians from other countries even to the Palestinian semi-state. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas delivers a speech in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday, following the announcement by President Trump of the Mideast peace plan.\n                \n                    \n                    Abbas Momani/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas delivers a speech in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday, following the announcement by President Trump of the Mideast peace plan. On security, it describes a regime in which Israeli security forces would maintain constant presence, and likely experience friction, with Palestinians even in their own territory. In any realistic peace plan, Palestinians will have to agree to major concessions they have not accepted before. So will Israel. But this version would place Palestinian leaders \u2014 even stronger and bolder ones than the current, aging President Mahmoud Abbas \u2014 in an untenable position, unable to defend to their people something that will look like a total surrender. That makes the plan unimplementable. It calls for Palestinians to accept these terms within four years. The high likelihood is that the plan is a dead letter. The authors, and the Israelis, seem to know this. And the prospect of a plan that is going nowhere \u2014 whether by design or misjudgment \u2014 is pushing Israel toward unilateral actions instead, namely annexing large chunks of the West Bank. While the text suggests such unilateral annexation could be the result if the Palestinians fail to accept the plan within four years, already Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, fighting for his political life in a competitive election, is signaling he may advance annexation legislation much sooner. It could happen within weeks or months. I see four dangerous ramifications from this plan and the way it was constructed and presented. First, it undercuts longstanding principles that the United States and Israel have agreed should govern U.S. peace efforts: that agreements can only be reached in direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, not by outside parties; and that both sides should avoid unilateral acts that undercut negotiations. The violations of these principles set new precedents. Today they work in Israel's favor. It is possible to imagine future scenarios where they would not. Second, while some Arab states are offering tepid support for Trump's efforts, the prospect of the death of the two-state solution and unilateral Israeli annexation of the Jordan Valley is being greeted with alarm in Jordan. A key moderate Arab ally of the United States and peace partner to Israel, Jordan's stability is in the interest of both the U.S. and Israel. But King Abdullah II will feel pressure from Jordan's majority Palestinian-origin population and other opponents of the peace with Israel to downgrade ties. Quiet security cooperation benefits both countries and could be a buffer, but this relationship is best not put under stress. Third, while the plan envisions most of the roughly 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank living in the Palestinian semi-state, there is a reasonable possibility that at some point, that non-viable entity will collapse. If it does, the Israeli military will be drawn back into the main West Bank population centers, and Israel will find itself in full control of everyone and everything west of the Jordan River. At that point, the question Palestinians and many others will raise is: Why not simply have one-person, one-vote in all areas Israel controls? Taking into account the over 2 million Palestinian citizens of Israel who already vote in Israeli elections, that is the moment when Israel will face a dilemma with no solution: How can it remain what it has always been \u2014 a Jewish and democratic state without a solid Jewish majority? The answer: It can't. Finally, the plan's release so close to the U.S. election creates another dilemma for Israel. If Trump loses in November, his successor will not feel bound by it. The plan is well outside the historical consensus U.S. policy through multiple administrations of both parties, and the Trump administration made minimal efforts to build support for its approach before its release. All the leading Democratic presidential candidates have criticized it. So if Israel were to invest deeply in this plan in 2020, even going so far as to commence unilateral annexation, it has approximately a 50% chance of finding itself in a serious clash with a new administration in January 2021. Palestinian leaders, who have long boycotted direct talks, denied Israel's legitimacy and winked at violence, bear significant responsibility for their people's hardship. But a plan that, even if they change their ways, offers them little they can highlight with pride to their people and fails to to truly separate Palestinians and Israelis into two states, is unlikely to end the conflict or succeed in making their lives better. It won't do any favors for Israel or the United States, either.",

The Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says U.S. immigration agents in Guatemala helped officials deport Hondurans traveling in a migrant caravan earlier this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Santiago Billy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Honduran migrants walking in a group stop before Guatemalan police in January near Agua Caliente, Guatemala. The Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says U.S. immigration agents in Guatemala helped officials deport Hondurans traveling in a migrant caravan earlier this year. Democratic lawmakers are demanding more information from the Trump administration about an incident in January in which U.S. agents working in Guatemala rounded up U.S.-bound Honduran migrants and transported them back to the Guatemala-Honduras border. Forty-five members of Congress, all Democrats, signed a letter released Wednesday asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to provide a full report on what happened. An Oct. 13 report by Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee detailed how U.S. agents rented three unmarked vans and shuttled the migrants to the Honduran border. The agents were in Guatemala under a State Department agreement to help train local police, mostly in combating narcotics trafficking. The agreement prohibits the use of funds for direct enforcement operations by U.S. agents abroad. President Trump has made the effort to curb illegal immigration along the U.S. southern border a centerpiece of his election campaigns and presidency. Among his policies: forcing asylum-seekers to wait out adjudication of their U.S. claims in Mexico. The administration has also flown other asylum-seekers to third countries in Central America to apply for relief there. In his presidential bid, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has denounced Trump for curbing access to asylum in the U.S. and for separating children from migrant parents. \"Kids in cages\" has become a battle cry in the Democrats' campaign for a more humane approach to migrants and asylum-seekers. In their letter about the activities of the U.S. agents in Guatemala, the Democratic lawmakers charged the Department of Homeland Security \"carried out an ad hoc operation that appears to have lacked protocols related to security, personal safety, and the screening of migrants who may have been eligible for international protection.\" They also asked if Honduran migrant families had been separated and, if so, whether proper measures were taken to ensure reunification. When Democratic congressional staffers first asked the State Department in January about the incident in Guatemala, the department relayed their questions to DHS, which denied its agents participated in the roundup. DHS reversed itself and acknowledged its involvement eight days later \u2014 but not before the State Department had informed Congress of the denial. In their letter, congressional Democrats, including Sen. Bob Menendez and Rep. Norma Torres, who was born in Guatemala, accused the administration of transmitting false information to Congress. \"We trust you recognize the gravity of this matter and will take immediate steps to prevent future incidents,\" they wrote. Earlier, Menendez, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked the inspectors general of both DHS and the State Department to investigate. Calls for comment to DHS were not returned. A State Department spokesman said, \"As a general matter, we do not comment on congressional correspondence.\" Migrant advocates worry such actions by DHS agents abroad could hurt agreements U.S. agencies have with countries in the region. \"It's hard to imagine any foreign government welcoming U.S. agents carrying out immigration enforcement actions in their country, and that could easily undermine other forms of cooperation,\" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. At the time of the incident, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei had just taken office. When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report was made public this month, a Guatemalan official told Al-Jazeera his government would try to verify the story. Guatemala's migration agency referred NPR's request for comment to the president's office, which did not respond.",

Technically started the project in 2017, but really began in earnest in early 2019 while covering immigration along the Texas/Mexico border. I am going to continue the project through the 2020 Presidential Election. What do you hope will resonate or stick with people the most? Postcards from Americans reconnects subject and viewer to one critical truth: we may not agree with each other, but we are all invested in speaking up for a better America. What was your favorite photo? The nature of the project \u2014 meeting real people in real places on tight schedules \u2014 means that these images aren't the polished, highly-produced work you might find in another time or from another photographer. But the magic of the project exists in the way the photos connect the people in them to the words they've written, and I've found a number of images I love because of the great meaning in what the subjects have shared, and not just the image alone. It's been a good reminder that some images in a project are there because they are important to the story, and not because they are striking standalone photos. What was the most challenging part of this project? The most challenging part of the project has been finding conservative voices. Distrust for the media in general is a discussion I have a lot with potential subjects.

            "article_content": "Despite President Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric, Mexico's president has developed a relationship with him. NPR discusses how this relationship could change if Joe Biden wins the election.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: They seem like the political odd couple, President Trump and Mexico's president, Andres Lopez Obrador. When he first came into office, President Trump used some memorable anti-Mexican rhetoric and threatened tariffs against Mexico. But over the years, he and Mexico's leader have forged a strong relationship. So now Mexico's wondering, what would Joe Biden mean for U.S.-Mexico relations? NPR's Carrie Kahn takes a look. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: As a candidate, remember, Trump didn't have very nice things to say about Mexicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. KAHN: For his part, candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was no fan of Trump's either. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: In 2017, he equated Trump's treatment of migrants to Hitler. But fast-forward to last July at the White house, and both men are celebrating passage of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, and both are heaping praise on each other. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: My good friend, President Lopez Obrador of Mexico, we've had a very outstanding relationship. LOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Lopez Obrador said he wanted the American people to know that their president has treated Mexicans with kindness and respect. While critics at home said the Mexican president was too accommodating, others, like political analyst Carlos Bravo, says Lopez Obrador had little choice. CARLOS BRAVO: It would be very costly for Lopez Obrador to get in a fight with Donald Trump. KAHN: Trump had been threatening to slap crippling tariffs on Mexican exports and make the southern neighbor pay for a border wall. Bravo says the Mexican president, known by his initials as AMLO, adapted. BRAVO: Donald Trump clearly forced AMLO to change his migration policy toward Central American migrants. KAHN: Using Mexican troops to stop migrants from getting to the U.S. and allowing tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to wait out their claims in Mexico. These concessions have put Lopez Obrador in a good position if there is a second Trump term, says Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a political scientist at George Mason University. GUADALUPE CORREA-CABRERA: If Donald Trump wins the election, it's going to be perfect for him because he would have shown his loyalty and he would have made a good bet. KAHN: A Joe Biden victory might be trickier at first for Lopez Obrador. In what was seen as a snub, he refused to meet with Biden or any Democrats during his summer visit to Washington. Biden, on the other hand, went out of his way on a stopover in Mexico in 2012 to meet with then-candidate Lopez Obrador. Dan Restrepo, a former Obama adviser on Latin America who consults with the Biden campaign, doubts there will be hard feelings. DAN RESTREPO: If Joe Biden is elected president of the United States, he is going to work to advance the national interests of the United States and not his personal interests. KAHN: When he was vice president, Biden promoted aid to Central American countries and pressured their leaders to curb corruption in hopes of stopping the migrant flow north. Restrepo says a Biden president would find ways to cooperate with Lopez Obrador on immigration. For their part, Mexicans will be watching to see if a President Biden visits Mexico. Every president since FDR has, except for Donald Trump. Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Mexico City. SHAPIRO: And in the days ahead, we'll have other reports from NPR's international correspondents about what a change in the White House might mean for leaders around the world who have forged close ties with President Trump.

            "article_content": "With President Trump's immigration policies on the line, immigrants will be watching to see if Joe Biden wins the election, and then follows through on pledges to help immigrants and asylum-seekers.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Millions of immigrants view Joe Biden as a sort of savior if he gets in the White House. President Trump is promising an even bigger crackdown if he gets a second term. NPR's John Burnett brings us this story of a mother and a son who have been hiding in a church in Austin, Texas, for the entirety of Trump's presidency. (CROSSTALK) JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: A taste of home - some fried plantains and tamales wrapped in banana leaves, a moment of joy in a bleak existence. (CROSSTALK) BURNETT: You see - Hilda Ramirez and her 14-year-old son Ivan have chosen to live in a sort of cozy prison for more than 4 1/2 years. A progressive Presbyterian church in North Austin has given them sanctuary from deportation. Agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement generally do not make arrests inside churches. So mother and son are ensconced in the Sunday school-wing wing of the church, believing that if they leave the property, they'll be picked up. HILDA RAMIREZ: (Through interpreter) It's hard to have two fears. I'm afraid they'll separate me from my son, that immigration agents will come at any minute. And I'm afraid of COVID, that I won't be able to go to the doctor. BURNETT: Ramirez says she and Ivan fled her abusive father in Guatemala five years ago, made it to the Texas border and asked for asylum from the Obama-Biden administration. But she was rejected, and they took refuge in the church. To turn the screw even tighter, ICE has imposed a civil fine on her for $60,000 for failing to depart the United States, a sum she has no way to pay. H RAMIREZ: (Through interpreter) If I could vote, I would prefer Joe Biden, because though he has deported lots of people, he was never as bad as Donald Trump, who has separated mothers from their children. BURNETT: Biden pledges to roll back Trump's harsh immigration crackdown and reenact more lenient Obama-era policies, such as restoring the asylum process and legalizing unauthorized migrants. In her hopes for a Biden administration, Hilda Ramirez is articulating the aspirations of literally millions of immigrants inside and outside the U.S. Angela Kelley is a senior adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ANGELA KELLEY: So there's countless stories like this of people who have been terrorized because of the highly aggressive, heavy-handed, relentless efforts by this administration to push people out, to deport them or to make them so afraid that they'll leave. BURNETT: The universe of migrants expecting relief from a Biden White House includes 11 million who are here in the U.S. illegally, thousands of asylum seekers waiting in Mexican border cities for their cases to be heard and thousands more DACA recipients. These are immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children who've been given temporary protection from deportation. White House aide Stephen Miller says the Trump administration plans to double down on restrictive immigration policies if Trump gets a second term. And he had dire warnings if Biden wins. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHEN MILLER: No country on planet Earth has ever conceived of attempting what Joe Biden is proposing - the idea that you would release every single illegal immigrant who shows up at your country's border. If it were to happen, the working class and middle class of this country would be wiped out. It's that dangerous. BURNETT: Meanwhile, back in Austin, 14-year-old Ivan Ramirez has lived a third of his life with his mother, hiding from the U.S. government inside the church. Recently, he was granted a child's visa, but he remains afraid to go out. IVAN RAMIREZ: I mean, I would like to go to see a movie, but - and I would like to go to play soccer. I would like to go to a store. I would like to go - I don't know - everywhere. BURNETT: He asks whoever occupies the White House next year, he'd like to live like a normal teenager.

The Supreme Court is agreeing to review a Trump administration policy that makes asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings. The U.S. Supreme Court said it will hear cases that involve the U.S. \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and the border wall, two of President Trump's most controversial attempts to limit migration across the southern border with Mexico. The court did not say when it will hear the cases, but arguments are likely to be heard well after the Nov. 3 election. The outcome of next month's presidential election could render both cases moot if Trump loses his reelection bid. In one case, the justices will review a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from early 2020 that briefly forced the Trump administration to halt its practice of making thousands of people seeking asylum at the southern border wait in Mexico for the U.S. to process their claims. The Supreme Court allowed the policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, to remain in effect in March as the issue made its way through a legal back-and-forth. The \"Remain in Mexico\" lawsuit was filed on behalf of 11 asylum-seekers who were forced to return to Mexico as their claims worked their way through the U.S. immigration system. \"Asylum-seekers face grave danger every day this illegal and depraved policy is in effect,\" said the American Civil Liberties Union's Judy Rabinovitz, who is the lead counsel in the lawsuit. \"The courts have repeatedly ruled against it, and the Supreme Court should as well.\" The White House sees it differently, issuing a statement earlier this year saying, \"By any measure, MPP has been hugely successful, including by reducing burdens on United States communities and easing the humanitarian crisis on the Southern border.\" In the other case, Trump v. Sierra Club, the high court will hear a dispute over the administration's use of military funding to build sections of the president's long-promised border wall. Lower courts had frozen billions in funding, but the Supreme Court granted a stay in the summer of 2019 that allowed the government to spend money from the Defense Department budget to build parts of a wall along the border with Mexico. In late 2019, federal judges in California and Texas ruled against the president's plan to shift money around, saying the administration cannot reallocate money Congress has appropriated for other purposes.",

She delivered the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee markup. She delivered the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday. According to Rep. Veronica Escobar, the greatest danger facing Americans is not foreign, economic or even climate related. It is the president himself and his Republican supporters in Congress. \"Honestly, the greatest threat to our security is a president and a Republican-controlled Senate that act only in their own interest,\" Escobar said during the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night. Escobar, a first-term Democrat who represents Texas' 16th Congressional District in El Paso, took the seat vacated by Beto O'Rourke in January 2019. Standing in a community health clinic in her hometown of El Paso, Escobar focused her rebuttal particularly on immigration, gun control and Americans' ability to access health care, saying Trump and congressional Republicans are \"actively fighting to dismantle lifesaving benefits.\" \"Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, is blocking legislation that would better the lives of veterans, women and families \u2014 all of us,\" Escobar said, adding that hundreds of bipartisan legislation proposals are \"collecting dust\" on McConnell's desk. Although Escobar specifically invoked the threat of legislation not being passed, she also spoke candidly about Trump's impeachment trial, saying that it was a \"tragic moment\" and that \"no one is above the law.\" \"We know that the president violated his oath when he asked another country to interfere in our elections, putting the integrity of our elections and our national security at risk and later trying to cover up his wrongdoing,\" Escobar said. In her first year serving in the House, Escobar's district endured the deadliest attack on Latinos in U.S. history when a white gunman, targeting Mexicans, killed 22 people at an El Paso Walmart last August. In her speech, Escobar framed gun violence as a public health epidemic and connected the murders directly to Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. \"Just before [the shooter] began his killing spree, he published his opinions on the Internet, and he used the same hateful words used by President Trump to describe immigrants and Latinos,\" Escobar said. Trump invoked that type of rhetoric during his State of the Union earlier in the night when he cited examples of immigrants in the country illegally who had committed violent crimes in sanctuary cities, even though research suggests that illegal immigration does not increase violent crime. Escobar has become a vocal critic of Trump's immigration policies, such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the Remain in Mexico program, which require asylum-seeking immigrants to wait in Mexico, rather than in the United States, for their day in U.S. immigration court. She also sponsored a bill to create an ombudsman for immigration enforcement issues. \"From the attacks on the young DREAMers, family separation, the deaths of migrant children, to the Remain in Mexico program that sends asylum-seekers into dangerous situations, these are the policies that none of us ever imagined would happen in the United States,\" she said. Escobar is one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in Congress, along with Rep. Sylvia Garcia, who was elected at the same time. Prior to her election, Escobar was county judge and a county commissioner for El Paso County. She now serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. The Spanish-language response to the president's annual speech has been delivered nearly every year since 2011 by both Democrats and Republicans. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, also in her first term, gave the Democratic response to the president's State of the Union address.",

            "article_content": "One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics was admitted to hospital in critical condition \u2014 Alexei Navalny's staff believes he was poisoned shortly before taking a domestic flight.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: One of the fiercest critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin is in a coma in a hospital in Siberia. His colleagues believe that Alexei Navalny was poisoned. Two years ago, Navalny tried to run against Putin in presidential elections, but he wasn't allowed to register as a candidate. For the latest, we're joined now by NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow. Hey, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So how much do we know about what happened? I mean, how did Navalny end up in a hospital more than a thousand miles east of Moscow? KIM: Well, this morning he was flying back to Moscow from Siberia with his press secretary, Kira Yarmysh. He felt ill, lost consciousness, and the plane had to make an emergency landing in the city of Omsk where he was taken to a hospital. The doctors there had been pretty tight-lipped, but Yarmysh spoke to a Moscow radio station this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRA YARMYSH: (Speaking Russian). KIM: She said she's sure Navalny was poisoned and that this was already the second time. She says the first time was a year ago when he was doing jail time during protests in Moscow. The official diagnosis back then was that he had an allergic reaction. CHANG: OK. So as we said, Navalny has been a leading critic of Putin for several years now. Can you just tell us more about who he is and what he has said about Putin? KIM: Sure. Navalny is probably the most colorful and prominent opponent President Putin has had in his 20 years in power. Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and politician. But what makes him so successful is his mastery of social media and grassroots organizing. Even as you mentioned his presidential campaign went nowhere, he has a nationwide network of activists and, thanks to the Internet, really a reach to the farthest corners of Russia. It's fair to say that Navalny, who is 44, has inspired and really energized a new generation of Russians who view their government very skeptically. CHANG: Well, it is well-known that many people who have crossed the Kremlin have been poisoned. So does this case with Navalny fit into that larger pattern you think? KIM: Well, unfortunately, there is a long list of Russians who have fallen ill or even died after being poisoned. The most recent example, of course, is the incident in Salisbury, England... CHANG: Right. KIM: ...Where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned and that was just the latest of several incidents just in the U.K. In Russia, a number of opposition figures have also been poisoned. The Kremlin, for its part, says it's way too early to say that Navalny was poisoned. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, spoke to reporters today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DMITRY PESKOV: (Speaking Russian). KIM: He said the Kremlin is monitoring the situation and that, if necessary, the Kremlin doesn't have anything against Navalny getting treatment abroad as any Russian citizen has the right to do. CHANG: Now, I understand that there are plans to evacuate Navalny to Germany for treatment there. KIM: Possibly. Earlier today, one of Navalny's doctors said that he hoped Navalny could be treated in a clinic in France or Germany, not because Russian doctors wouldn't be able to cure him but because the chances are much higher foreign doctors will be able to get to the bottom of what caused his illness. Later, we heard from the leaders of Germany and France that they are ready to help provide him with medical care, even political asylum. And now activists in Germany who helped treat another Russian poison victim say they have a plane ready to go and get him as soon as the Russians give him permission. CHANG: That is NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow. Thank you, Lucian. KIM: Thanks, Ailsa. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In Russia a new generation is coming of age \u2014 one that has grown up entirely during the 20-year reign of President Putin. They have no memories of post-Soviet hardship.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: On this New Year's Day, Vladimir Putin marks 20 years as the leader of Russia, sometimes as president, sometimes as prime minister - in power the whole time. He took power amidst the poverty crime and chaos that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. He prides himself on Russia's return to stability. But these days, a new generation of Russians who grew up under Putin is not so interested in how people lived before they were born. They measure themselves by their peers in Europe or the United States, and they don't like what they see. A recent poll shows more than half of these young Russians would like to leave their country. Young people are starting to rebel against Putin's rule even in Russia's conservative heartland. Here's NPR's Lucian Kim. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Dmitry Nikolayev didn't used to care about politics. He was just a normal 20-something from Tula, an arms-producing town south of Moscow. His dad was a factory worker, his mom a saleswoman in a store. DMITRY NIKOLAYEV: (Speaking Russian). KIM: Then out of the blue, he says, he was called in by the police. He'd posted on social media about a heavy metal band whose songs the government had labeled extremist. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PHANTOM\") KORROZIYA METALLA: (Singing in Russian). NIKOLAYEV: (Speaking Russian). KIM: \"At that moment,\" Nikolayev says, \"I understood that something was wrong with my country.\" He joined the political opposition to Vladimir Putin. In conservative Tula though, most older people support the president, a generational divide found across the country. Just off a new pedestrian street in the historic town center, I meet Yuliya Savelyeva, a 46-year-old engineer in one of the town's factories. YULIYA SAVELYEVA: (Speaking Russian). KIM: She says Putin gave the weapons factories new business. When I ask her about a wave of anti-government protests in Moscow this summer, Savelyeva shrugs. SAVELYEVA: (Speaking Russian). KIM: \"I'm not very interested in politics,\" she says. \"I'm perfectly happy with the way things are.\" That kind of thinking infuriates Dmitry Nikolayev, the young man who joined the opposition. He supports Alexei Navalny, Russia's most famous anti-corruption campaigner who tried to run against Putin two years ago before he was banned from the election. NIKOLAYEV: (Speaking Russian). KIM: \"I ran Navalny's Tula headquarters,\" Nikolayev says. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING, APPLAUSE) KIM: Navalny, almost 25 years younger than Putin, was there to open the campaign office. Putin of course was reelected. The Navalny campaign office has been shuttered, and Nikolayev's closest aide, Filipp Simpkins has fled the country. I visit Simpkins's mother - her name is Yelena Agayeva - in a grim Tula suburb. (Speaking Russian). YELENA AGAYEVA: (Speaking Russian). KIM: She says her son Filipp just packed his bags one day last year and left, saying he could no longer live in Russia. He flew to Switzerland and now has political asylum. AGAYEVA: (Speaking Russian). KIM: Agayeva says her son's political activism caused him to be kicked out of the vocational school where he was studying to be a train engineer. He'd already been locked up a week for organizing a rally and was threatened with more jail time if he continued. AGAYEVA: (Through interpreter) He thought that if we all stand up against Putin and corruption, everything would change. But he didn't change Russia. The government changed his life. KIM: All that Filipp left behind is a computer, a mountain bike and his cat. Agayeva switches on the computer and plays a song he used to sing. The name of the song is \"I'll Be Back,\" and it's by a singer who grew up in the same gritty Tula suburb as Filipp. I ask Agayeva if she thinks her son will also return. AGAYEVA: (Speaking Russian). KIM: \"No, he's not coming back,\" she says, \"and I don't want him to. He's safer where he is now.\" Lucian Kim, NPR News, Tula. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Li is seeking asylum in Taiwan after posting a video that went viral on Twitter criticizing the Chinese president and Communist Party. In March 2019, a masked Chinese exchange student in Taiwan live-streamed a video on Twitter passionately criticizing China's president Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. Soon after, he posted again, this time with his face revealed and openly stated his name: Li Jiabao (\u674e\u5bb6\u5b9d aka \u674e\u5bb6\u5bf6). Within hours, the video went viral. Li received threatening messages asking for his location and identity. Hours later, he was blocked from both his Chinese social media accounts. Fearing imprisonment - or worse - if he returns to China, Li has extended his student status for almost a year. But the democratic island of Taiwan has no formal asylum law, and is wary of openly welcoming Chinese \"mainlanders.\" Li's situation has fueled larger discussions about Taiwan's role as a haven for Chinese dissidents, as well as questions about who he is as an individual and his motivations. In this episode, NPR Beijing correspondent Emily Feng speaks with Rough Translation's host Gregory Warner about how and why a 20-year-old nursing student with no previous history of activism suddenly decided to make such a rash decision. Is Li a conscientious activist, a brazen opportunist, or perhaps, a Communist spy? You can find more episodes of Rough Translation on our homepage, or wherever you get your podcasts.

Editor's Note: Iranian influence specialists are behind threatening emails sent to voters in Alaska and Florida, U.S. officials said on Wednesday evening. Updated at 5:42 p.m. ET Voters in Alaska and Florida reported receiving emails on Tuesday that threatened \"vote for Trump or else!\" \u2014 messages that have prompted investigations in both states. \"You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access into the entire voting infrastructure,\" said one of the emails obtained by Alaska Public Media. \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply.\" The sender claimed to have the voter's email, phone number and home address. Some of the emails were purportedly sent by the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group with ties to white nationalism that has clashed with law enforcement during recent protests. But cybersecurity experts say the origin of the messages is unclear, suggesting some of the emails appear to have originated from an Estonian server. The Proud Boys chairman has denied the group was involved. Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote on Twitter that the agency was \"aware of threatening emails with misleading info about the secrecy of your vote.\" \"These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters' confidence in our elections,\" he wrote. The agency has also posted a fact sheet reminding voters that in all states ballot secrecy is guaranteed by law. Party affiliation and history of voting are not usually confidential, however. Political parties and other groups can often access a voter's party affiliation and which elections they voted in as well as information from voter registration records such as phone numbers and home addresses. Not a moment too soon, as we're aware of threatening emails with misleading info about the secrecy of your vote.FACT:  Ballot secrecy is guaranteed by law in all states. These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters\u2019 confidence in our elections. pic.twitter.com/CocBKrMEaN The Alachua County, Fla., Sheriff's Office wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday that it is aware of the emails being circulated and is investigating. \"The email appears to be a scam and we will be initiating an investigation into the source of the email along with assistance from our partners on the federal level,\" the sheriff's office said. TJ Pyche, a spokesman for the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections, told NPR that election officials are in contact with the FBI. Pyche said hundreds, if not thousands, of voters in the county received the emails and that voters in other Florida counties also received them. \"We are always worried when things happen that might affect our voters' attitudes toward voting,\" Pyche said in an email. \"This is an obvious case of that. We want to assure folks that their votes are always kept secret and we are taking this situation very seriously.\" A spokesperson for the Alaska Democratic Party told The Washington Post that the FBI is \"now involved in the investigation.\" The bureau told NPR in a statement, \"Though the FBI's standard practice is to neither confirm nor deny any investigation, we take all election-related threats seriously, whether it is vote fraud, voter suppression, or threats from cyber or foreign influence actors. We're committed to\u202f supporting our election security partners and protecting our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote. \" There have also been reports of similar emails being sent to voters in Arizona and Pennsylvania, but local officials in those states have not made any statements announcing investigations. Nina Jankowicz, an expert on disinformation at the Wilson Center, said the reports are concerning. \"It fits into a pattern of voter intimidation we've been seeing coming from both foreign and domestic actors who have been pushing narratives about voter safety at the polls, both related to COVID-19 as well as potential violent incidents,\" she told NPR. The Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers who focus on election interference, emphasized there is no evidence the threats are legitimate and that the goal of such attempts is to scare voters away from casting their ballots. \"What makes an active measures campaign successful and dangerous, is when the response from the media and members of the public amplify the message, resulting in unfounded fear that disenfranchises voters,\" the group said.",

President Trump's hesitation, once again, to denounce white supremacy during Tuesday's presidential debate is drawing quick condemnation from anti-racism activists \u2014 as are his unusual comments directed at a white supremacist group called the Proud Boys. During an exchange on the debate stage, moderator Chris Wallace repeatedly asked Trump if he would condemn white supremacists. Trump initially sidestepped that question, claiming that he mostly sees violence \"from the left wing.\" Trump eventually responded to Wallace's question by referring to a white supremacist group, saying, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what: Somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left.\" Here is the exchange: WALLACE: You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland? Are you prepared to specifically do that? TRUMP: Sure, I'm prepared to do that. But I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing. If you look, I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace. WALLACE: Then do it, sir. BIDEN: Do it. Say it. TRUMP: You want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead \u2014 who would you like me to condemn? WALLACE: White supremacists, white supremacists and right-wing militia. TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what: Somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left. Because this is not a right-wing problem \u2014 this is a left-wing problem. BIDEN: His own FBI director said ... antifa is an idea, not an organization. Not militias. TRUMP: Oh, you gotta be kidding. BIDEN: His FBI director said that. WALLACE: We're done, sir. BIDEN: Everybody in your administration. TRUMP: When a bat hits you over the head, that's not an idea. Antifa is bad. BIDEN: Everybody who tells you the truth in your administration has a bad idea. TRUMP: Antifa is a dangerous, radical group, and you ought to be careful with them. They'll overthrow you. The federal government has deemed white supremacist terrorism among the most serious threats facing the nation. In testimony this month to the House Homeland Security Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the majority of domestic terrorism threats and violence come from \"racially motivated violent extremism,\" mostly from people who subscribe to white supremacist ideologies. Contradicting Trump's characterization, Wray described antifa as an ideology or movement rather than an organized group and said the FBI was investigating some cases involving people who self-identify with antifa. But he said the protest-related violence doesn't appear to be organized or connected to one group. Protests for racial justice have at times turned violent but have largely been peaceful. Quickly, as noted by Alex Kaplan of Media Matters, Internet users created memes that appeared to marry support for the Proud Boys with Trump's remarks. The Proud Boys on Telegram have now posted an image with its logo and Trump's remark. https://t.co/xSySGrohcm pic.twitter.com/UAJFsKCsbX The Anti-Defamation League's Jonathan Greenblatt, meanwhile, has called for Trump to apologize for that statement or explain what he meant. It's astonishing that, when asked a simple question, will you condemn white supremacists, @POTUS responded - \"The Proud Boys should stand back and stand by.\" Trying to determine if this was an answer or an admission. @POTUS owes America an apology or an explanation. Now. https://t.co/9tgufXom9K The exchange came not long after former Vice President Joe Biden recalled the memory of deadly white supremacist violence that broke out in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 \u2014 a moment Biden has said was pivotal in his decision to challenge Trump for the presidency. \"Close your eyes. Remember what those people looked like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile,\" Biden said. \"And the president said there were 'very fine people on both sides.' No president has ever said anything like that.\" Biden is referring to Trump's comments responding to the violence, where he indeed said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the clash between white supremacists and counterprotesters. Trump later said he was referring to both anti-racism counterprotesters and those in Charlottesville who opposed the removal of Confederate monuments. PolitiFact called the statement a situation where \"context is needed.\" Trump has a history of refusing to quickly denounce racism and white nationalism, and then backpedaling. During the 2016 campaign, he was forced to issue a clarification on Twitter after initially refusing to condemn former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

Well, the 2020 national political conventions are over. The Republicans wrapped up Thursday night, and there was a lot to digest, not least a clearer sense of what the post-Labor Day sprint is going to look and sound like. Here are seven takeaways from the RNC: 1. Trump tried to make the election a little less about him As much as the Republican National Convention was all about Trump, the president and his campaign needed to try to make the election a little less about him. Trump's approval rating has barely budged since he's been in office. It's had the smallest range of any president since Jimmy Carter and has not been net-positive since two weeks after his inauguration. A majority of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing on the coronavirus and think he's fanning the flames of racial division. So running solely on his record would put Trump at a disadvantage in this election. Trump struggled to defend his handling of the pandemic during his acceptance speech. So he attacked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for saying he would shut down the country if the science demanded it. Trump called that \"a surrender to the virus.\" \"[Americans] have to get back to work, they have to get back to school,\" he said. Trump then claimed, \"We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year. And together we will crush the virus.\" But taunting COVID-19 won't make it go away any faster than saying it will miraculously \"disappear.\" The polling in this race between Biden and Trump has been remarkably consistent. Biden is at or above 50% and, like his approval rating, Trump has been stuck in the low 40s. So we'll see in a couple of weeks whether Republicans' attempted reframing worked, and what rhetoric sank in with voters. 2. This convention tried to sell a version of Trump a lot of Americans don't recognize Convention speakers said Trump is a \"kind and decent\" man; that he promotes and listens to women; that he values Black men, new immigrants and the disabled; has been anti-China and done a good job handling the pandemic. But Trump is known for his public belittling of those who disagree with him; he has a history of demeaning women, and almost two dozen have accused him of sexual misconduct; he's been unable to say \"Black Lives Matter\" or Jacob Blake's name; he's taken a harder line on immigration than any modern president; mocked a disabled reporter; worked to have a close relationship with China's President Xi Jinping (his daughter even had trademarks fast-tracked by the Chinese) before the coronavirus; and he acted late on the pandemic, dismissing it as something that would \"disappear,\" maybe even by Easter or during the warmth of summer. One thing is clear about the GOP convention: Trump's campaign recognizes his serious vulnerabilities. He's not widely seen as caring and empathetic, has frequently made racist statements and is not getting good marks on the coronavirus. So Republicans brought out person after person to present a portrait of Trump you just might not see in public. 3. This election is all about the culture wars White \"economic anxiety\" as an explanation for Trump's victory in 2016 was always a myth. Nativism and white grievance were more the core of Trump's candidacy. And Trump's continued support from his base even amid his handling of the pandemic and an economic collapse shows that's even more true in 2020. Both Democrats and Republicans are saying this is a battle for the soul of the nation. And they're both right. It just depends on what you want that soul to look like. The country is at a crossroads. And both conventions laid out the very different paths it could take. Trump and multiple speakers said that under a Biden presidency a liberal dystopia would take hold and the country wouldn't be safe. A Biden presidency, Trump said, will \"give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens\" and \"destroy\" the American way of life. Meantime, Biden on Thursday said of violent protests: \"This happens to be Donald Trump's America,\" and that the country will be far safer once Trump is out of office. Biden also called out Trump's resistance to condemn right-wing extremism and white nationalism. Biden has frequently said he was prompted to run for president by Trump's remarks following racist and anti-Semitic violence in Charlottesville, Va., when he said there were \"good people on both sides.\" But Republicans think they've found something with their push on crime. Biden on Thursday said Trump is rooting for violence. A report from a reputable pollster in Wisconsin out Thursday noted that approval of Black Lives Matter had declined from June until August (before the shooting of Jacob Blake): \"In June approval of protests was widespread, with 61 percent approving of the protests and 36 percent disapproving. Approval declined in August with 48 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving. \"Approval remained strong among Black or Hispanic respondents and in the City of Milwaukee, but declined among white respondents and in the four media-market regions of the state outside the city of Milwaukee.\" But FiveThirtyEight's Perry Bacon pointed out that the decline and Biden's electoral prospects \"are not closely linked \u2014 at least not so far\": \"That drop in popularity has largely been driven by increased opposition among white Republicans (80 percent of whom oppose the movement, higher than before Floyd's death) and white independents (who now support BLM at similar levels as before Floyd's death).\" 4. The message against Biden is still somewhat boilerplate and incongruous Is Biden a Trojan horse for Black Lives Matter, or is he a racist who doesn't understand African Americans? Is he too tough on crime because of the 1994 crime bill, or is he going to defund the police? You'd be forgiven if you weren't sure which it was after watching this convention. Trump went hard after Biden, digging in on his record on foreign and domestic policy. Talking about jobs sent overseas, for example, Trump said, \"[laid-off workers] didn't want Joe Biden's hollow words of empathy; they wanted their jobs back.\" The Trump campaign has been struggling with a specific message against Biden. Saying he's really beholden to \"radical liberals\" is an acknowledgment that that's just not how Biden is seen by most Americans. After all, Biden has been in the public eye for almost half a century, something Trump tried to weaponize against him. They have just over two months to succeed and rebrand the former vice president. The speaker who took the best aim at Biden was probably South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. It wouldn't be surprising to see more of Scott on the campaign trail as a surrogate for Trump. 5. There were numerous falsehoods and misstatements, while the \"line\" of acceptable behavior was nowhere to be found From health care (claiming to protect coverage of preexisting conditions) to the economy (Larry Kudlow falsely saying the president inherited a stagnant economy) to foreign affairs (Pam Bondi's distortions about Ukraine or overstating the significance of the Israel-UAE deal) to speaker after speaker saying Biden wants to defund the police, the Republican National Convention was chock full of false and misleading statements. And that was before Trump spoke. His speech was full of fear and falsehoods. You can read the dozens of annotations in our live fact check. Here's a rundown of some others. In addition to the untruths, the convention crossed many other lines, including potential violations of the Hatch Act by staging partisan events and speeches on the White House grounds, the fireworks spelling out \"Trump 2020\" in front of the Washington Monument and the over-the-top opera from the White House balcony (\"Nessun Dorma\" and \"Ave Maria\"). This wasn't just quaint norm-busting, but completely blowing up any partisan guard rails around the presidency. 6. The convention offered a poor example during the coronavirus When first lady Melania Trump delivered a speech from the Rose Garden, few masks were worn. There was an attempt to space seats out, but not far enough to make public health experts comfortable. Vice President Pence spoke before a larger crowd in Baltimore with lots of close mingling \u2014 and few masks. But all pretense of setting an example of adhering to public health measures was thrown out with Trump's speech in front of 1,500 people, closely seated next to each other with few masks in evidence. (Did we mention the live opera?) But Trump is never going to conform. Referring to what he called Biden's \"failed political class,\" Trump said, \"The fact is, I'm here, and they're not.\" 7. The 2024 Republican primary officially kicked off For as all-consuming as Trump is, at some point he won't be president, whether that's 145 days from now or 1,606. And this convention showcased a slate of potential 2024 Republican presidential contenders, including Pence, Scott, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, even the Trump children, who may want the top job in the post-Donald era. Call it the beginning of the fight for the soul of the Republican Party. But they all know one thing: They can't get anywhere without Trump's base.",

He'll deliver his main convention speech from the same location on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks on the South Lawn of the White House, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, on July 4. He'll deliver his main convention speech from the same location on Thursday. The last three American presidents all won reelection, and they all knew voters would reward them, not for their accomplishments, but for their future plans. Bill Clinton promised to build a \"bridge to the 21st century\" in 1996. George W. Bush offered safety and prosperity in 2004, built on conservative economic and national security policies. For Barack Obama in 2012, it was all about protecting the middle class as the country continued recovering from the Great Recession. At this week's Republican National Convention, President Trump will get a chance to not only remind voters why he thinks Joe Biden would be a disaster in the White House, but also lay out his own vision for the future. So far, he hasn't been very specific about what it is. Like most incumbents, the president's second-term agenda would be a continuation of his first, and Trump wants to rewind to the moment right before the pandemic began when he says the economy was the best in history. Vice President Mike Pence has doubled down on the back to the future vision as he punctuates speeches with a familiar tagline: \"We are going to make America great again, again.\" When Trump does talk about it, it's always superlative. At a press conference earlier this month, he said, \"If stupid people aren't elected next year, we're going to have one of the greatest years we've ever had.\" \"It is remarkable how little he has talked about what a second Trump term would look like,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. \"It's a totally blank slate right now, which is really unusual for anyone running for president, let alone somebody who's been there for four years.\" The Trump campaign insists that will change at the convention. \"The president certainly has a very powerful and forward-looking agenda for the future,\" said Steve Cortes, senior adviser for strategy with the Trump campaign. \"And President Trump believes ... he has the track record to prove that he knows how to create the conditions for a soaring economy, particularly for working-class Americans.\" The heart of the agenda, according to Cortes, is economic nationalism \u2014 rebuilding prosperity through more deregulation, more tax cuts and more \"America first\" trade deals. But Cortes acknowledged that Trump doesn't always focus on those goals. \"He says a heck of a lot. So sure, at times he's made the case better than other times,\" he said. \"As far as messaging, though, that's incumbent upon me and my colleagues at the campaign to do our job of messaging it to the American people and convincing the president to really stay on message.\" It's not every day that a top campaign official admits his candidate is undisciplined, but that's just who Trump is. His economic agenda is mainly a mainstream conservative one, but it gets overshadowed by the rest of his rhetoric, including racist appeals around Confederate monuments, attacks on immigrants and low-income housing and an embrace of wacky conspiracy theories. \"He is defined in some ways by all of the stylistic critiques that people have of him personally: confrontations, saying whatever's on your mind, tweeting it at all times of the day,\" said Republican strategist Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" said Holmes. \"On the one hand, you don't get into the deeper policy issues that I think would have wide appeal across the American electorate. But on the other hand, he talks about whatever it is that he wants to talk about every day.\" And that's for better or for worse, according to Holmes. Marc Thiessen, a former George W. Bush speechwriter, disagrees and says Trump's core supporters have no trouble understanding what the vision is, and it's exactly what got him elected in 2016. \"His vision is to finally deliver for the forgotten Americans. The Democrats took them for granted and the Republicans ignored them, and Donald Trump came in and said, 'I'm going to fight for them,' \" Thiessen said. \"They said, 'Yeah, we're hurting in this trade war with China, and we're hurting because of the pandemic. He hasn't brought the jobs back, but he's fighting for us. And I get what he's doing, and we want to reelect him.' So he's got that loyal base because it's the first time they feel that anybody in Washington is speaking for them.\" That fierce devotion explains one of the mysteries of this campaign: With more than 175,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic and unemployment above 10%, Trump's approval ratings have not collapsed. Still, Trump's base alone isn't big enough to win the election, and this week is his chance to expand it, according to Conant. \"What he really needs to do is lay out a compelling agenda for the second term that can bring in people who don't like his tweets, don't like the way he's handled the pandemic, but do like what he's outlining he would do in a second term, especially compared to a more liberal vision coming from Joe Biden,\" he said.

For former Vice President Joe Biden, foreign policy isn't primarily about position papers, global summits or treaties. It's about personal connections, forged over long and repeated face-to-face meetings. Listen to Biden talk about foreign policy on the campaign trail and you hear him come back to the same theme, over and over. \"I've met every major world leader in the last 35 years \u2014 not because I'm important, but because of the nature of my job,\" he told a crowd in Sparks, Nev., back in January, before in-person campaigning was halted. During that event, Biden spoke at length about how he'd deal with the rest of the world, if elected president. And he touted some of those personal relationships. Russian President Vladimir Putin? \"He knows I know him. I've spent a lot of time with him.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping? \"I've traveled 17,000 miles with him.\" \"I always would kid [former President Barack Obama] \u2014 I'd say all politics is personal, particularly international relations,\" Biden explained in Sparks. \"You've got to know the other man or woman's soul, and who they are, and make sure they know you.\" So it's deeply ironic, then, that as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns for the presidency on a foreign policy platform that's focused on reengaging with allies the Trump administration has repeatedly alienated, his go-to approach to diplomacy is likely off the table, at least in the short term. The coronavirus pandemic has made big international summits nearly impossible. The same goes for extended meetings, dinners or most other scenarios where a President Biden could sit down with other heads of government and forge the relationships he sees as so key to reaching agreements with other nations. \"For sure, his ability to connect with other world leaders \u2014 the focus that he puts on understanding where they're coming from, what their constraints are, what their options are, so that he can effectively negotiate on behalf of the United States \u2014 that does benefit tremendously from being able to be in the same place,\" conceded Tony Blinken, who has been Biden's top foreign policy adviser for decades and would likely play a key role in a Biden administration. But just as a candidate who thrives on one-on-one, in-person interactions with voters has figured out how to campaign during a pandemic, Blinken is confident Biden could carry out long-distance diplomacy. \"You know, I've spent a lot of time with him over the years conducting diplomacy by telephone,\" Blinken said. \"Conducting, now, it will have to be by Zoom or the equivalent. And it's doable. Is it as good? No. But is it doable, is it necessary? Yes.\" Blinken's view is not universally held, however. \"I don't think the inability to get in an airplane and meet face to face changes things fundamentally,\" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Haass, who recently authored a book called The World, has known and worked with Biden for years and understands how much the former vice president values face time. But, Haass argued, other countries aren't thinking about charm. \"What they're going to care about is not the toasts after dinner,\" he said. \"They're going to care about the substance of the foreign policy coming from them.\" Biden's to-do list On that front, there's a lot on Biden's to-do list for other countries to consider. First and foremost on both the domestic and international front, said Blinken, is dealing with the coronavirus. \"If we're fortunate, there will be a vaccine. But then it's got to be manufactured. It's got to be distributed. And if there's no vaccine, it's going to be testing, tracing, stockpile, safety standards,\" he said. Biden laid out his foreign policy agenda in a prepandemic speech a year ago in New York City. A big part of it, as Biden sees things: doing cleanup work after four years of President Trump. \"Donald Trump's brand of 'America First' has too often led to America alone, making it much harder to mobilize others to address the threats to our common well being,\" Biden said then. Biden has said he'll prioritize repairing the relationships Trump has frayed \u2014 especially with NATO allies. He'd also reenter and rework the international agreements at the heart of the Obama administration's foreign policy, which Trump has since withdrawn from: the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Biden has also vowed to confront the global rise of authoritarianism he and many Democrats have long argued Trump and his policies have helped enable. \"Trust in institutions around the world is down, and fear of the other is way up,\" Biden said last year. \"Together, in my view, these forces have driven dangerous resurgences of extreme nationalism and illiberalism, of protectionism and xenophobia. And Donald Trump and demagogues around the world are leaning into these forces.\" China: \"the most important relationship\" While the coronavirus pandemic has upended domestic politics, Haass argues it hasn't fundamentally changed the trajectory of any of those big challenges, at least in a substantial way. China, Haass said, \"is the most important relationship of this era. It was already deteriorating before the pandemic. This deterioration has simply continued, or in some ways accelerated. It might have happened anyhow.\" Whether Biden or Trump is in the White House next year, China will likely play an outsized role in foreign policy. Tension between the two countries is at a high point, as the U.S. and China order each other to close consulates, expel or limit reporters and state employees from each other's countries, and as China has cracked down on political expression in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Trump and many congressional Republicans have repeatedly blamed China for losing control of the coronavirus, which originated in its Wuhan province, and letting it spread around the world. Meanwhile, both the Biden and Trump campaigns have seized on U.S.-China relations as a campaign issue, and each is running ads framing the other candidate as the one who's \"softer\" on China. Over the course of the campaign, Biden has repeatedly emphasized that as vice president, he was tapped by the Obama administration to meet frequently with Xi and establish a working relationship with the emerging world leader. \"I've spent more time with Xi Jinping, at least before [the Obama administration] got out, than any world leader has,\" he told Nevada Democrats in January. But in a world without a COVID-19 vaccine, Biden would most likely be blocked from what would otherwise be a natural move: once again meeting directly with Xi, either in the U.S. or China, to begin addressing the two nations' growing tension points. Biden would also likely have to abandon plans for the two international summits he had planned on convening in the U.S. early on in his possible administration. One would focus on strengthening democracy and pushing back on authoritarianism, and the other would tackle climate change. Neither seems likely until a vaccine is developed and globally distributed. Still, Blinken says one way or another, a President Biden would be engaging with other world leaders. \"The United States has to show up again, has to be present again. And whether that's virtually in the first instance and eventually in person remains to be seen. But we have to get back in the game,\" he said.",

Updated at 4:52 p.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, laid out a key plank of his economic agenda for the country \u2014 dubbed \"Build Back Better\" \u2014 in a half-hour speech Thursday, offering a competing vision of economic nationalism that President Trump has trumpeted in recent years. \"The truth is throughout this [coronavirus] crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market \u2014 the Dow and Nasdaq \u2014 not you, not your families,\" Biden said during his remarks Thursday afternoon in Dunmore, Pa., near his hometown of Scranton. \"If I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, I'll be laser-focused on working families, the middle-class families that I came from.\" Biden's economic plans to date have focused on immediate relief for families, small businesses and communities struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the proposal he detailed Thursday centered around manufacturing and innovation. He outlined an agenda to \"Buy American,\" which includes a $700 billion investment in procurement and research and development for new technologies such as biotech, clean energy and artificial intelligence. \"This will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II,\" Biden said. His campaign posits the new plan will help create 5 million new jobs. \"I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past,\" Biden said, adding that he believes the future should be \"made in America, all in America.\" And when the federal government spends taxpayer dollars, Biden said, the focus should be on buying American products that would support American jobs. He said as president, he would intend to focus on rules that would help make that happen. Biden also reiterated his plan to boost the corporate tax rate back up, to 28%, after Republican tax cuts in 2017 lowered the rate to 21%. \"The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income tax will be over,\" he said. In recent weeks Biden has insisted that his economic agenda will do more than simply respond to Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and the economic side effects of the pandemic. \"Folks, it's not sufficient to build back, we have to build back better,\" Biden said Thursday. \"That's why my plan is to build back better.\" Earlier this week, Biden spoke about the need to onshore more American goods \u2014 specifically vital medical equipment and pharmaceuticals \u2014 so that the United States would be better equipped to deal with future crises without relying on importing critical goods from China or elsewhere. That's an issue Trump has also stressed, with his \"America First\" economic and trade policies. Trump's reelection campaign on Thursday harshly criticized Biden's record. \"We don't need to guess what a Biden economy would look like since Americans have been forced to live through it once already,\" Hogan Gidley, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, said in a statement. \"Biden's policies caused the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, anemic job growth, and depressed wages for the workers left.\" Also speaking about the economy in Pennsylvania on Thursday was Vice President Pence, underscoring the importance of the state as a presidential battleground. Biden's speech Thursday was the first in a series of planned rollouts in the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. Biden said he'll announce plans around infrastructure and clean energy next week. And in the coming weeks, he also intends to address, child care and racial inequality. On Wednesday, Biden's \"unity task forces\" with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont released a 110-page policy wish list of recommendations for the former vice president that included plans for universal pre-K and 12 weeks of paid family leave. The effort was the result of six joint task forces appointed by Biden and Sanders in May.",

The group \u2014 43 Alumni for Biden, a reference to Bush, the 43rd president \u2014 described its formation as an effort to restore \"the principles of unity, tolerance and compassion to the greatest elected office in the world.\" \"For four years, we have watched with grave concern as the party we loved has morphed into a cult of personality that little resembles the party of Lincoln and Reagan,\" said Karen Kirksey, the group's director. \"We endorse Joe Biden not necessarily in full support of his political agenda but rather in full agreement with the urgent need to restore the soul of this nation. Once elected, we look forward to working in a bipartisan way through civil, spirited debate on the many important issues facing Americans today and for decades to come.\" The group, consisting of hundreds of former Bush officials, is the latest effort by establishment Republicans to reject the leadership of President Trump, who sailed to the presidency in the 2016 election on a blistering, divisive campaign centered on nationalism and a rejection of the politically correct. The Nov. 3 faceoff between Trump and Biden will be a referendum on both the policies and the posture that Trump has brought to American politics over the last several years. Issues including the faltering U.S. economy, the coronavirus pandemic and the administration's response to it, as well as climate change, are all expected to play heavily into voters' considerations. By announcing its formation on July 1, the group will effectively avoid disclosing its donors until mid-October, less than three weeks before the election. Had it announced the day before, it would have had to file a list of donors with the Federal Election Commission by mid-July. Brett Neely contributed to this report.",

Steve King faced criticism for his comments on abortion, including when he questioned whether there would be \"any population of the world left\" if not for births due to rape and incest.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Steve King faced criticism for his comments on abortion, including when he questioned whether there would be \"any population of the world left\" if not for births due to rape and incest. Updated at 8:17 a.m. ET After years of racist comments that lost him the support of many Republican Party leaders, conservative Iowa Rep. Steve King has lost his bid for reelection to a primary challenge by GOP state Sen. Randy Feenstra. \"I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support over the past 17 months that made tonight possible and I thank Congressman King for his decades of public service,\" Feenstra said in a statement. \"As we turn to the general election, I will remain focused on my plans to deliver results for the families, farmers and communities of Iowa. But first, we must make sure this seat doesn't land in the hands of Nancy Pelosi and her liberal allies in Congress. Tomorrow, we get back to work.\" First elected in 2002, King faced the toughest primary campaign of his career in Iowa's 4th Congressional District, trailing in the polls with a limited cash supply and minimal advertising. He faced an onslaught of challengers feeding off of his vulnerability because of his inflammatory rhetoric. His primary opponents focused on an argument that King is unable to effectively represent the interests of his constituents since being stripped of House committee assignments last year, rather than focusing on his history of controversial statements that included racist language and comments on abortion and immigration. Loading... \"The 4th District needs a seat at the table, an effective conservative voice,\" stressed Feenstra in a May debate hosted by WHO-TV. Feenstra represented the most likely threat to King's reelection, raising $925,849 this cycle, compared with King's $330,000, according to the Center For Responsive Politics. Also challenging King were former Irwin Mayor Bret Richards, former state representative and Woodbury County supervisor Jeremy Taylor, and real estate developer Steve Reeder. All had similar platforms: opposing abortion rights, securing the Southern U.S. border and supporting gun owners' views of the Second Amendment. The writing may have been on the wall for King, whom President Trump once dubbed \"the world's most conservative human being.\" In his last general election, he scraped by with a margin of just 3 percentage points in his bright red district against Democrat J.D. Scholten, a paralegal and former minor league baseball pitcher. Scholten's progress at nearly flipping the northwest district, which is home to Sioux City and Ames, prompted this crowded Republican primary with challengers painting King, 71, as ineffective and offering themselves up as a viable conservative alternative without the reputation of being a toxic thorn in the GOP's side. Scholten is returning for a second swing at the seat this year and ended up without any competition in the Democratic primary. Not only did Feenstra raise more than King in the first quarter, he also garnered the high-profile endorsements of former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The latter released an ad criticizing King for inaction. \"When we've needed him most, Steve King has let us down. He got kicked off the agriculture committee, hurting our farmers, and hasn't written a single farming bill that passed Congress,\" the ad proclaimed. Many top Iowa Republicans have abandoned King this cycle, seeing it as an unnecessary risk to maintaining control of the district, with King's controversial record considered a distraction to the conservative cause and a possible threat to the reelection of Sen. Joni Ernst. Last year, King wondered out loud to The New York Times why \"white nationalist\" and \"white supremacist\" are considered offensive terms. King was widely rebuked by party leadership and stripped from key committee assignments, including his place on the House Agriculture Committee, a panel of particular importance to his home state. King did support a House resolution condemning his comments that was passed nearly unanimously in 2019. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who rarely wades into actions by House Republicans, released a statement at the time calling King's statements \"unworthy of his elected position.\" \"If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work,\" McConnell wrote. King issued a public statement shortly after the interview was published, defending himself by saying that he wasn't an advocate for white nationalism but rather that he supports \"western civilization's values.\" It hardly marked the first time his explosive comments made the news. In 2008, he said terrorists would \"be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11\" if Barack Obama were elected president. He has also made incendiary comments on multiculturalism, immigration and abortion, falsely expressing skepticism that a woman could get pregnant as a result of rape or incest.",

Both are now pushing hard for a vaccine. The United States has already agreed to pay a drug company more than $1 billion to produce a vaccine that's yet to be approved. Xi says if China succeeds in developing a vaccine, it will be declared \"a global public good.\" The race to defeat the coronavirus can be viewed in two very distinct ways. One is based on international cooperation, with a vaccine treated as a \"global public good.\" The other is competitive, a battle between nations that's being described as \"vaccine nationalism.\" Many are hoping for the former, but are seeing signs of the latter. The main competition, on this and many other global issues, appears to be between the United States and China. Both President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping have faced criticism for their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Success with a vaccine at home could make up for the earlier shortcomings. \"We're about to have an unprecedented battle over access to the vaccines, which will be far more challenging if we're in a U.S.-versus-China Cold War environment,\" said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. Trump's Operation Warp Speed is designed to develop a COVID-19 vaccine for Americans as soon as possible, and with an eye on the November presidential election. Last week, the U.S. government announced it was paying up to $1.2 billion to the drugmaker AstraZeneca to start work on a vaccine that could be ready as early as October, though there's not yet a vaccine that's been proved to be safe and effective. China's line Meanwhile, China's Xi has adopted a somewhat softer public line that some are describing as \"vaccine diplomacy.\" Xi says China will spend $2 billion to help developing countries. China also is among dozens of countries that have signed on to a resolution by member states of the World Health Organization that says a vaccine should be treated as a \"global public good\" to be distributed widely, fairly and cheaply. China faced global condemnation for its early efforts to downplay the severity of the virus and has sought to rewrite the narrative by promoting its efforts to find a vaccine and assist other countries. China is making a major push to develop a vaccine at home and has at least four trials underway. Xi wants China to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century, including biopharmaceuticals. If China became the first to develop a vaccine, it would consider it a huge victory. However, some U.S. national security officials say the Chinese efforts include attempts to hack into American and other Western drug companies to steal valuable research information. \"We have the full expectation that China will do everything in their power to obtain any viable research that we are conducting here in the U.S.,\" said Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. \"That will be in line with their capabilities and intent the last decade plus, and we are expecting them to continue to do so.\" Global pandemic, global solution While one country, or one company, may take the lead when it comes to a vaccine, the worldwide nature of the problem points to the need for a truly global solution, according to those in the international health community. For example, AstraZeneca, which is getting the U.S. government funding, is a Swedish-British firm, which is hoping to produce vaccines based on promising research conducted at Oxford University in Britain. AstraZeneca, like all the major Western pharmaceutical companies, has offices and manufacturing plants spread around the globe. Many players in many countries are likely to be involved. But it takes time to ramp up vaccine production, and this points to a crucial question: In a world of more than 7 billion people, who's at the front of the line, and who's at the back? \"The challenge is going to come in the first year in terms of capacity, combined with disagreements about who should be first, second and third in line,\" said Nancy Kass, professor of bioethics and public health at Johns Hopkins University. New drugs and vaccines traditionally go first to the wealthiest countries, and that's the expectation in this case as well. But the exact order could depend on where the vaccine is first developed. The U.S. and China could have very different priorities on how to distribute a vaccine.

Countries and companies are racing to find a vaccine with some describing the competition as \"vaccine nationalism.\" Rich countries have been hit hardest by the virus so far. But in many of these nations, COVID-19 cases are leveling off or declining, while they are rising rapidly in the developing world, including countries such as India, Brazil and Peru. Assessing needs Global health organizations are working on plans with a focus on poorer nations. Kate Elder of Doctors Without Borders says her organization often faces challenges in dealing with Western pharmaceutical companies that have tremendous leverage because they are the only one, or one of just a few, that make a critical drug. \"We can design things as a global community,\" she said. \"But ultimately, since the power is in the pharmaceutical corporation's hands to make those decisions, it's up to them. At what scale they produce these vaccines, at what price they set them, and who are the first customers that they'll cater to.\" Because the demand for a new vaccine will be so great, nations, political leaders and drug companies are likely to face a range of conflicting pressures. They will need to provide the vaccine at home but will also face intense scrutiny to share it widely, fairly and cheaply abroad. \"It's set up to be a massive geopolitical battle,\" said Bremmer, of the Eurasia Group. \"Not just around the discovery of the vaccine, but the manufacturing chain \u2014 with billions of doses needed, and the challenges of a global vaccination campaign.\" Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent.

Russia's trolling specialists have evolved their disinformation and agitation techniques to become subtler and tougher to track, according to new research unveiled on Thursday. A cache of Instagram posts captured by researchers showed that the Russians were \"better at impersonating candidates\" and that influence-mongers \"have moved away from creating their own fake advocacy groups to mimicking and appropriating the names of actual American groups,\" wrote Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin professor who analyzed the material with her team. Kim, who is also affiliated with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, discussed the analysis in a new report that also included images of some of the posts. Kim and her team identified 32 Instagram accounts they said appeared to be linked to Russia's now-infamous Internet Research Agency, of which 31 later were confirmed to be IRA-linked by an analysis commissioned by Facebook, which owns Instagram. The material was taken down, but Kim's team has saved it and studied it. Kim's report followed warnings this week, ahead of voting on Super Tuesday, that foreign actors are continuing to try to influence voters in the United States. Law enforcement and intelligence officials told reporters that they didn't detect any big spike in activity but acknowledged that interference activity endures at a steady state. Kim's report examines that at an atomic level and confirms that the efforts targeting the 2020 vote continue many of the trends exhibited earlier. What her research did not establish was the degree to which the material was intended to help a specific candidate; there doesn't appear to have been enough to draw a solid conclusion. Russian influence operations are aimed at sowing chaos and amplifying division as much as bringing about a specific political result, national security officials say. Astroturf To that end, influence specialists posed as American grassroots or community activists and targeted populations with the intent to divide them or convince them not to vote, Kim wrote. \"The IRA is well-versed enough in the history and culture of our politics to exploit sharp political divisions already existing in our society,\" Kim wrote. \"American nationalism/patriotism, immigration, gun control and LGBT issues were the top five issues frequently discussed in the IRA's campaigns.\" Veterans, working-class whites in rural areas and nonwhites, \"especially African Americans,\" also were especially targeted, according to the report. And: \"One notable trend is the increase in the discussion of feminism at both ends of the spectrum.\" Kim's findings about the posts' focus on nonwhites tracks with earlier findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, both of which documented clear attempts by Russian influence-mongers specifically to divide blacks or dissuade them from voting. Kim's findings also suggested a level of political sophistication about the operations she analyzed: The accounts targeted battleground states, including those expected to be critical in 2020, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. Move versus countermove For as much continuity as Kim's research uncovered about more recent influence operations, the overall game is different from 2016. National security officials and social media platforms are working in real time to monitor and counter election interference in a way they didn't during the last presidential race. Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, acknowledged to NPR this week that the service was caught \"flat-footed\" last time and that this is why it's being more active for the 2020 race. At the same time, however, Roth said technical aspects of the influence operations are changing too. Twitter today traces very few election-interference posts to Russia, he said. And in 2018 the goal was, in effect, meta-influence: Specialists tried to create the impression that more interference was happening than actually was. \"We saw activity that we believe to have been connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency that was specifically targeting journalists in an attempt to convince them that there had been large-scale activity on the platform that didn't actually happen,\" Roth told NPR. Thirteen Russians and three Russian entities, including the IRA, were indicted in 2018 as part of the Justice Department's investigation into the interference of 2016.",

The site is where the army of the king of Scots, Robert the Bruce, defeated the army of England's King Edward II in 1314 in the First War of Scottish Independence. At the Scottish National Party's recent annual conference, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, said she had \"never been so certain\" that Scotland would become an independent nation. \"Who do we want to be in the driving seat of shaping Scotland's future?\" she asked. \"The Scottish government has not got everything right, far from it. But I doubt there are many people in Scotland who would have wanted Westminster to be more in charge of our pandemic response.\" Sturgeon was referring to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to the coronavirus, which has included a botched testing plan and repeated policy U-turns. With more than 63,000 deaths, the U.K. has the highest toll in Europe. Johnson's performance is one reason why the last 15 polls show that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 most Scots consistently support leaving the United Kingdom. A poll in October found 58% of likely voters backed an independent Scotland. That is a big shift from 2014 when voters easily defeated a referendum on independence by 55% to 45%. As regional parliamentary elections loom in May, Sturgeon's Scottish National Party is running on a platform of holding a second independence referendum. If the party does well \u2014 as expected \u2014 it will claim those results as a mandate and press the British government for a second vote. Johnson has repeatedly rejected the idea. He says Scotland already had its chance in 2014 and the United Kingdom must stick together to fight the pandemic. \"This is not the moment, frankly, for division or distraction about our national constitution,\" Johnson said early this fall. \"In order for us to tackle the shared and common thread that is COVID-19, the focus on separation has got to stop.\" Scotland and England have a long and bitter history, and they've fought dozens of battles over the centuries. Scotland eventually joined England in 1707, in part to profit from its colonial expansion. But some of the economic rationale that drove the relationship faded in the 20th century after Britain lost its empire in the wake of World War II. \"You're starting to see the economic benefits of union becoming less clear at a time when the British state was intruding,\" historian Fiona Watson says. \"These combined to see the beginnings, I think, of political Scottish nationalism.\" With many disappointed in the U.K.'s COVID-19 response, that nationalism is solidifying. Distrust of Boris Johnson Since April, when the U.K. was a few weeks into its first lockdown, Johnson's overall approval rating plummeted from 66% to 34%, according to YouGov, the polling firm. Johnson is a populist cheerleader; his many critics say he doesn't focus on details. Many Scots, as well as others in United Kingdom, think he's poorly suited to handle the pandemic. Johnson himself fell gravely ill in the spring, just weeks after visiting coronavirus patients in a hospital, where he boasted that he'd shaken hands \"with everybody.\" \"He's a buffoon,\" says Sandy Comfort, a retired lawyer in Kingussie, a town in the Scottish Highlands. \"Totally out of his depth. He's only in it purely for the power.\" Farzana Haq, a pharmacist who lives in Dunfermline, northwest of Edinburgh, says she thinks Johnson is a hypocrite. She cites the prime minister's refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his then-chief adviser, after Cummings drove across England while infected with COVID-19 in March in violation of a national lockdown. \"We've been following the rules up here,\" says Haq, who voted against independence in 2014 but says she will vote for it if she gets another chance. \"It was heartbreaking for a lot of people when they learned that they could have just jumped in the car and driven to their parents' house.\" Last month, Johnson finally pushed Cummings out for other reasons, but the damage to public trust was done. While many Scots are critical of Johnson, they have a far more favorable opinion of Sturgeon, the leading voice for independence. In an Ipsos-MORI poll last month, 74% said Sturgeon had handled the pandemic well, while 62% thought Johnson had handled it badly. Under Sturgeon, Scotland did make mistakes during the crisis. For instance, Scottish hospitals transferred dozens of coronavirus-positive patients back into nursing homes, already hard hit by the virus. But many Scots, including Haq, gave Sturgeon high marks for what they say is clear and transparent communication. \"She's prepared to come up and stand in front of journalists and take questions every day, and she's prepared to put her hands up when there's a mistake,\" Haq says. The Brexit factor Concerns over Johnson's handling of the pandemic are only the most recent factor driving support for Scottish independence. Another is Brexit, the issue that has dominated British politics for the past 4 1/2 years. Many in Scotland feel betrayed by Johnson, the country's Brexiteer in chief, and his Conservative Party. Consider John Craig, who runs the student union at Glasgow's Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The 24-year-old alto saxophone player voted to stay in the U.K. in 2014. He opposed independence because it would have meant leaving the European Union and all the rich educational and performing opportunities it offered musicians like him. Anti-independence campaigners assured Scotland's voters the U.K. wouldn't hold a nationwide referendum on EU membership. But two years later, in 2016, the U.K. did just that. Nearly two-thirds of Scots voted to stay in the EU. But England \u2014 which is 11 times more populous than Scotland \u2014 backed leaving, easily outvoting its neighbor to the north. \"I hate admitting I felt tricked, but absolutely, I definitely felt tricked,\" Craig says. Citing the recent polls, Craig says he's furious with Johnson for refusing even to consider a second independence referendum for Scotland. \"I feel like my democratic right is being blocked within my own country,\" Craig says. \"I have a democratic right to ask for Scottish independence. I feel like I'm ignored as a citizen in the U.K.\" There are financial advantages for Scotland to stick with the United Kingdom. For instance, when the coronavirus hit, the U.K. guaranteed Scotland an additional $8.5 billion in funding. \"I don't want independence,\" says Alex Jamieson, a retired police officer from Glasgow. \"I think we're better together. If we'd [have been] independent when this epidemic happened, we wouldn't have the money ... to get ourselves through it.\" Even so, surveys show that Great Britain is straining at the seams. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted against Brexit. In the past year, polls have shown solid support in Northern Ireland for reuniting with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. Discontent is even rising in Wales. A YouGov poll in October found nearly 1 in 4 people would vote for Welsh independence, up by 8% since 2016. \"The strongest argument for the union was always it's what you know, it's stable, it's prosperous, whatever its faults, the U.K. works,\" says Richard Wyn Jones, director of Cardiff University's Wales Governance, who focuses on nationalism and the political dynamics of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. Brexit, he says, \"throws all of that under the bus. Everything is now unstable.\" In May, political attention will focus on Scotland's parliamentary elections. Even if the Scottish National Party does well, analysts expect Johnson will continue to resist another independence referendum. But Ailsa Henderson, a professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh, wonders how long the national government in London can ignore the popular will. \"It's very difficult if you're saying to an electorate how you express yourself peacefully and democratically at the ballot box, no matter what you say, it won't matter,\" Henderson says. NPR's London producer Jessica Beck contributed to this report.",

The moderator was polite enough not to make it Question 1. But, oh, it was coming. This face-off in Hailey, Idaho, wasn't a typical debate night. Beforehand, incumbent state Sen. Michelle Stennett, a Democrat, had sought assurances for her safety, fearing riled-up supporters of her Republican opponent, Eric Parker. He, in turn, posted guards outside to avoid a ruckus like the one at a recent GOP picnic. That time, a heckler interrupted Parker's speech to call him a domestic terrorist. The precautions all go back to what Parker calls \"the elephant in the room\" in his bid for state office, namely that federal authorities consider him an anti-government extremist who belongs in prison. Instead, Parker beat felony charges twice, now leads one of the best-known militia groups in the mountain region, and is on the ballot in a rare purple district in bright-red Idaho. Idaho state Sen.

Parker, in a navy suit with his long hair tied back, listened with a slight smirk, then started his answer with a correction: \"It was 2014.\" Six years ago, during the armed standoff in Bunkerville, Nev., Parker, then a 30-year-old electrician, stood on a bridge along with other right-wing supporters of the local Bundy family's fight with the government over grazing rights. Below, in a dry riverbed, heavily armed authorities watched the demonstrators. As tensions rose, Parker dropped to his belly, stuck his rifle through a gap in a concrete barrier and leveled his weapon at the officers.

That life-or-death moment on the bridge was captured in a photo that's been described as the most iconic image of the anti-government movement in the past 20 years. Prosecutors and much of America took one look at Parker prone with a semiautomatic rifle and saw an act of domestic terrorism. To the far-right \"patriot movement,\" however, Parker was an antihero, a legend. The bridge photo appeared on T-shirts and in memes with captions such as, \"You give peace a chance. I'll cover you.\" From Longreads and Oregon Public Broadcasting, \"Bundyville\" is a seven-part series chronicling the rise, fall and resurgence of the Bundy family, the armed uprisings they inspired and the fight over the future of the American West. The mythos was cemented when the government's prosecution of Parker collapsed in 2018, with two federal trials culminating in a plea agreement on a single misdemeanor; a raft of felonies vanished. The infamous \"Bundy ranch sniper\" walked, emerging from lockup with the swagger of a man who faced 100 years in prison and instead got a second act. At the debate Sept. 17, Parker reminded Idaho voters that he is guilty only of a misdemeanor obstruction charge, \"the same as jaywalking.\" He said he'd take two more to stand up for the First Amendment. Parker pledged to follow the law but then added a little wiggle room. \"An unjust law is an illegal law per the Constitution,\" he told the audience. For the past year, NPR has followed Parker's political evolution as he joins a wave of patriot movement figures seeking \u2013 and sometimes winning \u2013 public office. These days, the guy in the photo with a rifle is the guest of honor at a fundraiser at the lieutenant governor's house, accepting a check from the state GOP chairman.

But Parker's attempt to straddle two worlds is becoming increasingly complicated. The far-right militia threat has emerged as a feature of this election season, with warnings of voter intimidation, violent clashes at statehouses and protests, and an alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. If it was hard for Parker to shed the \"domestic extremist\" label before, it's now impossible. As part of its efforts to curb militia-style organizing, Facebook recently wiped out accounts associated with Parker, his campaign and his group, the Real 3%ers Idaho. Parker, incensed, likened the ban to \"communist China.\" \"We've had to kind of completely change the way we do things because of the Facebook censorship,\" he said. Meanwhile, Parker is taking heat from within the militia movement, too. In July, Idaho County authorities invited the Real 3%ers Idaho to look at evidence in hopes of preventing unrest over a deputy's shooting of a far-right activist, Sean Anderson, in a traffic stop. After Parker's group reviewed video and a 911 call, he issued a statement affirming that the shooting appeared justifiable under the circumstances. Some right-wing activists saw this as a betrayal. They held a rally where, according to The Lewiston Tribune, Anderson's wife ripped up the 3%ers' statement and said of Parker: \"How dare you elevate yourself to see that information before me.\" Parker said he won't be cowed into groupthink. He considers himself a true-blue \"constitutionalist,\" a holdout against the overt white nationalism that has crept into other patriot factions. Parker said he's already kicked out several members, some for racism and some for going to \"fight antifa\" in Portland, Ore. \"We don't do 'Gangs of New York' in my organization.\" When asked about rumors that he's Latino, Parker said he has Hispanic and Irish ancestry but that he loathes \"identity politics\" and writes in \"American\" on forms that list racial categories. He said his opposition to white nationalists is about his principles, not his background.

In the black-clad antifa activists, he said, he recalls his days as a mohawk-wearing youth scrapping with neo-Nazis on the streets of Phoenix. Inked on the same arm as a big 3%er logo is a vestige of his punk phase: a Black Flag tattoo. Similarly, he rejects the blanket labeling of Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization (\"Welcome to the club!\"). He said the police killing of George Floyd was indefensible, and he acknowledges systemic racial inequalities. But he repeated right-wing chestnuts about \"looters and rioters\" taking over the protests. Parker said his second-in-command passed out 100 cheeseburgers at a Black Lives Matter event in Boise, along with a request for protesters to remain peaceful. \"If you're going to occupy and you're not going to leave, that's great. But if somebody is throwing a brick behind you, take them out,\" Parker said. \"Clean your own house. You have to.\" Isn't that a little rich coming from the guy whose idea of peaceful protest landed him on domestic terrorism lists? Parker meets with Idaho state Rep.

Dialogue, he said, is a hard sell in this combustible moment. Lines are hardening. There's little appetite for de-escalation. \"It's not a popular stance to say that we can affect change in the system. Most people don't believe that. Especially in the crowds we see. Everybody's pretty done with talking, if you were to ask them,\" Parker said. \"I think that means it's even more important that somebody's talking.\" Extremism analysts warn against viewing Parker as some kind of statesman of the anti-government world, saying it risks promoting the myth of a \"neutral\" or benign militia. Even if the Real 3%ers Idaho didn't participate as an organization, analysts note, members have been spotted among the armed demonstrators pushing their way into the state Capitol in Boise or joining a vigilante mob up north in Coeur d'Alene.

Parker doesn't dispute that his 3%ers have turned up at those events. He disapproves, he said, but his bigger concern is the off-camera threat, the unseen mobilizing he's hearing about in other parts of the state. Whispers of offensive operations in a movement that traditionally asserts itself as a defensive, patriotic force. He wouldn't divulge names or any details, but Parker said he's made personal pleas for restraint. \"Those groups out there I do not make excuses for,\" Parker said. \"I've literally tried to proactively take my own time to search out who's in charge and tell them, 'As the guy in the picture that holds some sort of sway, I guess, to listen, man, it's going to get crazy. And you have a responsibility.' \" After lockup, an opportunity At the Idaho Statehouse one Tuesday in January 2018, Republican state Rep. Dorothy Moon glimpsed a familiar face in the visitors' gallery. \"Mr. Speaker, I'd like to introduce Mr. Eric Parker,\" Moon said on the Capitol floor. Moon praised Parker for \"everything he's done for the citizens of Idaho and in Nevada.\" She and several other conservative lawmakers then applauded, according to video from Idaho public media, until the speaker said, \"House will be in order.\" Parker has become a regular visitor to the Idaho Statehouse since 2018 when he was released after serving 18 months in pretrial detention on federal charges.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Urquhart for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Parker has become a regular visitor to the Idaho Statehouse since 2018 when he was released after serving 18 months in pretrial detention on federal charges. Upstairs in the gallery that day, Parker was stunned by the welcome. He said it was his first inkling that his actions in Nevada \u2013 which made him radioactive in polite society \u2013 might yield political clout. He saw a path to legitimacy. Power. \"When I came home, I didn't go put on camouflage and start running around the woods practicing for some war,\" Parker said. \"I realized very quickly that policy and policymakers is where we affect real change.\" Parker's release coincided with a tumultuous era for Idaho's Three Percenters, named for the nationwide movement based on the debunked notion that just 3% of colonists fought in the American Revolution. Embezzlement accusations against a top leader led to the implosion of Idaho's biggest Three Percenter faction, which Parker was part of forming right after the 2014 standoff. By the time Parker emerged from his 18-month detention, he said, the Three Percenters had atomized into more than a dozen smaller groups fanned out across Idaho. With name recognition from the Bundy ranch and street cred for beating federal charges, Parker was uniquely positioned to lead a new era. \"After the acquittals, there was an opportunity for kind of a rebirth,\" Parker said.

Parker bristles at being called a paramilitary or militia leader; he sees it as overseeing a statewide network promoting \"self-reliance and civil defense.\" Rebranded as the Real 3%ers Idaho, the organization vacuumed up at least eight disparate armed groups across the state, amassing a paramilitary force that made extremism researchers take notice. His entry into politics earlier this year drew deeper concern. Even if Parker is a long-shot candidate against a popular, longtime incumbent, the experience gives his ideology a bigger platform, potentially drawing recruits through his boots-to-suits transformation. \"Over the past year, we've seen Eric Parker work to enter the mainstream in some ways. He sort of put down his camo, put on a suit and tie, he's running for office,\" said Lindsay Schubiner of the Western States Center, a Portland-based civil rights nonprofit that tracks militia activity in the region. No matter how measured the political speech, she said, there's always the implicit threat of violence. \"Parker is still the leader of an armed paramilitary movement that is not accountable to any civil or government authority,\" Schubiner said. \"That's incredibly dangerous.\" Parker listens with other members after a convoy protection training exercise in January.

Even if Parker is a long-shot candidate against a popular, five-term incumbent, the experience gives his ideology a bigger platform, potentially drawing recruits through his boots-to-suits transformation. Extremism analysts say Parker is representative of the nuances that often get lost in public discourse about \"militias,\" now a catchall term that runs the gamut from organized groups such as the Real 3%ers to pop-up bands of like-minded friends. In anything-goes 2020, Parker is not extreme enough for militia compatriots who are open to working with Proud Boys, white nationalists or the \"boogaloo bois\" calling for violent revolution. And among the old guard, there's wariness about the spotlight he draws to the movement, said Amy Cooter, a Vanderbilt University sociologist who studies right-wing militia groups and has interviewed members for years. \"A lot of those folks at least respect what he's trying to do, even if they don't always agree with how he goes about that or his public messaging,\" Cooter said. \"Sometimes they see it as a bad thing to have too much attention drawn to yourself that way. Sometimes they kind of construe it as somebody \u2013 again, using their words here \u2013 getting bigger than their britches.\" Behind the scenes, Parker said, the attention was no prize. His wife, Andrea, mother of their four children, lost her job because of his trials. When she'd drop the kids off at school, Parker said, other parents would gawk and whisper. For a while, Andrea pleaded with her husband to leave town and start over somewhere new. Parker said moments like the applause at the Capitol helped to convince her that they still had supporters. Not only were people listening, Parker reassured her, \"they were understanding.\" So, the family stayed put. \"It didn't click right away, but something started to form in my head. That we had an opportunity that we were either going to use or not use. And I hate passing opportunities,\" Parker said. \"We checked it out and we tried, and we saw how far we could get. We realized we could get pretty far.\" Parker the politician Parker hands out copies of the U.S. Constitution as he campaigns Sept. 18 at the Gooding Pro Rodeo in Gooding, Idaho.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Urquhart for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Parker hands out copies of the U.S. Constitution as he campaigns Sept. 18 at the Gooding Pro Rodeo in Gooding, Idaho. At dusk one recent Friday, hundreds of Idahoans, not a mask in sight, arrived for a big annual rodeo in rural Gooding County, a red part of the purple district Parker seeks to represent. \"Pocket Constitution?\" Parker asked families on the way in, handing out miniature copies. \"I'm running for state Senate. ...\" Months after insisting that his only political ideology was \"Three Percenter,\" here was Parker campaigning as a Republican, at an official Republican booth, to the consternation of some in the party who see him as a libertarian interloper. \"There's definitely people who will never be fans of mine,\" Parker said. \"They don't believe I'm really a Republican. Which is, you know, that's fair. I'm not like any other Republican.\" Tom Luna, chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, said he tells members who are skeptical about Parker to go talk to him to \"get their own comfort level.\" Luna said that's what he did, and he came away convinced that Parker wasn't a threat. He said the party \"would never support a domestic terrorist for office.\" \"In Idaho, the Republican Party is very diverse. As party chairman, my No. 1 goal and responsibility is party unity,\" Luna said. \"When we have a candidate that wins a primary, we support our candidates.\" Luna said he donated $500 to Parker's campaign; the state party gave him another $500. \"I personally gave money to Eric because I think he does have a future,\" Luna said. \"I think he can win that race, and I am personally comfortable with how he's explained his previous involvement and actions.\" Among Idaho Democrats, there was some surprise that Stennett, who's held the seat for a decade, would validate Parker's run by agreeing to debate him that evening in Hailey.

Stennett said she agreed to the debate because she's committed to serving all constituents. \"I don't feel like adding more fear or anger or vitriol to it de-escalates anything,\" Stennett said. \"So we walk in with our own truth and our own message. I'm not going to do this in a fearful fashion and have been given no evidence that I need to be.\" As for Parker's history, Stennett said politely, \"That's his to own, not mine to own.\" What critics don't get, Parker said, is that he's not ashamed of his conduct during the standoff. In fact, he's proud of it. He shrugs off politicians and reporters who want to \"go back to 2014.\" \"I haven't hidden it throughout the whole campaign. I lead with it,\" Parker said. \"I was indicted by the federal government. I do believe what I did was right. That's why I'm here.\" A flash of the firebrand Parker comes out when he's reminded that, no matter the legal outcome, everybody saw him with a gun on the bridge looking poised to shoot at federal agents.

Here, a nurse practitioner administers a dose of flu vaccine in Key Biscayne, Fla. Nine drug companies pledged Tuesday that they will not submit vaccine candidates for FDA review until their safety and efficacy is shown in large clinical trials. The move is intended to bolster public confidence amid the rush to make a COVID-19 vaccine widely available, and counter fears of political pressure to have a vaccine before the November presidential election. The CEOs of AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer are among those who signed the pledge to follow \"high ethical standards and sound scientific principles.\" All three companies are conducting large studies of potential vaccines for the disease that has killed nearly 200,000 people in the U.S. and nearly 900,000 worldwide. The other biopharmaceutical companies are Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Novavax, BioNTech and Sanofi. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in an interview on the Today show, called the pledge historic. \"With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are using to develop these vaccines and even more importantly the processes that will be used to evaluate the vaccines, we thought it was critical to come out and reiterate our commitment,\" Bourla said. The declaration comes one month after a survey found that only 2 in 5 people in the U.S. said they planned to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if and when a vaccine becomes available. That YouGov survey found that a third of Americans were unsure whether they would get the vaccine. On Sunday, President Trump told a White House news conference that a \"very safe and very effective\" vaccine is \"going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told states last week to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as soon as late October. But in an interview with NPR, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to the Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, called it \"extremely unlikely\" that a vaccine will be ready by then. \"There is a very, very low chance that the trials that are running as we speak\" could be ready before the end of October, Slaoui said. \"And therefore, there could be \u2014 if all other conditions required for an Emergency Use Authorization are met \u2014 an approval. I think it's extremely unlikely but not impossible. And therefore, it's the right thing to do, to be prepared in case.\" Many top U.S. health officials, including infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have repeatedly said they hope that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready for distribution by early next year. Last month, President Trump cited a \"deep state\" conspiracy theory when he accused the Food and Drug Administration, without evidence, of stalling work on an answer to the global pandemic to hamper his reelection chances. \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,\" Trump stated via Twitter. \"Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!\" The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics.

As of Tuesday, more than 27.3 million coronavirus infections had been reported globally, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has reported 6.3 million cases, the most in the world. India is second, with nearly 4.3 million reported cases. The issue of vaccine availability has become a hot topic for global health experts such as WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has urged countries to resist \"vaccine nationalism\" and join the COVAX Global Vaccines Facility \u2014 an international agreement meant to ensure wide access to a COVID-19 vaccine. Last week, the Trump administration said the U.S. will not be part of that global pact. As part of their pledge, the nine drug companies also vowed \"to ensure a sufficient supply and range of vaccine options, including those suitable for global access.\"",

On two LPs and a single, This Heat, still reeling from the aftershocks of World War II, railed against nationalist dogmas, nuclear war and any view of humanity that might limit one's self-discovery. Operating under the credo \"All possible processes. All channels open. Twenty-four hour alert,\" This Heat mined dub and Dada, prog-rock and politics, tape manipulation and tempestuously heavy rock. It could be loud and mean, eerie and apocalyptic, funny and catchy. This Heat, 1979\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the artist\n                    \n                \nhide caption This Heat existed for less than seven years; the trio's very distinct personalities and penchant for endless debate steadily pulled it apart. Still, the group's extreme experimental impulses and magpie-like enthusiasm for disparate influences made this tiny catalog of music one of rock and roll's most low-key-influential. In fact, after LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy asks \"Have you seen my records?\" during his chronicle of cool, \"Losing My Edge,\" This Heat is the first band he namechecks, long before Scott Walker, Gil Scott-Heron, or even Lou Reed. This Heat helped facilitate the ever-widening scope of indie rock, and predicted some of the thornier paths electronic music would pursue. You can hear This Heat's tension in post-punk and art-rock, from Women to Stereolab to Deerhunter, their frisson in noise-rock, their fluidity within interconnected improvisational scenes. More than four decades later, This Heat's music still feels radically free, unlimited in the shapes it can take. As with so many foundational cult favorites, This Heat's records have sometimes been hard to find, prompting a string of pointedly timely reissues. The band offered its catalog on CD in 1991, while the Gulf War erupted and the Soviet Union collapsed. It arrived again as the box set Out of Cold Storage in 2006, in part because Hayward was devastated it wasn't more accessible after 9/11 \u2014 nations had returned to war \"to keep freedom's flag flying,\" just like he predicted on 1981's \"Cenotaph.\" Then, in early 2016, months before the Brexit vote and the subsequent election of Donald Trump, Seattle's Light in the Attic Records repressed much of This Heat's oeuvre into a definitive new vinyl edition. Those re-releases prompted a series of revelatory \"reunion\" shows under the name This Is Not This Heat, with ringers like Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor stepping in for the late Williams. Now, amid the casualties and doubts of a global pandemic and civic unrest in so many corners of the world, This Heat are finally putting their music on streaming services. \"There's a weird inevitability to This Heat \u2014 it comes back at the times it needs to come back,\" says Hayward, from his home in London. \"If we're going to be addressing the problems of the world through something that happened 40 years ago, now is another good time.\" This is an introduction to This Heat's small but mighty digitized discography, so rich it suggests new avenues of exploration even now. You can stream this playlist via Spotify. On two albums and an EP, there was revealed a vast landscape of musical possibilities. These six songs \u2014 some of the hits, if you will \u2014 put a frame around that range. \"Horizontal Hold\" Enormous, shout-out-loud choruses would soon become crucial to This Heat's compulsory weirdness, but not at the start. The band's first indispensable song, \"Horizontal Hold,\" is a wordless wonder, as heavy and lithe as it is unpredictable and relentless. Written in early 1976 in preparation for a second gig, the song took shape from a series of improvisations over a groove that, much to Williams' chagrin, Hayward wouldn't stop playing. \"Horizontal Hold\" begins with this lumbering rhythm, swinging with the same barbed maul as Led Zeppelin's far more famous \"Kashmir.\" This Heat continually interrupt the beat with an unexpectedly long rest here or a wobbly organ interlude there, a weaponized noise squall now or a corkscrew guitar solo later. In this moment of early inspiration, This Heat suggests some unsung dub rhythm section, sequestered inside a bizarro studio built beneath a funhouse. (For a bonus, listen to the extended version recorded for BBC DJ John Peel at Maida Vale a year later, where the bass feels like a bludgeon and tape manipulation redoubles the vertigo.) \"Music Like Escaping Gas\" (This Heat) This Heat never intended to write mere songs \u2014 a few chords buttressing verses and a chorus, lined up in a row. Instead, the three wrestled with conceptual frameworks, hoping to distill reflections on high art and hard society into something profound. \"Music Like Escaping Gas\" epitomizes this audacious process: The song combines a condensed take on a half-hour-long improvisation, a mutated chord from an earlier tune, a melody Hayward wrote when he was 14, a suspicion of what greedy nations were doing to a shared planet, and the concept of \"The Cloud Pump,\" lifted from a Dadaist poetry collection written by sculptor Jean Arp nearly 60 years earlier. As though delighting in building luxury cars from scrap heaps, This Heat thrived on endless recombination. The resulting four minutes are, frankly, terrifying \u2014 a post-industrial wasteland bleak enough to render Orwell queasy. An oppressive drone hovers throughout the track, the inescapable hum of modern anxiety. An acoustic guitar misses every \"right\" note by a semitone, making its riff feel dejected and sad, like a child playing with a broken toy on Christmas morning. Warped drums and electronics hiss and wheeze, conjuring Arp's \"Cloud Pump\" as it puffs out its noxious atmosphere. Finally, two disembodied voices narrate the scene like a teasing Greek chorus, reminding us that we've lobbied for this ruin through dollars and votes. \"A nation gets the clouds it deserves,\" the voices croak in matter-of-fact ridicule. \"Give me carbon monoxide.\" \"Twilight Furniture\" (This Heat) No, you're not listening to Radiohead in 2003 or Liars in 2006, but it's understandable if the obvious influence of This Heat circa 1977 makes you do a double-take. \"Twilight Furniture,\" the most bewitching song on the band's self-titled debut, mines the same pattern of deceptive simplicity that would give their apostles hits decades later \u2014 hypnotic drums, enigmatic voices, elliptical guitars, background textures so faint and peculiar you wonder if you've conjured them out of whole cloth. Written in part on piano but recorded without it, the song seems to linger in the haze created by a piano's decaying notes, as if the world were always about to fade away. Hayward's rhythm for \"Twilight Furniture\" is so seductive you might be tempted to stay here forever \u2014 it's like Sufi trance music, slowed and tempered. But the song's eerie vision of imminent apocalypse, and the belief that we've brought ourselves to this abyssal edge, creates one of This Heat's most uneasy spaces. Above a guitar line that sweeps back and forth like a prison's searchlight, Hayward sings of state control and the self-deception that modern convenience inspires. \"Nuclear fission, our friend,\" he offers, too exhausted by anxiety to sneer. \"We must shake him by the hands.\" \"Health and Efficiency\" (Health and Efficiency) Did This Heat write... a jock jam? At least for a bit, yes. After a hearty year of touring, Bullen, Hayward and Williams returned to Cold Storage to commence the follow-up to their debut, when Williams teased Hayward for riding his bike to practice. \"Health and efficiency!\" Williams quipped at the unexpected sight. Those words never actually appear during this eight-minute anthem, the A-side to a two-song single that's driven by a riff as incisive as anything from Television's then-new Marquee Moon. It is, instead, an ode to sunshine, energy, and \"momentum over stasis,\" feeling at first like walk-up music for some major-league slugger. But the would-be hit coils during the second half into the sort of discordant angularity Battles later made its stock-in-trade. You're left to wonder about the sincerity of these people's enthusiasm for fitness. \"Health and Efficiency\" feels now like a cut-up collage of Goop catchphrases, brilliantly built into a jingle that breaks down like an aging body. Hayward understands the feeling: \"We're being sold our bodies back to ourselves,\" he says, \"and being turned into a meat market.\" \"S.P.Q.R.\" (Deceit) One of rock and roll's great wartime philippics, \"S.P.Q.R.\" lampoons the unchecked groupthink that empowers collective human atrocities \u2014 nationalism, genocide, atomic weapons, fighting at all. Dual photographs from different-if-not-distant German eras inspired Hayward to consider the way shared patriotism corrupts individual morality \u2014 one shot of Hitler's army marching down the autobahn, bound for battle, and a subsequent one of tourists on the same stretch, bound for vacation. Are we that easy to fool? This Heat answers that question affirmatively here, jeering Rome's origin story of fratricide and its rampant inequality. \"We are all Romans, and we know all about straight roads,\" squealed in lockstep above the wallop. \"Every straight road leads home, home to Rome.\" It's an imagined credo of Roman pride and a reminder that assumptions of invincibility can kill us. Notice how the drums lag behind the shards of guitar and synchronized vocals. The whole affair is one tenuous connection from collapsing \u2013 as with any over-extended empire or brutal regime. Perhaps a new wave of white supremacists, inexplicably brandishing the title's Roman abbreviation, need an unintentionally ironic theme? \"Makeshift Swahili\" (Made Available: John Peel Sessions) Nearly a quarter-century after releasing Deceit in 1981, This Heat was still not satisfied with the version of \"Makeshift Swahili\" that serves as the album's blunderbuss and arguable climax. Cobbled together from three studio sessions, the finished product is indeed a glorious mess \u2014 ghastly drones, tessellated riffs, corrosive metal, absurdist poetry, screamed bedlam, a brief but delightful pop-rock burst that sounds salvaged from Sgt. Pepper's, all squeezed into four breathless minutes. \"Makeshift Swahili\" is a symphony of assorted cacophonies. But three years before releasing Deceit, the band had actually captured a more powerful and nuanced take during their second visit with John Peel. It was slowed down, letting the song unfurl dramatically, from The Velvet Underground-like smear that offers the tense invocation to the manic screams and grinding noise that obliterate the end. The Peel iteration of \"Makeshift Swahili'' is overstuffed with backwards guitars, drunken piano, and competing rhythms \u2014 fitting for a song about the death of language, foreshadowing our context-free social media age. This Heat conveys the woes of uncommunicative madness as loudly as possible, as if stuck in a crowded room where everyone speaks over everyone else. So many This Heat songs share musical parts or lyrical ideas, tracks growing out of and back into one another like some colossal system of underground roots. These sets illustrate the process. \"24 Track Loop\" b/w \"Graphic/Varispeed\" (This Heat, Health and Efficiency) Perhaps no two tracks better capture This Heat's \"all possible processes\" dogma than these forever-linked instrumentals, both accidents. After capturing an electrifying drum-and-organ jam on tape, This Heat decided to loop the snippet again and again, speeding it up or slowing it down each time. They mixed those warped results while the loops played back in the studio, creating what feels like a live band working through especially demented techno. \"24 Track Loop\" is a thrilling, three-dimensional round of Snakes and Ladders, some randomized surprise appearing with every turn. (Bonus: Look for an even wilder, longer rendition of \"24 Track Loop\" called \"Repeat,\" finally finished by the band in the early '90s.) During the tedious and electrifying process, This Heat paused to do something similar with a glowing keyboard-and-viola fragment they'd recently recorded at practice. That's the sound you hear at the beginning of \"24 Track Loop,\" a hiccuping drone that suggests the three are still powering up. It's also the sound you hear \u2014 albeit sped up and slowed down \u2014 throughout \"Graphic/Varispeed,\" the wobbly hum of a B-side for \"Health and Efficiency.\" The band suggested playing it at 16, 33, 45, or 78 RPM, designing a little game of chance John Cage might have admired. \"Fall of Saigon\" b/w \"Independence\" (This Heat, Deceit) What do the Fall of Saigon, the Declaration of Independence, and a whiskey-drunk cat named Soda have in common? Guess. From the music to the subject matter, This Heat explored most every inspiration it could find, including Hayward's love-hate obsession with television. One night, while watching the news in 1975, the broadcast pivoted from helicopters dramatically fleeing Saigon to Soda, a lovably inebriated cat. The juxtaposition provided a lesson in the arbitrary nature of pain and pleasure, or the way suffering and celebration are forever but a news segment apart. That's the tension inside \"Fall of Saigon\" \u2014 This Heat invokes absolute anguish through a sort of gothic Gamelan orchestra, while drolly harmonizing a bit of Soda fan-fiction. \"I know all about cats and their heavy vibes.\" While recording \"Fall of Saigon,\" an engineer accidentally played the vocals backwards. The band loved the mistake so much they asked for a tape, which Hayward remembered when he needed a melody for a new groove. Scouring a battered encyclopedia for lyrical conceits, he spotted the United States' Declaration of Independence \u2014 perfect fodder for the backward melody and Williams' Wild West pan-pipe lines. The result, \"Independence,\" is a menacing taunt, with rubbery bass and wearily chanted vocals that already sound exhausted by the United States' aspirations. By weaponizing this country's most sacrosanct text of rebellion, This Heat built a transatlantic protest anthem for unfulfilled promises. Because of This Heat's very brief lifespan as a band, almost all of its finished songs \u2014 exactly two-dozen \u2014 are on the albums and EP. If you feel inspired, you can track down bootlegs (and there are lots), pay mightily for a 1982 split cassette, or trace the trio's members through multiple post-This Heat projects. But the fastest and cheapest way to imagine what else it might have been is to listen to \"Aerial Photography,\" a five-minute onstage improvisation for guitar, melodica and keys, found on Live 80/81. The band drifts around an implied rhythm, wisps of dissonance curling upward like smoke. It's easy to picture Charles and Charles and Gareth taking the jam back to Cold Storage, where they'd argue about it until shaping some delightfully obtuse attack on early-'80s global conservatism. In the end, though, the song goes nowhere while suggesting it could go anywhere \u2014 much like This Heat, start to finish. Still curious? Don't know where to begin with K-pop, or queer punk?

One sold nearly 1 million copies on its first day, based on the name of the author and weeks of publicity. But the other is the better book to buy for insight into what Trump's rise and rule really mean \u2014 here and abroad \u2014 for democracy in our time. The first, of course, was Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man. In its rueful pages, Mary Trump, the president's niece, wields both her training as a psychologist and her insider knowledge of Uncle Donald's dealings with other family members. The second, by historian and journalist Anne Applebaum, is Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism \u2014 and it too depicts Trump as a threat on a global scale. Unlike the several exposes by Washington Post reporters and other journalists, former FBI directors and former Trump enablers, this compact work runs under 200 pages and spends relatively few of them on Trump himself. Yet it deserves a place of both prominence and permanence in the anti-Trump canon. To be sure, Applebaum sees the U.S. president as akin to an array of autocrats now in power around the world, from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Hungary's Viktor Orban to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. She does not cast Trump as the cause of the world's current passion for autocracy, although he is arguably its gaudiest product. Applebaum brings to these judgments the gravitas of a historian, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Gulag: A History, one of three volumes on the tyranny of the Soviet Union. Her greater subject is the fragile state of classic liberal democracy. She fears that the rule of law, the rights of the individual and the combination of free elections with the regulating institutions of a republic may not survive the onslaught of the 21st century. Still heir to ancient fears and hatreds, even the most advanced societies are straining under repeated blows: protracted wars, economic disruptions, migrating populations, and now a global pandemic. These challenges are complicated by the power and pace of technological change, especially the bewildering landscape of social media and other Internet-based communications that can \"undermine consensus, divide people further and increase polarization until only violence can determine who rules.\" It all lends itself to exploitation by individuals and political parties offering solutions in the form of \"strong man\" authority, often with an emphasis on returning to traditional social arrangements and cultural presumptions. Given all this weighty material, it is remarkable that Applebaum can make her treatment of it edifying. Yet it is as smoothly readable and impressively reasoned as her columns from 17 years at The Washington Post and her more recent writing in The Atlantic. One reason may be the personal focus of this work, the sense that she is lamenting the loss of friends and views she felt sure of when the century began. A 2018 essay from The Atlantic titled \"A Warning From Europe\" reappears at the beginning of this volume. In it, Applebaum revisits a party she and her husband (a Polish journalist and political figure) threw for friends in Poland on New Year's Eve 1999. After depicting the guests as survivors of the Iron Curtain era and creators of the new Poland, she recounts how their trajectories have since diverged. Some, whom she describes as having been among her best friends, are people with whom she no longer speaks. For reasons of ambition or \"to make a difference,\" several have cast their lot with Poland's move to a nationalist, autocratic government. When she tries to contact one, she receives a text that asks: \"What would we talk about?\" Applebaum recounts similar estrangements from some of the American conservatives she regarded as allies in an earlier time, before they \"split in half\" \u2014 largely over the rise of politicians such as Sarah Palin, the Tea Party and Trump. \"What has caused this transformation?\" Applebaum asks herself and her readers. \"Were some of our friends always closet authoritarians? Or have the people with whom we clinked glasses in the first minutes of the new millennium somehow changed over the subsequent two decades?\" There is no simple response, but to the biggest question she replies: \"Given the right conditions, any society can turn against democracy. Indeed, if history is anything to go by, all societies eventually will.\" Indeed, changing conditions have dimmed what had seemed the dawning of a new international epoch in the late 20th century. In those years, the Soviet Union was collapsing, apartheid was abolished, military juntas were being displaced in South America and even China seemed to be moving toward free markets and perhaps even a kind of democracy. It was the heady time when political scientist Francis Fukuyama dared to title an essay \"The End of History?\" \u2014 arguing that the centuries of argument over economics and governing had led to broad consensus. Notably, Applebaum titles her final chapter here \"The Unending of History.\" Much of Twilight is focused on Poland, where the Washington-born Applebaum is now a citizen. But she sees a similar dynamic in other polities, such as in England (where she studied at the London School of Economics and Oxford and later worked for The Economist and The Spectator) and in Spain, where she went on journalistic assignment. Both countries have seen periods of political peace and Western European orientation give way to surging sentiments of nationalism and populism (a term she uses sparingly) \u2014 often linked to resentment of immigrants. One old friend from her younger days is Boris Johnson, who pops up at one point riding a bicycle on a London street shortly after being elected mayor. A few years later, of course, Johnson has moved to the national stage and been caught up in the vortex of Brexit as the prime minister. In Spain, Applebaum focuses on a relatively new party known as Vox, a name that nods to the voice of \"the people.\" A minor player at first, Vox has swiftly swollen in importance. Its appeals have reached older voters nostalgic for the traditional social and political arrangements, even as they reach a new generation longing for the nation to return to prominence. When she turns back to look at the U.S., Applebaum is fascinated with the similarities between the violent revolutionaries of the Weather Underground in the 1960s and some of the right-wing activists and armed militia of our day. She notes that the former group titled their manifesto \"Prairie Fire\" at the time, and the metaphor of a fire sweeping across the prairie reappeared in a speech Steve Bannon of Breitbart.com gave in 2010, before joining forces with Trump. \"By 2016, some of the arguments of the old Marxist left \u2014 their hatred of ordinary, bourgeois politics and their longing for revolutionary change \u2014 met and mingled with the Christian right's despair about the future of American democracy,\" she writes. \"Together they produced the restorative nostalgic campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump.\" Applebaum also joins a host of other authors in her amazement at Trump's penchant for misrepresenting facts and then insisting on the validity of his misrepresentations. She hearkens back to the controversy that arose in the first hours of his presidency with regard to the crowd for his inauguration speech. All available evidence showed that crowd to be far smaller than the one on President Barack Obama's first Inauguration Day in 2009. But Trump and his minions insisted on his version of events, giving an early indication of how he would defy the media, Congress and other forms of oversight from then on. The point here is to encourage his followers \"to engage, at least part of the time, with an alternative reality.\" By so doing, she says, one becomes complicit in the conspiracy. Near the end of Twilight Applebaum tells of a friend in Poland who caught himself shouting ever louder in an argument. The friend reported having the sudden realization that he was doing so not to convince others but to convince himself that he still believed what he was saying. Perhaps, she says, those shouting their approval for autocrats around the world will reach that same conclusion. In the meantime, Applebaum hopes the pandemic \"will inspire a new sense of global solidarity\" but fears it might have the opposite effect, that \"fear of disease will create fear of freedom\" and empower the autocrats. \"Maddeningly,\" she concludes, \"we must accept that both futures are possible. No political victory is ever permanent. ...\" And in that final statement we can find both cause for concern and a reason to hope.",

            "article_content": "When Army Pvt. Ethan Melzer found out in April that he was deploying to Turkey, U.S. prosecutors say, he began to plot. He allegedly browsed jihadist propaganda, including an ISIS account of attacks on American forces. In it, militants referred to a \"harvest of the soldiers.\" But the ambush 22-year-old Melzer was planning, authorities say, was driven by a different ideology. A federal indictment unsealed in June accuses Melzer of passing sensitive military information to fellow members of a Satanic neo-Nazi network, the Order of the Nine Angles. The target: Melzer's own unit. While the case hinges on contacts with white supremacists, jihadist references are laced throughout. In May, prosecutors say, Melzer slipped information to someone he took for an al-Qaida operative. Court papers show a conversation where an alleged neo-Nazi asked Melzer if they were \"literally organizing a jihadi attack,\" to which he replied, \"Yes probably.\" \"They didn't draw a distinction, didn't really see a problem with adhering to tenets of violent white supremacy, Satanism and jihad,\" said Colin P. Clarke, a terrorism researcher at The Soufan Center. \"The lines are blurrier than ever before.\" Analysts say Melzer's alleged plot is emblematic of today's extremist threat, one inspired by a mash-up of radical beliefs. It's a threat that is international in reach, and nihilistic and violent in nature \u2013 part of the destroy-the-system \"accelerationist\" vein. One researcher noted that the old left-right terrorism spectrum now looks more like a circle. A Justice Department statement described Melzer's motivations as \"a diabolical cocktail of ideologies.\" Even the federal case against Melzer is muddy when it comes to which brand of extremism forms the legal basis of the terrorism component. After several email exchanges between NPR and Justice Department spokespeople, it was still unclear whether the charge Melzer faces for material support of terrorism is linked to his alleged association with the neo-Nazi group or to the jihadists. Or, potentially to both. \"It's all become muddled together and it's very difficult to disaggregate,\" Clarke said. \"As researchers, we're looking for that kind of clarity, and it's not there very often now. This is not your old-school Aryan Nation guy.\" The fluidity makes it even harder for security officials and terrorism researchers struggling to \"turn the ship,\" as Clarke put it. They're moving from years of an almost single-minded focus on Islamist extremism \u2013 namely al-Qaida and ISIS \u2013 to the resurgent far-right, now the deadlier and more active threat in the United States, according to the FBI. Plus, the country is in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis and a polarizing election year, creating fertile ground for radicalization. \"I think we're going to look back at the first half of 2020 and see this as a watershed moment for far-right extremists, in terms of recruiting new members and infusing new lifeblood into these groups,\" Clarke said. The concept of accelerationism \u2014 the promotion of violence to hasten the collapse of failed governmental systems - isn't exclusive to the far-right. And the vision of a post-collapse new order varies from faction to faction. The heavily armed, Hawaiian shirt-sporting \"boogaloo boys\" say they're prepping for a second Civil War, but they're all over the place on ideology and governance for the day after. For hardcore racists, the goal is more clear-cut: a white ethno-state. \"What defines white supremacist accelerationists is their belief that violence is the only way to pursue their political goals. To put it most simply, accelerationists embrace terrorism,\" wrote researcher Cassie Miller in a recent report for the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"Accelerationists aren't part of a new movement,\" Miller added. \"They're just an iteration more inclined toward terroristic violence than has existed in recent decades.\" The attacks often draw from a hybrid of ideologies. One trend blends white nationalism with the misogynistic incel movement, another uses the left's climate concerns to stoke right-wing paranoia over racial competition for resources. Mass shooters in Christchurch, New Zealand, and El Paso, Texas, both included environmentalist themes in their white-nationalist manifestos. Melzer's case is among a handful involving both white supremacy and militant Islamism, sometimes based on a melding of ideologies, sometimes just a borrowing of tactics. Another example comes from the Justice Department's crackdown on The Base, a small neo-Nazi group agitating for a race war. As Miller of the SPLC wrote, The Base's goal was \"system collapse.\" The network was disrupted in January with the arrests of seven members ahead of a gun rally in Virginia. Authorities say The Base planned to target the event. Extremism trackers roll their eyes at the attention to the name of the group \u2013 yes, they all know \"The Base\" translates as \"al Qaida\" in Arabic. That might be coincidental, researchers say, but they do see the jihadist influence elsewhere. The Base's black flag is reminiscent of the ISIS banner. The group's propaganda follows the cinematic style that was another hallmark of ISIS, down to a group photo with a decapitated ram's head. Art Jipson, a University of Dayton professor who's studied white racial extremists for decades, said neo-Nazis and jihadists don't stand a chance of working out a power-sharing agreement after the imagined system collapse. The disparate camps are interested in one another only as a means to an end. For now, Jipson said, they share an obsession with \"purity and pollution\" and a penchant for guerrilla warfare. \"There is a respect for the tactic, the devotion to cause, the devotion to the group, but obviously not accepting the ideology or the goals of those movements,\" Jipson said. \"The willingness to die for your cause is held in some esteem.\" The portrait that emerges from the court papers of Melzer, the Army private charged with plotting to ambush his own unit, is of an extremist who wanted to sow chaos by any means necessary. When Melzer found out in April that he was being deployed to Turkey, prosecutors say, he passed details about his unit's location, strength and defenses to the Order of the Nine Angles; prosecutors say he also gave information to a purported al-Qaida operative. An attorney for Melzer, Jennifer Willis, declined to comment on the charges. Melzer realized the ambush plot was a suicide operation and didn't care, according to the indictment. His goal was bigger \u2013 he wanted to \"leave a mark.\" The indictment says Melzer reasoned that his death was worth it because \"the after effects of a convoy getting attacked would cover it ... It would be another war.\" In the court papers, one exchange shows Melzer and his neo-Nazi comrades using Arabic phrases about Melzer's deployment to Turkey, as if mimicking jihadists: \"inshallah my brother, allahu akbar.\" In another transcript, an alleged co-conspirator tells Melzer that his neo-Nazi group \"is officially chill with the hajis,\" a pejorative reference to Muslims. Melzer allegedly replied that they were \"not the only one.\" The other member wrote back that what the group was planning \"is already similar to jihad.\" \"There's a kind of flippancy with the language, a tongue-in-cheek humor to it: 'They're on the wrong side of history, we're on the right side of history, but if they're attacking the federal, international cabal, then that is not necessarily a bad thing,' \" Jipson said, summarizing the white supremacists' take on jihadists. Counterterrorism authorities disrupted the alleged plot in May and arrested Melzer on June 10. A Justice Department news release referred to him as \"the enemy within\" and said he was \"motivated by racism and hatred as he attempted to carry out this ultimate act of betrayal.\" Melzer is in custody, but researchers warn that his alleged apocalyptic mission, informed by guerrilla movements around the world, remains a serious national security threat. The pandemic makes it even more timely to understand and address it, said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, who runs the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University. The more people view systems as failing to protect them, she said, the more the tear-it-down approach resonates. \"There's a lot of fantastical and even mythological thinking here, a phoenix rising from the ashes, a way of believing in some kind of mythical rebirth and restoration,\" Miller-Idriss said. \"That becomes more attractive in times where we're experiencing a lot of instability and uncertainty.\"",

This week, we examine a little known history that sheds light on the Latino experience today. I recently traveled to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to interview historian Jesse Hoffnung-Garskoff who wrote a fascinating book called Racial Migrations: New York City and the Racial Politics of of the Spanish Caribbean. It's a gripping read about Afro-Latino migrants to the U.S. who, in the late 19th century, conspired to overthrow a colonial monarchy, eliminate slavery and organize in the Spanish Caribbean while living in New York and Florida. There are echoes of the book in headlines today, from the Puerto Rican demonstrations last summer that resulted in the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to recent protests in the Dominican Republic around election corruption. And because professor Hoffnung-Garskoff is such a thorough historian, he brought in some very rare recordings of music to reflect the time period we are talking about.

            "article_content": "Atlantic writer Mike Giglio profiles the Oath Keepers, a pro-Trump militia group, in a new article. \"They believe that there is a very strong likelihood of civil violence in America,\" he says.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Police departments are preparing for the possibility of violence on Election Day. Some pro-Trump, far-right militants are preparing for the possibility of civil war. My guest Mike Giglio writes about one such militant group, the Oath Keepers, that he says has tapped into a deep current of anxiety that could cause a surprisingly large contingent of people with real police and military experience to consider armed, political violence. Giglio got access to a leaked database of the Oath Keepers membership from 2009 to 2015. Nearly 25,000 people were on that list. About two-thirds of them had a background in the military or law enforcement. About 10% was active duty. Giglio spent several months interviewing current and former members of the group, trying to understand their motivations and how serious they were about taking up arms. He also interviewed the group's founder and leader Stewart Rhodes, who has warned crowds to be ready for war. This is a prospect that Giglio finds especially disturbing because he's covered civil wars in Syria, Ukraine and Iraq and has witnessed the suffering they've caused. He's also the author of a book about ISIS called \"Shatter The Nations.\" His article about the Oath Keepers is in the November issue of The Atlantic. Mike Giglio, welcome to FRESH AIR. MIKE GIGLIO: Thank you for having me. GROSS: You spoke to many current and former members of the Oath Keepers. Are they preparing in case there is a civil war? Or do they want to start a civil war? GIGLIO: It's more the former. So they believe that there's a very strong likelihood of civil violence in America. And, you know, they've been prepping for this in their minds, in some cases, since the group started in 2009. And all the events of the Trump presidency, you know, over the last year, for a lot of them, have made them feel like it's more likely that there's going to be some form of conflict. All of them said that they don't want it to happen. But they're at the point where they feel like they might not have a choice. And so preparations is really the kind of - embracing was the dominant mood of these people when I spoke to them. GROSS: Who do they think is going to start the civil war? GIGLIO: In their view, the political left, antifa, leftist agitators. If you speak with some of them, they have a very dire view that says that maybe it already started on a smaller scale. So they are casting themselves as defensive even as they use this very aggressive rhetoric. GROSS: So some of them see signs that a civil war is inevitable. What are some of the other signs? GIGLIO: If you think about their worldview, it holds that the federal government and state governments will seek to use almost tyrannical power to control the population. So the mandates that came down from the coronavirus, the lockdowns, that reinforce that worldview. The fear of protests from the political left and of riots is very prevalent in their worldview. It's something that they talk about for years. And when they saw the protests against police brutality take place this summer and when they saw the riots that were connected to some of those, that reinforced the idea that there is some sort of unrest coming or even already here. And, you know, they really listen to the way that President Trump portrays these events. So if you listen to Trump's own comments, it's - you know, he's portraying the governor of Michigan, for example, as almost tyrannical. He's portraying the protesters as leftist insurrectionists who are bent on looting and destruction. It really feeds into their worldview. And so that's why over the course of the year that I was talking to them, they became more and more convinced that these events were actually playing out. GROSS: It's interesting that they're so pro-Trump in the sense that you think of the far-right, militant groups as being anti-government. But this group is so pro-Trump, and he's the president. GIGLIO: It's actually an important point. This is the first time that militant groups like this have had someone in the White House that they fully support. They were really skeptical of the first George Bush administration, for example, and even George H.W. Bush - not as much as they've been skeptical of Democrats, but they really never felt like they had an ally in the White House. And from the beginning of Trump's presidential campaign in 2015, they were almost fully on board. And, you know, he speaks their language. And, you know, they are very passionately Trump supporters. And it really is a change for these groups. And I think - you know, what I detected is that they still haven't quite figured out how to square what they used to say about the power of the government and being a check on that with the fact that they're just, you know, full-fledged behind the president right now. And I think that's a big contradiction. GROSS: Why is a relatively large percentage of the group comprised of current and former members of the police and the military? GIGLIO: The Oath Keepers are unique - and this is the reason that I decided to focus on them - in that they expressly recruit and focus on people with military and police experience. They - that's how they build themselves. And I think what their founder has been very successful at doing is tying the idea that there is this sort of movement on the political left that is anti-police, anti-military, and making this into an idea that what this militant movement is is actually some version of patriotic. And it's a place for Trump supporters and gun rights advocates and military and police professionals and the people who very, wholeheartedly support them. He calls it the warrior class. And this has sort of been a dream for him, to try to channel that into some sort of political force. And he told me even in February of this year, the first time I spoke with him, that he was using the - what he called a drumbeat of police demonization on the left to help his efforts of outreach to these communities. And as the year progressed, you know, I saw him taking that and really trying to hammer it home. GROSS: So how did Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, go about recruiting current and former members of the police and military? GIGLIO: I think the most effective thing that he did was when he founded the group, you know, it started out as just a blog campaign. He's a - he was a very prolific blogger beforehand, a libertarian blogger. And he tied the group's purpose to defending the oath that police and military members take when they swear in, the oath to defend the Constitution and to protect it against enemies, foreign and domestic. And that's a way to say, hey, we're just appealing to the oath that you already took. We're asking you to reaffirm it - and putting the group more middle-of-the-road than some of these more extreme militant groups are in their rhetoric. I think it's important when we think about the Oath Keepers, and what the files that I have show, is the idea that it's not so much the group itself that we're - that we can understand through the files as much as a mindset. There is something in America and in this mindset that says, hey, I would at least be willing to consider this, you know? There's something about the Oath Keepers that can draw people in no matter how long they stay, but at least get them to consider the idea that armed, political violence might be necessary. GROSS: I'm trying to think about whether the fact that there are a lot of current and former people from the military and law enforcement who believe this, that there might be a civil war, they might have to take up arms - do you think that they would have more control because they were professionals or that they would be more zealous because they really - they're trained to use weapons. GIGLIO: You know, there is a stereotype of the regular, let's say, militia member in America - someone who's an armchair warrior, probably has no experience in the military. They talk about civil war because they've seen movies about it, and they think it's this amazing, glorious thing. I was interested in the Oath Keepers because they advertise it. They actually had people who were veterans of police and military in their ranks and who understood what violence really means and how ugly it is. And what I found was - I did connect with some members who had actually seen combat and, because of that, were actually among those who were most afraid of violence and trying to be - in this context at least, trying to be most careful about whether they might provoke it through what they were doing. A lot of those people, I should note, had left the group by now because it has - the founder has become more radical in the things that he says. And then there are people who served in the military but never saw combat or who didn't serve at all, and I think they were a little bit more immature about really understanding what it means when they talk about violence and may be more inclined to be more aggressive in their posturing. GROSS: It's interesting because what you just said about the people who didn't see combat, that holds true for the founder of the group, Stewart Rhodes. He wanted to be in the Special Forces. He wanted to be a Green Beret. But in a parachute exercise, he injured his spine and couldn't serve any longer. So he - would you put him in that category as somebody who never saw combat but wanted to and was frustrated by that? GIGLIO: You know, it's true. He never did see combat. And he wanted to be in the Special Forces, which is this elite part of the U.S. military that goes overseas. And one of their core missions is actually going out among local populations and training Indigenous forces and getting populations ready to support U.S. intervention or foreign policy. And, actually, that's how he sees himself with the Oath Keepers. He says, like, they're on a Special Forces mission but just in America. They want to train the population. They want to go out and bring people into their ideology. So I do think he's found a way to live out what his military dreams used to be when he was younger in the American context. And I think that that's a thread that is really common in this movement. And I do think it raises questions. Like, you know, we as Americans are so comfortable with the idea of sending people out into foreign wars, and now they're starting to look at America itself as part of that battle space. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mike Giglio. His article about the Oath Keepers is in the November issue of The Atlantic. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mike Giglio about his article in the current issue of The Atlantic on the Oath Keepers, a far-right militant group that supports Trump and is preparing for the possibility of civil war. Many current and former members of the group have experience in the military or police. The group was founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes. So we've talked a little bit about what the Oath Keepers believe in and the possibility of civil war that they're preparing for. What are some of the things the group has actually done so far? GIGLIO: They are most famous for having a team of people who went to the protests in Ferguson, Mo., after Michael Brown's killing. And they went with their AR-15-style rifles, and they patrolled the crowds, and they stood guard on the roofs of - the rooftops of local businesses. And, you know, to them, they were protecting businesses from looting and arson and rioting. To the protesters, it was a provocation. You know, it was portrayed as, you know, them being there to intimidate the protesters. But, really, you know, this - it was also kind of like a coming-out party for the group. It was all over the media. And, actually, I was overseas at the time, but that was the first that I ever heard of the Oath Keepers. I remember seeing a news image of an Oath Keeper standing on a rooftop with his rifle and kind of staring out into the distance and just the hair on the back of my neck standing up and just wondering, what is happening in America? You know, it was interesting for me actually to, over the course of reporting this story, connect with that same person and talk with him about, you know, what he saw, you know, through his own eyes while he was doing that. GROSS: So what did he see through his eyes? GIGLIO: He thought that he was there for the public good. He thought - you know, he's been defined by that photo, and I think he struggled with that. But in his mind, they were protecting the community. And, you know, the way I describe it in the article and the way I saw it is, you know, whatever they had in mind, that photo became an image of a country that was starting to turn on itself. GROSS: What are some of the ways that you think President Trump has enabled militant far-right groups like the Oath Keepers? GIGLIO: I think what the president says and what his allies say really means a lot. And one thing I found is that the Oath Keepers and the part of the militant right that they represent are listening very closely to what the president is saying. And they believe him. You know, they think he's a truth teller. And, you know, one example of that is I asked - I spoke to dozens of people over the course of reporting this article this year, and I asked almost every single one of them, what will you do if the president says that the vote was stolen, if he's declared the loser of the election, but he says that there was fraud and it was stolen? And almost every one of them said, well, we all know that there was massive fraud by Democrats in 2016. They just take that as fact. And it's because Trump has been saying it for four years and also because parts of the conservative media establishment and Republican politicians have in different ways been supporting him and that idea, that voter fraud is this real problem and that maybe it did happen in some massive way, like the president says, in 2016. But they're very attuned to that. And they're listening very closely when he's saying it's already happening for 2020. GROSS: When Trump calls Biden a socialist, does that feed the far-right narrative? Because I think one of the things - one of the signs that the militant groups are looking for is, like, is America becoming a socialist country? And if it is, it's time to take up arms. GIGLIO: That's a good point. You know, since they were founded in 2009, that's been what they've been talking about. Socialism is coming and, with that, tyranny. That's been what they say. That's how they see the world. That's how they cast Barack Obama. They were part of the Tea Party wave. You know, there's a - I don't mention this in the article, but there's a question in the files that asked members when they signed up, how did you hear about the Oath Keepers? And dozens of people had just signed up at Tea Party rallies or been referred by local Republican politicians. And so they were very embedded in the Tea Party wave in 2009. But if you think about Trump, he just - he - you know, where that was at one point seen as sort of a fringe of the party, Trump just speaks that way, you know. So the way I would answer the question is the Oath Keepers and people in this part of the political spectrum, they already were dominated by talk of socialism, and they probably would have seen Biden that way anyway. Trump is just speaking their language. And I think it magnifies it and it gives it additional credibility to hear the president of the United States and the leader of the Republican Party saying it so relentlessly, so clearly. GROSS: You know, I find this so interesting because Trump's - as you say, Trump speaks their language. How does Trump know their language? Trump was not, like, a politically ideological person, as far as I know, before he started campaigning. And his concerns were his - you know, related to his business and to winning and to making money and getting ratings, you know, not dog whistles to the far right. So do you think he's - do you think he understands the code that he's speaking in? And do you think he learned it from somebody who serves as an adviser to him or writes speeches for him? GIGLIO: I think it's a good question, and I think that there are elements of Trump's politics that overlap with what the militant right was saying even years ago. So Trump was - almost made his political name on the idea of the birther theory that President Obama wasn't actually born in America. And, you know, the Oath Keepers and parts of the Tea Party and parts of the militant right, they were very much into that whole theory. And so he was speaking in these conspiratorial frames, you know, at the same time that they were before it was mainstream. And he cast himself as an outsider, someone who is attacking the political elite, Democrat and Republican alike. And for the Oath Keepers and for this part of the political right, that is essential, that part of Trump's message. The fact that he took on Jeb Bush before he took on Hillary Clinton - I mean, the Clintons and the Bushes, these are two names that in this world view are synonymous with the U.S. political elite. And they really talk about the idea that the elite is undermining America. It wants to weaken the country. This is their world view. And Trump just casts himself as that outsider anti-elite candidate from the beginning. So I think the overlap is just natural. And I don't know the answer to the rest of the question, you know, whether he's trying to appeal to these groups specifically. But it is a very natural alliance at least. GROSS: Let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mike Giglio. His article about the Oath Keepers is in the November issue of The Atlantic. We'll talk more after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF KYLE EASTWOOD'S \"SONG FOR YOU\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Mike Giglio about his article in the current issue of The Atlantic - also online, of course - on the Oath Keepers, a far-right militant group that supports Trump and is preparing for the possibility of civil war. Many current and former members of the group have experience in the military or police. The group was founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes. Let's talk about the Oath Keepers founder, Stewart Rhodes. What is his background? GIGLIO: He joined the military right out of high school in the 1980s, and he wanted to be a Green Beret, which is the most elite - one of the most elite branches of the U.S. military. But he never made it there. He was training, doing a parachute jump. And the way he tells it, at least, it was a night jump. His parachute got caught in a tree. He fell, and he fractured his spine. And after that, he was sort of drifting. So he was in Las Vegas. He did some training in mixed martial arts. He was parking cars as a valet. He was a firearms instructor. And he started at that time getting involved in or at least interested in politics and specifically libertarian politics. You know, he was working at gun shows and places like that where politics were pretty frequently discussed. And at one point, he had an accident actually with a loaded handgun, and he dropped it and it discharged and shot him in the face and blinded him in one eye. And I found he doesn't like to talk much about this part of his life. But I found his wife is - also was a very prolific blogger. And I found some of her old blog posts. And she described that as, like, really a turning point for him. Like, he almost died and he wanted to rededicate himself and he had this kind of crisis of what am I going to do with my life after that? And so he ended up enrolling in community college, and then he did well and he transferred to UNLV. And then he graduated summa cum laude from there. And he actually went to Yale Law School, and he graduated from Yale Law, you know, older than most of the other graduates shortly before the 2008 race and was involved with Ron Paul's campaign. And then something happened, you know, when Ron Paul lost to John McCain and then McCain lost to Obama and he really veered off the path that he was on, you know, trying to work as a lawyer. And he ended up, you know, starting this militant group instead, just taking a whole different tack. GROSS: So he - you know, he blinds himself in a gun accident in 1993 and doesn't start becoming an activist for gun safety. He becomes an activist preparing for armed civil war. His own life experience almost contradicts what he's about because, you know, one of the basic precepts of his group is that - is gun rights. GIGLIO: In a way, it shows how committed he is to the idea of gun rights, that it didn't make him question his work with firearms. GROSS: Oh, I see. So you say he sees it as a sign of his strength as a believer in the Second Amendment. GIGLIO: I actually - no, it's a good question that you're raising. I haven't actually asked him, you know, whether he considered moving away from guns after that. Just my own interpretation of it is, you know, it shows that he's really committed to this idea. And he - I mean, I was really insistent on meeting with him. You know, I contacted him initially earlier this year, let him know that I was writing this story and I had these files and that it was going to be an article that was critically minded. And I had a hard time nailing him down to actually meet. It took months before we were actually able to connect in person. One thing I wanted to find out for myself that I feel like I can get a better sense of in person is, you know, how much he believes what he puts out there. You know, how committed is he really on a personal level to his ideology? And really on the guns thing, like, my impression was that he means what he says. Having a firearm to him is fundamental to what it means to be his version of an American. And it's central to his political worldview. You know, he carries a firearm wherever he goes. He will talk to just regular people at rallies and things like that just about why you should be armed and what kind of weapons you should have. Like, it's just central to who he is. GROSS: Rhodes doesn't want the Oath Keepers to be called a militia or to have its members be called white nationalists. He doesn't want to be labeled as racist. In reality, is the group white nationalist and racist? Are they a militia? GIGLIO: I had a number of conversations with Stewart and with members of the Oath Keepers about the white nationalism label, and they didn't just reject the label, they criticized white nationalism. They said that they're part of the problem. They like to say that white supremacists and leftists are all part of the same basket. They're all part of the problem. And so the way that they see themselves at least is that they are very much not white nationalists. Rhodes actually - and I put this in the article - he considers it to be a smear to be called a white nationalist. It's a very difficult issue to say, like, every member of the group and what they believe. And, you know, the vice president of the Oath Keepers, for example, is African American. And they have from the beginning put a disavowal of racism on their site and banned racism officially. And the introductory video, even on their website is of a Black member. Like, they really want to push back against this. I end up deciding that the best way to position them is just Trumpist in their views about race. They are aligned with the president when it comes to Black Lives Matter. So to them, at least the leadership level, Black Lives Matter is a Marxist group, which I would note is a foreign enemy. You know, so we're talking about enemies, foreign and domestic. This is a foreign enemy on domestic soil if they're calling the Marxist. But President Trump says that as well. GROSS: So by using the word Marxist for some of these groups, some of the individuals in the groups, it's a way of saying they're not even American, so we have a right to take up arms. They're not us. They're others. They're embracing a foreign ideology. Therefore, they're foreign, too. GIGLIO: If you look at the way that Stewart Rhodes presents the protesters, at least the leaders of the protesters, he's saying this is part of an insurrection and we need to be part of putting down that insurrection. And he's saying that they're Marxists. And this - it feeds the idea that the stakes of the election and of these political battles are not just domestic, but also part of this struggle where foreign enemies and American politicians who are aligned with these foreign interests are undermining the country. And I think that's part of the framing. And, also, you know, I think it's important just to remember, like, America as a country has been at war for two decades now, continuously. And we think we can just put this - these wars out of mind for the most part, aside from those, obviously, who serve in them and their families. But I think when a country is at war for this long, it does something to our collective psyche, where we're just - whether we realize it or not, we're used to the idea of being at war with sort of amorphous foreign enemies, and we have this idea of unbounded conflict that we're all just - we've all grown comfortable with in a foreign context. And I think what I noticed in Stewart's rhetoric and the speeches that he gave that I attended is that these frames that we usually apply to foreign wars are now part of our political dialogue at home. And one example of this I put in the story - I attended a meeting that he hosted in Tennessee where he tried to bring people from the community and different groups together. So a militia group called the Three Percenters was there, and some Oath Keepers were there. And he wanted to start a new organizing effort and unite everyone. And while I was waiting for him to get there, I was sitting with an Iraq War veteran who had recently joined the Oath Keepers. And he just started talking, you know, kind of about his experience overseas. And one thing that he started talking about was the - something that he seemed like he was still grappling with this in his own mind, like, the idea that U.S. soldiers in Iraq had been forced to confront the possibility of killing kids and just sort of the ugly chaos of war, where a child might run up to a soldier strapped with an IED and the soldier might be forced to kill the child. This is what's on his mind. And Rhodes eventually arrives, and he's giving a talk, and he's really being inflammatory, and he's talking about the protesters and antifa and - it's an insurrection. And he actually at one point says, at some point, they're going to be using IEDs. And then after that, he says, you know what? Unless we find some miracle way to avoid this, at some point we're going to have to kill these kids. Us older veterans and these younger ones, too, we're going to have to kill these kids in the streets, and they're going to die believing that they were fighting Nazis. And to me, it was just a very jarring example of how the sort of things that happen overseas that even - all Americans have been thinking about and dealing with and just accepting for years now are now part of what people are talking about when they think about the potential for conflict here at home. GROSS: That is a very disturbing statement. And I think it was at a recruiting rally that he made that statement about how, at some point, we're going to have to kill these kids. GIGLIO: Right. At the same meeting where he was trying to say, we need to organize to defend against this insurrection and push back against the protests and the riots and antifa and Black Lives Matter. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mike Giglio. His article about the Oath Keepers is in the November issue of The Atlantic. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mike Giglio about his article in The Atlantic on the Oath Keepers, a far-right militant group that supports Trump and is preparing for the possibility of a civil war. Many current and former members of the group have experience in the military or police. The group was founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes. It sounds like the Oath Keepers might be in disarray. They've lost some members. People who know Rhodes told you that his behavior had become erratic. He was disbarred, I think, in 2015. In 2018, his wife petitioned for an order of protection during divorce proceedings, alleging he'd once grabbed their daughter by the throat and had a habit during marital arguments of waving a pistol in the air before putting it to his head. So what's the state of the Oath Keepers now? GIGLIO: I spoke to a number of people who had left who told me that there was just a great deal of dysfunction in the way that the group was run. And I think, you know, one thing I tried to make clear in the article - because I know it's pretty eye-popping when we say, hey, I've got these files that were leaked. They show everyone that signed up to be a member of the Oath Keepers over a six-year period. And it's 25,000 names, and I think you can run with that and say, oh, my goodness, like, they have a 25,000-person army at their ready. But that definitely wasn't the case. You know, I spoke to so many people who had left for various reasons. You know, in some cases, it was the idea of, like, hey, I thought it was - I saw - I thought it was about gun rights. You know, I signed up, and then I went into their forums and it was way more, you know, extreme than I thought it would be, and so I left or - you know, people had all kinds of ideological differences with the group. And so, you know, I really think the way to see it is - it's a mindset that is very - way more prevalent than we might expect and that is subscribed to by regular citizens. These are not, you know, wild-eyed militiamen off in the woods somewhere. These are people who go to work every day. These are current or former police officers, people who hold regular jobs, members of the community. I think the idea that so many people from regular society have at least considered going down this path is very jarring and says a lot about the kind of anxieties that exist in the country right now. GROSS: What do you think some of those anxieties are that are attracting people to militant groups and to the belief that civil war is a possibility and maybe it's time to prepare? GIGLIO: One thing that I learned overseas covering civil wars is that the first step down that path is convincing yourself that the other side is bent on your destruction, is convincing yourself that they do not have good intentions, that the arguments that you have with your neighbors are not political alone, that they're also existential. And, you know, I only moved back to America a few years ago. And I was just really struck by the fact that that is how people in America are portraying the political divide right now to a large degree - just the level of polarization and division. And, you know, actually, on all sides of the political spectrum right now, you know, the level to which people are convinced that the other side is out to destroy them is really jarring to me. And I think that's the fundamental anxiety that I - you know, that I really honed in on while I was reporting this piece. And if you look at how President Trump portrays his reelection bid, how - even look at the first speech he gave when he announced that he was running for reelection. It's the other side is out to destroy you and your way of life. These are the stakes. And I'm the last thing that's standing in their way. You know, he's obviously tapped into a very deep-seeded anxiety that he's able to exist politically while and gain traction while speaking in really dire terms like that. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mike Giglio. His article about the Oath Keepers is in the November issue of The Atlantic. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DIE KNODEL'S \"MIT DER 42ER\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mike Giglio about his article in The Atlantic on the Oath Keepers, a far-right, militant group that supports Trump and is preparing for the possibility of civil war. Many current and former members of the group have experience in the military or police. The group was founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes. Are there other parallels you see between your reporting on ISIS and civil wars in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine? GIGLIO: You know, I keep thinking back to when I was in eastern Ukraine before a war broke out there. And I was really, like, embedded with these protesters who were on the side of Russia. You know, they speak Russian. They have links to Russia. And they're very tuned into Russian media. And they, at first, were just protesting and taking over local government businesses peacefully because they were convinced that the government in Kyiv was out to get them, was going to take away their ability to speak Russian in schools, take away their way of life. And, eventually, that - you know, over months, as I knew these people, they went from that to they are sending people here to kill us. They're going to put us - arrest us en masse. They're going to - like, Nazis are coming to attack and kill us. And it wasn't true, but they convinced themselves that it was. And, you know, eventually, that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. You know, it meant that they started taking up weapons defensively. And they started - you know, after they took over government buildings, they started defending them. And then, you know, there were standoffs with government forces. And then there were small outbreaks of violence. And then there were calls for revenge. And then it just kind of spiraled from there. Not that I think that would happen in America, necessarily - I think we're a ways off from that. But just the way that people have convinced themselves that their very existence is at stake and that the other side is just bent on not just winning politically, but destroying them and that it will be a final destruction, that they won't be able to win the election again in four years or fight back through other political means is very chilling to me. GROSS: When you were covering Ukraine, you were kidnapped by pro-Soviet rebels. What do you think you learned about militants from that experience? And you were kidnapped because you were a journalist. And there were other journalists who were being held, too. Fortunately, you were released. But did you feel like you learned anything about the mindset of militants and especially militants who think that journalists are evil? GIGLIO: So I was kidnapped at a checkpoint. And I was put in a bus - I think it was a school bus - and blindfolded. And there were a number of these rebels around on the bus. And they were driving me and some other journalists who had been kidnapped to a place where they planned to interrogate us. And I remember just listening, because I couldn't see anything, and feeling the bus slow down to go through a checkpoint that I knew was on the road - and it was a rebel checkpoint - and then hearing them cock their weapons. Like, they were so scared themselves and so clueless as to what was going on, even though they were the ones kidnapping us and, supposedly, in charge, that they were cocking their weapons even as they rolled through their own checkpoints. And it was just, like, a reminder of the fact that when a war breaks out, and especially a civil conflict, like, it is just confusion. It is just people running blindly around and, really, not knowing what to do and just that chaos itself sort of perpetuating. And I think that that's fundamental to understanding, like, what civil conflict really is. It's just - it is not directed clearly. Whatever side you think you're on, you might end up, you know, shooting them by accident, shooting them on purpose. It's just chaos. I can't - it's just suffering and confusion. And, you know, that is what ended up playing out. That was at the very beginning of that war, and, I mean, that's what ended up playing out. Like, it's just a senseless war that's gone on for years where everyone suffers. There's no clear political end. And I'm sure if you went back and reinterviewed every single one of those people that I was with back at the early days when they were starting the war, they would say in a second that they wish that they never had done it. GROSS: Do you think about that a lot when you hear people talk about preparing for civil war in the U.S.? GIGLIO: I wish I could take them with me to Iraq or to a place that's actually in a real war and hold their eyes, you know, open and have them just really see what it is that they're talking about. I just - I don't think they know. You know, when people talk about civil war, like, you know, Stewart Rhodes talks about Lexington Green like it's like the glory of the American Revolution, and I want to say, like, no, it's just suffering. It's not the redcoats versus the patriots. It's like - it's nonlinear. It's civilians dying for no reason. It's not, you know, tales of heroism. It's tales of people being afraid and sort of causing destruction that they can't make any sense of in the end. GROSS: So let's talk about where we are now. Just recently, there was a plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. The Center for Strategic and International Studies issued a report just a few days ago that white supremacists and other like-minded groups have committed a majority of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. this year. Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security warned that violent white supremacy was the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland. So when you look ahead to Election Day and the days soon after, what do you see? GIGLIO: You know, if you had asked me in January when I started working on the story what are, like, my worst-case scenarios for the election, I would've said confusion, people from different sides coming out into the streets and bloodshed erupting just in the confusion of that and in the charged political climate that we're in. And that's what happened, actually, over the summer. You know, that's what happened in Kenosha. That's what happened in Portland, where there were these confused, muddled standoffs between people fighting from various sides at protests and bloodshed - deadly bloodshed because of it. And, you know, I think when I look at, like, worst-case scenarios for the election, that's still what's in my mind - just random, confused unrest like we saw over the summer, maybe on a larger scale, depending on how things go. GROSS: Which could be very dangerous. GIGLIO: It is dangerous. And, you know, when we talk about people preparing for a civil war, like, I don't want to get just stuck imagining some kind of distant conflict, you know, worst-case scenario. Like, the steps, you know, well short of civil war are still really bad. Street violence is not something that we should be dealing with here in America. Shootings and confused plots and just chaos like this, I mean, that's bad enough, and all this talk in preparation for violence I think can help to fuel that and is part of what makes it so dangerous. GROSS: Mike Giglio, thank you so much for your reporting and for joining us on the show today. GIGLIO: Thank you for having me.

            "article_content": "The outspoken son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a podcast and recently hosted the son of Brazil's president - giving a glance at a new generation of nationalists.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST: President Trump may be leaving office, but his right-wing nationalist allies aren't going anywhere, nor is their next generation. The son of one prominent nationalist leader has a new podcast, and he started by talking strategy with the son of another noted nationalist. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: \"The Yair Netanyahu Show\" is hosted by the 29-year-old son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") YAIR NETANYAHU: Welcome to my new podcast. ESTRIN: The podcast debuted a couple of days before the U.S. elections. Yair Netanyahu's guest is the 36-year-old son of Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") NETANYAHU: So today, I'm with my good friend Eduardo Bolsonaro. I wanted to talk to him today about something that impacts all of us, the global battle between globalism versus nationalism. EDUARDO BOLSONARO: It's my pleasure to be here, my friend. ESTRIN: Their fathers are both allies of President Trump. And they've created social media profiles a bit like Donald Trump Jr., promoting nationalist policies. Their conversation starts with disdain for the media. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") BOLSONARO: The mainstream media in Brazil keeps saying that the Amazon is on fire. ESTRIN: The Amazon rainforest has been on fire. But he says the media is lying and controlled by the left. Yair Netanyahu picks up on that. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") NETANYAHU: And I want to connect to what you said before about how the left is very successful in taking over all the power centers of a country, the academia, the media. ESTRIN: They get around the media through social media but complain that's getting tougher. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") NETANYAHU: I was blocked several times from Facebook for hate speech. And I think you were blocked for a while on Twitter, as well. BOLSONARO: All the media - I think only YouTube didn't block me. NETANYAHU: Now you told them, YouTube. So now they're going to make sure to block you, too. (LAUGHTER) ESTRIN: They conclude that they need new platforms to reach new audiences. It's not just in this podcast. Right-wing nationalists around the world have been connecting more. (SOUNDBITE OF CONFERENCE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Prime Minister Orban, let's go back to 1989. ESTRIN: A conference in Rome early this year titled National Conservativism featured European politicians, including leading nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The conference was organized by Israeli conservative author Yoram Hazony. He spoke to NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) YORAM HAZONY: Israel has a very special place at this moment of rising nationalism throughout the democratic world. ESTRIN: He calls Israel a, quote, \"successful national state protecting Jews and Judaism.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) HAZONY: In Britain or Hungary or India or Brazil or even in America, today, you hear many people saying, there's a lot that we can learn from Israel. ESTRIN: Israeli researchers studying right-wing nationalism say U.S. conservative donors have helped turn Israel into a greenhouse for nationalist politics. Noam Gidron teaches political science at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem. NOAM GIDRON: By now, the network of institutions within countries and across countries proliferating these ideas and giving them a platform - and these organizations have preceded Trump and are going to stay here after Trump is no longer president. ESTRIN: Eduardo Bolsonaro is a member of the Brazilian Congress. He helped form a cooperation pact with the Israeli parliament. And yet Yair Netanyahu has spoken to U.S. evangelical groups, big supporters of Trump and Israel and Brazil's leaders. They end the podcast looking past the pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE YAIR NETANYAHU SHOW\") NETANYAHU: My father and your father will navigate this - our - you know, our countries through this difficult times to safer shores. BOLSONARO: I think we are going to look great next year. We are going to recover faster than people think. ESTRIN: Trump lost the election a couple days after the podcast dropped. But these young nationalists will continue their roles, and so will their fathers. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Yet the country's prime minister is as popular as ever.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: India has reported the second most coronavirus cases in the world behind the United States. And its economy shrank 24% last spring. And yet, the country's prime minister is as popular as ever. Here's NPR's Lauren Frayer. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a lockdown last spring with just four hours' notice, millions of migrant workers got stranded when their workplaces and public transit shut down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WORKER #1: (Singing in non-English language). FRAYER: \"Oh, government, please help us,\" one man sang trying to walk to his home village. Many of those stranded were from Bihar, one of India's poorest states, where unemployment hit 46% during the lockdown. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WORKER #1: (Non-English language spoken). FRAYER: \"We're helpless and hungry,\" says another worker who returned to Bihar. The government was forced to reverse course and lift its lockdown amid reports that people were starving to death. So when Bihar held state elections this month, it looked bad for the incumbents, a coalition of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party - or BJP - and its allies. Polls predicted a defeat, but the opposite happened. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The BJP's big victory in Bihar. FRAYER: Modi managed to win one of the states most hurt by his lockdown. Guru Prakash, a BJP spokesman, says what people want in a crisis, more than anything else, is a strong pair of hands. GURU PRAKASH: The decision to impose lockdown required leadership, political will. And he did that. FRAYER: In Bihar, Modi also promised food rations and direct cash transfers to the poor. And he managed to deflect blame for the misery there, says political scientist Sudha Pai. SUDHA PAI: They think that it's the local officials who treated them badly during COVID. But Modi had sent them money and food and all that. And there's this image of him of somebody above normal politics who is untouched by all the wrong that is happening. FRAYER: It's as if Modi is invincible, she says. And this isn't the first time he's proven that. Four years ago, there were long lines at banks after Modi invalidated most paper money to modernize a mainly cash economy. It was his signature demonetization policy and it failed, says political scientist Rikhil Bhavnani. But, he says... RIKHIL BHAVNANI: Despite demonetization being this tremendous negative economic shock, the hardest hit areas in India didn't punish the BJP electorally. FRAYER: Modi remained popular through demonetization and now through the pandemic by uniting voters around two things, economic optimism - the idea that tough times are fleeting - and Hindu nationalism. In a speech last month in Bihar... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: (Non-English language spoken). FRAYER: ...Modi heralded the construction of a grand, Hindu temple in a place called Ayodhya on the ruins of a mosque destroyed in riots. It might seem like an obscure thing to talk about to people facing 46% unemployment in a pandemic. But these stories of an ancient, Hindu civilization rising up, rebuilding, they matter, Bhavnani says, because with them, Modi invites Indians, at a time of crisis, to be part of a larger identity. BHAVNANI: The larger identity, of course, is Hindu. And individuals in India, individuals in Bihar, will vote on the basis of that larger identity. FRAYER: And in August, when India was breaking daily records for new coronavirus cases, Modi's approval rating was at 78%. Lauren Frayer, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

But not the '68 you think. Yes, 1968 also saw protests, racial divisions and political polarization. Adam Serwer covers politics for The Atlantic, and he says you can certainly draw comparisons between Trump and Nixon \u2013 in that Trump is actually a backlash to the policies that came out of 1968. But Serwer says 1868 is a better point of comparison \u2013 it was a moment of hope, when white Republicans had been fighting for black rights for years, before ultimately abandoning them to pursue white voters. Serwer sees Americans coming together in this moment, as they have in the past, but as a student of history, he says the backlash always comes eventually. On whether white people will sustain their support after this moment Please don't kill us or beat us is such a reasonable demand that it's hard for almost anyone who does not envision the police as the enforcers of the color line to reject it. But once the demands go beyond that, once they go to more material questions, much as King's civil rights movement went beyond questions of political power to material dimensions, there is often a tremendous backlash. On racial dynamics within the Republican and Democratic Parties Historically, what happens when you have a party that is almost entirely white is that party views, you know, non-white constituencies as sort of enemies of its own political power. And when you have to do ultimately, is you have to build a coalition, a political coalition where you're sharing power with those people so you don't view them as a threat. And that's what I think has happened with the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is not more progressive on race because ... white liberals are inherently better people. They are more progressive on race because they have to share power with non-white people. That is the actual source of the Democratic Party's progressivism on race. On what the historical lesson of this moment is There are moments where tremendous progress is possible because Americans of very different backgrounds are willing to come together in defense of the political ideals that they have come to view as essential to their identities. There is also, you know, every instance a tremendous backlash to that. And I think we are seeing a backlash to the backlash at this particular moment. And I think we don't know whether there will be a backlash to the backlash to the backlash or what that will look like and what political effect it will have.

            "article_content": "U.S., British and Canadian intelligence agencies are reporting that Russian hackers are trying to steal information from health care organizations working on a potential coronavirus vaccine.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: We still don't know which country or which company will be the first to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. We do know that such a vaccine will be extremely valuable. And today U.S., British and Canadian intelligence agencies all said that Russian hackers are trying to steal information from Western health care organizations working on a vaccine. For more on this potential threat, we're joined now by NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre. Hey, Greg. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: Hi. So what do we know about these attempted Russian hacks? MYRE: Well, we heard from the National Security Agency, along with their British and Canadian counterparts. They issued this coordinated statement - or statements, plural. Now, they say they're seeing these persistent attempts by Russian hackers to break into a range of organizations working on a potential vaccine. So it is a bit unusual for them all to put out a statement. They clearly wanted to amplify their message by putting out this information simultaneously and noting the joint efforts that are underway to detect and mitigate the threat. Western intelligence agencies say they're seeing these spear-phishing emails and attempts to insert malware. And as they examine these digital fingerprints, they believe these hackers are part of a Russian group that's formally known as APT29 or informally known as Cozy Bear. CHANG: Cozy Bear - right. OK, Cozy Bear may sound familiar to some of our listeners. Remind us why we've heard of them before. MYRE: Well, they're linked to Russian intelligence, and they've been blamed for hacking into Democratic Party emails in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They're part of one of several Russian intelligence agencies, and they're believed to be part of the Russian equivalent of the CIA. Now, in the U.S., the National Security Agency rarely comments on anything. But Anne Neuberger, who's NSA cybersecurity director, issued a statement saying that, quote, \"APT29 has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic, think tank, health care and energy organizations.\" Russia pretty shortly afterward denied the accusation, saying it had nothing to do with this, according to a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. CHANG: OK. So do we know who was targeted by these hacks, I mean, and if any valuable information was stolen? MYRE: No, we don't at this point. The intelligence agencies didn't name any organization that's been targeted. The statements didn't say whether any of these alleged Russian efforts were successful or if they caused any real harm. And, of course, we should remember there is no vaccine yet, so there is no magic formula to steal right now. CHANG: Right. MYRE: But that said, it's not too hard to figure out who the likely targets are. The U.S. government has provided money to some companies to work on a vaccine. The companies themselves have provided updates on their research and some preliminary results. And it appears that targets do go beyond just pharmaceutical companies. It can all be - also be university research labs or government health agencies. CHANG: I mean, there's clearly a fierce global competition to develop a vaccine. What might be the motives behind a hacking attempt like this, you think? MYRE: Well, really, several. First of all, this is what Russian intelligence agencies do. But this vaccine would be - will be extremely valuable financially. It'll be great prestige for the country that develops it first. And some are predicting that we're seeing, really, the first stages of vaccine nationalism. We started hearing about this a couple months ago in early May when the U.S. and others started sounding the alarm about China. Perhaps most importantly at all - of all, the country that develops a vaccine can begin vaccinating its own people first. They... CHANG: Right. MYRE: ...Won't have to wait in a long line for what could be a very long process. CHANG: That is NPR's Greg Myre. Thank you, Greg. MYRE: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Disillusionment with British Prime Minister Johnson's handling of the pandemic and Brexit has driven a majority of Scottish people to consistently support independence for the first time in decades.  NOEL KING, HOST: The ties that bind the United Kingdom together are straining. Part of it is Brexit. Part of it is the government's mishandling of the coronavirus. And the Scots are getting restless. For the first time, polls consistently show most Scots want independence from the U.K. Here's NPR's Frank Langfitt in Edinburgh. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: This is John Craig. He's playing the alto sax. Craig also runs the student union at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Six years ago, he and most voters here voted against leaving the United Kingdom because Craig knew that leaving the U.K. would mean leaving the European Union and all the rich, educational and performing opportunities it offered to musicians like him. JOHN CRAIG: We were promised during the 2014 referendum the only way to retain your membership with the EU is to vote no and stay within the U.K. And we were also promised that no referendum would happen on EU membership. LANGFITT: Well, we all know how that turned out. Britain held its Brexit referendum in 2016. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. But England, by far the largest nation inside the United Kingdom, easily outvoted them. CRAIG: I hate admitting that I felt tricked. But absolutely, yeah, I definitely felt tricked. And I placed a lot of blame on myself for tying Scotland down to this. It took a lot of, like, self-reflection to not feel totally embarrassed of what had happened. LANGFITT: If Scotland holds another independence referendum, poll suggest it will pass. A recent poll found a whopping 58% of likely voters back leaving the U.K. The ruling Scottish National Party is running on its independence platform in elections to the regional parliament in May. If the party does well, as expected, it will press the British government for a second independence vote. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opposes the idea, which makes people like John Craig even angrier. CRAIG: I feel like my Democratic right is being blocked within my own country. I have a democratic right to ask for Scottish independence because that is the will that we have in recent polling. I feel, like, ignored as a citizen in the U.K. LANGFITT: Brexit isn't the only factor driving support for Scottish independence, another is Boris Johnson. Under his leadership, the U.K. has recorded the most coronavirus deaths in all of Europe. Many Scots aren't impressed. SANDY COMFORT: He's a buffoon, totally out of his depth. I think he's in it purely for the power. JIM WELSH: I think he's a nut job. I think he's a bit as daft as your Trump. I don't have any respect for the guy. FARZANA HAQ: I do not trust Boris Johnson. LANGFITT: That was Sandy Comfort (ph), a retired lawyer in Kingussie in the Scottish Highlands, Jim Welsh (ph), who works as an electrical technician offshore in the North Sea, and Farzana Haq (ph), a pharmacist in the town of Dunfermline, northwest of Edinburgh. Haq voted against independence in 2014. But she'll vote for it if she gets another chance in part because she thinks Johnson's a hypocrite. She cites the prime minister's refusal to fire his chief adviser after he drove across England in violation of a national lockdown earlier this year. HAQ: We've been following the rules up here. And to be told that we could've broken the rules and it's fine and the government will just stand by you because he happens to be the chief aide was just ridiculous. It was heartbreaking for a lot of people when they learned that they could have just jumped in the car and drove into their parents' house. LANGFITT: Many in Scotland have also been disappointed in Johnson for making grandiose promises... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON: We will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating. LANGFITT: ...That have either fizzled or failed. The Scottish government has also made mistakes. But Haq credits Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, for being transparent with the public. HAQ: She's prepared to come up and stand in front of journalists and take questions every day. And she's prepared to put her hands up when there's a mistake. I do not believe a word that Boris Johnson says. They have made a number of errors. And not one person in his cabinet has taken responsibility. LANGFITT: In a recent poll, seven out of 10 Scots said they were satisfied with Sturgeon's performance, while more than three quarters were disappointed with Johnson's. Scotland and England have a long and bitter history. They fought dozens of battles over the centuries. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Shouting). LANGFITT: One of the most famous battles was here in Bannockburn in 1314. That's when Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots, defeated the English. The sounds and images are recreated at the visitor center north of Edinburgh. Scotland eventually joined England in 1707 in part to profit off the colonies. Fiona Watson's a historian. FIONA WATSON: Because the Scots were desperate to get into empire. And so that to some... LANGFITT: Get in on the action? WATSON: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you weren't going to be in there, you were not going to be anything. LANGFITT: But some of the economic rationale that drove the relationship faded in the 20th century. WATSON: You get the demise of the British Empire and the demise of the huge manufacturing that Scotland had been such a part of. So you're starting to see the economic benefits of union becoming less clear at a time when the British state was intruding. So all of these combine to see the beginnings, I think, of political Scottish nationalism. LANGFITT: There are still big financial reasons for Scotland to stick with the United Kingdom. The U.K. provides a hefty annual subsidy to Scotland. And when the coronavirus hit, it guaranteed an additional $8 1/2 billion in funding. ALEX JAMESON: I don't want independence. LANGFITT: Alex Jameson (ph) is a retired cop from Glasgow. JAMESON: I think we're better together. I think we're stronger together. If we'd been independent when this epidemic happened, we'd be - we wouldn't have the money, the finance, to get ourselves through it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LANGFITT: Back here in Edinburgh, pubs and restaurants are once again closed because of the pandemic. The only live music is out on the streets. And many laid off workers have the British treasury to thank for covering much of their lost wages. Whether money will provide enough glue to hold the country together is one of the big questions. Surveys show that the entire nation is straining at the seams in a way not seen in decades. Ailsa Henderson is a professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh. AILSA HENDERSON: You've got a majority support for independence in Scotland. You've got rising support for independence in Wales. You've got polling on a united Ireland that is hitting over 50% in Northern Ireland. LANGFITT: Polls have never shown this level of division in the United Kingdom. The next test for the union comes here in May. The Scottish National Party will try to use a strong showing to demand another independence vote and put the British government in a bind. HENDERSON: It's very difficult if you're saying to an electorate, how you express yourself peacefully and democratically at the ballot box, no matter what you say, it won't matter. LANGFITT: But Henderson says Boris Johnson has been willing to make unpopular decisions like that before and hope the problem will eventually just go away. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Edinburgh.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an uptick in the demand at food banks.\n                \n                    \n                    Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A volunteer loads food into a cart at a mobile pantry in Detroit in April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an uptick in the demand at food banks. COVID-19 has disrupted life around the globe. Borders have closed between nations, businesses have shuttered, and school and social routines have been profoundly altered. Yet amid all this, CNN host and Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria sees possibility. \"This is an opportunity, if we take it, to really go ahead and make some of the big changes that we all know we need,\" he says. In his new book, Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World, Zakaria looks ahead to the ways that COVID-19 might fundamentally change our relationships to work, technology and government. He says Americans in particular have some important decisions to make about the role of government in our lives. \"We have to do something about the inequality that has become so dramatic in these Western societies,\" he says. \"We have to get our infrastructure in shape. We have to have a better health care system that allows poor people access to good, decent health care.\" Zakaria is hopeful for the future: \"We can't forget that human beings have choice. We are not doomed to go down the path that people think we have. And yet, nor is it guaranteed that we will make the right choices. It's all up to us.\" Zakaria says that depending on the actions we take now, \"We could well look back on these times 10 or 20 years from now and say, 'This was the turning point. We were finally able to make some of these changes.'\" On comparing how authoritarian and democratic countries have fared in the pandemic It turns out that there's a mixture of results on both sides, the democratic side and the authoritarian. So I don't want to suggest that authoritarian states are all good or bad at this. There is no question that China handled it very well overall. They mishandled it at the start, that mishandling had something to do with the secretive and repressive nature of the Chinese system. But then they pivoted and did a remarkably good job. ... But consider other dictatorships: Russia, Venezuela, Iran \u2014 they've all done terribly at it. On the other hand, with democracies, you see countries like the United States and Great Britain that have not done very well, but some of the best performing countries in the world \u2014 Taiwan, South Korea, Germany \u2014 are all democracies. And in fact, what's interesting is when you look at the Taiwanese response and you look at the South Korean response, it isn't that they used draconian powers of government very well. They did not, actually, in either of those cases, do a shutdown ever. What they did instead was very good testing and tracing. The key to stopping the growth of Covid is that when you find somebody has it, you very quickly do contact tracing and isolate those people who have it so that you are, in a sense, separating out the small number of possible infectors from the large population. ... It turns out that the intelligent democracies, because they're open, they're transparent, may be the best performers of them. On how lean, adaptable governments seem better able to respond to the pandemic It's not the quantity of government, it's the quality. Fareed Zakaria The 20th century was consumed by this huge debate originating in, of course, the debate between capitalism and communism on the size of the government. How big should your government be? And it's an important debate and it has important dimensions. But I think it is obscured something very important that is getting highlighted in the 21st century, which is it's not the quantity of government, it's the quality. Fareed Zakaria's previous books include The Post American World.\n\n                    \n                    Jeremy P. Freeman/WW Norton\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fareed Zakaria's previous books include The Post American World. It's the fact that these governments in East Asia are very lean. They are very responsive. They spend a lot of time trying to adopt best practices and they have managed to do it at a much cheaper cost than governments in Europe, by and large. One of the things you realize in all of those places is that the governments are very attentive to learning. They learn from failure. They learn from their mistakes. For example, during SARS many of these governments in East Asia did not handle the SARS epidemic that well. And they immediately asked themselves, what can we do better? How do we do it differently? And that level of responsiveness is not something you tend to see in the American system in particular, where we have this idea that we are the best of everything. Why do we need to learn from anyone? So it turns out that ability to be an intelligent, aggressive, supple, those things are much more important than how large the government is. On how the erosion of trust in the U.S. government has hurt America's ability to respond to a crisis The United States is born in an anti-statist revolution and has always had a suspicion of government. This is an anti-statist country. In its inception, even the British colonists in their own way had some of this DNA as part of their makeup. So it's always been a struggle. Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized the country by creating, for the first time, an activist federal government that saw itself as having the responsibility of the economic welfare of its people. What happened in more recent years ... is that ever since Ronald Reagan, you have had this deliberate attack on the federal government as corrupt, inefficient, dysfunctional, when it really wasn't. ... What happens with Reagan is you begin this assault on government. He said [in his 1981 inaugural address], \"Government is not the solution to our problems. Government is the problem.\" ... All that has taken an enormous toll coupled with the defunding of government agencies. We don't recognize this because the number is obscured because Social Security, Medicare and the Defense Department have all gone up so much. But the other functions of government have either stayed the same as the population has doubled or they have actually been cut dramatically. ... [Former adviser to Donald Trump] Steve Bannon ... said the goal of the Trump revolution is to deconstruct the administrative state. Well, if that's your goal, guess what? When you have a pandemic, it's not going to function very well. On the pandemic's effect on global inequality There's no question in my mind that the effect of COVID-19 and the pandemic is going to be to substantially increase inequality around the world, both within a country, but also among the countries of the world. So let's just take global inequality: India and China have been growing faster and as a result, 400 to 500 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20, 25 years. That whole process is now being arrested and perhaps being reversed because the lockdowns, the paralysis, the great recession that are taking place everywhere in the world. This is affecting the person who is at the bottom of the pole much, much more than it is the people at the top. The people at the top have education. They can do their work digitally. They have access to urban centers. They're doing fine. It is the people at the bottom who are suffering the most. And so you are going to see massive rises in poverty in places like India, probably a little bit less so in China, because they have managed to get their economy back. Many of these countries, by the way, cannot do what the United States can do, which is to print money and to print money in its own currency and issue debt, so they will be doubly disadvantaged. But then let's take a look at the United States. ... If you look at the last four recessions and you look at the top 25 percent of earners and the bottom 25 percent, and you say during the recession, what percentage lost jobs, it turns out that for the last three recessions, the top 25 percent and the bottom 25 percent lose jobs at about the same rate. In this recession, the top 25 percent have actually stayed stable. They haven't lost many jobs. The bottom 25 percent, it's just a cratering. ... It's all the bankers, the lawyers, the people in media, we're all fine or mostly fine. But think about the restaurant workers, think about the waiters, think about the people who work in hotels, on cruise ships, in theme parks. All those people who were low-wage in any case, have seen their livelihoods destroyed. And this massive acceleration and exacerbation of inequality is, to me, the most deeply worrying thing about what this pandemic has done. On why the federal government should step in to help the people who need it most I think that the most important piece of what the federal government can do is to stabilize these people's lives with direct aid, with the massive infrastructure spending, so that people who are in these categories, people without college educations, can can find their way forward. Look, at the end of the day, you can only do it for some transition period. But I think we should be erring on the side of helping rather than not. I understand there are concerns about the deficit and I understand their concerns about inflation and all that. But if we don't do this for the next year or two, you won't have a society. You won't have an economy that is going to function in any kind of meaningful sense. Worrying about inflation is a luxury, if you have 30 to 40 percent of the country that literally can't make ends meet. Sam Briger and Kayla Lattimore produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Updated at 10:55 a.m. ET Facebook said it won't accept any new political ads in the week leading up to the presidential election, one of several policies that CEO Mark Zuckerberg said will help ensure a fair election in November. One such measure involves deleting posts that claim people will get COVID-19 if they vote. \"This election is not going to be business as usual,\" Zuckerberg said Thursday about the vote that is now two months away. \"We all have a responsibility to protect our democracy.\" The new policies are also Facebook's latest attempt to respond to long-held criticisms over its handling of political content. Critics say the company allows a free hand to those who use the platform to mislead voters. And they accuse Facebook of applying inconsistent standards for members of the public, political figures and advertisers. Facebook is already working to help people register to vote and to clarify how the election will work during a pandemic, Zuckerberg said. And in light of the intense political antagonism in the U.S., he added that the social media company will act \"to reduce the chances of violence and unrest.\" The company recently joined Twitter in removing accounts that spread \"false stories about racial justice, the Democratic presidential campaign of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and President Trump's policies,\" as NPR's Bobby Allyn reported. Those removed accounts were linked to Russian state actors, suggesting Russia is once again seeking to influence U.S. elections with misinformation and by amplifying the differences among Americans. But there is a new wrinkle for the Nov. 3 vote, Zuckerberg said. He noted that while Facebook has removed dozens of international networks that spread bogus stories, \"we're increasingly seeing attempts to undermine the legitimacy of our elections from within our own borders.\" To address those concerns, the company and its CEO outlined several changes Thursday in how Facebook handles ads, posts and other content. If a post aims to undermine the legitimacy of the election \u2013 for instance, by \"claiming that lawful methods of voting will lead to fraud,\" Facebook said \u2013 the company will attach an informational label. A similar approach will cover any content whose goal is to delegitimize the election's outcome. Other posts would be removed outright, if they \"claim that people will get COVID-19 if they take part in voting,\" the company said. If a post doesn't go quite that far \u2013 but still seeks to use COVID-19 to suppress voter participation \u2014 Facebook will attach a link to verified information about the coronavirus. Facebook would still allow advertisers to \"adjust the targeting\" for ads that were accepted before it institutes the one-week quiet period in late October. The policy restricting new political or issue ads in the final week of the campaign season does not mean Facebook users won't see any political ads in that time. Instead, advertisers can continue running ads that have already been published and scrutinized. \"It's important that campaigns can run get out the vote campaigns, and I generally believe the best antidote to bad speech is more speech,\" Zuckerberg said, \"but in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims.\" The company's plan also includes potential measures that could be taken to rein in candidates or campaign accounts on Facebook that claim victory before final election results are in. In those cases, Facebook said, it will tack on a label that sends readers to authoritative election results, from either Reuters or the National Election Pool. The company will also limit the ability to forward content on its Messenger platform in hopes of \"reducing the risk of misinformation and harmful content going viral,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We've already implemented this in WhatsApp during sensitive periods and have found it to be an effective method of preventing misinformation from spreading in many countries,\" he added. Facebook has faced intense scrutiny over how it approaches political content and ads. Most notably, Russian operatives used the platform to spread disinformation ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. New criticisms emerged early this year, and on many fronts. When Facebook said in January that it would continue to allow political advertisers to target users, Federal Election Commissioner Ellen Weintraub responded by saying that Facebook's \"weak plan suggests the company has no idea how seriously it is hurting democracy.\" Critics also said the company fell short in its response to an inflammatory post by Trump in late May in which the president revived the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter hid its version of Trump's post behind a warning label, but Facebook declined to take such action. In the weeks that followed, members of the public and Facebook employees complained about the company's handling of racist and hateful rhetoric, leading a number of large corporations to pause their advertising on the social media platform. By late June, as NPR's Shannon Bond reported, Facebook had reversed its position somewhat, saying it would \"put warning labels on posts that break its rules but are considered newsworthy.\" Editor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.",

In the midst of the damage to public health and the global economy, the COVID-19 crisis could present an unexpected opportunity both to resolve the only hot war in Europe and to address Russian President Vladimir Putin's assault on international norms of behavior. As the spreading coronavirus and collapsing oil prices weigh increasingly on the Kremlin, the United States and its allies should offer to lift international sanctions against Russia if Putin will end his military incursions into Ukraine. President Trump and Congress can advance America's interests, and the world's, with a bold step to encourage an end to this war. The Trump administration and Congress should seize this opening. Since Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea and Donbas regions in 2014, Russian forces and their local proxies have killed 14,000 Ukrainians in Ukraine's eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Russian-led forces periodically escalate the fight, most recently in February.  The war continues to damage Russian interests, European and Western security \u2014 and a world governed by laws rather than by force of arms. The international community opposed Moscow's assaults with economic and other sanctions that have helped to depress Russian economic growth by 1% annually since 2014. The price of crude oil, a mainstay of Russia's economy, has now hit an 18-year low. Fossil fuels account for over 60% of Russian exports. The looming global recession will deliver another blow to the Russian economy. Now more than ever Russia needs a break from sanctions. Indeed, Putin used his speech to last week's Group of 20 virtual summit conference to urge a halt to all international sanctions. He called sanctions relief \"a humanitarian issue\" in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As bipartisan U.S. policy has made clear, Russia's withdrawal from its costly war in Ukraine is the way to get sanctions lifted. A withdrawal agreement would free up resources in both Russia and Ukraine to fight the virus. While years of diplomacy to end the Ukraine war have stalled, a high-level push now from the United States could break that deadlock. The coronavirus crisis could provide the Kremlin a rationale to agree. In close cooperation with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine, President Trump should propose to President Putin an end to the fighting, the return of Donbas and the international border to Ukrainian sovereignty, and the removal of the sanctions imposed on Russia for its Donbas intrusion. If Putin were willing to withdraw from Crimea, the other sanctions imposed against that illegal annexation could be lifted as well. But the major penalties are directed against Moscow's aggression in Donbas, and the West can lift those while maintaining sanctions on Moscow for its seizure of Crimea. The essentials of a deal \u2014 if not the order in which to apply them \u2014 have been set in the so-called Minsk negotiations among Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. They are a cease-fire, OSCE-verified withdrawal of Russian-led forces, return of the border to Ukrainian control, local elections and some measure of decentralized decision-making for all Ukrainian administrative regions. To ensure security in Donbas during the process, one idea is to have joint patrols by national Ukrainian police and local police still now working in occupied Donbas. That arrangement could be overseen by the OSCE and \u2014 to help ensure fair, secure elections \u2014 should be buttressed by an international peacekeeping mission. That peacekeeping force would be authorized by the United Nations Security Council and led by a neutral nation. A key requirement would be for the Ukrainian international border with Russia to be controlled by the peacekeepers rather than, as now, Russia's military. In Washington, President Trump would need congressional support to remove the sanctions on Russia, and many in Congress are rightly skeptical that the Kremlin would act in good faith. But the bipartisan consensus that imposed those sanctions in the first place should permit their carefully conditioned removal. President Trump, with support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, should be able to persuade Congress to remove the Donbas sanctions, with the explicit understanding that they would be re-imposed if Putin reneges on agreements. Those same conditions would need to underpin a consensus among the United States, its European partners and NATO allies. With bipartisan and transatlantic support, President Trump would be able to engage directly with President Putin. The looming health and economic threats of the coronavirus pushed Ukraine's parliament last week to advance controversial land-sale and bank reforms needed to qualify for crucial loans from the International Monetary Fund. Russia, which for months has played down the virus threat, followed other nations in tightly restricting people's movements out of their homes. Especially during a pandemic, it is insanity for Russian-led forces and Ukrainians to be killing each other. The Kremlin's aggression must be ended. All nations need to focus now on fighting the coronavirus, not their neighbors.",

He also encouraged people not to go to their workplaces unless absolutely necessary. In a setback for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's president said Sunday he will give centrist retired army general Benny Gantz the first chance to try to form a new government following this month's inconclusive elections. Gantz was tapped after a majority of 61 lawmakers in the 120-member Parliament told President Reuven Rivlin they support Gantz over Netanyahu. A coalition of Arab parties, including a staunchly Palestinian nationalist faction, decisively helped tip the scales by unanimously endorsing Gantz. This does not mean Gantz will automatically become Israel's next prime minister, but it gives him 42 days to try to form a government. More immediately, it gives him the upper hand in Parliament, as his party considers advancing legislation barring Netanyahu from forming a new government due to a corruption indictment against him. Netanyahu argues that the challenge of coronavirus means he should remain in office. In a tweet, he offered Gantz two options to break the political deadlock in Israel: joining a six-month emergency government with Netanyahu at the head, or a unity government that would allow Netanyahu to serve as prime minister for two more years before Gantz takes over. \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05e6\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05db\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05ea\u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05dc\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea. \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e6\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05f4\u05e8 \u05db\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d2\u05e0\u05e5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 \u05dc\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 Gantz could unseat Netanyahu by building a minority government dependent on Arab parties, but it would be an unstable coalition and would draw fierce opposition from the right-wing Netanyahu, who calls the Arab parties terror sympathizers. \"While Prime Minister Netanyahu is handling an unprecedented global and national crisis in the most responsible and measured way,\" Netanyahu's Likud party said in a statement, \"Gantz is rushing to a minority government dependent on ... terror supporters instead of joining a national emergency government that will save lives.\" About 20% of Israel's population comprise Palestinian Arab citizens inside the country's borders. This month's inconclusive elections left Netanyahu's political future uncertain, but the coronavirus crisis offered some relief to Netanyahu on Sunday: his corruption trial was postponed due to emergency measures taken in response to coronavirus, drawing accusations from Netanyahu's rivals that he is extracting personal and political gain from the health crisis. Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust for his dealings with media moguls. He was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday for the opening hearing of his trial, but a panel of judges delayed it to May 24, citing a state of emergency declared by the caretaker justice minister. Justice Minister Amir Ohana, a Netanyahu loyalist, claimed no political interference. Emanuel Gross, professor emeritus of law at Haifa University in Israel, said in an interview with NPR that he believed coronavirus concerns were a legitimate reason to delay the trial. But critics raised eyebrows as the justice minister last week expanded his powers enabling him to freeze the courts due to a health crisis, then around 1 a.m. Sunday issued a freeze on non-urgent court hearings for 24 hours, which is liable to be extended. \"The delay of the trial at this time does not hurt Benjamin Netanyahu, and the rest you can understand yourself,\" wrote former state prosecutor Eran Shender in an op-ed. The delay in Netanyahu's hearing followed new restrictions Netanyahu enacted to combat the spread of coronavirus, banning gatherings of more than 10 people and closing schools, restaurants, malls, movie theaters, gyms and other non-essential public venues. Israel is also banning entry to most foreign visitors and has ordered some 30,000 Israelis into home quarantine. There are around 200 coronavirus cases in the country, most of them mild. Netanyahu came under additional criticism for seeking to use surveillance technology to track virus carriers, a move that would impinge on Israelis' privacy. The government on Sunday approved tracking Israeli coronavirus carriers' cellphones to determine who they may have come in contact with. \"We are in the midst of an emergency, but this doesn't mean that turning Israel into a surveillance state is justified,\" said Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler of the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute. Gantz on Sunday appeared unwilling to give Netanyahu a lifeline to stay in office. \"Netanyahu, don't try to manipulate the citizens of Israel,\" Gantz tweeted. \"If you're interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an 'emergency unity' outline to the press.\" Moshe Yaalon, Netanyahu's former defense minister turned political rival in Gantz's Blue and White coalition, accused Netanyahu of \"cynically taking advantage of the corona crisis for personal political needs of a defendant before trial.\" In a separate tweet, Yaalon wrote, \"Blue and White cannot be a partner to the destruction of democracy in our country by a defendant fleeing trial.\"",

Rand Paul, R-Ky., which may have revealed the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Senators weighing impeachment charges against President Trump spent Thursday firing questions at lawyers as they did the day before, just as the prospect of former national security adviser John Bolton's appearance as a witness continues to stoke speculation. The Senate will enter its next phase Friday \u2014 considering whether to allow witnesses and evidence. The president faces two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to accusations that he held up military aid to Ukraine until the country announced investigations into potential political rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Late Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins said she would vote in support of allowing witnesses: I will vote in support of the motion to allow witnesses and documents to be subpoenaed.  My full statement: https://t.co/VuhZv6CO5e pic.twitter.com/LhQlnvPaoc Democrats need four Republicans to support their push for witnesses. On Thursday night at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, days ahead of the caucuses Monday, President Trump took jabs at House Managers prosecuting him over alleged abuse of office and obstruction of Congress. \"Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax,\" said Trump to a booing crowd. \"We're having probably the best years we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people? I got impeached. They impeached Trump,\" Trump said. \"That's not gonna work. Watch. Just watch,\" Trump said. \"They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government. That's not happening.\" Roberts refuses early question U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, presiding over the trial, refused to read a question from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. \"The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,\" Roberts said. It is believed that Paul's question would have identified the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the House's impeachment investigation of Trump. The person's identity is protected by law, and neither Roberts nor Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., want it to be in the official trial record. McConnell had urged senators to be respectful of Roberts, who is supervising the trial as specified in the Constitution while also attempting to keep above the partisan aspects. \"Madness\" House impeachment manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took issue with the wide view of presidential powers put forth by Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz on Wednesday. In response to a question about whether a quid pro quo in the foreign policy arena was ever appropriate, Dershowitz said, \"Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest.\" He added, \"If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\" After wide condemnation by Democrats and on social media, Dershowitz said his comments were misinterpreted. But Schiff declared, \"That way madness lies, if we are to accept the president essentially can do whatever he wants.\" \"Join us\" The answer to one question posed by Republican senators must have brought joy to the president's ears. Asked whether the president has the best interests of Americans and their families in mind, Trump attorney Eric Herschmann recited a litany of positive economic statistics in what may have sounded like a Trump reelection ad. \"There are more than 7 million jobs created since the election. Illegal border crossings are down 78% since May, and 100 miles of the wall have been built. The unemployment rate is the lowest in 50 years,\" he said. Turning to the House managers, he concluded, \"Maybe we could even get more done. Let's try something different now. Join us. Join us. One nation, one nation, one people.\" Sen. Warren considers chief justice's position Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had a sharply worded question for the House managers. \"At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court and the Constitution?\" Schiff answered by first saying, \"The chief justice has presided admirably.\" He added that the country \"does deserve a fair trial,\" which, for Democrats, means calling witnesses. \"If they don't get that fair trial, it will just further a cynicism that is corrosive to this institution and to our democracy,\" Schiff said. Acquittal at hand? The Senate is expected to finish the 16 hours of written questions on Thursday night. On Friday, the Senate is expected to convene at 1 p.m. ET and have up to four hours of debate \u2014 equally divided between the managers and president's counsels \u2014 on whether to consider more evidence or witness testimony. It is possible that at the end of that debate (or any time during or thereafter), the Senate will go in to closed session for private deliberation on the witness question. Only in closed deliberation can they speak to one another on the floor. There is no time limit for closed deliberations. If the motion to consider more evidence is approved \u2014 a 51-vote majority is required \u2014 then senators can offer motions on which witnesses and documents they want to subpoena. A 50-50 tie fails. Technically, the presiding officer, Roberts, could move to break a tie, but he is not expected to insert himself into a political process. Loading... If the motion fails, there are still any number of procedural motions Democrats could offer, and there is potential for another long series of votes. For example, Democrats could offer motions requesting more time to debate, but these would likely be delaying tactics or protest votes that will not affect the outcome. When the lawmakers are done debating all motions, the Senate will then vote on each article of impeachment. Those votes could occur as early as Friday evening. Republicans would like Trump to be acquitted by then, but Democrats are working to recruit enough members to support bringing in witnesses to testify. That effort is flagging, senators say. \"The momentum is clearly in the direction of moving to final judgment on Friday,\" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. \"We still have a couple members who said they want to listen to answers to questions, but that's where the momentum is in the caucus right now.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tried to walk a tightrope when he gave his assessment on the possibility of bringing in witnesses. \"Probably no,\" Schumer told reporters on Wednesday. \"But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.\" Democrats need to persuade at least four Republicans to cross party lines in order to lock in enough votes to subpoena witnesses. Among the most-discussed potential witness is Bolton, who has drawn attention because of a report in The New York Times that he wrote in a forthcoming book that the president had directly linked the aid for Ukraine to an investigation of the Bidens. Speaking before Thursday's session, Schiff said the Trump administration has \"gone to extraordinary lengths to put a muzzle on John Bolton to avoid calling him as a witness, to avoid letting the American people hear what he has to say.\" Another House manager, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, left the door open to the possibility that the House may subpoena Bolton if the Senate doesn't. \"We will see,\" Nadler said. Republicans' witnesses If the door does open to witnesses, Republicans have indicated they would like to call people such as Hunter Biden, who had served on a Ukrainian energy company board. Republicans might also call the whistleblower. Asked what kind of delay witnesses would add to the trial, Trump defense lawyer Jay Sekulow said \"months.\" \"This would be the first of many weeks.\" In this image from video, House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., speaks during the impeachment trial in the Senate. Schiff's stance is that \"you can't have a fair trial without witnesses.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Senate Television via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this image from video, House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., speaks during the impeachment trial in the Senate. Schiff's stance is that \"you can't have a fair trial without witnesses.\" But Schiff bristled at this argument, saying Trump's defense team is exaggerating the delay to discourage senators from supporting calling witnesses, including Bolton. \"You can subpoena John Bolton,\" Schiff said. \"Don't be thrown off by this claim, 'Oh, if you even think about it, we are going to make you pay with delays like you've never seen. We're going to call witnesses that will turn this into a circus.' It shouldn't be a circus. It should be a fair trial. You can't have a fair trial without witnesses.\" Some Republicans have been discussing a possible deal involving a witness-for-witness swap, in which Bolton might be exchange for Biden. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that if Republicans are able to call just one witness, it will be Biden. \"Because he's incredibly relevant to whether or not President Trump had a reason to believe that corruption was afoot in the Ukraine,\" Graham told reporters on Wednesday. The speaker: This will leave a mark At her weekly news conference on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said nothing can remove the asterisk Trump will now carry after having been impeached by the House. Trump \"will not be acquitted,\" she said. \"You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial. You don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation. I would hope that the senators, if it comes to a tie or if there's a question of hearing testimony or receiving documents, they would leave it up to the chief justice.\" Pelosi also said she was \"very proud of our managers,\" saying they have been \"magnificent custodians of the Constitution.\" NPR's Brakkton Booker, Lexie Schapitl and Claudia Grisales contributed to this report.",

A divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the decision late Wednesday, reversing a lower court order that stopped Trump from using $3.6 billion in U.S Defense Department money to construct the long-promised border wall. The court noted that in July, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a similar freeze on a separate source of military funding that Trump would like to use to pay for border barriers. \"The Government is entitled to the same relief here,\" wrote the three-judge panel in the opinion. On Thursday, the White House welcomed the court's action, calling the nationwide injunction put in place by the lower court \"illegitimate.\" \"This is a victory for the rule of law. We are committed to keeping our borders secure, and we will finish the wall,\" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Opponents say pulling money that was approved by Congress for other military projects in order to pay for border wall construction is an abuse of power. Administration officials insist the maneuver became legal after Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border in February 2019. Under the declaration, Trump officials say, they have the right to reallocate military construction funding for more urgent projects, such as the 450 miles of border wall that Trump says he wants built by the end of the year. When the president declared the national emergency over border security, he ordered federal agencies to find $6.7 billion in funding from other government projects to finance construction. The declaration also created a path to another source of border wall funding: money collected in drug interdiction efforts. In essence, Trump's declaration enabled him to draw billions more dollars beyond the $1.3 billion that Congress specifically authorized for border wall funding. Trump had previously requested $5.7 billion from lawmakers, but Democrats balked at the price tag. In the 2020 spending package passed in December, Congress maintained border wall funding at $1.3 billion, far below Trump's request, which he had upped to $8.6 billion. White House officials are hopeful that drawing funds from other projects appropriated by Congress will raise enough money to pay for the wall. Critics highlight how then-candidate Trump often declared ahead of the 2016 presidential election that Mexico would pay for the border wall. Building a wall along the border with Mexico was one of the central proposals of his immigration plan when running for president, and it is a policy the president still often cites to fire up crowds at rallies. Trump tapped his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to help speed up completion of the wall, but the project has been plagued by delay. And protracted legal battles are not the only thing slowing down construction. The government has found the process of seizing private land for the border wall to be vexing, leading critics to question whether Trump will get anywhere near those hoped-for 450 miles of new border barriers. Lawyers for El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights, who originally sued over the controversial funding mechanism, suggested that the legal fight isn't over. \"We're confident the district court's ruling that the president can't usurp Congress's power on this spending decision is correct,\" said Kristy Parker, a lawyer for the Protect Democracy Project, which is representing groups that sued the administration. \"Even though border wall construction can move forward for now, we expect that in the end, the people of El Paso and the border community will prevail,\" Parker said. On Thursday, Trump sent out a victorious tweet following the appeal court's order: \"The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just reversed a lower court decision & gave us the go ahead to build one of the largest sections of the desperately needed Southern Border Wall, Four Billion Dollars. Entire Wall is under construction or getting ready to start!\" NPR's John Burnett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "World leaders are congratulating President-Elect Joe Biden on his victory and they include some who have been close allies of President Trump.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In his victory speech last night, President-elect Joe Biden noted that U.S. elections are viewed far beyond our borders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Tonight, the whole world is watching America. And I believe at our best, America's a beacon for the globe. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The world is indeed watching, in some cases holding off on congratulating Biden just yet in a bid to avoid being collateral damage. For instance, Mexico's president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has flat-out said he will not congratulate Biden, at least not until, quote, \"all legal matters have been resolved.\" But some leaders around the world, even some controversial allies of President Trump, have been congratulating the president-elect. Given Saturday's big news, where do America's trade and security partners and challengers like Middle Eastern and European countries and China stand? We're going to check in now with NPR correspondents who cover those places. Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem. Eleanor Beardsley is in Paris. And John Ruwitch is currently watching China from California. Welcome to you all. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Thanks. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'm going to start with you, Daniel, because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is perhaps Donald Trump's closest world ally. He congratulated Biden by tweet. What did he say? ESTRIN: Right. He said he's had a warm personal relationship with Biden for almost 40 years and that Biden is a good friend of Israel. He also tweeted his thanks to Trump. And Netanyahu weighed in much longer after other leaders did. That could be because Netanyahu has been very close to Trump. Remember, Netanyahu has been very closely aligned with not only Trump, but the GOP - his evangelical base as well. Also, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, congratulated Biden, and Palestinians expect Biden to be much friendlier to them than Trump was. They hope that Biden will restore, for instance, the U.S. aid that Trump cut. GARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump also had close ties with some Arab leaders. I'm thinking Saudi Arabia in particular. But where has that stood? Who's congratulating Biden? ESTRIN: Well, several Arab leaders have. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi claims he was the very first leader to congratulate Trump four years ago, and he very quickly has congratulated Biden now. You know, Trump was very supportive of Sisi, despite his record of human rights abuses, and now Sisi's positioning himself to seek favor with Biden. We also heard from the United Arab Emirates congratulating Biden. And remember, the UAE gave Trump a big boost and agreed to open diplomatic relations with Israel. Now, the one country we have not heard from yet is Saudi Arabia. The crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was very close to Trump, especially close to his son-in-law Jared Kushner. You know, Trump was accused of giving the Saudis a free pass about the war in Yemen, about human rights abuses, the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And Biden has made it very clear throughout his campaign that he would reassess the U.S. relationship with the Saudis. And here we are. You know, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia congratulated the president of Tanzania yesterday for reelection - crickets on Biden, however. GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. Eleanor, you're in Paris, and there's a little more of a consensus in Europe, where Trump has had strained relations with many of their leaders, right? BEARDSLEY: Absolutely, Lulu. You know, there's huge relief among Europe's main democracies - supporters of multilateralism like France and Germany. President Macron of France reached out immediately by Twitter and said, let's work together again. Chancellor Angela Merkel said, our trans-Atlantic friendship is indispensable if we're to deal with the major challenges of our time. And even the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, tweeted, welcome back, America, an allusion to us rejoining - you know, the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate accord. You know, remember, Emmanuel Macron was the first leader in Europe to really reach out to Trump. He tried to, as he said, keep him within the community of nations. He wined and dined him in the Eiffel Tower. He gave him that Bastille Day military (inaudible), but none of it worked. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord anyway. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what does Biden offer that's new to some of these longtime U.S. allies? BEARDSLEY: Well, aside from, you know, disagreement over the climate accord, you know, Trump tore up the Iran nuclear agreement that the Europeans had so meticulously negotiated. They had much faith in it. He also regularly criticized NATO, which has been a pillar of U.S.-European relations since 1949 when it was founded. You know, he said that the Europeans weren't paying their fair share. He even threatened to pull out. He had just a range of disdainful comments about his - you know, America's supposed allies. So Europeans say a Biden presidency means a return to statesmanship and decorum and normalcy in relations between the trans-Atlantic allies. And one concrete example - Biden has already said that the day he takes office, he will bring the U.S. back into the Paris climate accord. GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. And now we're going to turn to China because this has, of course, been a signature relationship for the Trump administration. John, what have we heard from China? JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: We have heard nothing from China yet. Other major capitals in Asia have weighed in. We've heard from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, but not China. Chinese state media has run a few stories about the news out of the U.S., but nothing from the government. Four years ago - so this stands in contrast - when Trump was elected, they were pretty quick. Xi Jinping, leader - the leader of China, offered congratulations. But this time around, it's obviously different, right? Trump hasn't conceded. The domestic political situation in America is pretty fluid. And China sees that. They're playing it very cautiously, and they don't want to be seen as interfering. One more thing that I think may be on their mind is that they don't want to antagonize Trump. He's got over two months left in office. U.S.-China relations have been pretty rocky and in freefall, basically, for the second half of this year, and they really don't want things to worsen. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Well, looking forward, Trump has claimed throughout the campaign that Biden would go easy on China. Biden has denied that. What do you see happening here? Do Chinese leaders have doubts about him? RUWITCH: Yeah, there is - you know, the backdrop is that there's growing bipartisan agreement here in the U.S. - right? - for the need to face China as a competitor and to do it with strength. And on the campaign trail, Biden said he'd do that on trade, on intellectual property, human rights, a range of other issues. And his rhetoric has showed it. He knows Xi Jinping, leader of China. They met several times when they were both vice presidents, and they reportedly got along. But lately he's been calling Xi a, quote, \"thug.\" You know, I think a Biden administration's likely to have more discipline in its approach to China. Trump was a bit scattershot. Biden on the campaign trail has pledged to coordinate with allies, you know, in applying pressure on China. That means Europe, which we just heard about, and friends in Asia. He's going to reengage with multilateral organizations, but it's not going to all be adversarial. The Biden administration will be looking for areas where they can cooperate with China, like in controlling the pandemic and on climate change. So China may get more stability... GARCIA-NAVARRO: And North Korea. RUWITCH: And North Korea, exactly. China may get a bit more stability and predictability, but Biden won't necessarily be a pushover. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That is NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris with John Ruwitch here in the U.S. and Daniel Estrin from Jerusalem. All over the world, our correspondents. Thank you all very much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. RUWITCH: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "The Trump administration is scrambling to build as much of the border wall as it can before the Biden administration begins.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: OK. With Joe Biden on his way to the White House, what's to become of Donald Trump's controversial wall along the U.S.-Mexico border? Biden said this when I interviewed him last August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But it is not his administration yet. And as NPR's John Burnett reports, the Trump administration is going full steam ahead. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: By all accounts, Trump's border wall builders are hurrying to get as many miles completed before the next president could cancel their contracts. In Guadalupe Canyon and the Coronado National Memorial in southern Arizona, work crews are dynamiting the sides of pristine mountains and bulldozing access roads in this stunning landscape. LAIKEN JORDAHL: And every single day, the Department of Homeland Security continues to dynamite, to blow up, these rugged mountains in order to clear a path for a wall that, in all likelihood, will never be built. BURNETT: Laiken Jordahl is with the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson. JORDAHL: So now it's just destruction for destruction's sake. BURNETT: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the wall project, said it expects contractors to continue work and, quote, \"it will not speculate on actions the administration may or may not take.\" Trump has beat back nearly every court challenge to his signature border wall. Currently, 11 different contractors are at work on 27 separate construction contracts, including the ones in Arizona. Fifteen billion dollars has been set aside for the gargantuan project, more than the price tag for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Cranes and concrete trucks are erecting steel panels from the subtropics of the Texas Gulf all the way to the Pacific hills of San Diego. Last month, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf stood beside the wall in the Rio Grande Valley to announce the completion of nearly 400 miles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHAD WOLF: And while this is an important milestone, we're building even more wall. Currently, we have nearly 210 more miles under construction and expect to complete 450 miles by the end of this calendar year. BURNETT: And the pace is quickening even after the election. Roberto Lopez is with the Texas Civil Rights Project that represents landowners fighting the government. He says federal lawyers are now filing what's called a motion for immediate possession to aggressively seize land for the border wall. ROBERTO LOPEZ: We're still seeing filings. We're still seeing this happen. And the government isn't stopping or slowing. It seems like they're trying to speed up. BURNETT: A case in point, the Salineno Reserve (ph) in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Scott Nicol is a longtime conservation activist in the region. SCOTT NICOL: The Salineno Preserve in Starr County, which is 2 1/2 acres of some of the best bird habitat, brings in birders from all over the country and all over the world, has been acquired by the Army Corps of Engineers and is set to be destroyed for the border wall. BURNETT: After a public outcry, the owners of the preserve decided to cancel the whole deal and fight the government to keep out the bulldozers. A spokesman with Customs and Border Protection said they have no plans to stop construction of the border wall because of Biden's election. Quote, \"these barriers have proved to be a critical component in gaining operational control of the border.\" Immigration hawks want President Biden to keep building Trump's border wall. They want Biden to do the same thing that President Obama did when he allowed border fence contracts signed under President Bush to be completed. DAVID AGUILAR: It should not be a, hey, I made a political commitment. And therefore, on January 20 at 12:01, I'm shutting this down. I would have to say that's irresponsible. BURNETT: David Aguilar was chief of the Border Patrol when Obama came in. AGUILAR: What needs to happen is take a step back, take a look at what is in place and what the appropriate path forward should be. BURNETT: But Representative Henry Cuellar needs Biden to stand by his pledge not to build another foot of border wall. The Laredo Democrat says this is what he'll ask of the incoming administration. HENRY CUELLAR: One, tell the Department of Justice to stop all the condemnation suits. And the second thing is send another instruction to the Army Corps of Engineers to tell all those contractors to stop the construction of the wall. BURNETT: In Texas, where most of the border lands are in private hands, the wall's progress has been slowed down by a tedious legal condemnation process. The government has contracted 121 miles of wall in the Laredo region, but they haven't acquired a single acre to put it on. Lots of landowners fought the government in court, and the delay tactics worked, says Tricia Cortez with the local No Border Wall Coalition. TRICIA CORTEZ: Our coalition feels confident that the wall is dead and that nothing more will happen between now and the inauguration. BURNETT: That comes as a huge relief to Sacred Heart Children's Home, which is situated right on the Rio Grande. The giant barrier, with its hundred-foot-wide enforcement zone, would have plowed right through the riverside campus of the Catholic orphanage. Tomas Rodriguez Jr., a board member, says Biden's election is the answer to a prayer. TOMAS RODRIGUEZ: I'm very happy for that. The wall, it seems, will not be built. And that would help our cause 'cause we would not lose any property. And we would be able to help young boys and young girls. BURNETT: That is, if Joe Biden follows through on his promise to stop Donald Trump's wall and abandon the unfinished project in the borderlands. John Burnett, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "President Trump wants to send more federal law enforcement officials to cities to fight violent crime \u2014 as a part of his \"law and order\" message to suburban voters ahead of the election.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump is promising to send more federal law enforcement officials to fight crime in cities like Chicago and Albuquerque. The effort is known as Operation Legend, and it's named after a 4-year-old boy killed in Kansas City last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today I'm announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime. We'll work every single day to restore public safety, protect our nation's children and bring violent perpetrators to justice. SHAPIRO: This expansion comes as President Trump ramps up his law-and-order election messaging, a strategy to appeal to white voters. Here to break it down for us is NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson and Mara Liasson, national political correspondent. Welcome to both of you. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Thanks. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: Carrie, to begin with, what's the administration actually doing? JOHNSON: The Trump administration is going to be sending federal money and law enforcement officers from the Justice Department to two cities, Chicago and Albuquerque. These will be people from the FBI, the DEA, the ATF and the U.S. Marshals. Ari, this is a bread-and-butter law enforcement initiative, the kind that both President Trump and President Obama have launched in recent years. Overall, you know, crime is at or near historic lows, but there's a big violence problem in some cities. Homicides in Kansas City, where this operation began, this month are up 40%. Just yesterday in Chicago, 15 people were shot at a funeral. Homicides are there up 50% or so. Anything the feds can do to help fight crime in Chicago would be welcome. But the Chicago mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has been saying she doesn't want an occupying force or secret agents. She wants partners. SHAPIRO: Yeah. The question is what exactly these forces will be doing. There's been a lot of concern from communities that the president's overstepping his powers. Does he have the authority to do what he's announcing today? JOHNSON: Yeah. By and large, yes. The feds work with state and local governments on task forces to fight drugs and gun crimes and gangs all the time. Here's Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM BARR: This is a different kind of operation, obviously, than the tactical teams we used to defend against riots and mob violence. And we're going to continue to confront mob violence. But the operations we're discussing today are very different. They are classic crime-fighting. JOHNSON: So you just heard the attorney general go out of his way to say this is not what we've seen in Portland that's been attracting so much criticism and so many legal questions about probable cause and the Constitution. Now, mayors and district attorneys in some of these cities have said they want to hear about it if the feds are acting in aggressive ways like that. They're taking what seems to be kind of a trust-but-verify approach right now. SHAPIRO: Mara, from a political perspective, why is the president talking about this right now? LIASSON: That's a good question because this situation has been happening for this 3 1/2 years that the president has been in office. But as you said, he's running for reelection on a law and order message. And even though today was not about sending federal agents into Democratic-led cities to quell riots - as Bill Barr just said, this is traditional crime-fighting, investigating murders, et cetera - it's all part of the same message. And the president did conflate the two today when he linked calls to defund the police to the rise in violent crime. There's no evidence that those two things are linked, but it gave him an opportunity to push back against one of his favorite targets, which is the movement to overhaul policing in the wake of demonstrations all across the country after George Floyd's murder. So I think the bottom line is the president is behind in the polls. He thinks a law-and-order message is effective for his base and maybe even beyond it. SHAPIRO: Is it effective? I mean, is it likely to win over suburban voters, for example? LIASSON: Well, that's the question. He needs to get suburban voters. They're 50% of the electorate. He's way behind in the suburbs. But there are some risks. Even though this is a real problem, there is a real crime problem in these cities, but what if he doesn't solve it? What if the murder rate doesn't go down after he surges hundreds of federal officers into these cities? Does he own the problem? There are other political risks. What if suburban voters are more afraid of COVID than they are of rioters or inner-city crime? What if there's a big peaceful pushback? You know, Carrie said that some of these mayors and governors don't want federal agents in there fighting with rioters. There have been lawsuits. I think in any event, the president gets the b-roll that he wants for campaign commercials, he gets the issue of law and order front and center, and he gets the pictures of camouflaged federal agents fighting against protesters. It's a little bit like when he sent the military to the border in 2018 during the election cycle to protect America from what he said then was a dangerous caravan of criminal, illegal immigrants. SHAPIRO: Carrie, what does Attorney General Bill Barr bring to this issue? JOHNSON: Ari, we heard at the White House today a little reminiscing from Attorney General Barr. Remember; the last time he ran the Justice Department was in the early 1990s when crime was a big problem. He mentioned that today. He also mentioned relatives of some of the victims of recent violent crimes were in the audience at the White House, including the mom and other family members of Legend, the 4-year-old boy who was killed while he was sleeping in Kansas City last month. SHAPIRO: Is there any sense that this could expand to other U.S. cities? JOHNSON: It definitely could. The president - President Trump made a big pitch for other cities he said were too proud to reach out to the federal government for help. Certainly there are other cities that are suffering from violence. There are leaders, though, who may want to wait and see how these first partnerships work and if the Trump administration is living up to its word and helping the problem. SHAPIRO: Mara, what will you be looking for as this program expands and rolls out? LIASSON: Well, I'll be looking for how the president uses it politically. Remember; this is a tried-and-true issue for him. He has been a law-and-order guy since the 1980s. He's always made being pro-police part of his brand. And remember; during the campaign he featured Angel Families, people whose loved ones had been killed or hurt by illegal immigrants. He had them at the convention, and he featured them prominently in commercials. So I'll be watching to see if he does more of that. SHAPIRO: That is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson and NPR's justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Thank you both. JOHNSON: Thank you. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Updated at 1:19 p.m. ET A day after the Electoral College made the results official, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for their victory. McConnell joins a wave of new Republicans acknowledging the win on Monday. \"The Electoral College has spoken. So today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,\" McConnell said from the Senate floor Tuesday. \"The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.\" Biden said he spoke to McConnell after the floor remarks and had \"a good conversation.\" \"I called him to thank him for the congratulations, told him that while we disagree on a lot of things there's things we can work together on,\" Biden told reporters traveling with him to Georgia. He said he and McConnell agreed to get together soon. \"I'm looking forward to working with him,\" Biden said. McConnell's comments come more than a month after election results showed the Democratic win. Several moderate members of the GOP had already congratulated the president-elect in those first days and weeks, with more members joining them in recent days. McConnell also took the opportunity on the floor to recognize Harris' historic win as the next vice president. \"I also want to congratulate the vice president-elect, our colleague from California, Sen. Harris,\" McConnell said. \"Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice president-elect for the very first time.\" McConnell made the remarks at the tail end of a speech on the Senate floor, acknowledging all of President Trump's accomplishments over the last four years \u2014 from new judges to progress building a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border to gains for the military. \"The list of American accomplishments since 2016 is nearly endless,\" McConnell said. \"It would take far more than one speech to catalog all the major wins the Trump administration has helped deliver for the American people.\" McConnell also closed out his remarks that it was time to end the Trump administration on a positive, bipartisan note. \"I look forward to finishing out the next 36 days strong with President Trump,\" he said.",

Updated at 4:53 a.m. ET Saturday The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday night rejected an eleventh hour challenge to Joe Biden's election as president. The court's action came in a one-page order, which said the complaint was denied \"for lack of standing.\" Texas, supported by President Trump, tried to sue Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan, claiming fraud, without evidence. But in order for a state to bring a case in court, especially the Supreme Court, a state must show it has been injured. In essence, the court said Texas could not show that it was injured by the way other states conducted their elections. \"Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections,\" the court wrote. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that in their view the court does \"not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.\" But the two said that while they would have allowed the filing of the complaint, they would not have granted Trump or Texas any of the relief they sought. Kevin McCarthy, the top ranking Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, had earlier in the day attached his name to 125 fellow House Republicans who supported Trump's longshot bid. McCarthy was the most notable member of Congress to back the suit. On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued four states where Biden  had been certified the winner: Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The suit, filed directly in the Supreme Court, was styled as \"an original\" case, pitting one state against another. Paxton claimed that the targeted states made changes to election procedures  due to the pandemic that violated federal law. He alleged the changes enabled voter fraud. And he asked the Supreme Court to extend the Dec. 14 deadline for the Electoral College electors to cast ballots in those four states, contending more time was needed to allow investigations of the election results. Paxton's suit came in the face of repeated findings by state officials, including Republican state officeholders, certifying the results, as well as statements by U.S. Attorney General William Barr that the Justice Department did not find evidence of widespread fraud in this year's election. The Texas suit set in motion a cascade of legal motions at the high court. Not only did President Trump seek to join the Texas suit, so did 17 other states \u2014 all overwhelmingly won by Trump. More support would follow, including the brief filed by a majority of the GOP members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Late Thursday the four targeted states struck back in briefs filed in the Supreme Court. \"Texas invites this court to overthrow the votes of the American people and choose the next president of the United States,\" wrote Georgia Attorney General Christopher Carr, chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. \"That Faustian invitation must be firmly rejected,\" he said. \"Georgia did what the Constitution empowered it to do,\" the state's brief said.   It \"implemented processes for the election, administered the election in the face of logistical challenges brought on by Covid-19, and confirmed and certified the election results \u2014 again and again and again. Yet Texas has sued Georgia anyway.\" Pennsylvania was equally acerbic. \"The court should not abide this seditious abuse of judicial process, and should send a clear and unmistakable signal that that abuse must never be replicated,\" it said in its brief. And Wisconsin said the Texas bid \"to nullify [Wisconsin's] choice [for president] is devoid of a legal foundation or factual basis.\" It was unclear how or why Paxton, the Texas attorney general, decided to carry  Trump's water in the case. Especially since all four targeted states have Republican-controlled legislatures, and to date, both state and federal courts at lower levels, including Trump-appointed judges, have found the fraud allegations baseless. The unprecedented nature of the Paxton suit, plus the fact that the state's chief appellate lawyer, Kyle Hawkins, did not sign the Texas brief as he usually would do, has spurred speculation that Paxton is seeking a pardon. He is currently under indictment over securities fraud, and is being investigated by the FBI on bribery and abuse of power allegations. Although the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over disputes between states,  such cases are rare, and are almost exclusively confined to disputes that can't be handled by other courts, such as those over borders or water rights. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court rejected an effort to block Pennsylvania from certifying its election results in favor of Biden. Trump distanced himself from the legal blow and hitched his wagon instead to the Texas lawsuit, calling it \"the case that everyone has been waiting for.\" We will be INTERVENING in the Texas (plus many other states) case. This is the big one. Our Country needs a victory! Trump reportedly had conversations with some of the Republican attorneys general who were meeting this week in Washington, urging them to support the Texas lawsuit. And several news organizations reported that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had agreed to represent Trump in the event the Supreme Court had agreed to hear the case. Initial reaction to the Texas suit, however, has been dismissive at best. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told CNN that he \"frankly struggle[d] to understand the legal theory\" of the suit, noting that election disputes in our system are \"decided at the state and local level and not at the national level.\" The Texas suit had other problems. First was the question of legal standing. Essentially, how do Texas, or the states joining it, have legal standing to complain about the procedures for voting and counting votes in other states? Next, the Texas lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to delay the vote in four targeted states, but as professor Edward Foley of the Moritz College of Law observed, the date for electors to cast their votes is set by federal law under the Constitution, which requires that the day \"shall be the same throughout the United States.\" The date chosen by Congress this year is Dec. 14. Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called Paxton's lawsuit \"dangerous garbage.\" \"This is a press release masquerading as a lawsuit,\" he wrote. \"It's too late for the Supreme Court to grant a remedy even if the claims were meritorious (they are not),\" he wrote. On Friday evening after the decision, Hasen wrote that the fact that \"courts across the nation, with both Democratic and Republican judges, held the line for the rule of law\" is \"something really to celebrate.\" Benjamin Ginsburg, a longtime election law guru for the Republican Party, told CNN on Wednesday that he didn't think \"for an instant\" that the Supreme Court would consider taking up the case. That said, with three Trump appointees on the court, and a newly strengthened 6-3 majority of conservative Republican-appointed justices, the president apparently believed that the Supreme Court would view the case differently than did \"election experts.\" He was wrong. Trump later weighed in on the decision on Twitter. \"The Supreme Court really let us down,\" he wrote. \"No Wisdom, No Courage!\" The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage! Barring unforeseen events, the result of the court's action is that on Monday, the Electoral College delegates in each state will cast their ballots, and Biden will formally become the president-elect, with only one more step, in the House of Representatives where the Electoral College votes are certified, before he is sworn in on Jan. 20.",

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler on Saturday, in Valdosta, Ga., ahead of a crucial runoff election that will decide who controls the U.S. Senate. At his first campaign rally after losing the election, President Trump sent mixed messages to Republican voters in Georgia on Saturday night, repeating false claims that the election was rigged while encouraging them to vote in a Jan. 5 runoff that will decide control of the U.S. Senate. Trump, who lost Georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes after an audit and a recount, told the crowd in Valdosta near the Florida border that supporting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the runoff would help shape the future of America. \"The voters of Georgia will determine which party runs every committee, writes every piece of legislation, controls every single taxpayer dollar,\" he said. \"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country.\" He called Perdue and Loeffler \"two of the finest people you'll ever meet\" and said they were two of his biggest supporters in Congress. If the pair lose to Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the Senate would be split 50-50, with Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote. Local and national Republicans have stressed the importance of the Georgia race as the last line of defense against a Biden administration agenda, with surrogates swarming the state on a daily basis. That included a visit by Vice President Mike Pence to Savannah on Friday, where he dismissed some calls from fringe voices on the right to boycott the election. \"I actually hear some people saying, 'Just don't vote,' \" he said. \"My fellow Americans, if you don't vote, they win.\" But the president spent most of the night repeating baseless claims of election fraud in Georgia and other states, claiming falsely that he won Georgia, Wisconsin and other states certified for President-elect Joe Biden. \"If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser,\" Trump said. \"If I lost, I would say, 'I lost,' and I'd go to Florida and I'd take it easy and I'd go around and I'd say, 'I did a good job.' But you can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob.\" Trump also mentioned a debunked allegation pushed by his attorney Rudy Giuliani that election workers in Fulton County, Ga., illegally counted \"suitcases\" full of ballots in secret after Republican monitors left for the night. Election officials say the security camera footage, seized on by the Trump campaign as alleged evidence of election fraud, did not show any processes out of the ordinary. Georgia law does not require partisan monitors to be present for vote counting to occur, and law enforcement investigators with the secretary of state's office found no evidence that improper ballots were added to the totals. Trump also said that \"phony, fake\" mail-in absentee ballots were used to \"sabotage\" the election \u2014 and then gave supporters directions to request those types of ballots for the runoff. Earlier in the day, Trump phoned Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to demand that he call the state legislature into a special session to overturn Georgia's results and order an audit of the signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. Kemp, who served as secretary of state for eight years, rebuffed the request for a special session. The governor reiterated in a tweet that he has called numerous times for a signature audit, which he's said must be legally ordered by the current secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger. Raffensperger, who voted for the president but has stood up to the mounting pressure and misinformation about the election, said auditing signatures is not necessary since they were checked multiple times before those votes were counted. Further, he said an audit would not be logistically possible for local officials who spent the past month counting 5 million ballots three times. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night after a young campaign staffer for Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Harrison Deal, and a close friend of the governor and his family, died in a car crash. The Trump campaign has filed one of several lawsuits seeking to overturn Georgia's election results, but so far no court has found evidence to warrant such a decision.",

On more than one occasion, President Trump has demonstrated his willingness to use his pardon power to pluck a political ally or associate out of legal trouble. In July, he commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and informal adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress. Last week, he pardoned his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. That has set the stage for a possible run on pardons in the closing weeks of the Trump administration. The list of Trump associates who are facing or could face federal charges is long. It is not unusual for a president to issue pardons in the waning days of an administration. Historically, at least some of those decisions have been controversial. President George H.W. Bush pardoned people ensnared in the Iran-Contra scandal on Christmas Eve 1992, not long before he was set to leave office. That move was supported by once and future Attorney General William Barr. Then, on his last day in office, President Bill Clinton pardoned the fugitive financier Marc Rich. The move immediately sparked questions, particularly since Rich's former wife, Denise Rich, had made a large donation to the Democratic Party and the Clinton Library. Federal investigators looked into the matter, but ultimately no charges were brought. Trump largely stands apart from his predecessors, however, in his willingness to grant pardons to political allies and people he knows. Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned former Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza and former New York Police Department Commissioner Bernard Kerik \u2014 who is a friend of the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Those all generated headlines and a degree of controversy, but nothing like Trump's decision to grant clemency to Stone and Flynn, two friends and advisers whose legal troubles tied back to the president himself. Stone and Flynn were charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump has long railed against the probe, calling it a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt,\" which has fueled speculation he could pardon others who were caught up in the investigation. The pardons tied to Mueller probe The first person on that list would likely be Paul Manafort, Trump's onetime campaign chairman. A jury convicted Manafort of tax and bank fraud, and he later pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in a separate but related case also brought by Mueller's team. As part of his plea deal, Manafort agreed to cooperate, but the special counsel's team said he repeatedly lied to them. Trump has already publicly mulled pardoning Manafort, although he has not taken action. An attorney for Manafort, Todd Blanche, declined to comment on questions about a possible pardon. Manafort's former deputy, Rick Gates, also was convicted as part of the Russia probe. Gates said neither he nor his lawyers have been in touch with the White House about a pardon, but he said he'd happily accept one. \"I absolutely believe the pardons would be warranted,\" Gates told NPR. \"It's the president's decision, ultimately, but I'm hopeful and would certainly be grateful if he were to issue one. And nobody knows better than him the suffering that we all kind of went through as a result of that investigation.\" Gates was charged alongside Manafort but ultimately pleaded guilty and became a key witness for investigators. He said he doesn't think his cooperation with Mueller should rule him out from Trump's consideration. \"I don't believe that the idea of my cooperation would hinder any opportunity for a pardon,\" Gates said. \"And I hope that anybody that is reviewing it does certainly understand that this was not a cooperation in the sense that it, quote, flipped on anyone.\" Another person caught up in the Russia probe was George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the 2016 campaign who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. He served a brief prison term. Critics \u2014 including one of the attorneys who took part in the Russia investigation, Andrew Weissmann \u2014 say that what they call Trump's abuse of his pardon power has kept authorities from finding out all they can about what took place. With the incentive to hold out because of the prospect of clemency from Trump, witnesses such as Manafort also had an incentive not to tell all they know, Weissmann said. The close aides The list of Trump associates potentially angling for a pardon does not end there. Steve Bannon, who helped run Trump's 2016 campaign and then became his chief strategist at the White House, is under federal indictment in New York. He and three other men are accused of defrauding people who donated to an online campaign to raise money for a southern border wall. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. Trump has tried to distance himself from the fundraising campaign, but he also could pardon the other men involved in the case, who aren't as close to Trump but who support the politics of the border wall. Giuliani, the president's personal attorney and the man spearheading Trump's baseless claims of widespread election fraud, was also under the scrutiny of federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani denies he's done anything wrong, and the current status of the federal investigation is unclear. But investigators were looking at Giuliani's business dealings and his activities in Ukraine, according to an individual familiar with the matter. The New York Times has reported that Giuliani has discussed a possible pardon for himself with the president. Giuliani told NPR in a text message the report was \"completely false.\" The family and the president There's also the possibility that Trump could preemptively pardon members of his family or even himself. Neither Trump nor his children have been charged with a federal crime, but they have faced scrutiny. The president's pardon power is broad, and it is rooted in the Constitution. The president can issue a preemptive pardon. On its website, the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney says that \"it would be highly unusual, but there have been a few cases where people who had not been charged with a crime were pardoned.\" The classic example is President Gerald Ford's pardoning of Richard Nixon, who had resigned from office but had not been charged with any crimes. As specialist attorneys told NPR's Brian Naylor, what Trump could do is pardon his children or others for activities that took place during a certain span of time, even if authorities didn't learn until later that potential crimes had been committed. The pardon would mean that the recipients couldn't be prosecuted afterward if any crimes were discovered that took place then. But the preemptive pardon wouldn't protect its recipients from prosecution by state or local authorities, and it wouldn't inoculate them against prosecutions involving wrongdoing that took place after the span of time covered in the pardon. The issue of a president pardoning himself is trickier. Trump has claimed he has the power to do so, but no president has ever tried that, and experts say it's an unsettled legal question.",

            "article_content": "President Trump insists he will never concede the election. President-elect Joe Biden picks Janet Yellen to be first female treasury secretary. Plus, an update on the coronavirus situation in Brazil.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Early Monday afternoon, thousands of people watched online as a previously obscure Michigan board did its work. DAVID GREENE, HOST: That's right. This board of two Republicans and two Democrats met to certify Michigan's election result. And after some passionate public comments, they voted to certify, as the law requires them to do. With that, President Trump's strategy to somehow win the election he lost suffered yet another blow. Also the same afternoon, his administration agreed to cooperate with the transition. The head of the General Services Administration, a Trump appointee, did not quite admit that Biden won. She did say that she had seen enough after watching more states certify and as numerous Trump lawsuits failed. INSKEEP: NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us. Good morning. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: So we should note that Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration said she delayed the transition for weeks on her own and that she decided to go ahead with the transition on her own. And then as soon as she said that, the departing president said, actually, no, he recommended it. So what did he say, for the record? RASCOE: Well, he said that he had recommended that she and her team do what needs to be done to start the process. You know, as you said, it directly contradicted what Emily Murphy, the head of GSA, what she had said because she said she came to it independently. You know, this is President Trump seeming to try to take control of a situation in which he doesn't have much control. He's still saying - he tweeted last night that he is not going to concede the elections - the election, but that doesn't carry any legal weight. The actions that the GSA took, that's what carries the legal weight. INSKEEP: How much pressure had been building on the president and the administration to move ahead? RASCOE: You know, they filed a bunch of lawsuits, but the lawsuits aren't really going anywhere. Most of them are being thrown out. As you said, Michigan certified its results. There was a big loss in Pennsylvania in federal court there. So that was drying up. And then you had Republican senators coming out and saying - putting pressure on President Trump, saying that it was time to begin the transition. You had a Republican senator from Tennessee, Senator Lamar Alexander, reminding Trump that when you are in public life, people remember the last thing that you do. And so there was this kind of growing chorus of Republicans slowly but surely saying that it was time to begin moving on. INSKEEP: Yeah. Alexander urged the president to put the country first and have a prompt and orderly transition. So the GSA - Murphy at least used the word ascertain in a letter that did not quite call Biden the president-elect but also said that they could move ahead in the event of a transition. In a practical sense, what does all that mean? RASCOE: It means that Biden's team should now have access to government office space. They'll be able to formally meet with Trump administration officials to discuss policy issues and receive some $7.3 million to pay staffers and other expenses. And, you know, this is something that the Biden team and others had really expressed a lot of concern about because up until now, they couldn't get information about national security briefings or vaccine distribution. And obviously, that's a big deal when we're in the middle of a pandemic. So they will now be able to get those types of briefings and get that information. And the Biden transition team said that this was a definitive administrative action to begin the formal transition process. They also said that this will give them the chance to gain a complete understanding of the Trump administration's efforts to, quote, \"hollow out government agencies.\" INSKEEP: Lots to come. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe, thanks so much. RASCOE: Thank you. INSKEEP: Now, President-elect Biden's early Cabinet picks suggest an emphasis on diversity. GREENE: Yeah, they sure do. So Biden is a 78-year-old white guy who was running mate to our nation's first Black president. He then chose the first Black woman on any major party ticket as his running mate. And now he says he's going to nominate a Latino to head the Department of Homeland Security, which plays a huge role in security along the Mexican border. He also chose the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence. There have not been many directors of national intelligence. That's a fairly new position. But the office of treasury secretary has existed since Alexander Hamilton's time, and Janet Yellen would be the first woman ever in that job. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to talk about Yellen's nomination. Hey there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So she's a first here and yet a very familiar name. HORSLEY: That's right. She's a barrier breaker but in a sort of reassuring way. After news of her nomination broke yesterday, the compliments came in from across the political spectrum. Wall Street basically took the announcement in stride. I think that speaks to her record. She's obviously held a number of powerful economic posts already. She led the Central Bank for four years under Presidents Obama and Trump. And she was also a top White House economist under President Clinton. She's been described as extremely competent and experienced. She's well known by other central bankers around the world, which would be helpful as treasury secretary. And she's a consensus builder, which Washington could certainly use right now. INSKEEP: What could we expect her priority to be, assuming she is confirmed by the Senate? HORSLEY: She has echoed the president-elect in saying the first job is to get control of the pandemic, which right now is out of control. You know, infections have been surging. Hospitals are filling up. Yellen told Bloomberg Television last month that that's the biggest challenge for the incoming administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET YELLEN: I think we need a much more effective effort than we've had, and if we have that, it'll be good not only for health but for being able to open up the economy. HORSLEY: In recent weeks, we have gotten some encouraging news on the vaccine front, which offers some hope for a better economy in the spring or maybe the summer. But, you know, widespread distribution of a vaccine is still months away. And in the meantime, a lot of families and businesses are going to be struggling just to get through the winter. INSKEEP: Scott, for some reason, I'm thinking of the presidential transition after the election of 1932. Franklin Roosevelt won the election. The transition went for months, and the Great Depression, which was going on, got a lot worse before Roosevelt finally took office. Now, here we are in the middle of a transition with a pandemic getting a lot worse. What is happening over the next couple of months? HORSLEY: You know, the president-elect and his team are urging Congress to pass a new round of coronavirus relief now before Biden is sworn in. Yellen has stressed that the money Congress pumped into the economy early on was really helpful, but that was only a down payment. And additional bills are now coming due. You know, just as an example, we've got 13 million people relying on emergency unemployment benefits that are set to expire in just over a month. Democrats want to see those programs extended, and they also want to see more federal help for state and local governments. INSKEEP: Isn't the outgoing administration taking away some of the options for the Federal Reserve, which has been propping up the economy? HORSLEY: Yes. Last week, the outgoing treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, decided to end some of the Fed's emergency lending programs. He basically said mission accomplished. Others say the emergency is not over yet and that taking away those tools gives one more challenge for the incoming president and his team. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley, thanks so much. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. You would think that having one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks would be terrible news for any political leader. GREENE: Right. But in Brazil, COVID has killed more than 169,000 people. And yet the nation's president is a lot more popular now than when this pandemic began. INSKEEP: How could that be? NPR's Phil Reeves is in Rio de Janeiro. Hey there, Philip. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: So we're talking about the president, Bolsonaro, but let's start with his country. How serious is the pandemic where you are? REEVES: Well, it's pretty alarming, Steve. I mean, for a long time, Brazil was stuck on this high plateau with more than a thousand deaths a day, and then they dropped by more than half. And now we're seeing numbers edging up again, particularly in the country's two biggest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Here in Rio, where I am, daily average deaths are up by more than 180% on two weeks ago. The number nationwide of confirmed cases has now crossed 6 million. And there's a report out this morning saying that scientists from a group of top Brazilian universities believe there's pretty conclusive evidence that a second wave has begun right across the country, even though government officials aren't acknowledging that. And these scientists reportedly blame several factors, including a lack of systematic testing and tracing. INSKEEP: Well, given all of that, why would President Jair Bolsonaro be so popular? REEVES: Well, you know, his message, that the economy must stay open at all costs, resonates with a lot of Brazilians, especially the multitude who live hand to mouth. But on another level, it's really simple. His government's put a lot of money in the pockets of the poor. It's made emergency aid payments to almost 70 million people. That's cost Brazil so far tens of billions of dollars. And these payments are actually agreed by Congress. But Bolsonaro has been getting the credit, and that's helped push his poll numbers up. But, you know, it is surprising when you consider his behavior when you see this rise in popularity. I mean, he's been downplaying the virus, as you know, from the get-go. He's undermined social distancing, doesn't wear a mask a lot of the time, dives into crowds. He's expressed scant sympathy for COVID-19 victims, saying everyone has to die sometime. And the other day, he told Brazilians they mustn't be a nation of sissies, although he used a homophobic Portuguese term for sissy. INSKEEP: Is he making any effort to get a vaccine now that vaccines are becoming available? REEVES: Yeah, he's particularly supporting the vaccine that's being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But his government signed up for several other vaccines under trial as well. But he's also playing politics with vaccines, like picking a fight over them. The governor of Brazil's most populous state, Sao Paulo, is promoting and helping to test the Chinese-made vaccine called CoronaVac. He's already shipped some of this in, though it's not yet approved. And that governor, Joao Doria, is a big rival of Bolsonaro's and also a potential challenger in the presidential election in a couple of years' time. Bolsonaro's railed against CoronaVac. When his own health minister tried to buy some, Bolsonaro canceled the order. When health regulators stopped the trials briefly recently, Bolsonaro called it a personal victory. So like his idol, Donald Trump, he's a populist who thinks China bashing plays to his base. INSKEEP: And is willing to put politics, apparently, above vaccines. REEVES: It seems so. INSKEEP: Philip, thanks so much. REEVES: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Philip Reeves in Rio de Janeiro. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

John Kasich, pictured in October 2018 in Washington, D.C., says that President Trump's refusal to concede is \"absurd.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ohio Gov. John Kasich, pictured in October 2018 in Washington, D.C., says that President Trump's refusal to concede is \"absurd.\" Few high-profile Republican members of Congress have publicly acknowledged Joe Biden's presidential win. And many Republican politicians have refused to denounce President Trump's legal challenges and false allegations of widespread voter fraud. John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio who was a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, said it's because Republicans are \"either in complete lockstep with [Trump] or they're afraid of him.\" \"They're afraid that they'll be primaried or they're afraid they'll be severely criticized,\" he told Leila Fadel on NPR's All Things Considered. \"And it's a pretty remarkable situation.\" He called Trump's refusal to concede \"absurd.\" Kasich endorsed Biden in the election and even spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August. \"[Biden] has clearly won this election, and it is just sort of amazing to me that Republicans just keep sitting on their hands. It makes no sense,\" Kasich told NPR. He said one of his foremost concerns about Trump's refusal to concede is how it affects the transition and the work Biden's team can do to fight the pandemic. The Biden team has been shut out from information on the government's coronavirus response, leaving it less prepared come Jan. 20. \"There should be total and complete cooperation between the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration in any variety of ways in which to deal with the distribution of the vaccine, a whole series of issues going forward.\" Kasich added that the Republican Party's part in enabling Trump is \"extremely disappointing for someone who has been a Republican all of my life.\" On if he has spoken to Republican leaders about his concerns I appear a lot on television, and my voice has been very clear and in terms of talking to Republican leaders, I haven't done that, but I've talked to them through the television because it's impossible for them to not hear what I've had to say. I have talked to Republicans who are not currently holding public office, a significant number, and some who are leaders, they basically hold the same view that I have. But again, they seem, in the Congress of the United States, to be frozen in place. Not all of them but most of them. Certainly the leadership is toeing the line. And it's a sad day. I think it was the Scorpions that wrote a song when the [Berlin] Wall came down, the \"[Wind] of Change\" was the name of the song. And we will see winds of change. They'll be blowing through shortly. On his concerns about the transition No. 1 is clearly around the issue of the pandemic and the ability to figure out a very secure, solid and speedy plan for the distribution of the vaccine. It appears as though the vaccines are right on the horizon. And it's an incredible logistical challenge to be able to distribute that to so many Americans that are going to be in a position to willingly accept the fact that they'd like the vaccine. You should have total cooperation. Also, better cooperation allows us to be in a position to get this economy moving, to understand exactly what the Trump people are going to do over the next couple of weeks so that the Biden administration can plan and prepare for a significant, hopefully, economic recovery. And then finally, the idea that the administration, as they're getting ready to go out the door, can try to implement some foreign policy actions that I think, frankly, border on irresponsible. I've always been one who's favored being able to negotiate a settlement and ultimately leave Afghanistan. But to just start willy-nilly withdrawing troops at this significant amount, I frankly think is irresponsible. So there's a foreign policy component to this as well. There needs to be coordination, that Joe Biden ought to have access to all the intelligence like has happened in all of my lifetime when we've had a presidential transition.

Updated at 11:36 a.m. ET Officials in Michigan's most populous county reversed course and certified its election results Tuesday evening, just a few hours after a surprising party-line deadlock suddenly cast the certification of more than 800,000 votes in doubt. Wayne County voted overwhelmingly for President-elect Joe Biden. The two Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers \u2014 a bipartisan foursome tasked with approving the results from a heavily populated swath of Michigan that includes Detroit \u2014 initially blocked the move to certify the votes, asserting discrepancies with the poll books in certain Detroit precincts. That meant an extremely rare 2-2 tie, which would have been sent up to the Board of State Canvassers to decide. The deadlock even earned a celebratory tweet from President Trump, who lost Michigan and the presidential election but has refused to concede. The tie did not last long, however. It stood for just about three hours under withering criticism, as residents made their complaints clear during a public comment period and local and national leaders lambasted the two members' decision online. Wayne County Commission Chair Alisha Bell, for one, called it \"an appalling outrage.\" \"They are denying justice and insulting and disregarding the will of Wayne County voters. They have neglected their responsibility by politicizing the certification process,\" Bell said in a statement issued Tuesday, adding that she was \"disappointed in the two Republican members, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann.\" Every court on the Detroit election results has ruled that Trump\u2019s claims of error were baseless.  Had the Board of Canvassers disenfranchised 1.4 million Wayne County voters over partisan politics, it would have been an historically shameful act. It\u2019s plain and simple, folks. The Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers put politics above their duty to our residents. Suggesting that all of Wayne County can be certified, EXCEPT for Detroit, is horrifying racist and a subversion of our democracy. President-elect Joe Biden carried 68% of the vote in Wayne County. And in Detroit specifically, where Palmer and Hartmann focused their objections to the results, more than 78% of the city's population is black \u2014 a point that was not lost on critics. During the Zoom meeting for public comment directly after the board's initial vote, the Rev. Wendell Anthony, head of the Detroit branch of the NAACP, called the two members a \"disgrace.\" \"You have extracted a Black city out of a county and said the only ones that are at fault is the city of Detroit, where 80% of the people who reside here are African Americans,\" he told the two Republican board members, according to The Associated Press. \"Shame on you!\" The deadlock dissolved later that evening, however, as Palmer and Hartmann reversed their votes with the reassurance of a comprehensive audit of the vote tally. With their approval, the election results in Wayne County were certified unanimously. The dust-up in Wayne County unfolded amid a nationwide effort by Trump and many of his GOP allies to push back on the results of the election. The outgoing president has claimed widespread voting fraud, without evidence, in the several of the states that he lost, including Michigan. On Wednesday, the president reiterated his claim that a \"giant scam\" robbed him of a victory in the state. \"I win Michigan!\" he tweeted. He and his allies, however, have repeatedly failed to produce evidence supporting their allegations of election fraud. That failure has spelled trouble in court for his campaign to get the election results overturned. In Michigan, an appeals court on Monday unanimously ruled against a Republican bid to invalidate the vote in Wayne County. The decision backed a lower-court ruling that found the allegations to be simply \"not credible.\" And the legal setbacks for Trump haven't been confined to Michigan's borders, either. As NPR's Pam Fessler explains, similar efforts challenging the vote in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin have failed to gain traction.",

Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who also chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, says because Democrats now hold a thin margin in the House, they have no choice but to work with Republicans. A couple of weeks ago, House Republicans were in the minority and forecasts showed that they could lose even more seats in a Democratic wave. That's not what happened. Although results continue to trickle in, the Democrats still hold the House majority, but Republicans managed to win back some competitive seats and hold on to some that they had feared losing. \"You win campaigns with great candidates, with the right message, and you've got to have enough resources,\" Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, tells All Things Considered. \"The top issues were the economy and they were safety and security or law and order. ... And we offered, I think, the best alternative, candidates, and we had the best messages depending on the districts.\" In excerpts from the interview, Emmer discusses Republican victories, whether there's room for cooperation and the results of the presidential election. How do you interpret the message of this election where Americans chose Joe Biden to be president but did not give Democrats an outright victory in Congress? One of the issues that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have is that they had a new group of elected officials join their conference two years ago who announced proudly that the socialists have arrived. You're saying you ran an election against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, the members of \"The Squad,\" freshmen members of the House? We ran an election based on far left-wing policies that included the Green New Deal, that included open borders and frankly, raising your taxes by $4 trillion. But I'm going to give you an example. Down in Florida, we won two seats ... [Florida Districts 26 and 27, where Maria Elvira Salazar defeated incumbent Donna Shalala and Carlos Gimenez defeated incumbent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell]. ... In the Miami area, where these two seats are, there's roughly 2 million Cuban expats in this country and many of them live in that area, along with Venezuelans and Colombians. They know what socialism is and they know that it ends badly. Give us a specific issue where you think the two parties can come together. When it comes to what we have put forward, whether it's on health care, whether it's on transportation, no matter what the issues are, because we're going to have such a thin margin, guess what? I think they're going to have no choice but to work with Republicans in the Congress. And I think it's going to be an interesting dynamic going forward. Very few Republicans in Congress have acknowledged that Biden has defeated Trump in the presidential race. At what point do you think that refusal to acknowledge reality begins to damage American democracy? Well, first off, I think, if you look back at Bush versus Gore, that took 37 days and it involved essentially three counties in one state. I think people can be a little patient and allow the votes to be counted. But we're talking about false claims of millions of fraudulent votes and stolen elections coming from the president of the United States. That's very different from what happened in 2000. We're talking about 200,000 to 250,000 votes that remain outstanding in Arizona, where the candidates are separated by 15,000 votes. [The Arizona Secretary of State's Office estimates the number of uncounted ballots in Arizona is currently about 58,000 as of 5:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday.] Do you personally believe that the role that the race is not yet settled? Rather than having the media make these declarations, let's allow the votes to be counted and make sure that everybody \u2014 and not everybody is going to be comfortable with the outcome, somebody wins, somebody loses \u2014 but let's allow the votes to be counted.

            "article_content": "One of the most unexpected election results happened in Texas on the U.S.-Mexico border. President Trump made inroads in the longtime Democratic stronghold and flipped one Latino county red.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: As we dig more into why Americans voted the way they did, we head to Zapata, Texas. This heavily Latino county on the U.S.-Mexico border has been reliably Democratic for generations. But this year, it flipped and went for President Trump. As John Burnett reports, what happened there underscores the difficulties Democrats have had with locking down the Latino vote and turning Texas blue. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Zapata County is a hardscrabble land of ranchers, oil field workers and bass fishermen. It's 93% Hispanic and hasn't voted Republican in a presidential race since it went for Warren G. Harding a century ago - until 2020. Trump won Zapata and did better than expected up and down the winding Rio Grande, while Biden underperformed. He carried the South Texas border counties by only 11 points, compared to Hillary Clinton's 44-point spread in 2016. Joe Gutierrez ranches and owns an oil field construction company in town. The Trump supporter inserts a plug of tobacco in his jaw and ruminates on the results. JOE GUTIERREZ: I think people are trying to wake the country up as to, you know what? Democrats don't own us. You know, like, Joe Biden said, if you vote for Trump, you're not Black. You know, you cannot put people in that situation. We're not owned by nobody - no party. BURNETT: Armed with polls and conventional wisdom, analysts counted this region solidly in Biden's bucket. After all, it has one of the worst coronavirus caseloads in the country, no thanks to White House bungling of the pandemic. Trump's border wall is very unpopular, and the president has been maligning immigrants from Day 1. And many residents down here trace their roots to Mexico. But as Tuesday showed, the border electorate defies easy categorization. CARLOS SANCHEZ: The strong showing by Trump was a pleasant surprise. BURNETT: Carlos Sanchez is a longtime journalist based in McAllen. SANCHEZ: One, it demonstrates that the Hispanic community is not monolithic in its concerns and, two, it demonstrates that the Hispanic community cannot be taken for granted. Hispanics along the border are much more conservative than people think. BURNETT: They tend to support the Border Patrol. They're deeply Catholic and generally pro-life, and they appreciate retail politics. Bill and Hillary Clinton were organizing South Texas for Democrats back in the 1970s. That helped her in 2016. A brief airport press conference in McAllen by vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris five days before the election did little to raise her ticket's fortunes. But if you had to pick one event that flipped Zapata, it was Biden's slip during the last debate when he said the country should transition away from petroleum. Texas has two prolific oil fields, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin, that are major employers in West and South Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF OIL BUBBLING) BURNETT: Chicharrones, fried pork rind, bubble in a pot inside Junior's Drive-In & Meat Market. Owner Robert Garza sells lots of rib-eyes to oil field workers. ROBERT GARZA: You know, Zapata is a small county. You know, it's based off of, I would say, about 80% oil field. And there's nothing else here that can bring the economy back up. And yeah, I know Biden's not going to stop, you know, oil field 'cause you can't stop it. But he was against fracking and stuff. And we need oil field here in town. BURNETT: Zapata County has been so Democratic there's not a single elected Republican. There's not even a local Republican Party. But 2020 might usher in a new era, says the Democratic county judge Joe Rathmell. JOE RATHMELL: If you see the Texas map, Zapata County is a red dot in a sea of blue along the river. So - but other counties showed significant support for President Trump. So, yeah, I think people will notice. BURNETT: A gleeful political adviser to GOP Governor Greg Abbott was quoted yesterday - we see real opportunity to grow the Republican brand in the Rio Grande Valley.

Democrats' long-term hopes for electoral success have long cited the growing Latino population in the country. But former Vice President Joe Biden's performance in heavily Latino areas of key states has concerned members of his party \u2014 and may have cost him Electoral College votes, according to groups and activists working to mobilize Latino voters. Nationally, Biden appears to have gotten support from roughly twice as many Latino voters as President Trump, but that support looked very different depending on where you looked in three key states with large Latino populations. Democrats were pleased with their performance in Arizona, where The Associated Press awarded Biden the state's 11 electoral votes early Wednesday morning, while anxiety ran high about the results in Florida, where President Trump's strength with conservative Cuban American voters helped secure him that state's 29 electoral votes, according to AP. And while Texas was a long shot for Biden, Democrats had seen opportunity in the explosive growth in the state's Latino population. During a post-election virtual press conference on Wednesday, leaders from groups aimed at mobilizing Latino voters expressed frustration that the votes of Latinos were not more aggressively pursued, even as they cheered record levels of turnout among Latinos in some key states. Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), said that the Biden campaign missed an opportunity in Florida and Texas. \"The Democrats cannot take Latinos for granted. I think Biden missed a grand opportunity to have been able to carry both Florida and Texas,\" he said. \"If he had just invested in the Latino community more, if he had delivered the correct message. The numbers that we've seen out of Miami-Dade is he got 250,000 less Latino votes than Hillary Clinton got.\" People attend a rally for Vice President Pence as he speaks during the Donald J.

Trump for President Latino Coalition Rollout on June 25, 2019 in Miami, Fla. President Trump's reelection campaign has aggressively courted Latino voters in Florida for years, particularly conservative Cuban Americans. Leaders in the Latino community have repeatedly stressed the diversity and complexity of the Latino vote, ranging from conservatives with more traditional social views to young liberals. There are first-generation citizens and families who have been in the United States for decades. President Trump's reelection campaign has aggressively courted Latino voters in Florida for years, particularly conservative Cuban Americans, in an effort to offset likely losses among suburban voters and seniors. Trump won a significant majority of Cuban American voters in Florida, as Republican attacks on Joe Biden and Democrats as \"socialists\" have resonated. While Trump won over Cuban Americans across the state, Biden's campaign won the other segments of the state's Latino electorate. But Biden's support among Florida's Latinos fell short of the support that Hillary Clinton carried them with in 2016. Four years ago, Clinton won Miami-Dade County, the state's largest county where nearly 7 out of every 10 residents are Hispanic, by 30 percentage points, despite losing the state. This year, Biden won it by just seven points. Biden's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told reporters on Wednesday that Biden had not underperformed among Latinos. \"We just saw Donald Trump increase his support with the Cuban American vote,\" she said. She defended the campaign's Latino voter outreach program both in Florida and nationally, citing strong Latino support in states like Arizona and Nevada. Democrats also had high hopes to turn Texas blue, due to a combination of Democratic breakthroughs in the suburbs and demographic change that they believed benefitted them, including explosive growth in the state's Latino population. Democrats in the state had been focused heavily on the Rio Grande Valley near the southern border with Mexico, but they ultimately came up short. Garcia and others pointed to Trump's victory in Zapata County, just north of the Rio Grande Valley, where voters had overwhelmingly backed the Democratic candidate in the past two presidential elections. \"It went from Hillary to Trump. Why? Because the issues of law and order are impacting Latinos quite a bit,\" Garcia said. \"For example, a lot of the border patrol, law enforcement are heavily Latino in the Rio Grande Valley. So when you are talking about defunding the police, and you don't stand up to those types of rhetoric, then it leaves an opening for Republicans to come in and take advantage of that.\" That's despite the fact that Biden vociferously opposed defunding the police, something that has support in the Democratic base. Biden's strength in Arizona was in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. Biden's campaign focused its efforts there, and drove up turnout among Latinos there, who are largely of Mexican origin. Strategists say that they believe Latinos younger than 30 to have been decisive in that state. The Trump campaign also worked to win over Latinos in this state, particularly Latino men, and the president was in the state in the closing days of the election, holding rallies despite the coronavirus pandemic.",

            "article_content": "As the world focused on the U.S. election, Israel demolished a small Palestinian village. Meanwhile, a former Israeli diplomat decried America's division as bad for Israel.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: As world attention was focused on U.S. elections yesterday, Israeli authorities carried out a controversial demolition of a small Palestinian village. Meanwhile, a former Israeli diplomat watching the elections voiced concern about the state of the U.S. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: At 11 in the morning yesterday, Israeli bulldozers arrived at a small Palestinian hamlet. It was a surprise to shepherd Yasser Abu al-Kbash. YASSER ABU AL-KBASH: (Non-English language spoken). ESTRIN: He says, \"they destroyed the shacks we lived in. They destroyed the animal pens. They erased everything.\" And he says he's, quote, \"99% certain Israel was taking advantage of the U.S. elections.\" There were no journalists around. Israel frequently demolishes Palestinian structures. But advocates say demolishing an entire hamlet of people is rare. In a written statement, Israel said the shacks were built illegally in a military firing zone. Al-Kbash says he's lived there all his life, and Israel just want them gone. The United Nations condemned the move. It released a statement saying the community is home to 74 people, including children. It's in the Jordan Valley of the West Bank. Palestinians claim it for a future state, but Israeli leaders have said they must permanently control the area because it borders Jordan. Meanwhile, there was sharp commentary on the election by recently retired Israeli diplomat Dani Dayan, who noted a schism in America. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANI DAYAN: That schism that I see in American society, in American politics - I don't believe that Donald Trump is interested in consolidating and curing the society. I am not sure Joe Biden is able to. ESTRIN: Such a critique of U.S. leaders is striking, considering he just served four years as Israel's consul general in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAYAN: And I wonder if a superpower, which is obviously Israel's most important ally, can continue to be such when based on a society that, in some senses, is disintegrating. ESTRIN: In an op-ed he published today in the major Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronot, he wrote, \"Israel needs a strong U.S. that trusts in itself.\" Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem.

Palestinian groups say another hamlet was destroyed in the same area on Tuesday. Israeli authorities demolished a rural Palestinian hamlet in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, residents and rights advocates said. More than 70 structures were destroyed, making it the largest single demolition in the past decade and the biggest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in over four years, the United Nations said. The statement said 73 people \u2014 including 41 children \u2014 lived in what it called a \"herding community.\" \"I am 99% certain this was taking advantage of the U.S. elections. ... There were no journalists around,\" Yasser Abu al-Kbash, a resident, told NPR. The 48-year-old shepherd said he had lived there all his life. \"They bulldozed everything,\" he said. Israel gave lower numbers for the structures destroyed. Khirbet Humsah, also called Humsah Al Bqai'a, was a small community in tents and shacks located in the Jordan Valley, the agricultural breadbasket of the West Bank that Palestinians claim for a future state. Israeli leaders have talked about seeking to permanently control the area for its strategic value because it borders Jordan. \"A demolition on this scale is extremely rare,\" said Amit Gilutz of B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights group that documents and opposes Israel's policies toward Palestinians. \"Everyone's attention is directed elsewhere.\" Smaller demolitions of Palestinian structures are frequent. This year, Israel broke a four-year record in the number of Palestinians it displaced by destroying their homes, Gilutz said. The hamlet's tents, sheds, sheep pens and animal feed were destroyed, as were mobile toilets and a solar panel funded by Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries, he said. The Israeli Defense Ministry's agency that oversees Palestinian civilian affairs, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, said authorities demolished seven tents and eight animal pens built illegally in a military firing range. It did not return a request for comment about the timing of Tuesday's operation. \"The enforcement was carried out in accordance with the authorities and procedures, and subject to operational considerations,\" the Israeli agency said in a statement. Abu al-Kbash said the area is used for agriculture and is only rarely used by Israel for military exercises. A Palestinian aid group has provided tents as temporary shelter for the residents who lost their homes, but Abu al-Kbash said they were not sufficient for the village's families, including children. He said villagers were now sleeping on the rubble of their destroyed shacks. \"Our bed is the ground. Our roof is the sky,\" he said. \"We hope people will come and see our situation. They will see that Israel, which pretends to be a compassionate country, is chasing us.\"",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had no greater friend in the White House than him. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n was the only European Union leader to endorse him for president in 2016. And Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he admires him greatly. President Trump has counted several world leaders as his fans, many of them authoritarians, nationalists or populists. But they might have trouble keeping their relationship with the United States as friendly and their growing authoritarian tendencies unchecked if Joe Biden wins the presidency. Besides the various torn-up international accords, the retreat of traditional American leadership from the global stage and the cementing of the \"America First\" doctrine, there has been perhaps no more glaring consequence of Trump's tenure than his embrace of strongmen who largely eschewed the Western-based human rights and rules of law agenda. By figuring out relatively early how to win favor with Trump, these leaders often leveraged their close relationship with him to cement their own power at home. Some borrowed his rhetoric such as decrying \"fake news\" to crack down on dissent, some appealed to his sense of pomp by throwing lavish ceremonies and others adopted his brazenly transactional approach to geopolitical dealmaking. None of these Trump \"bromances,\" whether forged for pragmatic or ideological reasons, are likely to continue with the same fervor with Biden. The 77-year-old former vice president, who has made clear his distaste for Trump's embrace of strongmen, is nevertheless the product of a traditional Democratic establishment that has also tolerated unsavory rulers in the name of preserving U.S. strategic interests. Still, if Biden wins, we can expect he'll seek to bring human rights and the rule of law as important pillars of U.S. foreign policy. Over the last few weeks, our correspondents explored Trump's close relationships with some world leaders and how they might change under a Biden presidency. The relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin As candidate, Trump made clear his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. And throughout his presidency \u2014 the Robert Mueller investigation and the ongoing Russian attempts to interfere with the election notwithstanding \u2014 Trump has mostly refrained from severely criticizing Putin. (The Trump administration and Congress have called out Russia's aggressive behavior and have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow.) Case in point: the Helsinki summit in 2018 in which Trump refused to unequivocally back his own intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Putin, Trump said, was \"extremely strong\" in his denials. Fast-forward to 2020 and U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia is still engaging in \"malign foreign influence\" \u2014 including the use of social media and propaganda \u2014 that, they say, primarily goes after Biden. (The Kremlin denies any interference in U.S. elections.) The drumbeat of interference assertions was a major reason U.S.-Russian relations never really had a chance to improve. How it might change under Biden \"I think the very fact that Biden was Obama's vice president already makes him not a friendly figure in Russia,\" says Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman. Biden, who repeatedly highlights the importance of preserving NATO, is likely to adopt a tougher line against Russia. The only thing that helps the Kremlin, Lipman says, is more polarization and turmoil in the United States. \"Turmoil means the United States [is] weakened,\" she says. \"This is what the Kremlin can actually benefit from, not an improvement in relations.\" The relationship with China's Xi Jinping On the campaign trail and throughout his presidency, Trump has railed against China but has also voiced admiration for Chinese leader Xi Jinping as he tried to secure trade deals beneficial to the United States. Who could forget his January tweet praising Xi over his handling of the novel coronavirus? As the virus ravaged the West, Trump changed course, using China as a punching bag and saying his relationship with Xi has since frayed. Putting aside the leaders' relationship, the two countries are probably experiencing the worst ties in years. The Trump administration has sanctioned Chinese officials, targeted Chinese tech companies, arrested alleged Chinese spies and regularly challenges the country's claims in the South China Sea. How it might change under Biden Biden regularly touts the tough line he took as vice president against Xi. Biden says he would force China to \"play by the international rules.\" He frames the issue as bringing together democracies to counter \"abusive economic practices.\" Tony Blinken, the Democrat's top foreign policy adviser, told NPR that Biden would focus on \"our competitiveness, on revitalizing our democracy, on strengthening our alliances and partnerships, on reasserting our values. That's how you engage China from a position of strength.\" China, for its part, sees the U.S. as a declining power. In its recently revealed five-year plan, Beijing signaled it expects more American-led tariffs on its exports and more sanctions on its tech firms but that it's also confident to meet those challenges. The relationship with Israel's Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks with Trump before the president's departure from Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv in May 2017. The visit was part of Trump's first Middle East trip after taking office.\n                \n                    \n                    Kobi Gideon/Israel Government Press Office/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks with Trump before the president's departure from Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv in May 2017. The visit was part of Trump's first Middle East trip after taking office. The Israeli prime minister is one of Trump's closest allies. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy there \u2014 even though Palestinians seek part of the city for their future capital. He recognized Israeli claims to sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Netanyahu has touted his friendship with Trump in his campaigns. Trump has tweeted his support for Netanyahu and hosted him at the White House. Just a week ago, the Trump administration lifted a ban on U.S. taxpayer funding for Israeli scientific research carried out in Jewish settlements in Israeli-occupied territory. Netanyahu says, \"Israel has never had a better friend.\" How it might change under Biden Danny Danon, who most recently served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, says Biden would also be \"good with Israel.\" Nevertheless, Biden was vice president during Obama and Netanyahu's famously frosty relationship, and it's hard to see the two leaders sharing as close a relationship as Trump and Netanyahu. Mitchell Barak, a pollster in Jerusalem, says that a Biden administration would probably want to take a more evenhanded approach with Israel. Under Trump, ties with the Palestinian leadership broke down. \"They're going to start to try and make it a little more evenhanded or to look more evenhanded. And the free lunches that we've been getting up until now \u2014 we're going to have to pay for some of those things,\" Barak says. \"And then Netanyahu does not have the advantage because it's going to be more of an antagonistic relationship.\" The relationship with India's Narendra Modi The two leaders have had each other's backs even as they've both faced criticism for discriminating against minorities. When he was pressed to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi about anti-Muslim riots in India, Trump gave him a pass. \"And I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom,\" Trump said during his visit to India earlier this year. How it might change under Biden A Biden-Harris administration is likely to voice stronger rhetoric on Modi's record on human rights, the environment and Kashmir. Still, India is seen as an important counterweight to China in the region, and Biden will not want to upset that. \"Since the George W. Bush administration, the United States has recognized India's potential as a natural balancer to China. It's been a proponent of the U.S.-India relationship due to India's strategic location, its potential as a market,\" says Akriti Vasudeva at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. The relationship with Mexico's Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador When he launched his campaign for president in 2015, Trump vilified Mexicans: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" He also repeatedly threatened tariffs on Mexican exports. But over the years, and especially as he worked to secure the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Trump and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's relationship has grown closer. Critics of L\u00f3pez Obrador say that he caved in to Trump by adopting harsher policies toward Central American migrants. But analysts say the Mexican leader didn't have much choice, particularly as he faced Trump's threats of tariffs and forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall. \"It would be very costly for L\u00f3pez Obrador to get in a fight with Donald Trump,\" says Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst and professor at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics. How it might change under Biden Then-Vice President Joe Biden meets with then-Mexican presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in March 2012 in Mexico City.\n                \n                    \n                    Yuri Cortez/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Vice President Joe Biden meets with then-Mexican presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in March 2012 in Mexico City. Every president since Franklin Roosevelt has visited Mexico \u2014 except for Trump. In fact, Biden even visited then-candidate L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2012. Biden made more trips just to Guatemala in his two terms as vice president than Trump has made to all of Latin America as president, and would likely look to work with L\u00f3pez Obrador on immigration. As vice president, he promoted aid to Central American countries and pressured their leaders to curb corruption. The relationship with Brazil's Bolsonaro Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro rides a horse during a May demonstration in favor of his government amid the coronavirus pandemic in front of Planalto Palace in Brasilia.\n                \n                    \n                    Andressa Anholete/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro rides a horse during a May demonstration in favor of his government amid the coronavirus pandemic in front of Planalto Palace in Brasilia. It's no surprise that the \"Trump of the Tropics,\" as Bolsonaro has come to be known, has a close relationship with the U.S. president. They're both brash nationalists who share similar views on the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 belittling the science, pooh-poohing the need for masks and saying the whole thing is just exaggerated. They both got COVID-19 and recovered. And they both believe shutting down the economy through lockdowns is more harmful than the virus. Bolsonaro's first international trip was to Washington, and he's since visited Trump three more times, including at Mar-a-Lago. How it might change under Biden \"It would be a sort of earthquake,\" says Rubens Ricupero, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United States. Biden would likely pressure Bolsonaro on the erosion of human rights protections, including for Indigenous people, but it's the Brazilian leader's positions on the Amazon that would really be scrutinized. Biden wants to join forces with other counties to create a $20 billion fund for Brazil as part of an effort to press Bolsonaro to end rising deforestation. Still, Biden would need Brazil's cooperation on Venezuela and containing China, Brazil's biggest trading partner. The relationship with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan The two leaders have had a bumpy relationship, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also understood the benefit of a good rapport with Trump and preying on his instincts \u2014 particularly one that has to do with Trump's anathema of having U.S. troops in the \"endless wars.\" With one phone call last year, Erdogan got Trump to move U.S. troops in Syria out of the way so that Turkish soldiers could attack Kurdish forces, which were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS. Still, though Trump has called Erdogan a \"good friend,\" he also at one point threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" the Turkish economy. How it might change under Biden For one thing, it might become more predictable. Turkey might find it has to rein in the adventurous foreign policy it enjoyed under Trump. Biden would also most likely pressure Turkey on its human rights record \u2014 particularly its jailing of journalists and other critics. Significant issues also divide Ankara and Washington, including Turkey's purchase of Russian missiles. The relationship with the Saudi crown prince Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) meets with Trump, who holds a chart displaying military hardware sales, in the Oval Office of the White House in March 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Pool via Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) meets with Trump, who holds a chart displaying military hardware sales, in the Oval Office of the White House in March 2018. Breaking with decades of U.S. tradition, Trump chose Saudi Arabia as his first international trip as president. In Riyadh, the Saudi royal family lavished Trump and his family with an extravagant ceremony. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has since been reaping the rewards. The Trump administration has barely pressured him \u2014 over the kingdom's air campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, or his crackdown on dissent. And following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump stood by the crown prince's side even as U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that the Saudi royal had approved the killing and as bipartisan lawmakers condemned him. How it might change under Biden The former vice president has cast the kingdom as a \"pariah\" \u2014 making it clear Salman would likely have a tougher time making inroads with a potential Biden administration. Biden has also threatened to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia, a top buyer of U.S. weaponry. \"So there might be some cuts in terms of particular arms sales. There might be symbolic punishments. But the Biden administration is going to want a good relationship with Saudi Arabia despite the many problems,\" says Daniel Byman, a Middle East specialist at Georgetown University. The relationship with Hungary's Orb\u00e1n Europe's populists, often shunned by Brussels, have found a natural ally in Trump, who shares their disdain for migrants, the media and dissent. But it's Hungary's prime minister, Orb\u00e1n, who leads the pack. He was the only EU leader to endorse Trump in 2016. Four years and a White House visit later, Orb\u00e1n calls Trump a friend and predicts he will win reelection. The populist leaders of Slovenia (Melania Trump's native country) and Serbia have also endorsed the president. Previous U.S. administrations shunned Hungary, and the EU is investigating Hungary and Poland, run by another Trump-friendly government, for rule of law violations. Ivan Krastev, a political scientist who leads the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, says the two countries have used their alliance with Trump to make it clear \"that they have an alternative\" to Brussels. How it might change under Biden Biden mentioned Poland and Hungary when slamming Trump's foreign policy during a town hall last month, adding, \"This president embraces all the thugs in the world.\" The remark angered Hungary's government, but Orb\u00e1n is already casting Biden as part of the international liberal elite. \"We know well American Democratic governments' diplomacy, built on moral imperialism,\" Orb\u00e1n wrote in a recent essay in the pro-government newspaper Magyar Nemzet. \"He knows he has a lot to lose, so he's already positioned himself for the world without Trump,\" says Krastev, the political scientist.

Torres likes the way President Trump takes no mess from Democrats or what he calls establishment Republicans. Also, Torres said, it's refreshing to see a president do what he says he's going to do despite criticism \u2014 from Trump's fiery tweets, sometimes filled with misinformation \u2014 to his controversial decisions such as moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a disputed territory. Come Election Day top of mind for Torres will be Trump's remaking of the federal courts. The president has appointed more than 200 judges in his time in office. That, not immigration, is what Torres will be thinking of as he casts his ballot. \"My family's been in Arizona for more than 100 years. We don't see ourselves as immigrants,\" he said. \"We're very much Arizonans and Americans. So to continue to treat us as if we're all still just fresh across the border, which most Republicans and a lot of Democrats would like to think we are \u2014 just to easily encapsulate us \u2014 is something that is not resounding.\" The Latino vote will be key across the country, especially in tight races in places such as Arizona and Florida. This year, Latinos make up the largest nonwhite eligible voting bloc in the country, and according to polls, Torres is a part of about or over a quarter of Latinos who view this president favorably, with some polls showing Trump doing slightly better among Latinos in 2020 than he did in 2016. And the backbone of that support comes from men. A New York Times/Siena College poll found that former Vice President Joe Biden leads by 34 percentage points among Latina voters, but with Latino men his lead is 8 points. \"Hispanic men in particular are a swing vote,\" said Michelle Mayorga, a New Mexico-based pollster who worked on polls for Equis Research focused on Latino voters. \"They are a vote that we have to go and get.\" In polls by Equis Research in key swing states from Arizona to Nevada, Latino male voters show much more support for Trump than Latina voters. While Democrats are projected to win the majority of Latino votes overall, the margins are narrower with men. \"Republicans will take a larger margin than maybe they have in the past or enough that it will start to eat into the Democratic margin,\" Mayorga said. It may sound strange. This is a president who has called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, who has been accused of race baiting and whose presidency is haunted with images of migrant children separated from their parents in overcrowded detention centers. But the support tracks with a Republican Party effort to court Latino voters over decades. Republican strategists turned to Latino communities when they started to see African American voters fleeing the party in the 1950s and 1960s, said Geraldo Cadava, a historian at Northwestern University who wrote a book on Hispanic Republicans. President Richard Nixon set the tone with politics of patronage and high-level appointments of Latinos, Cadava said. So this year is similar. \"It's kind of right in line with elections in the past. Ever since Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, Republicans have won somewhere between a quarter and a third of the Latino vote,\" said Cadava, author of The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, From Nixon to Trump. \"I would point first to the development over a long period of time of a partisan loyalty to the Republican Party. And Latino Republican voters just identify as Republicans above all else, just like many Americans. There is a kind of tribalism among Latino Republicans, just like there is among many Americans.\" While some might expect that support to wane in communities who've been most severely affected by COVID-19 \u2014 losing more jobs and more lives than other demographic groups \u2014 Cadava said the Trump campaign's messaging has been successful on low unemployment for Latinos pre-pandemic, \"law and order\" (many Latinos serve in the military, police force and in the Border Patrol) and other issues important to Latino conservatives. \"It's been kind of amazing to watch, I mean, in some ways the Latinos for Trump campaign, which started officially in the spring of 2019, has been relentless in recruiting Latino voters,\" Cadava said. \"They're actually trying to increase Trump's Latino support, not just kind of hold it steady or depress the turnout of Democrats. They're trying to win more Latino votes.\" In Orange County, Calif., Randall Avila is counting on Latino voters to turn the county red again by flipping back four congressional seats the party lost in 2018 and holding on to the county seat. Avila is ethnically Mexican, 30, and the executive director of the Orange County Republican Party. \"I've been called every name in the book, from coconut to many other things,\" he said. But that derisive rhetoric doesn't faze him, he said. This party is where he feels at home. \"Our families and our communities, you know, really took care of each other and took care of ourselves. We weren't really focused on what is the government going to do for us,\" he said. \"The independent spirit of our community really drove me to the Republican ideal of making sure that you're able to provide for yourself and your family, that you have that independence and that liberty to be able to start your own business or work where you wanted to, or go to school where you wanted to go and have those opportunities available.\" His Christian faith also aligned him with the Republican Party on issues such as  abortion. And while he said he probably wouldn't phrase things the way Trump does sometimes, Latino voters such as him are attracted to the message of lower taxes and lower costs of living, especially in California. \"I've never seen the Republican Party fight this hard to get Latino and African American votes,\" he said. \"We have a number of Latino candidates, a number of Latino Republicans who are really stepping up and taking center stage. I'm hoping that that can be a better conduit to connecting with Latinos across the country and showing them that the Republican Party, there is a place for you here. This is your home as a voter.\"",

            "article_content": "About a third of Latino voters view Trump favorably and it breaks down a long gender lines. More Latino men support the president, citing his economic policies and his tough guy approach.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump is holding steady or doing better with Latino voters than he did in 2016, according to polls. That may be surprising. The president has called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, and his presidency is haunted with images of immigrant children separated from their parents in crowded detention centers. But as NPR's Leila Fadel reports, his support is not waning, and most of it comes from men. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Reymundo Torres is a staunch supporter of this president. REYMUNDO TORRES: The thing that initially attracted me and keeps me tied to him is that he has taught Republicans how to not just win, but no longer throw our faces and bodies in front of every punch that the left is willing to throw. FADEL: Torres is Arizonan, ethnically Mexican and a devout Catholic. He says what he likes is that Trump doesn't take any mess from Democrats or what he calls establishment Republicans. So on Election Day, he's voting for the president. Top of mind for him is the courts and the more than 200 judges Trump's appointed in his time in office. TORRES: My family's been in Arizona for more than a hundred years. We don't see ourselves as immigrants. We see ourselves very much as Arizonans and Americans. To continue to treat us as if we're all still just fresh across the border, which most Republicans and a lot of Democrats would like to think we are just to easily encapsulate us, is something that is not resounding. FADEL: And Torres is part of about or just over a quarter of Latinos who are strongly or somewhat in support of this president. Michelle Mayorga, a New Mexico-based pollster, says the backbone of the support comes from men. MICHELLE MAYORGA: Hispanic men, in particular, are a swing vote. They're a vote that we have to go and get. FADEL: And while Democrats will likely win the majority of Latino votes overall, the margins are narrower with men. A New York Times/Siena College poll found that Vice President Joe Biden leads by 34 percentage points among Latina voters. But with Latino men, his lead is just 8 points. MAYORGA: Republicans will take a larger margin than maybe they have in the past, or enough that, you know, it is starting to eat into the Democratic margin. FADEL: The Republican Party has been courting the Latino vote for decades, says historian Geraldo Cadava, who wrote a book on Hispanic Republicans. President Richard Nixon set the tone. GERALDO CADAVA: Nixon did it through a kind of politics of patronage and high-level appointments. FADEL: He appointed the first Hispanic treasurer of the United States, a Mexican American woman, and appointed Latinos to other top positions. The big question is why. Why is the number holding steady or, in some places, going up slightly despite anti-immigration policies and offensive language about African and Latino immigrants? CADAVA: I think I would point first to the development over a long period of time of a partisan loyalty to the Republican Party. And Latino Republican voters just identify as Republicans above all else, just like many Americans. FADEL: Also, Cadava says Latino voters vote on issues of religious freedom, the economy. Trump's argument about a strong pre-COVID-19 economy for Latinos resonates, as does his law and order messaging. Many Latinos are cops, Border Patrol officers or in the military. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has made a concerted effort to court the vote early. CADAVA: I think it's been kind of amazing to watch. I mean, in some ways, the Latinos for Trump campaign, which started officially in the spring of 2019, has been relentless in recruiting Latino voters. They're actually trying to increase and have been trying to increase Trump's Latino support, not just kind of hold it steady or depress the turnout of Democrats. FADEL: That's the first thing Randall Avila, the executive director of the Orange County Republican Party, talks about when knocking on doors of other Latino voters in Southern California. He points to low unemployment rates for Latinos pre-pandemic, the party's preference for school choice and lower taxes. RANDALL AVILA: I have never seen the Republican Party fight this hard to get Latino and African American votes. I can definitely understand why there's some hesitancy based off some past comments or policies, but I don't believe that is the Republican Party of today. You know, we have a number of Latino candidates, a number of Latino Republicans who are really stepping up and taking center stage. FADEL: Avila says he hopes that resonates because come November, the party will need the votes to flip the four congressional seats they lost in 2018 in Orange County and hold on to their county seat.

            "article_content": "Real Women Radio, an Internet radio station created by and for African American women in Pensacola, Fla., is using these posters to help get out the vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Real Women Radio, an Internet radio station created by and for African American women in Pensacola, Fla., is using these posters to help get out the vote. President Trump is holding two rallies this week in Florida, a play to energize the voters he needs to deliver the must-win state. Early voting and vote by mail numbers indicate Floridians are already engaged, as more than 4 million have cast a ballot already. A new poll from Republican pollster the Listener Group shows Trump with a sizable lead in the northwest region of the state \u2014 up more than 28 points. That's typical of the GOP advantage in the Panhandle. Pensacola, a city in a part of Florida with more in common politically with neighboring Alabama and Georgia than Miami, is one of the stops for Trump. The president remains popular in that part of the state, but Democrats are trying to make inroads. \"I just wish him out the office\" On the industrial west side of town, Phyllis Hale-Benjamin, wearing a \"Black Voters Matter\" mask, is canvassing at a strip center. First stop is the Mr. Bubbles Laundromat, where she hands out postcards with voting details. \"If you need a ride to the polls, if you need to know where your precinct is, whatever you need to know if you call that number, it will give you all your information,\" she says. Kenneth McElroy tells her he's 43, and has voted in every election since he was old enough to vote. He says there's a lot on the line in this election, in the middle of a pandemic. \"Health, safety, living,\" says McElroy, whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Sally so he's been living out of his car for more than a month. He won't be voting for Trump. \"He ain't fit for the part,\" he says. \"I wish him good health, and, you know, always no animosity or bad on him. I just wish him out the office.\" Outside the laundromat, Hale-Benjamin expresses a similar sentiment. \"Some of the things that have come out of his mouth as a president has been very disappointing to me,\" she says. She supports Democrat Joe Biden but doesn't think he'll be able to change as much as he has promised. \"But at least we won't have to hear all of the noise, and we won't be so divided,\" Hale-Benjamin says. The former hairdresser is a registered Democrat and says many of her friends are white and Republican. This election has strained relationships. \"They're scared to talk to me, and I'm scared to talk to them because you don't know what's going to come out of somebody's mouth and all that,\" she says.  \"I don't think we should have to walk around like that.\" That political divide by race is evident when you look at voter registration in Florida. Only 1.3% of registered Republicans identify as Black. \"He's the best president we've ever had\" \"Deep red\" is how Clover Lawson of Pensacola describes the local politics. \"These people work hard for their money, and they want to keep as much of it as possible.\" The region voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016, and he's coming to Pensacola on Friday night to rally his base. This part of Florida is in the central time zone so Republican candidates typically get a boost an hour after the polls close in the rest of the state. That can be the difference in razor-tight races. Lawson, 51, is a Second Amendment activist who works for a gun manufacturer, and says she switched her party affiliation from independent to Republican before the last presidential election because she thought politics needed a reset. Lawson backed Trump and got involved in party politics. She's campaigning for a local state House candidate. Her parents, Simone and Ted Lawson, were equally as frustrated with politics and got behind Trump. They're sticking with him this year, too. \"My verdict today is that he's the best president we've ever had,\" Ted Lawson says. He's a Vietnam veteran, who retired from the civil service. Simone Lawson had a screen printing business. The couple practice Catholic charismatic renewal and say their faith informs their vote. \"Freedom of religion is much more open with Trump as president,\" Simone Lawson says. \"Freedom period, right?\" They say he's kept his promise to move ahead with a border wall, and the retirees are big fans of his Supreme Court nominees. Trump's personality had given Simone Lawson pause in 2016. \"Oh, I didn't like him at first at all,\" she says. His tone irritated her, but not so much anymore. The Lawsons say Trump just tells it like it is. \"Most of the people I know that don't like him, don't like him for those very reasons that he's a braggart. He's got a big mouth. He's a bully,\" Ted Lawson says. \"But he's our bully,\" his wife interjects. \"I didn't vote for Trump because he was a nice, gracious man,\" Ted Lawson says.  \"I voted for him because he got stuff done.\" Clover Lawson has two sons who are young adults. In her view, Trump has done some \"boneheaded\" things that are distractions. \"For someone who doesn't have any experience being a politician, you can tell,\" she says. But she thinks he's getting a bad rap when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. \"I think he was handed a really bad apple this year, and to judge the other years based on this year would be terribly unfair,\" Lawson says. But Trump's handling of coronavirus is what's driving many voters. \"We're in a pandemic right now, and it's chaos,\" says Sharia Beasley of Pensacola. She says she's lost several family members to COVID-19 and wants a change in leadership. \"I think we just need a little break from chaos for these four more years,\" says Beasley, co-founder of Real Women Radio, an Internet radio station created by and for African American women in Pensacola. Now the station is focused on the election. \"I've been preaching for the last couple of months: Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote,\" she says. \"Get your plan in order. Go do what you got to do. Take your mama and them, your daddy and them, your sister and them, your brother. Take everybody. Go vote.\" David Sims (left), Charlotte Nelson and Phyllis Hale-Benjamin go out canvassing in Pensacola for Real Women Radio.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Sims (left), Charlotte Nelson and Phyllis Hale-Benjamin go out canvassing in Pensacola for Real Women Radio. Beasley says she hasn't always been so engaged and recalls skipping the presidential election in 2000 when she was in her 20s. \"I thought at that point that Al Gore had the presidency in the bag,\" she recalls. \"I was working and I thought why should I even go and vote?\" Of course, Florida's results were so close that the state headed for a recount and prolonged election dispute that eventually resulted in a victory for Republican George W. Bush. She's been passionate about convincing people to vote ever since despite what she perceives as obstacles to exercising the franchise \u2014 long lines for early voting and problems with Florida's online voter registration system, for instance. Beasley is also concerned about the specter of armed militias trying to intimidate voters. She thinks the president has empowered extremists. \"Trump has said that he's not a racist,\" Beasley says. \"But I just think that doors have been opened up to say, 'Go ahead, it's a free country, do whatever you want to do.' \" There are also outside threats to the U.S. election. The government this week said Iran and Russia have taken actions to influence public opinion related to U.S. elections. \"What is the truth?\" Clover Lawson is alarmed by what she sees as a proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that reach her parents' inbox, and she tries to debunk them. Her dad says it's hard to sort out what to believe. \"When I read an article on Facebook and it kind of tricks my starter, my children say, you know, 'Don't repost it.' So I don't because it's probably not true,\" Ted Lawson says. \"But what is the truth?\" The Lawson family is skeptical of national polls that show Trump trailing Biden. \"He has to win,\" Simone Lawson says. Her husband wonders whether Americans will accept the outcome of the election no matter who wins. \"On both sides, they won't accept it,\" he says. \"If the Republicans lose, they won't accept that. I won't accept that.\" Simone Lawson says they've accepted every election in their lifetime. \"A lot of times it wasn't our choice, but we always respected the office of the president,\" she says. \"But in this case, Trump has to win.\" The Lawsons say they will be voting in person on Nov. 3. Clover Lawson plans to cast an absentee ballot, something she's always done as a former military spouse. Out on the streets of Pensacola, David Sims, a canvasser with Real Women Radio, has been working with ex-offenders re-enfranchised by a constitutional amendment approved by Florida voters two years ago. Advocacy groups say about 67,000 former felons are newly registered this election. But Sims says the Republican-controlled Legislature has complicated things. \"They pass one law saying you can vote, and they pass another law saying you have to pay your fines,\" Sims says. \"That's further disenfranchisement.\" Sims says he believes the system is stacked against encouraging full participation by Black voters such as himself. \"If I know you're gonna vote against me, I'm going to make it where you can't vote at all,\" Sims says. \"They're trying to silence us, and that's why we're out here.\"",

            "article_content": "The final presidential debate of the 2020 election season was more calm and policy-oriented than the first. But did either candidate change the dynamics of the race?  NOEL KING, HOST: President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden debated for a final time last night. This was a more substantive exchange of ideas when compared to the first debate. There are now 11 days left in this campaign. NPR's Tamara Keith and Asma Khalid were watching last night. Good morning, ladies. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Morning. KING: Tam, let me start with you. The headline is the president restrained himself. KEITH: Yeah. I mean, he took a lot of heat even from his allies after all the interrupting in the first debate. They kept saying, if you just let Joe Biden speak, maybe he'll slip up. And clearly, as you say, President Trump was more restrained this time, but some 48 million people voted between the first debate and this one. In terms of his message, Trump hit themes I've heard in his stump speech, things like the economy was great before the coronavirus pandemic, and it will be again. Biden won't be good for the economy, he says. And he repeated a line about doing more in 47 months than Biden has done in 47 years, the idea that Biden is a career politician. Trump came back to these ideas and attacks frequently. KING: Asma, you've been following the Biden campaign. How did he parry those attacks? How did he do? KHALID: You know, really, Noel, it felt like a very status quo debate for Joe Biden. It doesn't seem like it dramatically changed the trajectory of the race. His closing argument was that he was going to be a president for all people, even people who do not vote for him, and that's been a consistent arc in his campaign. You know, I think what was notable is that he was able to speak at length about policy because, you know, as you all mentioned, there were just fewer interruptions, and that allowed Biden to keep his focus. You know, and I thought that was particularly salient when it came to the pandemic. At the outset, in his very first response, he made this pitch quite clearly around COVID. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Two hundred twenty thousand Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this - anyone who is responsible for not taking control - in fact, not saying I'm - I take no responsibility, initially - anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. KING: Tam, President Trump's campaign is haunted by the pandemic. How did he manage questions about it last night? KEITH: You know, in many ways, his answers haven't changed since April. He says he shut down the border. It could have been worse. A vaccine is coming very soon, though he admitted in this debate that there's no guarantee it will be ready in the matter of weeks timeline that he's been boasting about. And he insisted that the cure can't be worse than the disease. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. KEITH: The basement Joe thing is something that Trump and his allies say all the time, but Biden was ready with a response that spoke to all the Americans who have been killed by the virus. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: You folks home who have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning, that man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their - out of habit, where their wife or husband was - is gone. Learning to live with it - come on. We're dying with it. KEITH: Trump said he wanted schools to open. Biden said he did, too, but he wanted them to have the resources to do it. Dare I say that they actually had an exchange of ideas about how to handle the pandemic that got beyond sort of the absolutism of either it's open or it's all shut down? KING: Another thing that we expected, Tam, last night was that President Trump would personally attack Joe Biden. Did he go down that road? KEITH: Oh, he did. The campaign had built it up, and he did. He went after Biden for his son Hunter's foreign business dealings, including with a Ukrainian company and a Chinese company. You know, he didn't, though, lay it out in a clear and cogent way that someone who hasn't been watching FOX or reading conservative blogs would be able to really follow. It was almost like he was speaking in a shorthand. And Biden responded saying that you can see that he didn't get any money from overseas because he's released his tax returns and went after Trump for not releasing his. But Biden's main response was just to say that this race for the White House isn't about the Biden family or the Trump family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Excuse me - just one second, please. KRISTEN WELKER: I do want to turn to - 10 seconds, Mr. President, 10 seconds. TRUMP: That's a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks - the family, around the table, everything - just a typical politician when I see that. WELKER: All right. Let's talk about North Korea now. TRUMP: I'm not a typical politician. WELKER: OK. TRUMP: That's why I got elected. KEITH: I do think that it's notable that after the debate, when the Trump campaign held a call with reporters, they put a lot more emphasis on Trump painting Biden as a career politician than they did on the Hunter Biden stuff. KING: Asma, let me ask you about that. Joe Biden is a career politician. He has a long record to defend. Last night, did he successfully do so? KHALID: You know, I was struck, I would say, by how he tried to seemingly define himself as being his own man, despite the fact that he has this long record and the fact that he's, you know, quite often been associated with Barack Obama. He ran during the primaries on Obama's legacy. But last night on two big issues, health care and immigration, he tried to draw some distinctions with the person that he's often referred to as his old buddy Barack. When Biden was asked why people should trust him now on immigration reform, given the record number of deportations under President Obama's administration, he essentially said because I'll be the president, not the vice president. And when it came to health care, you know, he emphasized that his vision would add a public option to the Affordable Care Act. It's a plan that he dubbed Bidencare. President Trump tried to refer to Biden's ideas as socialized medicine and repeatedly cited Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, to which Biden quipped... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden he's running against him. KHALID: And, Noel, you know, there was another aspect of Biden's record that repeatedly came up through the night. That was his support for a 1990s-era crime bill. Biden acknowledged that in the past, Congress had made some mistakes around drug sentences, but he also defended the Obama administration's record of reversing sentences for thousands of people. And later in the night, Biden really tried to highlight his character, his identity directly to the viewers, telling the audience to compare what they know about him to what they know about President Trump. KING: All right. Tam, let me ask you - we have nearly 50 million people who have already voted. The president is behind in the polls, and as a result, the understanding was he was looking for some big Biden slip-up to seize on last night. Did he get it? KEITH: Well, it all depends on your definition of big, but President Trump did seize on one moment when it came to energy. He was looking for Biden to say something that he could use to paint him as too far to the left. And Biden talked about a slow transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Would you close down the oil industry? BIDEN: I would transition from the oil industry, yes. I would transition. TRUMP: Oh, that's a big statement... BIDEN: It is a big statement... TRUMP: That's a big statement. BIDEN: ...Because I would stop... WELKER: Why would you do that? BIDEN: Because the oil industry pollutes significantly. TRUMP: Oh, I see. BIDEN: Here's the deal... TRUMP: That's a big statement. BIDEN: Well, if you let me finish the statement - because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time. And I'd stop giving - to the oil industry, I'd stop giving them federal subsidies. KEITH: And Trump really jumped at that. He was saying, hey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, did you hear this? Now, the political reality is such that it may not be as much of a blunder as the president thinks it is. A poll from August found a narrow majority of voters in Pennsylvania actually oppose fracking, and Biden is looking for a big turnout from young voters who care about climate change.

NPR checks in to see what they think of his presidency and how they might vote in 2020.  TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: Early voting started this week in the hotly contested swing state of Florida. Already, more than 3 million Floridians have cast a ballot either through early voting or absentee. Today, we're going to revisit a family in Pensacola. We first spoke with in 2016 this family about taking a gamble on a different kind of candidate, Donald Trump, and how they view his presidency today. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Like much of this Florida Panhandle city, Clover Lawson's North Pensacola neighborhood is strewn with downed trees, and most of the roofs are covered with blue tarps. It's been a little more than a month since Hurricane Sally struck, and the cleanup is still underway. CLOVER LAWSON: So I lost the chimney cover. That's what that is right there. ELLIOTT: Lawson walks around the outside of her house, noting it escaped without major damage. C LAWSON: Even my garden made it. ELLIOTT: She's still harvesting okra and has an overgrown pepper patch. C LAWSON: So that's what happens in Pensacola. We just call it peppers gone wild here (laughter). ELLIOTT: The politics here are of a similar color. C LAWSON: Deep red (laughter). ELLIOTT: This part of northwest Florida voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016, and polls indicate he'll likely carry the region again. C LAWSON: These people work hard for their money, and they want to keep as much of it as possible. ELLIOTT: Lawson, a Second Amendment activist who works for a gun manufacturer, says she switched her party affiliation from independent to Republican before the last presidential election and got involved in party politics. She's currently campaigning for a local state House candidate. Four years ago, she told me it felt like the culture of the country was at stake and politics needed a reset. Her parents, Simone and Ted Lawson, were equally as frustrated. Here's what they said back then. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SIMONE LAWSON: It's a disaster. TED LAWSON: I think the emotional side of how we feel is that we've had enough of politics as usual. ELLIOTT: So they backed the long shot Trump, Ted Lawson musing he would either be the best or worst president the country has seen. This year, the Lawsons stop by their daughter's house to again talk politics. C LAWSON: Mama, just be careful 'cause my... ELLIOTT: Sitting outside on the back deck, the Lawsons are all in for Trump's reelection. T LAWSON: My verdict today is that he's the best president we've ever had. And it's not so much of his personality that we're talking about. We're talking about his accomplishments. ELLIOTT: They say he's kept his promise to move ahead with a border wall, and the retirees are big fans of his Supreme Court nominees. Ted Lawson is a Vietnam veteran who retired from the civil service. Simone Lawson had a screen printing business. The couple practice Catholic charismatic renewal and say their faith informs their vote. S LAWSON: Freedom of religion is much more open with Trump as president - freedom, period (laughter), right? ELLIOTT: Trump's personality had given Simone Lawson pause in the last election. S LAWSON: Oh, I didn't like him at first, at all. ELLIOTT: His tone irritated her, but not so much anymore. The Lawsons say he just tells it like it is. T LAWSON: The - most of the people I know that don't like him, don't like him for those very reasons - that he's a braggart. He's got a big mouth. He's a bully. He bullies people. S LAWSON: Yeah, but he's our bully. T LAWSON: He's our bully. You know, I didn't vote for Trump - I didn't vote for him because he was a nice, gracious man. I voted for him 'cause he got stuff done. ELLIOTT: Clover Lawson is 51 and has two sons who are young adults. In her view, Trump has done some boneheaded things that are distractions, but she doesn't think he's getting a fair rap for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. C LAWSON: For someone who's - doesn't have any experience being a politician, you can tell, you know (laughter)? Am I happy with a lot of stuff that's gone on in the past couple years? Yeah. I think he was handed a really bad apple this year. And to judge the other couple years based on this year would be terribly unfair. ELLIOTT: Lawson is alarmed by what she sees as a proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that reach her parents' inbox, and she tries to debunk them. Her dad acknowledges it's hard to sort out what to believe. T LAWSON: When I read an article on Facebook and it kind of tricks my starter, my children say, you know, don't repost it. And so I don't because it's probably not true. But then, you know, what is the truth? ELLIOTT: They're skeptical of polls that show Trump is trailing Biden. I asked them whether Americans will accept the outcome. S LAWSON: He has to win. T LAWSON: On both sides they won't accept it. If the Republicans lose, they won't accept that. I won't accept it, but neither will he. S LAWSON: We've accepted all the elections in the past - all right? - in our lifetime. A lot of times, it wasn't our choice. But we've always respected the office of the president. But in this case, Trump has to win. ELLIOTT: The Lawsons say they will be voting in person on Nov. 3, while Clover plans to cast an absentee ballot, something she's always done as a former military wife.

President Trump is racing from tarmac to tarmac in the final weeks of the campaign, holding large rallies to blast out an array of closing arguments \u2014 buckshot style \u2014 for a second term in office. So far, most of the stops have been in swing states \u2014 Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada. But he has also held rallies in Iowa and Georgia, states he won easily in 2016 in a sign the electoral map has shifted on him. Down in the polls, and with millions of people having already voted, Trump is trying to make up for lost time. He was off the trail for 10 days earlier this month when he caught the coronavirus and was hospitalized. His rally performances post-COVID-19 have been spirited and confident, as Trump seeks to show voters he was not felled by the virus that has grounded the country and perhaps his reelection. And he says he plans to keep up the breakneck pace through the final two weeks of the campaign, including plans to make as many as five stops a day when the calendar turns to November. Here are a few of the president's final arguments. President Trump introduces White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany at the rally in Prescott, Ariz. Like the president, McEnany has recovered from the coronavirus.\n                \n                    \n                    Caitlin O'Hara/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump introduces White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany at the rally in Prescott, Ariz. Like the president, McEnany has recovered from the coronavirus. Rounding the corner on the coronavirus Polls show voters think Democratic challenger Joe Biden would do a better job handling the pandemic, the biggest test of Trump's leadership during his first term. But Trump is holding up his own experience with the disease as an asset, brandishing his recovery as a sign that treatments are improving, vaccines are on their way and better times are coming soon. \"It's rounding the turn. You'll see that. Normal life \u2014 that's all we want. We want normal life. Right?\" he said in Carson City, Nev., on Sunday. While critics and medical experts have panned the White House for letting a \"super-spreader event\" threaten the health of the president, his wife and more than a dozen close aides and associates, Trump has bragged about it, calling now-recovered aides like Hope Hicks and Kayleigh McEnany up to the stage. He has used his teenage son Barron's experience catching the virus without developing significant symptoms as fuel to argue schools should reopen. Even as coronavirus cases surge, only once in his travels has Trump reflected on the pain and loss caused by the pandemic \u2014 in a speech to seniors in Florida. \"I'm working as hard as I can so you can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon,\" Trump told seniors \u2014 an acknowledgement that showed he knows this key voting bloc is angry. Make America great again, again Trump's stump speech is less about his promises or vision for a second term, and more about his first three years in office. He rattles through a lengthy list of highlights, ranging from criminal justice reform, the opening of diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, establishing the Space Force, hikes in military spending, his conservative picks for the Supreme Court, trade deals and progress on the signature issue of his first run for office \u2014 the wall on the Southern U.S. border with Mexico. Republican strategists wish Trump would spend more time talking about the economy, an area of strength for the president until the pandemic shut down businesses and schools, throwing millions out of work. Voters are split on who they think would do a better job on the economy. \"We had the best employment numbers we ever had. We had 160 million people working,\" Trump said in Muskegon, Mich. \"It's called, Make America Great Again. Now I say, 'Make America Great Again, Again.' \" Supporters listen to President Trump during a Make America Great Again rally in Ocala, Fla., last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters listen to President Trump during a Make America Great Again rally in Ocala, Fla., last week. Trump argues he will keep cutting taxes while Biden will raise taxes and harm the economy with regulations on fracking for natural gas, among other things. \"This election is a choice between a Trump super-recovery \u2014 which we're in right now \u2014 or a Biden depression,\" Trump said in Carson City. 47  years vs. 47 months Trump is using a variety of attacks on Biden's years in the Senate and as vice president to try to paint himself as the come-from-behind upstart, even though he is the incumbent candidate with a record of his own. He argues that Biden is part of the establishment. \"He's a servant of the wealthy donors, globalists and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry and putting America last,\" Trump said in Carson City. Part of this line of attack involves lengthy diatribes against the business activities of Biden's son Hunter. But Trump also says Biden would give control to the left wing of his party, which is hardly sympathetic with the rich. Suburban women: 'I've saved your way of life' Trump is also spending a lot of time speaking directly to a group of voters who supported him last time, but have been turned off by his bombast: suburban women. He explains in his rallies that he has been in too big a hurry to be politically correct and says his actions on issues like supporting police, curbing protests and ending a policy to fight housing segregation have \"saved your way of life.\" \"So can I ask you to do me a favor suburban women: Would you please like me? No? Hey, I saved your damn neighborhood. OK,\" he said in Johnstown, Pa. Trump also brags that he thinks female voters like him more than polls show, as seen in his 2016 victory. \"Last time, they said the same thing. It was even worse. They said I had a problem with women, period. And then the night, that beautiful, night four years ago \u2014 was that the greatest of all time?\" he said in Janesville, Wis.

President Sooronbai Jeenbekov announced his resignation in a bid to end the turmoil that has engulfed the Central Asian nation after a disputed parliamentary election. The president of the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan resigned Thursday, after 10 days of unrest sparked by disputed parliamentary elections. As protesters closed in on his residence, Sooronbay Jeenbekov abruptly stepped down, saying nothing was dearer to him than the life of each of his compatriots. \"I'm not clinging to power. I don't want to go down in Kyrgyzstan's history as the president who spilled blood and shot at his own citizens,\" Jeenbekov said in a statement posted on the presidential website. Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov looks on during his inauguration ceremony in Bishkek in 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Vyacheslav Oseledko/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov looks on during his inauguration ceremony in Bishkek in 2017. Jeenbekov is the third president to be overthrown in a popular uprising since Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991. Unlike the other four Central Asian countries that emerged from the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan, with a population of 6.5 million, has a pluralistic, if chaotic, political life linked to its strong clan-based traditions. The landlocked, mountainous country, which borders China, hosts a Russian air base and receives millions in financial aid from the Kremlin. For more than a decade, the United States also operated an air base in Kyrgyzstan to support operations in Afghanistan, until it was forced to close in 2014 under pressure from Russia. The current turmoil in Kyrgyzstan centers on domestic rivalries. The chaos began with protests against vote-buying in an Oct. 4 parliamentary election. Even after the authorities nullified the vote, the unrest continued, with one person killed and hundreds injured in clashes in the capital, Bishkek. Supporters of a jailed former lawmaker, Sadyr Japarov, sprung him from prison, where he was serving a sentence for for kidnapping a local governor. When Prime Minister Kuratbek Boronov resigned last week, it created a political vacuum \u2014 and an opening for Japarov. Jeenbekov accepted Japarov as the new prime minister earlier this week. But Japarov insisted that the president step down immediately \u2014 and not, as Jeenbekov suggested, once the situation had stabilized. After Jeenbekov resigned, the speaker of parliament, next in line for the presidency, reportedly declined to take office. Japarov told supporters in Bishkek that he was assuming the powers of the presidency, according to the order of succession. The Kremlin has been watching these developments with alarm. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met frequently with Jeenbekov, a veteran politician who last visited Moscow at the end of September. Russia hosts hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrant workers, and Bishkek is tied to Moscow through economic and defense pacts. Earlier this week, Dmitry Kozak, the deputy head of Putin's administration, met with Jeenbekov and said he played a \"key role\" in the country's stable development. Following Jeenbekov's resignation, Putin's spokesman said that Russia will freeze financial aid to Kyrgyzstan until the situation calms down and a new government starts working.",

Updated at 11:30 a.m. ET Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, sat for nearly 20 hours of questioning by 22 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days. At the outset of the process, Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham acknowledged that her confirmation by the panel was all but guaranteed. \"This is probably not about persuading each other unless something really dramatic happens. All Republicans will vote yes and all Democrats will vote no and that will be the way the breakout of the vote,\" Graham said. But he added that the hearings give the American people the chance to \"find out about Judge Barrett.\" On Thursday, the panel, along party lines, set Oct. 22 as the date for its vote on Barrett's nomination. The full Senate will vote after that. The hearings revealed little about Barrett's views on major legal issues like health care, abortion rights, voting rights or gun rights. Instead, those watching learned about her overarching approach to the law as an originalist who believes the role of a justice is to adhere to the text of statutes rather than interpret or make policy from the bench. She skillfully parried back and forth with Democrats who were frustrated she wouldn't be pinned down and kept a cool, calm demeanor \u2014 even as many warned that her addition to the court could adversely affect millions of Americans. At one point, Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn asked her to show what notes she was using to prep for answers and she held up a blank notepad, demonstrating that she was capable of talking for hours on end about a broad range of legal issues without any notes. With a nationally televised audience and wall-to-wall news coverage, members on both sides of the dais used their time to make political arguments. The election loomed large over the proceedings. Several GOP senators, including Graham, are in increasingly tight reelection bids, and the prospects for Democrats to retake control of the chamber increased, even over the course of the hearings. The incentive to wrap up the confirmation review and get the Barrett vote to the Senate floor before Nov. 3 was palpable, as two GOP members of the panel who had tested positive for the coronavirus after attending an event unveiling Barrett's nomination released letters clearing them to participate in person without posing any health risks to others. Barrett declined to answer many questions, citing precedent of earlier nominees Nominees for the high court in modern times have deliberately avoided directly responding to questions. They point out that judicial ethics rules require that judges should not weigh in on any issue that could come before them. Barrett cited the woman whose seat she would take \u2014 the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 who established what became known as \"Ginsburg rule.\" At several points Barrett reiterated that this meant \"no hints, no previews, no forecasts.\" Democrats were, not surprisingly, not satisfied with that response, or Barrett's stream of non-answers on a range of issues. They said that President Trump publicly vowed to appoint judges who would overturn Obamacare and that recently he pushed for speedy confirmation of his nominee to the high court in the event that the 2020 election results ended up before the court. GOP senators argued that they were making leaps and suggesting some kind of backroom deal. \"Read the tweets!\" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said about the president's regular statements on these issues. Barrett also refused to say whether she believed climate change was a threat, or whether the administration's policy on separating children from their parents at  the southwest border was appropriate, saying she would not opine on contentious public policy issues. As soon as Barrett was nominated, the president and others portrayed her as a female version of her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. Democrats reminded the audience of that, but Barrett made a point of downplaying the comparison and insisting she would chart her own path. \"If I were confirmed, you'd be getting Justice Barrett, not Justice Scalia,\" she said. Democrats zeroed in on health care On the first day of Senate hearings over the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, supporters and opponents of the confirmation confront each other in front of the Supreme Court.\n                \n                    \n                    Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n                    \n                \nhide caption On the first day of Senate hearings over the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, supporters and opponents of the confirmation confront each other in front of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is slated to hear a case involving the Affordable Care Act just a week after the November election. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's strategy over the past several months has been to run against the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and to tie that to his pledge to undo Obamacare. For the most part, Democrats tried to turn the hearings into a forum on the health care law. During their opening statements, many sat next to large posters of constituents who they said were struggling with severe health issues and worried about their coverage. They argued that Barrett's writings and selection by the president could mean she would be a vote on the court to dismantle the law. Over and over Barrett said she had no agenda and that she never made any deal or discussed the issue with the president before her nomination. She was pressed multiple times by Democrats about a January 2017 law journal article in which she critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning for upholding the law in a key decision. But she maintained, \"I'm not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\" The pending case has to do with the issue of \"severability,\" whether a key provision of the law \u2014 the individual mandate requiring insurance \u2014 is legally sound, and whether pulling it out would undermine the entire law. GOP briefs filed by the administration argue for invalidating the statute. But Barrett, under questioning, said the presumption \"is always in favor of severability.\" Pressed by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar about her writings, Barrett insisted there was no deliberate pitch to show she was open to GOP attempts to legally take down the law that they have been unable to do with legislation. \"I have no animus or agenda for the Affordable Care Act.\" But Durbin again reminded those watching that the president who appointed her was clear on the issue and that was the \"orange cloud\" over her nomination. Abortion and debate over \"super-precedents\" The issue of abortion rights is always a flashpoint in Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Democrats repeatedly attempted to pin Barrett down on whether she viewed the landmark case providing protections for women who elect to have abortions, Roe v. Wade, as settled law, but she sidestepped the issue. She maintained that if she signaled one way or another it would invite litigants to frame legal strategies around her comments. But in an exchange with Klobuchar, Barrett stated that she viewed a half a dozen cases as \"super-precedents\" \u2014 cases that could not be overturned because they are established law. She pointed to a case outlawing school segregation but did not include Roe in that group, explaining that there continues to be litigation on the issue. \"Roe is not a super-precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased, but that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled.\" That led Klobuchar and other Democrats to conclude that she was open to considering a challenge to abortion laws. Klobuchar lamented that without answers one was left to \"follow the tracks\" based on Barrett's writings. Election results disputes and presidential pardons With the presidential election mere weeks away and concerns about close contests or legal challenges, Barrett was asked if she would recuse herself if such a case came before the high court. She assured the committee she would go through the traditional process justices use to determine whether it's appropriate for them to rule on a case. But she also pushed back at the notion that she was being rushed onto the court to tip the scales. \"I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.\" Democrats also tried to get her to explain what should happen if the president fails to accept a ruling. Barrett said no person was above the law, but also said \"the Supreme Court can't control whether or not the president obeys.\" Barrett also said she can't answer a question about whether the president has an absolute right to pardon himself because it hasn't been tested in court and is a question that calls for legal analysis. Republicans defended Barrett, argued judges are not policymakers GOP senators chided Democrats for playing politics with the hearing. One after another they praised Barrett's ability to balance a large family with seven children and a successful legal career. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, one of two female Republicans on the committee, touted the historic moment of adding a woman to the court in the same year women are marking 100 years of getting the right to vote. Republicans also went into the hearings spoiling for a fight with Democrats over Barrett's religious views, but that didn't materialize. During Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearing for her current circuit court post, the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, remarked about Barrett's Catholic faith: \"The dogma lives loudly within you.\" Republicans accused Democrats of an anti-religious bias and some used their opening statements to chastise any who would suggest that Barrett's religious views would interfere with her job as a judge. Ernst told Barrett that opponents were \"attacking your faith and your precious family ... attacking you as a mom and a woman of faith.\" But Democrats, disciplined on keeping the focus on health care, largely steered clear of raising the issue. Some outside liberal groups did contend that some conservative tenets of Catholicism would have an impact on cases. But when Democrats raised questions about contraception or abortion, they worked to keep the questioning lines to writings or speeches by Barrett, not any commentary on her faith. Still, Republicans periodically argued that the Democrats' line of questioning was unfair or condescending toward the accomplished jurist. Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said Democrats were using the hearings to \"spread some fear and misinformation\" about health care. She complained that they were trying to paint Barrett as \"a monster with an agenda.\" Debate mostly civil, confirmation on track Technical issues periodically interrupted the hearings and the coronavirus pandemic made some senators decide to participate remotely. But the hearings overall were far more civil than the raucous and testy exchanges witnessed during the committee's consideration of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination in 2018. Graham admitted he was worried, given the unpredictable nature of 2020, that things could go awry. Closing out the questioning period he concluded that while the hearings didn't change anyone's minds, they showed that the committee could function. He also said that Kavanaugh's confirmation forever changed the ability to garner large bipartisan votes on nominees to the high court. \"In another time, in another place, you would get everybody's vote,\" Graham told Barrett. Barrett's ability to maneuver through complicated legal questions and not raise any vetting issues ensured that the process would move forward at a quick pace, despite the controversy over whether it should be happening at all when 40 states are already voting in the presidential election. Graham celebrated Barrett's place in history on Wednesday, saying, \"This is the first time in American history that we've nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she is going to the court.\" The committee is hearing from an outside panel of supporters and opponents of Barrett's nomination on Thursday and is expected to approve her nomination on a party line on Oct. 22. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is expected to move for a full Senate vote the week before the election.",

            "article_content": "Loading... It has been a rough couple of weeks for President Trump. His performance in the first presidential debate was widely panned; Trump and several members of his inner circle contracted COVID-19; and then the president said he was pulling out of the next debate, after the debate commission said it wanted the candidates to appear from remote locations, citing safety concerns in the wake of Trump's diagnosis. The latter has left the fate of the remaining debates in doubt, as the campaigns and commission scramble to figure out how to proceed. Given all of that, Trump's standing in the NPR electoral map analysis has gotten worse. With states that are determined to be likely to go for either candidate or leaning toward them, Democrat Joe Biden now leads Trump, 290-163. Here are the moves we've made in this month's map: Wisconsin: Toss-Up \u2014> Lean D Arizona: Toss-Up \u2014> Lean D Nebraska 2nd Congressional District: Toss-Up \u2014> Lean D Iowa: Lean R \u2014> Toss-Up Nebraska 1st Congressional District: Likely R \u2014> Lean RMissouri: Likely R \u2014> Lean RAlaska: Likely R \u2014> Lean R That puts Biden \u2014 right now \u2014 above the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win a majority of the 538 available, leaving Trump with an uphill climb to win reelection. It comes with less than a month to go in the election \u2014 and with millions of votes already cast. To put Biden's lead in context, even if Trump wins all the remaining toss-up states, it would not be enough for him to win. The president would need to make gains in the next three weeks in states now leaning toward Biden. Of course, Trump was able to do so against Hillary Clinton in 2016, particularly in the Upper Midwest. We will update our map in a couple of weeks before the election \u2013 and things very well may shift and tighten between now and then, as they did in 2016. Fueling Biden's lead, according to national and statewide surveys, continues to be the former vice president's overperformance with white voters, suburban voters, independents and seniors, all groups Trump won in 2016. Biden is showing strength in the Midwest and is also eating into Trump's margins in traditionally red states. Biden is unlikely to win places like Alaska, Missouri, Montana and South Carolina, but being more competitive there than Hillary Clinton was in 2016 is putting him on track to surpass Clinton's vote total and popular vote margin of 3 million more than Trump. It should be noted, however, that Trump remains within striking distance, especially in the Sun Belt states, across the South and West. What's more, Democrats are worried about mail-in voting, not because of fraud, but because of the high rate of disqualification of mail-in ballots because technicalities like not signing in the correct place. Democratic voters are saying by far greater margins than Republicans that they're more likely to vote by mail, rather than in person, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Below is a deeper look at what we've changed and what we didn't and why. Toss-Up to Lean D Wisconsin: Polls have shown a consistent bent toward Biden this cycle. We had been reluctant to move it to Lean D, given Wisconsin's high percentage of whites without a college degree, a strongly pro-Trump group. But Biden's lead has remained consistent, up by 7 points now on average and above 50%. Arizona: This is a closer race than Wisconsin with Biden up 4 points on average. It's just on the edge of remaining in the Toss-Up category, but here are a couple of points for why we moved it: (1) Trump hasn't led here since early March and (2) when you look inside the polls, Biden is consistently doing better than Clinton did in Maricopa County, where two-thirds of the state's vote comes from, and he's even ahead of Clinton's margins in Pima County, the traditionally Democratic area where Tucson is. What's more, Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly has a wider lead in his race against incumbent GOP Sen. Martha McSally, which could help Biden's chances as well. Nebraska-2: Despite its Republican lean and the Democrat in the district's U.S. House race polling close or behind the GOP incumbent, this Omaha-area district has continued to favor Biden. Lean R to Toss-Up Iowa: This is a state that should favor Trump, given he won it last time and its significant white, non-college-educated population. But polls have shown it neck and neck, with Biden ahead in some recent surveys. Likely R to Lean R Nebraska-1: This district borders the 2nd Congressional District, encompassing the college town of Lincoln and some Omaha suburbs. It should be a district that goes to Trump easily, but polls have shown the race within 5 points there. Missouri: This used to be a traditional battleground state but has has fallen off in the last two election cycles. In 2008, Republican John McCain beat Barack Obama there by just 3,700 votes out of almost 3 million. The key here is if Biden continues to overperform with whites, margins will become tighter in red states and in red counties in swing states. Alaska: The tightening margins in these kinds of places are signs of a potential wave. We'll see if that holds over the next few weeks, but right now, Biden is closer in the polling average in Alaska than Trump is in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Nevada. Trump has got his work cut out for him. Texas: While the polls show a race within the margin of error, Trump has been near or above 50% and leading in the polling average. The Biden campaign is looking to make things interesting, spending $6 million on ads in the state. So let's see if they move the numbers and where things are in a couple weeks. But given Texas' voting history and the GOP's statewide political power, this one still leans toward Trump for now. South Carolina, Kansas, Montana: All of these are traditionally red states that Trump won by significant double-digit margins in 2016. But each of them is within 10 points in the race between Trump and Biden, according to the polls. All of that points to a rising sea level for Biden. Does it stay that way? Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio: These all remain Toss-Ups. The southeastern Sun Belt states were expected to be very competitive, but Ohio was thought to be trending steadily Republican. That tells you a lot about the landscape and Trump's struggles in the Midwest. Florida, at one point this summer, looked as if it was leaning toward Biden, but there is almost no path to reelection for Trump without Florida. So his campaign doubled down there and the race tightened, though a couple of polls this week have shown Biden opening up a lead again.

Vice President Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris square off in the first and only vice presidential debate Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET in Salt Lake City. Pence has laid low with President Trump undergoing treatment for the coronavirus, a threat the president had downplayed for months. But Pence is going to need to show up in a big way to try to inject some needed positive energy into the Trump-Pence presidential campaign, which has been consistently lagging Biden-Harris in the polls. Progressives, frustrated with Joe Biden's sometimes uneven public speaking appearances, have been waiting for this moment. They think Harris, who is more than 20 years younger than Biden, can deliver a better rhetorical punch. Both vice presidential candidates have said they are looking forward to the debate. \"My message to the Democratic nominee for vice president: congratulations. I'll see you in Salt Lake City,\" Pence said after Harris was selected as Biden's running mate. Harris responded wryly and with a wide smile in an interview with ABC, simply saying: \"Oh good. Me, too. Oh, I'm looking forward to seeing him. Absolutely.\" Well, game on. Here are five questions ahead of Wednesday night's debate: 1. Can Pence right the ship? Vice President Pence and his family arrive on Marine Two at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on Monday as he departs for Utah ahead of the vice presidential debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Eight years ago, it was Biden who helped steady the Obama reelection campaign with his solid performance in the vice presidential debate. It stabilized the narrative of the presidential race after a shaky first debate for then-President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, the same task falls to Pence, ironically. He needs to have a good debate showing and articulate a clear Trump campaign message after Trump's widely panned first debate performance followed by testing positive for COVID-19, which landed him in the hospital over the weekend. It's been chaotic for the Trump campaign and White House. If anyone can take the temperature down, it's the understated Pence. Pence, though, is very conservative, and while that appeals to the base, especially white evangelicals, he and Trump aren't lining up with the middle of the electorate. Independents and suburban voters have abandoned Trump on most issues during the Trump presidency, and Trump did nothing to reach out beyond the base in the first debate. That has to be a task for Pence, but how does he do it given his politics? 2. How does Pence counter a Harris punch? Harris has shown an ability to go viral and speak in soundbites, whether at high-profile hearings or some of the Democratic primary debates. She will aim to put Pence on his heels, and he's not dealing with the more staid Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick, who went up against Pence in 2016. Harris can be a strong debater and will certainly look for ways to bring the hammer down on Pence and make him defend unpopular Trump policies, positions and statements. How and whether Pence can counter could determine who wins the debate. Harris has the added hurdle of being the first woman of color on a major-party presidential ticket, and her team is well aware that she has to navigate everything that comes with that, as well. Of course, Harris has been dealing with that her entire career and life. But there are potential pitfalls on race and gender that Pence has to be careful about in responding and attacking. 3. Does Harris live up to the hype? Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris speaks during a voter mobilization drive-in event in Las Vegas at UNLV on Oct. 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris speaks during a voter mobilization drive-in event in Las Vegas at UNLV on Oct. 2. This is the moment progressives have been waiting for. They desperately want someone to stick it to Team Trump. But remember that debates can be all about expectations. The bar was very low for Biden because Trump and his campaign have cast him as incompetent and \"not all there.\" Trump's antics made it easy for Biden to clear that bar. But there are lots of expectations for Harris, and she needs to deliver a solid performance to keep the Biden train moving forward. Also, because of Biden's age, the spotlight may be brighter on Harris than for past vice presidential nominees. Democrats have set her up as the heir apparent after a Biden presidency, whether Biden runs for reelection or not. So this is a chance for her to show not just that she will be an attack dog for Biden, but for a large audience to see what kind of potential president she would be. 4. Can Harris stick to the Biden line? One way Pence has signaled pretty loudly that he will go after Harris is painting her as tied to the \"radical left,\" someone who will try to drag Biden further than his public statements are leading on. \"As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left,\" Pence told a crowd in Mesa, Ariz., after Harris was named Biden's running mate. \"So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Sen. Harris. You all might like to know that the vice presidential debate is on Oct. 7 in Utah.\" The next day, Pence said this on Fox News: \"I can't wait to get to Salt Lake City and be on the stage with her, to compare Joe Biden's nearly 50 years in public life \u2014 the agenda of the radical left, the agenda that she's embraced throughout her political career \u2014 with the results of this president and this administration.\" This is the Trump campaign's Trojan horse theory \u2014 despite Biden making it clear he's in charge and not on board with withdrawing funding from the police, \"Medicare for All\" or the Green New Deal. This is coming right down the train tracks at Harris with lights blaring and the horn blowing. This won't be a sneak attack. Harris' challenge will be to make a bold moral argument against the Trump administration, while also playing the good soldier and articulating the Biden campaign line clearly, forcefully and believably. 5. How does Trump's health come up? President Trump arrives back at the White House aboard Marine One after being treated for COVID-19 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on  Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The elephant in the room of this debate is Trump's health. The president tested positive for COVID-19 last week. While he's back at the White House and says he's \"FEELING GREAT!\" his doctors caution that he's not \"out of the woods.\" The administration and the president's doctors have delivered conflicting messages over the past few days, and the president made an impromptu trip in a hermetically sealed car with aides and Secret Service in the vehicle to visit supporters outside Walter Reed, where he was hospitalized, on Sunday. When he returned to the White House on Monday evening, he waved from a balcony, without a mask, and recorded a video urging Americans not to let the coronavirus \"dominate you.\" The succession plan \u2014 in case his health does decline further \u2014 also hasn't been clear, and continuity of government is an important thing to reflect to the world, especially adversaries who are always looking for American weakness. Pence is likely going to have to be spokesman for how the administration has dealt with not just this situation, but the coronavirus more broadly \u2014 to a large audience \u2014 especially since he is ostensibly still in charge of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. On Tuesday, Trump announced a halt to negotiations on a new coronavirus relief package \u2014 talks that had largely stalled on their own \u2014 until after the election. The administration has gotten criticized for its response; Trump is suffering politically because of it; and Pence is going to have to give voters who could be open to voting for Trump the confidence that the administration can handle the ongoing pandemic. Trump getting the virus may also mean Harris adjusting her approach on how personal she can get about his handling of the pandemic. The Biden campaign has been trying to walk that line already, wishing the president and first lady well, but criticizing his approach to COVID-19.",

That close presidential contest was one of several in U.S. history. Through the years President Trump has been in office, Americans have grown accustomed to hearing of \"norms\" ignored and \"guardrails\" broken. Trump has fulfilled his supporters' desire for an unconventional leader unbound by the sort of unwritten rules other presidents have followed. Yet nothing may have prepared the nation for the prospect of a presidential election in which an incumbent refuses to acknowledge an apparent defeat. Nor are Americans ready for an election where no clear winner can be determined in a timely fashion and the constitutional processes for resolving the issue prove insufficient. That scenario seems increasingly plausible, given the pandemic's impact on the voting process, the president's stated attitude and the current state of the laws governing the election of the president. This past week, the president several times took questions about the American tradition of \"peaceful transfer of power\" when a president loses a bid for reelection. On Wednesday, he declined to commit to leaving office. \"We'll have to see,\" he said, before launching an attack on the legitimacy of mailed ballots.  This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has record numbers of voters planning to do so by mail. Many states may not have counted all their legally submitted ballots by Election Night, or even the day after. But the president has insisted any delay past that night will be evidence of fraud. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and several other senior Republicans said they expected a normal, peaceful transfer of power if the president lost. The White House said Trump would respect \"a free and fair election.\" But on Friday night, at a campaign rally, Trump assured his supporters that no controversy needed to arise. \"We're not going to lose this,\" he said, before adding: \"Except if they cheat.\" That caveat recalled his frequent assertions in 2016 that the election that year would be \"rigged,\" unless he won. The president's comments \u2014 to reporters as well as rally crowds \u2014 have greatly expanded public wariness about what could lie ahead. Even as Trump was ramping up his threats of post-election resistance, The Atlantic was releasing an online version of a major story from its November issue by reporter Barton Gellman. A veteran of many years with The Washington Post, Gellman also relied in part on a 55-page article published in 2019, in the Loyola University of Chicago Law Review. It was written by Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State's Moritz School of Law. The articles together detail how Trump, if he had a modest lead in the vote count on Election Night in one or more decisive states, could declare himself reelected and resist any further accounting for the rest of the ballots by challenging those processes in the courts. Remembrance of troubles past The word \"unprecedented\" has been used so often in the Trump era as to lose its meaning. But at a minimum the president's remarks can stir bad memories. In truth, there are stories of uncertainty and narrow escapes in several U.S. elections in the past. But none may offer an adequate model, or much useful guidance at all, given the magnitude of this year's election problems and the apparent determination of the incumbent to resist any adverse results. The previous episodes include past presidential elections in which the candidate who finished first in the voting was not inaugurated. Five times the clear winner of the popular vote did not win the Electoral College. There have also been times when a candidate who could have challenged the results well past Election Day chose not to do so, at least in part to avoid a confrontation that could have harmed the nation. Let's look at the cases in reverse chronological order, so as to begin with those that Americans alive today remember. The election of 2016. Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 2.8 million votes four years ago, by far the largest popular vote victory for anyone who did not get to be president. But her vote was concentrated in California and a few other populous states. The Electoral College gives an edge to voters in less populous states because each state's electoral vote equals the number of seats it has in Congress, including an automatic two in the Senate (regardless of population). So while Trump lost the popular vote, by winning more states he ran up a good score (306-232) in the Electoral College. The latter institution was created in the Constitution by founding fathers who feared \"tumult and disorder\" might prevail among the general run of the voting citizenry. So, 233 years later, voters on Election Day are only choosing which set of electors will gather in their state capitol roughly six weeks later to make the official choice. The Florida recount and the delayed results of 2000. \"We don't want another Florida\" is a common refrain among election watchers old enough to remember. Unresolved for five weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stop to recounts, the outcome in Florida was crucial because the state's 25 electoral votes would determine the outcome in the Electoral College \u2014 which had its closest vote since the 1800s. But determining who had won in Florida was difficult because the margin was so infinitesimal, officially 537 votes out of more than 5.8 million. Various problems also emerged regarding the counting or disallowing of imperfect voting cards (\"hanging chads\"). Democrats tried to force recounts in parts of the state. These were stopped by a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Republican candidate George W. Bush, who was declared the razor-thin winner by state officials \u2014 including his brother, Jeb, and one of his statewide campaign chairs. Although Democrats had some success in the Florida state courts, Bush v. Gore was ultimately decided by five of the nine Supreme Court justices. Democratic nominee Al Gore, who had a nationwide lead of about half a million votes, could have pressed his case further \u2013 including to the new Congress in January \u2014 but he decided against it. The close elections of 1968 and 1960. President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, remains among the most popular presidents in memory today. Few recall now that he won by only about 100,000 votes nationwide. Disputes arose over his wins in Illinois, where a big Democratic vote from Chicago carried the day, and Texas, home to his running mate Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as in other states \u2014 more than enough to cost the Democrats their win in the Electoral College. President John F. Kennedy remains among the most popular presidents in memory today. Few recall now that he won by only about 100,000 votes nationwide over then-Vice President Richard Nixon.\n                \n                    \n                    Keystone/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many urged the Republican nominee, then-Vice President Richard Nixon, to contest the Illinois in particular \u2014 in part because Chicago's Democratic Mayor Richard J. Daley was thought to have had a hand in it.  Challenges and recounts did proceed locally in several states, but Nixon, at least in public, kept his distance, saying that to do otherwise could cause \"a constitutional crisis\" and \"tear the country apart.\" Nixon had another close election eight years later, winning the popular vote nationally by less than a percentage point. The Electoral College was also close because 46 electoral votes went to third-party candidate George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama. So Nixon needed the motherlode of electoral votes from California to secure an outright majority in the Electoral College (as the Constitution requires). That would have thrown the election to the House of Representatives, where each state would have one vote (another provision of the original Constitution) and where the outcome might have favored the Democratic nominee, then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The ouster of Grover Cleveland in 1888. Cleveland was the first Democrat elected president after the Civil War, ending a drought for the party that lasted a generation. After four years in office, he was able to attract half a million more voters than he had in 1884, winning the popular tally over his Republican challenger, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana. But this time around Cleveland was not able to win his home state of New York, which meant the switch of a whopping 36 votes in the Electoral College and a term in office for Harrison. Four years later, in 1892, Cleveland came back to win his home state and widen his margin in the popular vote and dominate the Electoral College, making him the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms. The disputed election of 1876. The third election after the Civil War showed just how badly divided the country remained \u2014 and would remain. The popular vote winner by 3 percentage points was a Democrat named Samuel Tilden, who not only managed an outright majority of the popular vote but carried his home state of New York and its neighbors Connecticut and New Jersey. He also won the border states (Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri) and Indiana \u2014 in addition to most of what had been the Confederacy. But with all that, Tilden came up one vote shy of an outright majority in the Electoral College. Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes, however, could not count on the votes of three Southern states (Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida), where  the delegations were in dispute. That meant neither candidate had a majority of the Electoral College on the appointed day, and the stalemate continued. Finally, well into the new year of 1877, two weeks before Inauguration Day (which was then in March), a compromise gave Hayes the electoral votes of the disputed states with the understanding that, in exchange, the federal government would withdraw its occupation troops throughout the South. That augured the end of the Reconstruction era, the recapture of state and local governments by the old power structure of white Southern Democrats. That soon led to the passage of \"Jim Crow\" laws oppressing formerly enslaved people and the de facto nullification of voting rights supposedly secured by three amendments to the Constitution. That state of affairs largely prevailed in the region until the 1960s, with aftereffects that are still felt today. The \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824. Long before the media echo chambers of our time, a phrase emerged that captured the sense of injustice felt by supporters of Andrew Jackson in his first bid for president. In a four-way contest, Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote (as best it could be determined at the time) and of the Electoral College as well. There was every reason for the war hero from Tennessee to expect to win the vote in the House of Representatives. But his rivals conspired against him and one of them, the legendary Kentuckian Henry Clay, got House members from his state and two neighboring states to throw their support to John Quincy Adams instead. Clay would later become Adams' secretary of state, prompting the accusations of  \"a corrupt bargain.\" But Jackson would have his revenge relatively soon, prevailing easily over Adams in the next presidential cycle (1828) and winning reelection four years after that. The wildly contested election of 1800. George Washington was twice elected without opposition and then retired in 1796, leaving his vice president, John Adams, to hold the fort. Adams, from Massachusetts, ran as the favorite of a party calling themselves the Federalists. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia was the nominee of what were then called the Democratic-Republicans. The voting took place over a month, with each state setting its own date. The states split about evenly between the candidates, and electors from four states divided their votes.  Adams emerged the winner in the Electoral College by just three votes (71 to 68). But if that seemed messy, it was a model of tidiness compared to what happened four years later when Adams sought a second term. Although he once again swept New England, he lost New York, in part because Jefferson had a New Yorker named Aaron Burr as his running mate. The Jefferson-Burr ticket had a clear 73-65 majority in the Electoral College, dismissing the incumbent.  But a dispute arose regarding which end of the ticket was up. Burr maintained that he had received as many electoral votes as Jefferson and that the House of Representatives should decide which of them should be president. (The Constitution would be amended a few years later to make sure this confusion did not recur.) In the wild weeks that followed there were charges and counter-charges of vote buying and bribery in the House, and some Federalists who were vehemently opposed to the Virginian swung their support to Burr, whom they regarded as the lesser threat. So of the House delegations for the 16 states in the Union at the time, Jefferson could only count on eight. Over seven days in February 1801 the House conducted 35 ballots, reaching the same 8-8 deadlock each time. In the end, the decisive influence was that of another New Yorker, Alexander Hamilton. While he disagreed with Jefferson on a host of issues, Hamilton had no use at all for Burr and feared him as a unprincipled demagogue. So he mounted one of his furious writing campaigns on behalf of Jefferson (\"by far not so dangerous a man\"). On the 36th ballot, the New York delegation finally turned on Burr and switched its vote to Jefferson, who would take the oath the following month. Hamilton was not a member of Congress, and in fact never came to Washington in his life. But as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 he had argued for the Electoral College as a means of restraining the excesses of democracy. His abhorrence of Burr is depicted dramatically in the Broadway musical Hamilton \u2014 albeit with some dramatic license \u2014 and their rivalry finally ended when Burr fatally shot Hamilton in a duel in 1804.",

In a secret ceremony, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn in for a sixth term Wednesday in the capital amid nationwide protests and international outrage over his August reelection in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent. State media announced that Lukashenko, who has held on to power for more than a quarter-century, took the oath of office during a ceremony at Independence Palace in Minsk that was attended by several hundred government officials. Presidential inaugurations in Belarus, seen as major state occasions, are normally announced in advance. But critics say the covert ceremony was aimed at avoiding the embarrassment of mass demonstrations that have plagued the government since the disputed Aug. 9 presidential election in which Lukashenko claimed to have won 80% of the vote. His main opponent, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a 38-year-old political novice, was forced to flee for her safety to neighboring Lithuania, a member of NATO, after the election results were announced. Tikhanovskaya, speaking from exile Wednesday, called the swearing-in ceremony a farce. \"I am the only leader who was elected by the Belarusian people. And our job now is to build a new Belarus together,\" she declared in an emailed statement that also stated she had \"returned\" from a visit to Brussels, where she met with European Union foreign ministers on Monday. The August vote, which the U.S. and its European allies have said was neither free nor fair, risks elevating an already isolated Belarus to the level of pariah state, with Russia as Lukashenko's main supporter. Shortly after the election, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called out the election as fraudulent. \"Severe restrictions on ballot access for candidates, prohibition of local independent observers at polling stations, intimidation tactics employed against opposition candidates, and the detentions of peaceful protesters and journalists marred the process,\" Pompeo said in a statement. The U.S. also recently signed on to a joint statement condemning Belarus' crackdown on Internet freedoms in the wake of the disputed election. Meanwhile, the European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a statement last week that the bloc does not recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus. \"The situation is clear for us. We consider the elections of Aug. 9 fraudulent,\" Borrell told the EU Parliament. A Kremlin spokesman told reporters on Wednesday that Vladimir Putin wasn't aware of the inauguration and that he didn't know whether the Russian president would congratulate Lukashenko. The spokesman said Putin has no plans to visit Minsk. However, hundreds of Russian airborne troops parachuted into Belarus on Wednesday as part of joint military exercises dubbed \"Slavic Brotherhood,\" according to Russia's defense ministry. The drills are interpreted by some as a show of support for Lukashenko. The maneuvers come as Russia has denied plans to open a military base in Belarus, a prospect that has alarmed neighbor and NATO-member Latvia. \"Russia is strengthening and modernizing its military capacity close to the Latvian border and Belarus is also involved in these activities,\" Latvian Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks said in a statement Tuesday that was reported by Bloomberg. Pabriks added that such drills, in which \"aggressive scenarios against the Baltic states are played out, do not promote mutual trust and good neighborly relations.\" NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow contributed to this report.",

Weighing the president down in his reelection bid is his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and race relations, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. More than half of Americans \u2014 56% \u2014 disapprove of the job President Trump has done handling the pandemic. By a 54% to 40% margin, likely voters also say they prefer Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Trump to handle the coronavirus. On race relations, likely voters prefer Biden 56% to 38%; and even on crime, Biden edges Trump with likely voters, 49% to 45%. The president continues, however, to have an advantage on the economy. Americans approve of the job he's doing on the economy, 49% to 45%, despite the millions of jobs lost during the pandemic. And likely voters say they prefer Trump over Biden to handle the economy, 50% to 46%. That's partially why the president's campaign is focusing a new round of fall advertising on the economy. Loading... Here's a breakdown of where American adults stand on key issues as voting season begins across the country, from the environment to the pandemic and election security, according to the poll: Climate change takes over top spot for Democrats in issue priorities On the issues, the parties have very different priorities. Overall, the economy (21%) is seen as the No. 1 issue for likely voters, followed by the coronavirus (13%), climate change (12%), health care (8%) and race relations (7%). But looking at the numbers by party shows the two sides appear to be living in very different universes. For Democratic likely voters, amid wildfires in the West and hurricane season, climate change has taken over the top spot (22%), followed by the coronavirus (18%), health care (15%), the economy (10%) and race relations (9%). Loading... Before the 2018 election, health care was the clear top issue for Democrats, followed by climate change and immigration. For Republican likely voters, in this poll, it was the economy (35%) that was head and shoulders above any issue, followed by abortion (14%), crime and guns (both 7%), and the coronavirus and jobs (both 5%). In a sharp reversal from 2018, just 2% of likely voters in this poll said immigration was the top issue. Just ahead of the 2018 election, as Trump called for a shutdown of the Southern border, immigration was tied for second on the issue priority list behind the economy/jobs and health care. For a quarter of Republicans, immigration was their top issue in 2018, second only to the economy/jobs. Now, just 4% of Republicans called it their top issue. Number saying they'll get vaccinated plummets Confidence in a potential vaccine has gotten worse. Just 49% of Americans now say they will get vaccinated when one is made available; 44% say they won't. This is a big shift from last month when 60% said they would and 35% said they would not. This comes from a 13-point decline in the number of independents saying they'll get vaccinated, from 61% to 48%, and a 10-point shift in Republicans, from 44% to 54%, saying they won't. Trust in public health experts and local officials declines Americans say public health experts and state and local governments are still their most trusted sources of information on the coronavirus, and just a third say they can trust what they hear from Trump. But the president's messaging against some of these officials \u2014 in this election year \u2014 seems to have resonated with his base. Trust in both public health experts and state and local officials has declined 15 points since March. And it's coming, again, from Republicans. Overall, 69% of Americans said they have trust in public health experts, down from 84% in March and 75% in August. But just since last month, among Republicans, that trust has dropped from 62% to 51%. A majority (57%) of Americans said they trust what they're hearing from state and local governments, but that's down from 72% in March and 62% in August. Again, the shift is attributable to Republicans, who declined 8 points in the last month, from 51% to 43%. Not rating much higher than Trump in terms of trust on the pandemic is the news media at 38%. Americans are pretty pessimistic that things will be back to normal any time soon \u2014 69% think it's going to be six months or longer. For context, back in May, 65% said it would be at least six months, and that was four months ago. A shift in views of the protests over racism and the Black Lives Matter movement There has been a continued downward trend in support of the protests against police action as it relates to George Floyd in Minneapolis and Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. In June, 62% said the protests were mostly legitimate as opposed to mostly people acting unlawfully. But in August, that dropped to 53%, and now, Americans are split, 48% to 45%. Registered Republicans are now firmly in the camp of saying the protesters are mostly acting unlawfully with 85% saying so, as opposed to 81% of Democrats and 53% of independents saying the protests are mostly legitimate. There's also a racial, generational and educational divide. Whites, by a 50% to 45% margin, now say the protests are mostly people acting unlawfully, though there's a big divide among whites by education. Whites with a college degree side with protesters (61%) versus whites without a college degree, who say the protesters are mostly acting unlawfully (60%). Two-thirds of African Americans say the demonstrations are mostly legitimate protests. Latinos, by a narrower 49% to 40% margin, also say they are mostly legitimate. There's a stark divide by age. Fifty-nine percent of millennial and Gen Z voters (ages 18-39) say they think the protests are mostly legitimate, while slight majorities of every other age group disagree. And while a majority of Americans overall (54%) still say they have a favorable impression of the Black Lives Matter movement, there has been an uptick in those saying they have an unfavorable one, going from 34% negative last month to 40% now. There, the negative opinions mostly come from Republicans, 83% of whom say they have an unfavorable impression of the movement, compared with 89% of Democrats and 59% of independents, who say the opposite. Whites are split at 47%, but the divide is stark again by education \u2014 61% of whites with a college degree saying they have a favorable impression of BLM, while 56% of those without a college degree say they have a negative one (including 64% of white men without a college degree). Among Black voters, 78% have a favorable impression, as do 66% of Latinos. Here, again, there's a huge generational divide. Of Gen Z and millennial voters, 68% have a favorable impression of the movement, 20 points higher than any other generation \u2014 Gen X, ages 40-55 (48%); baby boomers, ages 56-74 (46%); or Silent/Greatest, over 74 (45%). Election security Most Americans (53%) say the U.S. is either very prepared or prepared to keep November's election safe and secure. By a 69% to 20% margin, national adults are confident their state and local governments will run a fair election. Americans are more split on whether the U.S. Postal Service will deliver election-related material in a timely manner \u2014 52% express confidence, while 46% express doubt. By a 51% to 38% margin, Americans think Trump is encouraging election interference as opposed to making it safer. By a 50% to 37% margin, likely voters trust that the election results will be accurate \u2014 even if their candidate loses. And, perhaps surprisingly, there is little difference by party on this question. About a third (35%) of likely voters say they plan to vote by mail or absentee. Almost half (48%) say they will vote in person. There's a big split by party on this \u2014 two-thirds of likely Trump voters say they will vote in person, while just over a third (35%) of Biden backers say they will do so. Almost half of Biden supporters (46%) say they plan to vote by mail. So when interpreting election results, understand that Trump is set to dominate voting happening on Election Day, but that won't take into consideration votes by mail and early voting, which draw a substantial portion of the voting population. Methodology The poll, conducted from Sept. 11 through 16, surveyed 1,152 adults by cell phone and landline for a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. There were 964 registered voters in the poll for a margin of error of 4 percentage points and 723 likely voters with a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.",

Many Trump voters (or potential Trump voters) bring up abortion in explaining their voting rationale.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An anti-abortion-rights activist demonstrates in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in June. Many Trump voters (or potential Trump voters) bring up abortion in explaining their voting rationale. If President Trump wins Wisconsin again, he'll have Republican stalwarts like Mary Ludwig to thank. \"I always vote Republican because I'm so against abortion,\" she said, sitting next to a lake in the Milwaukee suburb of Oconomowoc on a recent summer evening. Ludwig has some reservations about Trump; she says that she doesn't like the \"offensive\" things he says. On the other hand, she also has things she admires about him: She really likes his kids and thinks he's handling the economy well. But those are all secondary to the fact that she deeply cares about abortion, and Trump often speaks out against abortion rights. Therefore, she will vote for him for president. \"I'm a mother. I birthed three children,\" she said. \"And the feeling of life in me is real at conception.\" This is one way Ludwig is similar to many other Trump voters. In a year when Americans are thinking about recession, a pandemic, racial justice, climate change and policing, Trump voters (or potential Trump voters) repeatedly in interviews brought up abortion in explaining their voting decisions. Two hundred miles away from Oconomowoc, in Cresco, Iowa, farmer William Goetch stood chatting with a friend outside a grocery store on a sweltering August day. Goetch farms just outside of Cresco, in an area that voted solidly for President Obama in 2012 and then for solidly for Trump in 2016. I asked Goetch if he, too, could ever be a swing voter. \"No, I couldn't be. Just mostly because the issue of abortion,\" he said, noting that he doesn't like Democrat Joe Biden's support of abortion rights. (And, indeed, he was not a swing voter earlier, either \u2014 Goetch said he never voted for Obama.) His friend, John Whelan, said he's undecided on who he'll support. But listening to Goetch, Whelan said that he thinks abortion might sway his vote, as well. \"You hear the abortion thing \u2014 that's kind of a big thing for being Catholic. So that could be the final straw,\" he said. A high priority, but rarely the top priority Biden wants there to be a federal law protecting the right to an abortion. (He did, however, flip-flop early in the campaign on whether there should be a ban on federal funding being used for abortions. He ultimately said he opposed such a ban.) Trump, meanwhile, wants Roe v. Wade overturned and has said he only supports abortion rights in cases of rape, incest or protecting a mother's life. If he is reelected, he almost certainly will have a chance to name at least one conservative justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, possibly overturning the decision that legalized abortion in the U.S. Figuring out how important abortion is to the electorate as a whole depends on which polls you look at \u2014 and how you ask the question. \"If you ask about the most important issue facing the country in comparison with issues like the pandemic, jobs and the economy, health care, our educational system, abortion barely registers,\" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. As of August, less than 0.5% of Americans told Gallup that they consider abortion the most important problem in America. But then, abortion is a top priority (if not the top priority) to far more voters. Fully 40% of voters see abortion as \"very important\" to their vote, according to a summer poll from Pew. That puts it well behind nearly a dozen other issues, but nevertheless shows its importance to a huge number of Americans. Perhaps most revealing, a spring poll from Gallup found that about 1 in 4 Americans, particularly voters who oppose abortion rights, see abortion as a sort of personal litmus test. Fully 30% of people who consider themselves \"pro-life\" say they would only vote for a candidate who shares that view compared to 19% of people who consider themselves \"pro-choice.\" That disparity may be reflected in the relative status of abortion at this year's party conventions. While Republicans foregrounded the topic at their convention, for example with a speech from abortion-rights opponent and activist Abby Johnson, the topic barely came up at the Democratic convention, as The New York Times' Lauren Kelley noted. One way to look at it is that abortion doesn't function for many voters as an issue in the way the economy does. Because many conservative Christian voters talk about seeing abortion as wrong because of their religious beliefs, abortion is closely tied to their core identity. These types of polls, as well as these voter interviews, signal that abortion (and, specifically, opposition to abortion rights) is a big part of the glue keeping Trump's base together \u2014 a base that includes the overwhelming share of white evangelicals. \"It's an important part of maintaining [Trump's] coalition, but it is not the issue on which the election will be decided,\" Ayres said. All of this said, it's important to note that many Americans have nuanced views on abortion \u2014 a plurality, 50%, believe it should be legal in certain circumstances, compared to the 3 in 10 who believe it should always be legal, and 2 in 10 who believe it should always be illegal. In this screenshot from the RNC's livestream of the 2020 Republican National Convention, anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson addresses the virtual convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the RNC\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this screenshot from the RNC's livestream of the 2020 Republican National Convention, anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson addresses the virtual convention. How an abortion stance can change The crucial role that abortion plays in Trump's base also means that when a voter decides abortion isn't the most important issue, or even moderately changes their opinion on abortion, they can easily fall away from the Trump coalition. Adam Hardy, from Brooklyn Park, Minn., is one example of this. As a white evangelical, abortion was top of mind for him in 2016 when he voted for Trump. But Hardy can pinpoint exactly what made him decide he wouldn't vote for him again. \"Really, what happened with the caravan through Southern and Central America, and then having the children separated from their parents at the border is really what turned it for me to not supporting Donald Trump and not focusing on abortion as the sole issue of electing a candidate,\" he said. Hardy is one of a small but important group of voters: those who voted for Obama and then Trump. He's also an example of how voters' issue priorities can shift from election to election. He voted for Obama in 2008, largely as a vote against John McCain and Sarah Palin. He voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, believing he would handle the economy better than Obama. Then, abortion was top of mind when he chose Trump in 2016. Hardy still considers himself anti-abortion, but he also believes it should be a personal choice, and he fears that if the practice were banned, people would dangerously attempt it themselves. He added that he thinks abortion-rights opponents need to expand their focus. \"The pro-life movement being solely focused on the unborn child seems to forget or ignore after birth how that child will grow up and what type of environment they will grow up in,\" he said. Candidates will be fighting hard for votes from Hardy and his fellow Minnesotans. He thinks he knows how he'll vote, though he's not enthused about it. In particular, he added, he has reservations about Biden's age. \"In all reality, it's America and our terrible two-party system. And so until things change, I think I have to vote Biden just to ensure that my vote will be counted against Trump,\" he said. This may make Hardy part of yet another crucial voting bloc: those unenthusiastic voters in the middle that candidates will try to sway, in hopes of swinging the election.",

GONZALEZ: Treat others the way you want to be treated. President - I'm not a fan of him, not at all. KOCHERGA: Gonzalez plans to cast a ballot for Joe Biden. David Ashcroft cannot decide if he wants to vote at all. DAVID ASHCROFT: It kind of makes me sick to my stomach just knowing that I put one of these people in office. The best thing for me is just to not vote. KOCHERGA: The 21-year-old waiter is standing in the plaza near a fountain with a large sculpture of alligators. He's with a friend, Amanda Kilcrease. She's a 20-year-old college student who says she will vote but reluctantly. AMANDA KILCREASE: It just feels like if Trump wins again, like, then - and I didn't vote, I would have guilt with that, too, that I didn't take a small action that could have had an opposite outcome. But I'm also not happy with the outcome of Biden. I just want to stress that. KOCHERGA: This is also the site of the mass shooting at a Walmart one year ago August. That's on the minds of Marta Santiesteban and her husband. Her 90-year-old father was killed at the store. The young gunman from the Dallas area told police he drove to El Paso to, quote, \"stop the Hispanic invasion.\" MARTA SANTIESTEBAN: Invasion. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah. SANTIESTEBAN: We're being invaded. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Of Mexicans in the United States. SANTIESTEBAN: Yeah. I think the climate contributed 100%. This is on Donald Trump. KOCHERGA: President Trump has his supporters in El Paso, too. Some of those voters were shopping at a farm supply and animal feed store on the western edge of El Paso near the New Mexico state line. William Long was in the parking lot after picking up some dog food. WILLIAM LONG: I'm pretty much going to probably vote for Mr. Trump even though if he'd shut up sometimes, he'd be way ahead. But the only thing is at least you know what's going on in that mind of his. KOCHERGA: Voter Terry Manning was reluctant to talk about issues on his mind because of the divisive political climate, something he never imagined in El Paso, a place known for tolerance. TERRY MANNING: We all grew up sharing different viewpoints and different cultures, and just everybody was together. But I have friends who've had their yard sign stolen or, once the sign was stolen, had eggs thrown at their house if they were for a particular candidate. KOCHERGA: The music producer and photographer voiced his concerns after loading his pickup truck with bales of hay. MANNING: That's alfalfa hay. I've got five horses, three goats and a donkey. KOCHERGA: Across town, Omar Castaneda was buying parts at an auto supply store with his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 8. OMAR CASTANEDA: Trying to get the kids back to go to school - I think it's important as far as socializing them. I think it's a big part of growing up, and I think they need that. KOCHERGA: He's also concerned about social justice. CASTANEDA: Black Lives Matter and the whole racial thing going on - I think it's very important that they prioritize that during their presidency. KOCHERGA: Castaneda has not decided who he will vote for yet, but after a tumultuous summer, he's ready to pay attention to the presidential race. For NPR News, I'm Angela Kocherga in El Paso.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko appears to be regaining the upper hand after mass demonstrations against his reelection in an Aug. 9 vote criticized as neither free nor fair by the U.S. and the European Union. For opposition supporters, a sense of dread is replacing the euphoria of some of the largest protests in Belarus since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \"The government is now tightening the screws very tightly, and it's becoming quite dangerous,\" said Yelena, 44, a volunteer in the campaign office of Viktor Babariko, one of Lukashenko's challengers in the election who was barred from running and jailed on fraud charges. \"This week people continued to go out on the street, despite all the threats and warnings that they would be arrested,\" said Yelena, who asked that her last name not be used because she faces persecution as an opposition activist. \"It's become scary because they can go after you simply for things like the color of your clothes,\" she said. \"It's like George Orwell's 1984. They can punish you for wearing red and white, or a white bracelet, or a T-shirt with a slogan.\" Belarus' white-red-white flag has become a symbol of the opposition to Lukashenko, who, after becoming president in 1994, introduced a green and red flag reminiscent of the nation's Soviet-era flag. Red and white became the colors of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition candidate who united the three campaigns of her jailed husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, Babariko and Viktor Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the U.S. who had to flee the country. After the election, Tikhanovskaya too was forced to leave Belarus, and is now based in neighboring Lithuania. What's left of the organized opposition to Lukashenko is a \"coordination council\" that wants to facilitate a dialogue with the regime for a peaceful transition of power. Lukashenko refuses to talk to the group, and the authorities have opened a criminal case against it. On Wednesday, investigators called in Svetlana Alexievich, Belarus' Nobel literature laureate and a council member, for questioning. Earlier two leaders of the council were given 10-day jail sentences for allegedly holding an illegal rally. \"We will not be silenced and forget what happened. We demand all those responsible be investigated and brought to justice, and that law and justice be restored,\" Maria Kolesnikova, one of the council's leaders, said in a video appeal this week. In the first days of the protests, police arrested almost 7,000 demonstrators. When they were released from prison, many of them spoke of being subjected to indiscriminate beatings and torture. The protests and strikes that followed rattled the Lukashenko regime, says Artyom Shraibman, a political analyst in Minsk, but now the demonstrations in the capital are not as widespread and visible as before. It's still too early to say that Lukashenko has won, Shraibman says, because protesters could turn out in force if the crackdown is too harsh. \"Until the protests have subsided completely, we cannot say they're over because they're basically like fire,\" Shraibman said. \"In theory, the authorities are capable of putting some more gasoline on the fire.\" The opposition council, he said, has limited room for maneuver. \"Probably the best thing that they can do is resist all of Lukashenko's efforts to drag them into framing the conflict as geopolitical,\" Shraibman said. On Friday, Lukashenko visited a cheese factory in the city of Orsha, draping a white cape over his suit as he inspected the machinery. It wasn't long before he was warning dairy workers that American F-16 fighter planes were now just a 20-minute flight away from the border \u2014 maybe even armed with nuclear weapons, he said. \"They don't need Belarus. Belarus is just a springboard, as usual, to get to Russia,\" Lukashenko said, referring to Swedish, French and German invasions over the centuries that all led through Belarus. Lukashenko has been talking up the threat from Belarus' NATO neighbors ever since mass protests broke out after the disputed election, which he claimed to have won in a landslide. Before the vote, Lukashenko had warned that it was enemies based in Russia who were trying to divide Belarus. A political survivor, Lukashenko has now secured the Kremlin's backing while branding his domestic opponents as pawns of the West. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that on Lukashenko's request, Russia had put together a rapid-reaction force that could intervene in Belarus if necessary. That same evening, Lukashenko's riot police detained more than 260 people at a peaceful rally in Minsk, including 50 journalists. But Putin's support for Lukashenko has alienated many Belarusians, who generally have warm feelings toward Russia. \"We expected something else. We always assumed that Putin and Russia would support the Belarusian people and not one particular individual, especially when they see how hard it is for Belarusians right now,\" said opposition activist Yelena. She said she hopes the weather is good this weekend so people turn out for renewed protests across the country.",

            "article_content": "With President Trump expected to accept his party's nomination Thursday night, NPR takes a look at his agenda for a second term.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Tonight on the South Lawn of the White House, Donald Trump will explain to the country exactly why he thinks he should be president for four more years, and, as it did four years ago, Trump's argument can be summed up in four words - Make America Great Again. Unlike four years ago, Trump is already in the job, and poll numbers suggest he's facing an uphill battle. To hear more about President Trump's vision for his next term and how other incumbent presidents have argued their case for four more years, we're joined now by NPR's senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Hey, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Ailsa. CHANG: Good to have you. Well, all right, let's just start with that agenda the president is putting forward - make America great again, again. Did I get that right? ELVING: Yes, that's the new slogan they've been trying out this week. It's a somewhat awkward phrase when you first hear it. Here's Vice President Mike Pence using it last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: We will make America great again, again. (APPLAUSE) ELVING: Now, that may be a perfect bumper sticker, but it's not a perfect punchline. It sounds maybe a little too much like, we'll get it right this time. But it does make sense as a campaign theme given the circumstances - where Donald Trump felt his presidency stood at the beginning of this year before the virus, the recession, the racial unrest, and then, of course, where we find ourselves in August. CHANG: Right. I mean, is that why the campaign veered away from the message the president's team had in mind at the beginning of this year, which was Keep America Great? ELVING: It certainly makes sense. That had been the new slogan right after the president survived impeachment and when the Trump team thought that the convention would be essentially a triumphal entry into history, something like the scene for the president's State of the Union speech last winter. Here's what he sounded like then. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never ever going back. ELVING: And we've heard some of that same concept this week from Kimberly Guilfoyle. She is formerly a Fox News personality who is now dating Donald Trump Jr. and also advising the campaign. She gave a speech on the convention's first night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: The best is yet to come. CHANG: Ron, how much have we seen previous presidents running for reelection actually lay out an explicit, detailed agenda for the second term? ELVING: As a rule, they have not run on an agenda for a second term. They talk about the future, something greater to come in a second term, but they know the election is a referendum on the first term and the political realities of the reelection year. Now, if those realities are working in the president's favor, he can afford to be aspirational, if not terribly specific in looking ahead. Bill Clinton talked a lot about the future in his 1996 acceptance speech of his renomination, including a phrase that would become part of the discourse for years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL CLINTON: Let us commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century. ELVING: And Ronald Reagan in 1984, on his way to winning 49 states, could run a fuzzy, feel-good campaign about how everything was great. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: It's morning again in America. Today, more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country's history, with interest rates... ELVING: President Trump, of course, would have liked to have had the circumstances for a Morning in America reelection campaign. But, of course, that's very hard to do in the circumstances, with 180,000 Americans having died of the virus. As for actual agendas in a second term, as it turned out, Ronald Reagan did a lot in his second term. He signed a major immigration reform and a historic tax reform and got the Senate to approve a sweeping nuclear arms control deal with the Soviets. But much of that agenda emerged only after Ronald Reagan was reelected, and that's been typical of other second terms as well. CHANG: OK. So even though it's rare for an incumbent president to lay out a detailed agenda for the second term, I am struck that during this Republican convention, they never updated even the party platform for 2020. They just stuck with what they had in 2016. How unusual is that? ELVING: Well, it's highly unusual. I can't think of a precedent for that. And it might suggest a lack of agenda other than the continuation of the last four years and the extension of promises as yet unfulfilled, such as the wall on the Mexican border or ending foreign military involvements or changing the culture in Washington. But we should note that the Trump campaign website does have a lengthy document called an agenda for a second term. It has 10 categories and lots of goals. One goal is to lower the payroll tax that's paid by workers and employers, but another goal is protecting Social Security and Medicare, which are paid for by that payroll tax. So how do these goals work together? That's the sort of question campaign documents rarely address. CHANG: That is NPR's senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Thank you, Ron.

            "article_content": "Follow live coverage of the RNC all week at NPR.org/conventions. Addressing the Republican National Convention Tuesday night, first lady Melania Trump made the case that President Trump is determined to work hard to improve the country in a second term. In her 25-minute keynote outside the White House, she directly addressed two of the biggest political crises facing her husband as he campaigns for a second term \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality and racial injustice. She started her longest speech as first lady by expressing sympathy for people who lost loved ones to COVID-19 or are suffering from the virus, acknowledging that \"many people are anxious.\" That stood in contrast to many other convention speakers, who sidestepped the pandemic or sought to put the crisis in the past tense. And she urged Americans to come together in difficult times, to reflect on racism and learn from it, without casting recent protests in overtly political terms. \"It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history,\" she said. \"Stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice.\" In 2016, Melania Trump spoke for about 15 minutes at the Republican National Convention \u2014 a speech that was initially well received but was soon criticized because some lines were plagiarized from Michelle Obama's 2008 convention speech. This time around, she spoke in front of about 100 guests, including White House officials and members of Trump's Cabinet in the Rose Garden, which was recently refurbished. Afterward, guests mingled and took selfies, many eschewing coronavirus prevention measures like social distancing and mask-wearing. As first lady, she has been seldom seen, and less often heard. She has focused her public work on the opioid epidemic and on children \u2014 visiting them in hospitals and schools, and famously, in detention facilities at the border with Mexico after they had been separated from their migrant parents. Speaking directly into the camera to \"mothers of this country,\" she said she shared their concerns about social media and the use of technology. Her \"Be Best\" campaign has urged people to treat each other kindly, especially online \u2014 an initiative she has acknowledged sparked skepticism because of her husband's proclivity to lash out at critics on Twitter and assign mean nicknames for his opponents in raucous rallies. Trump, whose husband's polling has suffered with suburban women, tried to cast him as a rough-around-the-edges truth-teller who delivered \"total honesty.\" \"Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking,\" she said. While she avoided criticizing her husband's political opponents, she did not hold back from criticizing the media for \"gossip\" and \"false headlines\" \u2014 stopping just short of using the president's favorite \"fake news\" insult.",

Ask any Republican strategist about the state of their party in 2020 and you'll get an answer something like this from GOP consultant Antonia Ferrier. \"This is Donald Trump's party,\" she said, \"and I don't think that should be much of a surprise.\" To underscore the point, the Republican National Committee decided not to write a new party platform this year. Instead, ahead of this week's GOP convention, the committee unanimously approved a resolution stating that the party \"will continue to enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.\" Ferrier comes from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. She worked as a communications adviser to current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and earlier for former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. She says the fact that the party is evolving is hardly unusual. All political parties change over time, she says, depending on issues and circumstances. But there is something different this time, says conservative Ramesh Ponnuru of the American Enterprise Institute. It's that Trump's takeover comes absent any deeply held ideology. \"It's not like [1964 GOP presidential nominee Barry] Goldwater with Goldwater-ism or [President Ronald] Reagan with Reagan-ism,\" Ponnuru said. \"There just really isn't a Trump-ism that transcends his whims of the moment.\" A change on trade and taking Putin's word A lot of long-held Republican beliefs \u2014 once seen as party dogma \u2014 have been jettisoned under Trump. The party of free trade has backed Trump as he imposes tariffs and criticizes trade deals. Most notable is his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact negotiated by the Obama administration and designed to be a counterweight to China's growing economic power. On national defense, the president accuses NATO allies of not carrying their weight and essentially freeloading off the United States. Then there's the longtime GOP hard line regarding the Soviet Union and Russia. Think back to 1987 and one of the defining moments of Reagan's presidency. Standing near the Berlin Wall and the famed Brandenburg Gate, Reagan sent a message to the leader of the Soviet Union: \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" President Ronald Reagan addresses the people of West Berlin at the base of the Brandenburg Gate on June 12, 1987.\n                \n                    \n                    Mike Sargent/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Reagan has another famous line he used when describing his dealings with the Soviets: \"Trust but verify.\" Trump's interactions with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, seem consistently conciliatory, especially when compared to Reagan. Trump and Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, not long after U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Asked at a news conference whether he'd confronted Putin about the revelation, Trump answered, \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\" Hard line on immigration well received by GOP voters A key issue for Trump during the campaign and as president has been his hard line on immigration. Again, his stance is a far cry from recent Republican presidents. Reagan signed an immigration reform law that allowed for amnesty for immigrants who entered the country illegally before 1982. President George W. Bush also pushed for immigration reform and highlighted the humanity of those crossing the border illegally, saying they do it to provide for their families. \"When I was governor of Texas I liked to say family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River,\" Bush said in a speech near the border with Mexico. People hold signs that read \"Build That Wall\" ahead of a Trump campaign rally on Feb. 12, 2016, in Tampa, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People hold signs that read \"Build That Wall\" ahead of a Trump campaign rally on Feb. 12, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. You'll hear no such comments from Trump, who has largely kept up the tone of the rhetoric he used in his very first speech as a presidential candidate. \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,\" he said that day in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. The president tapped into existing anti-immigrant sentiment in the Republican Party. Same with his attacks on global trade deals. Many working-class voters felt they suddenly had a champion in Trump. Tom Zawistowski, a Tea Party leader in Northeast Ohio, says it was like they'd found someone who'd been listening to what his movement had been talking about for years. \"This whole idea of, what about our jobs?\" Zawistowski said of Trump. \"He talked about the 'forgotten man' in 2016. You know, he talked about manufacturing jobs when the elites in both parties were basically saying, 'Hey, if you like to do manufacturing, tough luck.' \" While some may not like his Twitter habit, polls show sky-high approval for Trump among Republicans. Social conservatives praise Trump's judicial appointments. Others celebrate the 2017 tax-cut package. And many cheer his attacks on the media. Such solid GOP support comes even amid the pandemic, the more than 175,000 U.S. deaths it has caused so far, and the dive the economy and employment took as well. Enter the \"Never Trumpers\" Then there are those Republicans who have not been able to abide the president's decisive takeover of their party. Many simply call themselves \"Never Trumpers.\" Stuart Stevens, a former top presidential campaign strategist to GOP nominees George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, is one of them. Now he's working to defeat Trump by joining a group known as The Lincoln Project, which frequently produces viral ads attacking Trump. Stevens doesn't hesitate to call Trump racist, and in an interview on Fresh Air earlier this month, he said the current campaign reflects that. Looking ahead to the final months before Election Day, he said of the president: \"It's going to be a racial grievance campaign unlike we have ever seen on the national stage.\" As for the Republican Party, Stevens said he's \"extraordinarily negative on the prospects of the party.\" Democrats overwhelmingly win the votes of African American and Latino voters, and now younger voters. Stevens says with the country becoming more diverse demographically, that's a crisis for the GOP. \"And what does that mean for the Republican Party?\" he asked. \"It's a stage 4 cancer warning and the party gives no reason that it's going to change.\" Instead, Stevens said, Trump is actively driving those voters away. It's his party \u2014 will it last? As for how lasting Trump's transformation of the GOP will be, that depends on the election. If he wins, the story continues. But if he loses, says AEI's Ponnuru, there'll be a push to move on to someone else. He cites recent incumbent presidents defeated after one term \u2014 Jimmy Carter and the first George Bush \u2014 as two whose influence on their party faded instantly. But Trump, he said, may be a different case. First off, if he loses, he'll likely say the election was \"rigged.\" Further, he's not likely to exit the political arena as others have. Trump will likely still be on cable TV and certainly on Twitter, Ponnuru said. \"That's going to be a very delicate problem of coalition management and expansion for any future Republican Party.\" GOP strategist Ferrier put it this way: \"If there are those who believe that the Republican Party is just going to snap back to some status quo ante of, say, the Bush administration, I think that is misguided.\" Meanwhile, this week's GOP convention is giving America a nightly view of the current Republican Party, under complete command of President Trump.

On the first day of the Republican convention in Charlotte, N.C., more than five months after the coronavirus began spreading across the country, President Trump characterized the White House's response as \"the exact right thing.\" But, following a blueprint he has used for months, he also shifted responsibility for the pandemic response to the states. He accused many governors of having been \"ill-prepared\" for the pandemic, while praising others for doing a \"fine job.\" In May, Trump applauded Republican governors in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona for reopening quickly and having low case numbers. At the same time, he criticized states that remained closed, sparring with Democratic governors in New York and California, and pressuring leaders of swing states like Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to lift restrictions. In June, Trump held large campaign events that eschewed social distancing requirements and said he planned to hold more rallies in states that were reopening. He fixated on North Carolina and the lockdown measures imposed by its Democratic governor, mostly canceling Republican National Convention events there. But as summer continued, many of the same states that the president commended saw spikes in coronavirus cases. States he had criticized saw cases decline. So he was forced to change course. After rates of COVID-19 increased in many Republican-run states, Trump highlighted eventual, small drops in infections, often ignoring the state's summer spike. He eased up on criticisms of Democratic-led states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2014 states that avoided significant rises in infections this summer. But in the lead-up to the Republican National Convention, the president took some renewed swings at these leaders. Nationally, 37% of Americans think Trump would do a better job handling the coronavirus than his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, while 53% favor Biden. Trump maintains that he still has deep support, but polls have shown Biden with a continuous lead spanning months. Though polls will change, NPR's most recent electoral map ratings favor the former vice president. NPR has classified Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida as Democratic-leaning races; Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona as toss-ups; and Texas as Republican-leaning. Here's a look at what Trump has said about the pandemic response in seven key battleground states: NPR electoral map rating: Leaning Democratic Governor: Ron DeSantis, Republican Loading... Trump won Florida by just over a percentage point in 2016 and winning the state again may be key for his reelection. DeSantis has remained a top ally to Trump, with the president singing his praises throughout the pandemic. In April and May, Trump spoke often of Florida's successful fight with the coronavirus \u2014 a message that was solidified in early June, when he moved the majority of the Republican convention to Florida. But when the state's infection rate spiked in July, Trump stopped emphasizing its early successes and largely refrained from addressing the surge. Trump formally canceled the convention events in Jacksonville on July 23. As the state's case numbers have declined from peaks, he has since shifted to praising the state. While state polling averages indicated that Biden and Trump were virtually tied in March, the former vice president has since shot ahead and established a widening lead. Biden's biggest polling lead against Trump lasted from mid-June through July when the state experienced its highest case counts. NPR electoral map rating: Toss-up Governor: Doug Ducey, Republican Loading... Biden has steadily led in Arizona's polls since mid-March, but Trump has been no stranger to the state, making multiple visits since the start of the pandemic. Trump held his second June rally in Phoenix, despite rising cases. Just four days after that event, his messaging began to change. Vice President Pence postponed campaign visits to both Florida and Arizona \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to the Trump campaign. By late July \u2014 Trump pivoted again, like he did with Florida, and has continued to back Ducey. With a competitive Senate race underway on top of the presidential election, Arizona may end up being a tough state for Republicans to hold on to this fall. NPR electoral map rating: Toss-up Governor: Brian Kemp, Republican Loading... In late April, Georgia became the first state to begin reopening. Trump initially voiced his opposition to Kemp's decision with the caveat that Kemp should \"do what is right,\" for Georgians. By mid-May, the president was promoting the state's low case numbers. Trump continued to praise the reopening measures in Georgia throughout July despite COVID-19 cases rising since the end of June. On July 15, during a presidential visit to the state, Trump told a local Atlanta TV station that Georgia is \"getting close to having 100% open,\" adding that the state has \"really kept the virus to level down.\" In August, he began acknowledging an increase. Georgia has gone red for the last six presidential elections, but polling between Trump and Biden has remained close throughout the months of the pandemic, with the two candidates virtually tied since May. Similar to Arizona, Georgia is also home to a slew of competitive congressional races this fall. NPR electoral map rating: Leaning Republican Governor: Greg Abbott, Republican Loading... Like many Southern states, Texas saw a later rise in cases. The state is also traditionally Republican, but notably, since midsummer, Biden's polling in the Lone Star State has also gotten closer to Trump's. According to state polling averages, Biden is within single digits of the president in a state that hasn't swung blue in a presidential year since 1976. Trump promoted Texas at first. When cases started rising, he shifted, attributing the rise to specific groups within the state's population and touting the White House response. On June 15, he highlighted the rise in cases within prisons as a reason for increased case counts. On July 27, Trump spoke about \"focusing aggressively on the Texas border,\" citing high infection rates in Latin America. In early August, he linked decreasing cases in the state to lower numbers in counties on the Southwestern border with Mexico. NPR electoral map rating: Toss-up Governor: Roy Cooper, Democrat Loading... Trump made no secret of his disapproval of North Carolina's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and his more cautious reopening strategy. In a pre-pandemic world, Charlotte was set to host a full Republican convention. But Trump and the RNC sparred with state officials about measures needed to avoid spreading the virus. Throughout the back-and-forth over where to hold the convention \u2014 first in Charlotte and then Jacksonville \u2014 to the eventual acceptance of a scaled-down convention in Charlotte, the president's rhetoric has centered on empowering voters while blaming Cooper. While visiting North Carolina days after canceling the Jacksonville convention, Trump was asked whether Cooper had \"made the right choice\" in scaling down the convention, to which he replied, \"We could've done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing.\" Since mid-May, according to an average of state polls, Biden has held a slim lead over Trump, first surpassing him in mid-April. NPR electoral map rating: Leaning Democratic Governor: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat Loading... Trump's 2016 win in Michigan caused an upset for Democrats, and the state remains in play for both parties going into November. What's more, Biden has consistently led in the state polls for months. Throughout the pandemic, Trump attacked Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's lockdown measures and voiced support for protests against the rules in place. Whitmer was one of the first governors to bear the brunt of Trump's opposition during the pandemic. But since May, Michigan's coronavirus case numbers have decreased significantly and the state has entered Phase 4 of its reopening plan. At a \"tele-rally\" for Michigan in mid-July, the president seemed to acknowledge the need to work with Whitmer, while still maintaining his opposition. \"We disagree with many of the things she's doing, but we will continue to work with her,\" Trump said. \"We're also working quite honestly around her and we have to do that because what she wants to do is not going to be good for the state.\" NPR electoral map rating: Leaning Democratic Governor: Tom Wolf, Democrat Loading... Pennsylvania voted for Trump by less than one 1 percentage point, turning the state red for the first time in over two decades. Currently, the state is trending Democrat as Biden has led in an average of polls since March, hitting 50% or higher toward the end of the summer. Unlike other battleground and swing states in play this November, Biden has been able to visit Pennsylvania during the pandemic. Trump has directed criticism toward Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Tom Wolf. On a visit to the state in May, Trump spoke directly to the crowd saying, \"We have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit.\" The state has seen lower case numbers since April. Though Trump has made fewer mentions of Wolf in recent months, he took aim at the governor on a recent trip to Old Forge, Pa., close to where Biden was born. And Trump directed a similar message to Biden, alleging that Democrats are imposing lockdown measures for political gain. \"Everything that we've gained over the last number of months, [Biden] wants to lock it down,\" Trump said. \"These places have to be opened up. But Nov. 4, they'll open. Don't worry.\" he added.",

Updated at 11:20 a.m. ET The European Union on Wednesday said it does not recognize the results of Belarus' Aug. 9 presidential election, calling the poll fraudulent and promising to sanction individuals responsible for the violence that has followed. \"These elections were neither free nor fair and did not meet international standards,\" Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said at the end of an emergency summit on Belarus held by teleconference. \"The EU will impose shortly sanctions on a substantial number of individuals responsible for violence, repression and election fraud,\" he said. I'll update EU leaders on Wednesday's European Council on work to sanction those responsible for violence, repression & election results falsification #Belarus https://t.co/2Ztmfb50T9 \"The protests in Belarus are not about geopolitics,\" he said. \"This is in the first place a national crisis. This is about the right of the people to freely elect their leadership.\" \"We stand firmly behind the right of the Belarusian people to determine their own fate,\" he added. The vote in Belarus earlier this month, in which longtime President Alexander Lukashenko claimed an overwhelming victory amid accusations of massive election fraud, has sparked nationwide protests and a brutal crackdown by security forces. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians from across the country have taken part and the protests continue to grow with workers at giant state-owned factories walking off their jobs to join the demonstrations. \"The people of Belarus want change and they want it now,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a news conference following the meeting. \"We are impressed by the courage of the people of Belarus. For exactly 10 days since the presidential election took place, the people of Belarus have taken to the streets in unprecedented numbers,\" she said. Lukashenko's main opponent in the race, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was forced to flee the country after the results were announced. She initially conceded defeat from exile but has since since called for international mediation to resolve the political standoff. The EU is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Ukraine in 2014 when the ousting of a pro-Kremlin leader led to Russian military intervention. In recent days, Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered unspecified \"security assistance\" to Lukashenko's government, even as his security forces were denounced at home and abroad for violently quashing peaceful protests. Russia on Wednesday called the external pressure from EU countries \"unacceptable.\" \"We consider that Belarusians will iron out their own problems in the framework of dialogue, within the legal framework and without any foreign meddling,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. Speaking in Berlin after the meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country currently holds the rotating six-month EU presidency, echoed her fellow EU leaders' remarks, saying that there is \"no doubt\" of \"massive rule violations\" in the Belarus election. \"For us, it is clear that Belarus must find its own path, that must happen via dialog in the country and there must be no intervention from outside,\" Merkel said. Lukashenko also announced on Tuesday that Belarusian forces were being deployed on the western borders in response to criticism from Belarus' NATO-member neighbors there \u2014 Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Following Wednesday's EU meeting, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he was not concerned by troop movements. \"As part of normal, routine actions we are looking at what is happening behind our border and at the moment there are no reasons for concern,\" Morawiecki said at a news conference.",

The embattled Belarus government came under increasing pressure Tuesday as demonstrations sparked by a disputed presidential election showed signs of expanding, with more factory workers joining the protests and hundreds of people gathering outside a jail where the husband of the country's main opposition figure is being held. The protests began after the Aug. 9 polls in which President Alexander Lukashenko \u2014 who has kept a tight rein on the country for more than a quarter-century \u2014 claimed a sixth consecutive term amid widespread accusations of massive election fraud. Since then, the country's security forces have taken a heavy hand with protesters. The government has acknowledged that some 7,000 people have been arrested. Videos posted on social media have shown beatings and torture in jails, and some of about 2,000 who have since been released have  harrowing tales of detention. On Tuesday, Lukashenko signed an order awarding 300 medals to law enforcement \"for impeccable service\" during the crackdown. This week, thousands of factory workers began walking off the job to join the protests, heckling Lukashenko on Monday as he tried to address a crowd at a tractor manufacturing plant. By Tuesday, workers from even more state-controlled companies and factories were joining the protests, including Belaruskali, a factory that produces a fifth of the world's potash fertilizer. \"The authorities should understand that they are losing control,\" Yuri Zakharov, the head of the independent miners' union, told The Associated Press. \"Only Lukashenko's resignation and punishment of those in charge of rigging and beatings (of protesters) can calm us down.\" Zakharov said, \"[W]e will not back down. The strike will continue and grow until he steps down.\" Outside the Minsk prison where activist blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky has been held since being barred from standing against Lukashenko in the elections, supporters gathered to wish him well on his 42nd birthday. Ahead of the Aug. 9 race, Tikhanovsky's wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, stepped in to replace her husband. Shortly after the announcement of election results, in which the government said Lukashenko had won a resounding victory,  Tikhanovskaya was forced to flee the country. Initially, she appeared to concede defeat but has since called for international mediation to break the deadlock. Meanwhile, Russia, Belarus' closest and most important ally, has offered unspecified security assistance and has put its clout behind a diplomatic effort to take international pressure off Lukashenko. A Kremlin statement on Tuesday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in separate phone calls, informing them that putting pressure on the government in Minsk was unacceptable. Merkel said she told Putin that freedom of protest in Belarus must be guaranteed. In yet another potentially provocative move, Lukashenko on Tuesday announced that he had ordered troops deployed to unspecified locations along the country's western border. Citing statements made by foreign governments, Lukashenko said in a televised meeting that the units were on full alert. However, it wasn't immediately clear if the troop movements were new or part of planned military exercises that started Monday. On its western side, Belarus borders Poland, Lithuania and Latvia \u2013 all three NATO members who have expressed concern about the deteriorating situation next door. Last week, Poland called for a European Union summit on Belarus, and in an interview, Lithuania's finance minister said doing nothing about the \"lamentable\" situation in Belarus is \"not an option.\" Latvia's parliament approved a statement on Tuesday calling for new, internationally monitored elections in Belarus. NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow contributed to this report.",

Updated at 11:19 a.m. ET The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday night in its first completely virtual, made-for-TV incarnation. It was unlike any convention night seen in years past. The most glaring difference: the absence of delegates and an audience. That presented hurdles that the party tried to vault with a highly produced event that felt, at times, like a political infomercial mixed with a bit of \"We Are The World\" \u2014 and included one standout speech from former first lady Michelle Obama. Most of the segments were prerecorded with some live elements, including actress Eva Longoria emceeing. The two-hour event accomplished several things Democrats were looking to do, including laying out a more hopeful \u2014 and diverse \u2014 vision for America than will likely be seen next week at the Republican National Convention. It also hit President Trump on two of the major issues facing the country \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic and the reckoning over racial injustice. There was a lot to digest. Here are seven takeaways: 1. Michelle Obama delivered, as expected The former first lady delivered a sophisticated rebuke of President Trump that hit him thwack and branches. \"He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head,\" she said. \"He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.\" That last line, \"It is what it is,\" hearkens back to the president using those same words to describe the coronavirus death toll in the country. And Obama nailed the virtual format. She was seated, comfortable, emotive and soaring in her delivery. Obama acknowledged many voters are disaffected with politics. \"I get that,\" she said. She hit the seriousness of the moment. \"If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me \u2014 they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election,\" Obama said. And she made a direct appeal for people to get out and vote. \"We have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner and maybe breakfast, too,\" she said, \"because we've got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.\" 2. But she and the entire night could have benefited from a crowd Obama's speech was genuine and sober and serious. Sitting in a living room and saying, \"You know I hate politics,\" was powerful. But imagine what that speech would have been like with a crowd. Searing \u2014 and soaring. There were other moments that would have benefited from a crowd, as when Kristin Urquiza from Arizona \u2014 whose father, a Trump supporter, died of the coronavirus \u2014 delivered this line: \"His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and he paid with his life.\" There's nothing Democrats really could have done about the lack of a crowd because of the pandemic. Republicans are going to face a similar predicament next week, but in the words of the president: It is what it is. 3. Democrats started to build a case based on the character of Joe Biden One of the key tasks of a convention is to get voters excited about the candidate. Joe Biden is facing some deficiencies in that regard. So the Democrats are using this virtual platform to tell Biden's story, highlighting what they believe are his decency and empathy in contrast to Trump. Democrats started to do that Monday night in small and large ways. They described Biden as someone who is \"real\" and someone of \"character.\" Obama described Biden as \"a profoundly decent man, guided by faith\" and alluded to the tragedies he's faced in life with the death of his first wife and daughter in a car accident decades ago, and more recently the loss of his son Beau to cancer. \"Joe knows the anguish of sitting at a table with an empty chair,\" she said. As to the kind of president he would be, Obama noted: \"[H]e listens. He will tell the truth and trust science. He will make smart plans and manage a good team.\" All of that is important in filling in the picture of who Biden the person is, to help insulate him from attacks that will be coming from his opponents. 4. Democrats provided Republicans a bridge (or fork in the road) to vote for Biden One of the aspects of Monday night's convention that caused progressives some consternation was the inclusion of several Republicans, including, most notably, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who delivered his speech standing at a fork in a road, a visual metaphor if ever there was one. They aren't exactly the most prominent Republicans in the current version of the GOP, but putting their names behind Biden was, at the very least, a degree of taunting ahead of next week's GOP convention. It also could have provided some Republicans a bridge, or a directional sign at that literal fork in the road, to vote for Biden. \"Many of us have been deeply concerned about the current path we've been following for the past four years,\" Kasich said. \"Continuing to follow that path will have terrible consequences for America's soul because we're being taken down the wrong road by a president who has pitted one against the other.\" 5. But there was also something of a mixed message \u2014 is Biden a moderate, or as progressive as FDR? Kasich's appearance presented a conflicting message to viewers. He said he has confidence Biden won't \"turn sharp left and leave [Republicans and independents] behind.\" \"I don't believe that because I know the measure of the man: reasonable, faithful, respectful,\" Kasich said. \"And you know, no one pushes Joe around.\" But then Kasich was followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who noted in his speech that his own policies had been seen as radical before he ran for president but now are mainstream within the Democratic Party. On Sunday, Sanders touted that if Biden implemented recommendations of joint policy task forces between Biden's and his supporters, then \"Biden will become the most progressive president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\" So, which is it? Will Biden not be pushed around by the left, or will he be the most progressive president since FDR? 6. Sanders is all in, and nothing unifies like a common enemy All that said, Sanders made a strong and effective appeal to his voters to keep their eyes on the prize, that the most important thing this year is defeating Trump. Sanders extolled Biden's virtues and noted that he would lead the fight on Day 1. It's very clear that Sanders and other progressives see Trump as a clear and present danger. In 2016, many on the left couldn't imagine Trump would win, but now he's been president for 3 1/2 years, and what he's done and could do are very real threats to progressive causes. Four years ago some cast protest votes against Hillary Clinton thinking she wasn't progressive enough, but also thinking she'd likely win. Michelle Obama had a rejoinder for that. \"[T]his is not the time to withhold our votes in protest,\" she said, \"or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning.\" 7. Trump will do everything he can to steal Democrats' thunder this week Traditionally, the opposing candidate lays low during the convention of the other candidate and lets them have their week. But there's nothing traditional about this president, and Trump is already showing he's going to do everything he can to pull attention away from Democrats. On just the first day of the Democratic National Convention, Trump held three rallies in an effort to eclipse the star power of Michelle Obama et al. Tuesday the convention will feature Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former President Bill Clinton and Jill Biden, Joe Biden's wife. But Trump will be busy, too, signing a proclamation at the White House on the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. (On Tuesday morning, Trump announced a pardon of famed suffragist Susan B. Anthony.) Then he takes to the road to see border wall construction in Arizona.",

            "article_content": "President Trump hit the road Monday for campaign stops in Minnesota and Wisconsin \u2014 both states seen as crucial to his reelection. The visits coincide with the start of the Democratic convention.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: President Donald Trump has no plans to give up all the spotlight to Democrats as they begin their national convention tonight. Past presidents generally let their challengers have their moment, but Trump is kicking off a four-state trip to blunt any extra momentum the Democrats may get from the convention. Today he used the occasion to attack the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't say Biden because I don't think he knows what hell is happening. I think if you mention, you know, you shouldn't have done that to Minnesota, he'll say, where's Minnesota? I don't know anything. I don't know what Minnesota is. Where is that, please? FADEL: Here to talk about the president's remarks is NPR's White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Hey, Franco. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Hey, Leila. FADEL: So where is he going on this multistate trip, and what's the significance of this? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, today he started off in Minnesota, talking about law and order. And that's - and Minnesota is obviously where the death of George Floyd set off a wave of protests against racial injustice. He's also traveling to Wisconsin - which is technically the headquarters for the Democratic National Convention, though the convention is happening virtually - where he talked about jobs. And as you just noted, Trump is taking aim at Biden as well as Harris, and he's doing so repeatedly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Joe Biden is the puppet of left-wing extremists trying to erase our borders, eliminate our police, indoctrinate our children, vilify our heroes, take away our energy - you know all about that - take away our energy, if you can believe it - no fossil fuel - destroy our second amendment, attack the right to life and replace American freedom with left-wing fascism. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, and that's just a taste of what we've been hearing. Later this week he's going to Yuma, Ariz., to talk about immigration and the border. And he also plans a trip on Thursday to Scranton, Penn., which is Biden's hometown. FADEL: Now, how significant is this to basically campaign during the other party's convention? ORDO\u00d1EZ: It's very significant. As you noted, past presidents typically let their challengers, as they say, kind of have their own convention. I'll note that former President Obama also traveled a couple days in 2012 to Iowa, Colorado and Virginia during the national - Republican National Convention at the time. And he had to - himself had to defend breaking with tradition. But President Trump is really taking the counterprogramming to a different level. FADEL: But, Franco, how so? You note that Obama traveled to three states. ORDO\u00d1EZ: I mean, I think the big difference is that Obama didn't talk much about his challenger Mitt Romney or the Republicans, while Trump is making it very clear he's using this trip to target Joe Biden, and he's doing so very aggressively. Here's more of what he said today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: In Joe Biden's America, the protections of American citizenship will be stripped away, and your community will be left at the mercy of the mob. I mean, I'm saying these things, but I mean them. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Trump's - and Trump's main speech in Scranton, Biden's hometown, is also the same day that the former vice president formally accepts his party's nomination. FADEL: Now, there's no question that he's really getting personal. Do you think that's a sign he's concerned? Recent polls have largely not been in his favor. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, it's hard to say. What we have learned in the last almost four years of the administration is that Trump does have a tendency to lash out when things are not going his way. Recent polls show Biden leading Trump in many key states as well as nationally, and a lot of that has to do with how Americans feel about how President Trump's handling the pandemic. It's really hurt him. He was banking on running on a good economy, but the coronavirus wiped that away, those plans. People are out of work, and there are a lot of concerns when things will get back to normal. But things could certainly change. Polls could narrow if the pandemic ended or the economy rebounded, and momentum could shift back toward Trump. FADEL: White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez, thank you.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Monday she is delaying New Zealand's general elections by about a month as the nation moves to contain a new cluster of COVID-19 cases in its most populous city, Auckland. Ardern, who has the sole authority to set elections for the country, said she consulted the heads of the major political parties before setting the new date. Voting was originally scheduled for Sept. 19 but will now take place Oct. 17. \"Ultimately I want to ensure we have a well-run election that gives all voters the best chance to receive all the information they need about parties and candidates and delivers certainty for the future,\" Ardern said. She gave assurances that she had no plans to change the election date again. \"COVID is the world's new normal,\" she said, adding that moving the vote to mid-October \"provides sufficient time for parties to plan around the range of circumstances we could be campaigning under.\" She said the delay will give voters time to feel they can vote safely and that officials can deliver an \"accessible and credible election.\" The opposition National Party had pushed for a delay in the elections, arguing that restrictions on campaigning would give Ardern and her Labour Party an unfair advantage, the BBC reports. In one survey, 60% of Kiwis wanted the election delayed, the New Zealand Herald reports. National Party leader Judith Collins had called for postponing the elections until 2021. The Prime Minister has announced that the new election date is 17 October. That is her decision. Right now the focus must be on finding out exactly what failed so catastrophically at the border so we can be sure it won\u2019t happen again. In a tweet, Collins acknowledged Ardern's decision to shift the election date and called for answers on how the uptick in cases on the island occurred. \"Right now the focus must be on finding out exactly what failed so catastrophically at the border so we can be sure it won't happen again,\" she wrote. The island nation had gone an astonishing 102 days without a new reported COVID-19 case, before four members of a single family in South Auckland were confirmed by government officials last week to have tested positive. New Zealand recorded nine additional cases on Monday, bringing the total number of active cases to 78, according to New Zealand's Health Ministry. Of those, 58 are in the Auckland cluster. The rest are arrivals at the border who were immediately put into in quarantine or managed isolation away from the general population. COVID-19 Update: The Govt has announced Auckland will remain at Alert Level 3, and the rest of New Zealand will remain in Alert Level 2, until 11.59pm on Wednesday 26th August. Cabinet will continue to monitor the situation and will review this decision on Friday 21st August. pic.twitter.com/rwTJuSDuv6 The outbreak of new coronavirus cases prompted the government to implement safety measures late last week, with Auckland operating at an Alert Level 3, while the rest of the country is operating at the lower Alert Level 2. Both alerts are set to expire just before midnight on Aug. 26 and fall short of the top tier Level 4 emergency alert, which is lockdown. Overall, New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,700 coronavirus cases and 22 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Research Center, which tracks cases worldwide. By comparison, the United States has more than 5 million confirmed cases and more than 170,000 reported coronavirus-related deaths.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris at the U.S. Capitol after a vote in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris at the U.S. Capitol after a vote in March. Joe Biden picked California Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate. It's a historic pick. But there's a lot more to it than that. Here are five takeaways: 1. Biden picking Harris is a statement on what it means to be American. Biden picking Harris as his running mate is historic. No Black or South Asian American woman has ever been on a major-party ticket in U.S. history. Black voters, especially Black women, are pillars of the Democratic Party and were key to Biden's victory in the contest for the nomination. Because of his choice, it's possible Black voters will turn out at levels needed for Biden to win in key states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and elsewhere. But beyond his calculus of how his choice will affect the African American vote, Biden is trying to show his vision for the future of the country, one that respects diversity in a diversifying country. Make no mistake: Putting a qualified person of color like Harris \u2014 whose parents are Jamaican and Indian immigrants \u2014 on the ticket is a statement against President Trump. Remember, Biden said he was spurred to run for president because of Trump's response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., and lots of Americans are upset with Trump for stoking racial division. What's also notable is that Harris is seen as a \"safe\" pick. That's because she's a known quantity, has already been vetted during the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and is disciplined. But step back. Just the fact that Harris is seen as a safe pick \u2014 and not a \"Hail Mary\" \u2014 is progress in America's long reckoning with racism. 2. His choice shows Biden is willing to listen to those who disagree or have attacked him. Picking a running mate shows something about the decision-making of a potential president. Trump said he was surprised Biden picked Harris, in part, because she was \"disrespectful\" toward him during the primary. That's perhaps not surprising to hear from Trump because the president values fealty. But with this pick, Biden showed that people around him shouldn't be afraid to speak out, that it won't get someone thrown under the bus or \"canceled.\" That grace is almost a bookend to Barack Obama picking Biden as his VP. Many were surprised Obama selected Biden after he had referred to Obama as \"clean\" and \"articulate,\" which were widely seen as racist remarks. But Obama and Biden not only got over it, they became close confidantes. Biden has said he wants his VP to serve in a similar way to how he served with Obama \u2014 someone he can rely on for unvarnished advice whom he can trust and be the last person he talks to before making big decisions. Harris endorsed Joe Biden in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Harris endorsed Joe Biden in March. 3. Trump is struggling to find an effective attack on Harris. President Trump went after Harris on Tuesday as \"mean,\" \"nasty\" and \"disrespectful.\" \"I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, disrespectful of anyone in the U.S. Senate,\" Trump said from the White House on Tuesday, adding, \"I would have thought Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit.\" Trump also went after Harris for her questioning of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But calling her names may only serve to fire up women and the Democratic base. And Democrats see her questioning of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings as a strength, not a weakness. Trump also hit Harris with a laundry list of policy attacks, from health care and military funding to accusing her of wanting to raise taxes and being against fracking. But that's all pretty generic stuff against a Democrat. A video put out by the Trump campaign labels her \"phony.\" But the epithet was pretty cookie cutter and didn't really lay out a case for questioning Harris' authenticity. For example, she faced criticism during the Democratic primary for changing positions. She also lacked a clear campaign message, but that won't matter much now \u2014 Biden's message will be her message and she can deliver an argument. Progressives were also vexed by Harris' record as a prosecutor in California, but Trump didn't seem prepared to drive that wedge, either. And it'll be tough to do so, as the historic nature of a Harris pick will likely overshadow qualms progressives have with her on policy. 4. Harris will likely hold up well in a debate with Pence. The first rule of being a vice presidential pick is \"do no harm.\" And the most high-profile thing the running mates do during an election is the VP debate. The person at the top of the ticket can't afford their running mate to mess it up. \"I think it's a very important factor,\" Biden told MSNBC in March. Harris showed herself to be an able debater in the primary, and Democrats will likely rest easy about \u2014 and maybe even look forward to \u2014 the Oct. 7 debate in Utah with Vice President Pence. Pence apparently is also looking forward to it. \"As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left,\" Pence said at an event in Arizona on Tuesday. \"So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Sen. Harris. ... So my message to the Democratic nominee for vice president: Congratulations. I'll see you in Salt Lake City!\" 5. The process for picking Harris was another sign of a (surprisingly) well-run campaign so far. That the VP pick did not leak is a feat unto itself for a presidential campaign. Nearly every vice presidential pick in past years has leaked. In fact, it's become something of a journalistic competition and sought-after notch on a belt to see who can break the story. And no one did. What makes it surprising in some respects is that Biden's campaign struggled with organization and fundraising during the primary, but since the race transitioned to the general election Biden's team has been in control and on par with the Trump fundraising juggernaut.",

Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the main opposition candidate in Sunday's presidential election in Belarus, is refusing to accept the landslide victory declared by the five-term incumbent, Alexander Lukashenko. The release of an official exit poll that predicted a Lukashenko win prompted a long night of violent demonstrations. Fifty protesters and 39 law enforcement officers were injured in the Sunday night violence, and more than 3,000 were arrested, according to the Belarusian Interior Ministry. On Monday, Tikhanovskaya appeared before journalists in the capital, Minsk, pledging not to leave the country but also declining to assume the role of protest leader when asked about her plans. \"The authorities aren't listening to us; they are completely detached from the people,\" she said. \"We are for peaceful change, and the authorities should think about how to transfer power peacefully.\" According to preliminary results announced by Belarus' Central Election Commission, Lukashenko took 80% of the vote, with Tikhanovskaya coming in second with 10%. But Tikhanovskaya disputed those figures. She said that her campaign staff had seen results from more than 50 polling stations and that her share of the vote exceeded Lukashenko's by many times. The euphoria of Tikhanovskaya's campaign, when thousands of voters enthusiastically received her as she barnstormed across the country, has vanished. Tikhanovskaya told journalists she didn't know how to react to the government's harsh response to the protests \u2014 but that she had decided her presence at demonstrations could lead to an escalation of violence. Tikhanovskaya, a political novice, campaigned on the simple pledge to hold new, free and fair elections if she won. She decided to run against Lukashenko after her husband was jailed and prevented from registering his candidacy. Tikhanovskaya joined forces with two other challengers \u2014 Viktor Babariko, who is in pretrial detention on fraud charges, and Valery Tsepkalo, who fled Belarus over safety concerns. After the demonstrations, the Interior Ministry denied reports of one death Sunday night as \"a complete fake.\" Meanwhile, investigators said they were opening criminal cases into the organization of and participation in civil unrest, an offense that carries a prison sentence of eight to 15 years. The U.S. government said it is concerned about the conduct of the election, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \"was not free and fair.\" \"We urge the Belarusian government to respect the rights of all Belarusians to participate in peaceful assembly, refrain from use of force, and release those wrongfully detained,\" Pompeo said in statement. \"We strongly condemn ongoing violence against protesters and the detention of opposition supporters.\" The European Union \u2014 three members of which border Belarus \u2014 condemned the \"disproportionate and unacceptable state violence against peaceful protesters\" and appealed for a fair vote count by the Belarusian Central Election Commission. Poland called for a special EU summit to discuss the violence. Lukashenko is used to criticism from the West. The last U.S. ambassador to Minsk left in 2008 amid a crackdown on the Belarusian opposition. Recently Lukashenko has reached out to the United States to counter pressure from the Kremlin for closer political and economic integration. Pompeo visited him in February, and a new U.S. ambassador is expected in Minsk later this year. Lukashenko was defiant after the violence, calling the protesters \"sheep\" who were controlled by foreign puppet-masters. He said he saw no need to hold talks with Tikhanovskaya. Protesters carry a wounded man during clashes with police early Monday in Minsk after the presidential election.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters carry a wounded man during clashes with police early Monday in Minsk after the presidential election. \"Our response will be appropriate,\" he said during a visit to a new animal feed plant outside Minsk. \"We won't let the country be torn apart.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader to congratulate Lukashenko on his reelection, followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has shared new details of his plan for overturning President Trump's agenda, including a commitment to stop building the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.  STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST: Build that wall was presidential candidate Donald Trump's rallying cry in 2016. Now his 2020 opponent is saying, no new wall. That's presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. He has not made himself available for many interviews with reporters, but he did sit down with a team representing the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists. And NPR's very own Lulu Garcia-Navarro was among them. Hi, Lulu. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: Hi there. VANEK SMITH: Thanks for joining us. So you got to talk with the former vice president about a bunch of issues. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I did indeed. And he laid out what I thought was his clearest vision yet for completely overturning President Trump's agenda. Let's start with the border wall. As you know, progress on the wall has been sort of stymied by quite a few legal challenges. And President Trump has had to reroute federal funds to pay for its construction. I asked Biden if he would tear down the new parts of the wall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: No, I'm - there will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration, number one. Number two, what I'm going to focus on and the - and you're - the fact is that somebody in this group written a lot about the border. I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry - that's where all the bad stuff is happening. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What about the land confiscations? What about the land confiscations? BIDEN: Ended. End. End. End. Stop. Done. Over - not going to do it. Withdraw the lawsuits. We're out. We are not going to confiscate the land. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And this is the first time he said that. The issue of land confiscations is a big one. When former President Obama came into office with Joe Biden, they allowed a border wall planned under the Bush administration to continue. He's saying here, all work will stop if he becomes president. VANEK SMITH: And then, from what I understand, Biden spoke about China. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He did. I asked him about if he would rescind the China tariffs that Trump has put in place. And he said yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Manufacturing's gone on recession. Agriculture lost billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay. We're going after China in the wrong way. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And then I asked him... So if he scrapped those tariffs, what do you want in return? - or you're just going to scrap them without any concessions. BIDEN: No. No. Here's the deal. The question is, what is the appropriate behavior that they have to engage in international trade with us? And they have to play by the international rules. And what we have done is we have disarmed ourselves. We make up 25% of the world's economy, but we poked our finger in the eye of all of our allies out there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what Biden suggests is gathering the international community together to place pressure on China to do what is right, not using tariffs as a stick. VANEK SMITH: I also hear that there was a pretty feisty exchange about cognitive testing. Cognitive testing, of course, is something that President Trump has said went very well for him recently. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. He was asked if he has taken a test for cognitive decline, and he said no. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Come on, man. That's like saying you - before you got in this program, did you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not? What do you think? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Biden added that he's very willing to let the American public judge his physical and mental fitness and that he's looking forward to the debates. There was a lot more from our interview, which will be out tomorrow morning, where Biden discusses immigration and asylum, racial justice and whether Trump could face prosecution once he is out of office. And we should say that President Trump was also invited for an interview, and he never committed. VANEK SMITH: OK. Well, we are really looking forward to this interview. That was NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Thanks, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden says if elected, he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S. Southern border built during the Trump administration \u2014 but he would cease construction. \"There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1,\" he told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro during an interview with journalists from the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists. \"I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry \u2014 that's where all the bad stuff is happening,\" the former vice president said during the virtual interview on Tuesday. In our #nabjnahj2020  interview, @JoeBiden promised that 'not another foot of wall would be constructed\"  on the border. Watch our exchange: pic.twitter.com/rM9OgsYicU Biden committed to fully ending land confiscations, a more aggressive stance than President Barack Obama took when he came into office after President George W. Bush had approved border fencing to be built in the Southwest. \"End. Stop. Done. Over. Not going to do it. Withdraw the lawsuits. We're out. We're not going to confiscate the land,\" Biden told Garcia-Navarro. Obama oversaw the construction of a fence along the Southern border following Bush's signing of the Secure Fence Act in 2006. As the Austin American-Statesman reported, the Department of Homeland Security built 654 miles of fence at a cost of $2.4 billion. Significant amounts of private land were seized by the federal government for to clear space for the barrier. Ending China tariffs On China, Biden said he would reverse President Trump's tariffs and pushed back at the suggestion that some believe the Trump administration's aggressive stance toward China has been effective. \"Manufacturing's gone in recession. Agriculture lost billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay. We're going after China in the wrong way,\" he said. In our #nabjnahj2020  interview, @JoeBiden tells me that Trump's China tarriffs have been disastrous for business and farming. Watch our exchange here: pic.twitter.com/QuDQ1aOmPO \"China is stealing intellectual property. China's conditioning, being able to do business in China, based on whether or not you have 51% Chinese ownership, that's got to end.\" When pressed on whether China would have to meet any conditions for reversing tariffs, Biden deflected and said he would take a multilateral approach to get China to change its behavior. \"The question is, what is the appropriate behavior that they have to engage in international trade with us? They have to play by the international rules, and what we have done is, we have disarmed ourselves,\" he said. \"We make up 25% of the world's economy, but we poked our finger in the eye of all of our allies out there. The way China will respond is when we gather the rest of the world that in fact engages in open trade and making sure that we're in a position that we deal with WHO the right way ... That's when China's behavior is going to change.\" On taking a cognitive test Biden bristled when asked by CBS' Errol Barnett, a Black journalist, whether he had taken a cognitive test. \"No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test?\" Biden said. \"Come on, Man. That's like saying you, before you got on this program, did you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not? What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?\" In recent weeks,  Trump has bragged about his own such test, which is meant to identify cognitive decline, not measure a person's intelligence. He has tried to make Biden's mental state an issue for voters. Biden turns 78 a few weeks after the election. Trump is 74. Either would be the oldest president inaugurated. Biden didn't comment on Trump's tactic beyond saying he looks forward to debating. \"Well, if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don't know what the hell he's talking about... I know you're trying to goad me, but I mean, I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president and the debates.\"",

            "article_content": "Service cuts at the U.S. Postal Service have some election officials concerned that the dramatic pandemic-induced expansion of vote by mail could face delays as ballots are being returned.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The post office is cutting overtime hours for workers as part of a new business plan to ensure financial stability. That means your mail delivery could be delayed from time to time, and that also is raising concerns, with the presidential election approaching and millions of Americans planning to cast their ballots by mail. Sally Herships has more. SALLY HERSHIPS, BYLINE: Barb Byrum is clerk for Ingham County in Michigan. She's the chief election official. So the idea of mail being delayed does not sit well with her. BARB BYRUM: So this is extraordinarily concerning because Michigan law requires that the ballot be in the possession of the local clerk by the time polls close on Election Day. HERSHIPS: Byrum is worried because she says her county has already been experiencing delays due to the pandemic. She knows because she issues death certificates, and funeral homes aren't getting them. BYRUM: It was taking well over three weeks for them to get death certificates that were mailed from, literally, 15 miles away. HERSHIPS: And just ask her if it takes longer for rural areas, like the part of the county she lives in, to get its mail. BYRUM: Oh, my soul, it does. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So I live out in the rural portion of my county, and it has historically always taken a day or two or maybe three more days for me to get mail. Yeah. Yeah. HERSHIPS: So Byrum is worried that voters, especially in rural areas, will not be able to mail their ballots back on time. The National Vote at Home Institute says, to save money, many rural communities opt for a cheaper but slower nonprofit postage rate. If they switch to first class to try to get mail out faster, it could double their costs. And to make things even more complicated, every state has its own rules and regulations around voting by mail, and those rules are not delay-friendly. TAMMY PATRICK: Traditionally, all mail picked up on any given day is postmarked that day. Even if it takes until after midnight, it still receives the same day's postmark. HERSHIPS: Tammy Patrick is a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund, a nonprofit foundation. PATRICK: So for states that a ballot has to be postmarked by Election Day or by whatever the deadline, it's quite possible under this new regime that a ballot wouldn't get its postmark until the next day, and that could in fact disenfranchise a voter. HERSHIPS: Then Patrick says that, in a number of states, voters can request ballots just days before an election. The problem is if the mail is slow, you may not be able to mail back your vote in time. And she says billions of pieces of political mail go through the mail stream, and ballots are just a small part of that. PATRICK: Those candidates and campaigns and political action committees and political parties are investing billions of dollars into the mail stream, and they want to make sure that their mail is moving as well. HERSHIPS: And so do the many local governments that are required by state law to send out election materials in a timely manner. UNIDENTIFIED MAIL CARRIER: I'm scared that it's not going to happen. HERSHIPS: This is a mail carrier in Pennsylvania. We're not using her name because she's worried about losing her job if she speaks out. She points to the new head of the Postal Service, a close ally of President Trump's. Trump makes frequent false claims that mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud. This mail carrier and others worry that these cost-cutting measures could also be an attempt to disrupt the election. UNIDENTIFIED MAIL CARRIER: And I'm scared that that's almost voter suppression when it's being done on purpose. HERSHIPS: She says the Postal Service reaches every American, regardless of their political standpoint. UNIDENTIFIED MAIL CARRIER: I mean, for goodness sake, I think the Grand Canyon, we reach people via donkey. HERSHIPS: It's a mule, actually, a nonpartisan mail carrier. As for the post office, it says it's doing all it can to provide prompt and reliable service. And Tammy Patrick of the Democracy Fund says there's an easy fix - if you're voting by mail, vote early.

The federal police response to the ongoing protests against racial inequality has been criticized by city and state elected officials.\n                \n                    \n                    Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Federal police stand guard on Salmon Street after pushing protesters away from the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse on Tuesday in Portland, Ore. The federal police response to the ongoing protests against racial inequality has been criticized by city and state elected officials. When Border Patrol agents were dispatched earlier this month to Portland, Oregon, it wasn't the first time they've taken on urban policing far from their duties on the nation's frontiers. The agents deployed to Los Angeles, for instance, after the Rodney King verdict in 1992. Alongside local police and National Guard, the green-suited border agents were there to quell riots but drew a lot of criticism for also conducting immigration sweeps of people in the country illegally. Nearly three decades later \u2013 as debate rages over federal agents in Portland \u2013 questions remain about whether the Border Patrol gets appropriate training to handle civil unrest. The Trump administration is refusing to recall federal agents from the city, where racial justice protests have been ongoing for more than 50 days. Much of the controversy has stemmed from agents using unmarked vehicles to grab protesters off the streets. Critics say they didn't have probable cause and didn't properly identify themselves. Last night, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called the federal deployment an \"unconstitutional occupation,\" and was later tear gassed while in the crowd. Images of federal officers in camouflage uniforms making arrests on the streets of Portland, have alarmed critics across the country who think President Trump is using federal officers to trample civil liberties and paint himself as the law-and-order candidate heading into the November election. Among the skeptics is Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President Barack Obama. \"They're clearly the wrong group to be doing this,\" Kerlikowske said of the Border Patrol in Portland. \"I mean, this is not something they're trained to do. My guess is they would probably also clearly tell you it's not something they want to do.\" Kerlikowske asserts the Border Patrol unit known as BORTAC, which was dispatched to Portland, is chiefly trained to pursue fugitives and criminals. \"This is clearly an urban environment and civil unrest. It is not in their wheelhouse,\" he said. \"I mean, they track people. \"We've used them in upstate New York to track fugitive escapees. We've used them to track people who shot state troopers in Pennsylvania.\" But federal officials say their agents are acting within the law \u2014 and have been doing these kinds of operations for decades. Victor Manjarrez Jr. was a young Border Patrol agent in the 1990s and eventually became a sector chief. He said the Border Patrol sent 600 of the 1,000 federal officers deployed to Los Angeles during the Rodney King unrest, and that the border agents were not trained back then like they are today. \"The big difference now is you have folks that have specialized training in riot control,\" said Manjarrez, now the associate director for the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security, which includes CBP, insist BORTAC is not being used as Trump's secret police. The officials said the agents are trained to put down prison riots, and have broad authority to assist federal law enforcement anywhere in the U.S. In Portland, they were protecting federal buildings because the protesters had grown so violent, said Acting CBP commissioner Mark Morgan. \"These agents and officers are among the most highly trained agents and officers that we have within CBP, and that includes training in riot control,\" Morgan said. The agents' names are not on their uniforms, officials say, because protesters have identified some of them and posted the information on social media. The agents use unmarked vehicles so they won't be torched or vandalized, Morgan said, and they wear flak vests emblazoned with \"POLICE\" as well as smaller, light-colored CBP patches. \"I've seen news reporting after news reporting, tweet after tweet, saying 'unidentified, masked storm troopers,' \" Morgan said at a press conference this week. \"It is offensive to refer to these dedicated men and women that are out there as law enforcement professionals, to make that reference.\" There are other precedents for deploying Border Patrol into the interior of the country. In 1962, they were deputized as U.S. Marshals to protect James Meredith, the first Black student entering the University of Mississippi. And in 1987, they retook control of a federal prison in Louisiana that had been overrun by Cuban inmates. Today, some Democratic mayors and members of Congress have called these teams of agents \"unwanted, occupying forces\" whose presence escalates street violence, and they've asked the White House to remove them. But more are on the way. Trump Administration officials say DHS investigators are among federal squads rushing to Chicago, Albuquerque and Kansas City. They'll be there to help combat rising crime \u2013 not to take back the streets from protestors.",

President Trump has a message for suburban voters. And it's not a subtle one. \"They want to destroy our suburbs,\" Trump recently warned in a call with supporters. \"People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell,\" he said from the South Lawn of the White House. Trump has been issuing increasingly dire and outlandish warnings about what Democrats will do to the suburbs. He warns suburbanites will face rising crime and falling home values if they elect Joe Biden. The message: Be afraid, be very afraid. The newest ad from Trump's campaign is a very dramatic dramatization of an older white woman calling 911 when she sees an intruder. But no one is there to answer her call for help. As she is attacked, the words \"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America\" flash on the screen. This is all based on the false claim that Biden wants to defund the police. Biden has specifically said he doesn't want to defund the police. His campaign says these are \"smears\" that aren't working. From July 1 to July 20, Trump's campaign spent more than $18 million on television ads hitting this theme, according to the tracking firm Ad Analytics. It's a similar argument to one Trump made ahead of the 2018 midterms, that caravans of migrants would cross the border bringing gangs and crime. Democrats won control of the House in a wave election, led by a suburban backlash to Trump. \"People are not afraid of what he's trying to make them afraid of,\" said Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who has been critical of Trump. In 2016, voters in the suburbs made up 50% of the electorate. Trump won those voters narrowly that year. Now polls show him trailing Biden badly in the suburbs. Trump hadn't explicitly addressed suburban voters until about a month ago, when, in a speech to young supporters gathered at a Phoenix megachurch, Trump, referring to racial justice protests in Seattle, said it was bedlam. \"That's exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America, if the radical-left Democrats are put in charge,\" Trump claimed. From there, the appeals to suburban voters and his ideas about what issues matter to them have only gotten more direct. Trump has pushed for schools to reopen, threatening to pull funding if they don't, without explaining how it can be done safely while coronavirus cases spike. And he has targeted an Obama-era fair housing regulation, promising to sign an executive order halting it. The 2015 regulation deals with racial segregation of housing and requires local municipalities to address historic patterns of it. But Trump warned last week that it would \"destroy\" the suburbs. \"Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise,\" he said. \"People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I'm here.\" That kind of racial view, pitting whites in the suburbs against Blacks and Latinos who might move in, is an appeal that seems to stem from an anachronistic view of the suburbs. \"He thinks it's basically the planned development of Levittown in the 1960s as opposed to today's suburbs, which are multiracial, diverse and highly educated,\" Matthews said. Many suburban voters do think liberal activists have overstepped, said Ryan Costello, a former Republican congressman from the Pennsylvania suburbs. But, he added, they don't ascribe that to Biden, and they don't think he is going to defund their local police departments. Costello said that right now, people in the suburbs are worried about schools opening safely, with the emphasis on safely. They're worried about the coronavirus and the economy. \"This is really a referendum on how President Trump is handling the pandemic,\" Costello said. \"That's the kind of stuff that suburban voters that don't have a deep partisan allegiance are going to look at. And that's where they're going to render their value judgments.\" And so far, Americans largely disapprove of the job Trump is doing handling the coronavirus. On average, 58% now say they disapprove of it. Costello announced his retirement from the House of Representatives in 2018 rather than face near-certain defeat in a wave led by suburban backlash to Trump. He questions the logic of the president's current political strategy. \"If you're going to attack an opponent, there has to be something that is relatable in that attack on an opponent,\" Costello said. \"I live in the suburbs, and I don't know how he would eliminate the suburbs. It doesn't make much sense to me.\" The Trump campaign is downplaying this erosion of a key group that helped with his win in 2016. \"President Trump brought new voters into the Republican Party in 2016 and has realigned the political electorate, creating a broad coalition of support across all demographics that will carry him to victory in November,\" Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager said in an email when asked about Biden's apparent lead in the suburbs. In 2016, Trump brought in a surge of rural white voters, who don't live in the suburbs but may respond to his messages about urban crime and the dangers of the left. \"What does suburban really mean?\" Ernest McGowen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Richmond, asked rhetorically. \"What does it mean as a thing? Is it a geography, or is it an identity? McGowen, who has studied African Americans in the suburbs and lives in the suburbs himself, says that suburban identity is about accomplishment, but not excess. In the suburbs, you know your kids will go to good schools with extracurricular activities. You'll need a lawnmower. And McGowen points out, that doesn't mean you are all that close to the city anymore. The suburbs have expanded into what used to be rural areas. \"What we're calling a suburb now is going to be part of the metro in a few years,\" McGowen said. \"And what we're calling exurbs is going to actually be the suburbs as we would know them.\" The suburbs are again shaping up to be where 2020 could be won or lost.",

            "article_content": "More than 1,000 current and former staffers of Doctors Without Borders have signed a letter calling on the vaunted aid group to root out pervasive institutional racism within the organization.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: Worldwide mobilization against racism has reached a Nobel Peace Prize-winning aid organization, Doctors Without Borders. That organization has provided critical care to people in some of the world's most desperate and dangerous conflict zones for decades. But over the past month, more than 1,000 current and former staffers have signed a letter charging the organization with racism and white supremacy. Tomorrow, the group's international board plans to vote on a raft of measures to begin dismantling what even top officials there agree is a pattern of institutional racism. NPR's Nurith Aizenman reports. NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: One of the staffers who signed the letter alleging racism within Doctors Without Borders is Margaret Ngunang. She's a Cameroonian immigrant who had a long career in the U.S. as a social worker before she joined the aid group in 2017. MARGARET NGUNANG: I thought it was a great organization, given the work that they were doing in countries that have experienced war and famine. AIZENMAN: The possibility that she'd face racial discrimination from them... NGUNANG: It did not cross my mind at all. AIZENMAN: But Ngunang says the microaggressions began literally the moment she reached her first posting, a hospital run by the aid group in South Sudan. Suitcases still in hand, Ngunang and another new arrival, also an American of African descent, walked into the office of a top official. NGUNANG: A white female, you know, talking to two people. And when we said hello to this woman, she ignored us. You know, she turned, looked at us and continued talking. AIZENMAN: Over the following weeks, again and again Ngunang would notice white staffers treating white colleagues one way - warmly, respectfully - while for people like her with Black skin and an African accent, when they weren't being ignored... NGUNANG: You have everything that you do being put under the microscope. Everything that you do is questioned. AIZENMAN: But Ngunang says the situation was far worse for local South Sudanese staff. For them, a job with Doctors Without Borders was too precious to risk complaining, even when white staffers would talk down to them and berate them. NGUNANG: You know, it was just very traumatizing to see that, to hear that because coming from Cameroon, it brought back the colonial mentality. AIZENMAN: Christos Christou is president of the international board of Doctors Without Borders. He questions how widespread incidents of outright racism are across the organization's many missions. But he says there is no question the organization is built on a problematic model - essentially the idea of the white savior. CHRISTOS CHRISTOU: The white doctor going and providing assistance to the people there in Africa and especially to little African kids. AIZENMAN: And so Christou is calling for a total rethink. CHRISTOU: The whole way of distributing the decision-making power, also the resources. AIZENMAN: But how much of this talk will translate into progress on the ground? Africa Stewart is the president of Doctors Without Borders' U.S. board. She points to her own election back in 2017 as a sign of the appetite for change. Consider, she notes, who raised her. AFRICA STEWART: A surgical scrub tech - my mom - who could not go to nursing school and her bastard daughter and - with a Black Panther dad named Africa. I mean, this is - was I not born for this? AIZENMAN: But she also notes that earlier measures that she and others have pushed, like a plan adopted by the international board to increase the pay parity between international staff and local staff - it's taken years to actually implement. STEWART: It feels like it's - we're part of the solution. But it also feels like, well, damn it. How long does it take to wear down a mountain? AIZENMAN: Nurith Aizenman, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Jeff Sessions made his last political stand in Alabama's Republican Senate runoff Tuesday, losing to former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville, a political newcomer endorsed by President Trump.  NOEL KING, HOST: Jeff Sessions is out of the Alabama Senate race. Former football coach Tommy Tuberville beat him in a runoff race. That means Tuberville will challenge Democrat Doug Jones in the fall, and it may be the Republican Party's best chance to take a Senate seat. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the race. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: Sessions used to be pretty popular in Alabama, but it looks like this will be not just a loss, but a pretty substantial one. What happened? ELLIOTT: Right. More than double digits, reflecting what the polls had indicated was going to happen throughout much of the campaign. You know, Tommy Tuberville was really able to capitalize on President Trump's endorsement, making his allegiance to Trump his No. 1 selling point. He promised that, unlike Jeff Sessions, he won't let the president down when the going gets tough. You know, Sessions struggled to overcome being ousted as attorney general after he recused himself from special prosecutor Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, something that Trump went to great lengths to berate Sessions for time and time again. He even made this robocall the night before the election in support of Tuberville. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's going to have a call - direct line into my office. That I can tell you 'cause, you know, we had the Jeff Sessions thing. We gave it a shot. I had no idea it could be as bad as it was. But he had no clue. KING: No love lost between Trump and Sessions. That's apparent. Sessions, though, did hold that Senate seat for 20 years before he joined the Trump administration. What's he saying this morning - or last night? ELLIOTT: Right. He was certainly a fixture in Alabama politics. He was a former attorney general of the state, had been a U.S. attorney in Mobile. He made a somber speech from the Hampton Inn in Mobile last night. He's 73 years old now and said he ends his political career with no regrets and his integrity intact. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF SESSIONS: I was honored to serve the people of Alabama in the Senate, and I was extraordinarily proud by the accomplish that - accomplishments we had as attorney general. On recusal, I followed the law. I did the right thing, and I saved the president's bacon in the process. ELLIOTT: Saving his bacon, meaning he maintains that he - if he had done anything to somehow squash the investigation, things would have turned out much worse. But he didn't take that tone against the president until pretty late in the campaign, and I think that hurt him. He largely ran a campaign, up until the very end, based on his alignment with Trump's agenda, making the case that he was all about tougher immigration laws and some of the same issues that Trump pushes long before Trump even got into politics. KING: Tommy Tuberville - the winner - he does not have a long history in politics. What do we know about him? ELLIOTT: Right. He is new to this game, but he generally gets the celebrity treatment anywhere he goes in Alabama. He is the former football coach at Auburn University. Early in his coaching career, he earned this nickname, the riverboat gambler, for risky play-calling. But he took very few risks in this runoff campaign, especially after the vote got pushed from March until yesterday because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tuberville had refused to debate. He largely avoided the media. His ads would hit these familiar themes that resonate with conservative Republican voters here in Alabama - religious freedom, border security, law and order, gun rights. And he came back to those issues in his victory speech last night from Montgomery, as he turned his attention to his next opponent, the Democratic incumbent Doug Jones. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOMMY TUBERVILLE: In Doug Jones' Alabama, the Second Amendment is a dream. It's just a thought. It's not in the Constitution to them. By God, they're not taking our guns. (CHEERING) ELLIOTT: So just a little foreshadowing of what's to come in this Alabama Senate race. It's going to pull a lot of attention and probably a lot of money from both national parties. KING: NPR's Debbie Elliott. Thanks, Debbie. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

He faces Tommy Tuberville in Tuesday's Republican Senate runoff.\n                \n                    \n                    Vasha Hunt/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jeff Sessions talks with the media after voting in Alabama's primary election in Mobile, Ala., on March 3. He faces Tommy Tuberville in Tuesday's Republican Senate runoff. Veterans gathered recently beside the USS Alabama battleship on Mobile Bay in a show of support for former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"Let's hear it for the man of the hour, the once and future senator from Alabama, the honorable veteran Jeff Sessions,\" retired Brig. Gen. Richard Allen said in introducing Sessions. But the crowd was sparse. And only one television camera showed up, even though the appearance was in his hometown of Mobile, Ala. Sessions is fighting for his political life in a Republican runoff for his old Alabama Senate seat. The 73-year-old faces a political newcomer, the former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, who has a double-digit advantage, according to recent polling. The winner in Tuesday's runoff will advance to the general election to take on Sen. Doug Jones, the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate and the GOP's best shot to win a seat held by a Democrat. While Sessions is touting local endorsements, his opponent has one from the most popular politician in this deeply red state: President Trump. Sessions says it's not up to Washington to dictate the race. \"The president can endorse who he wishes,\" he said. \"But the people of Alabama will decide this race.\" Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville has President Trump's support in the Alabama Senate runoff.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville has President Trump's support in the Alabama Senate runoff. Sessions finds himself in a completely different position than he was in 2016, when throngs cheered for him in Mobile as he appeared with then-candidate Donald Trump. Sessions was one of the first Deep South politicians to endorse him. \"We have a man here who really helped me,\" Trump said at the time. \"He's the one person I sought his counsel because he's so spot-on.\" Sessions served 20 years in the Senate and was the leading voice against illegal immigration, long before Trump called for a border wall. Sessions argues that he remains the candidate most aligned with the president's agenda. But he's most associated now with his troubled tenure in the Trump administration, and his decision to recuse himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Sessions was ousted as attorney general in 2018 after being repeatedly mocked by Trump, who has called Sessions a \"disaster.\" \"I know that he has his strong feelings about this race,\" Sessions said. \"I know he's upset about the long, prolonged investigation that really disrupted his life and, in many ways, made it hard for him to govern effectively.\" Sessions says he was bound to follow the law. \"I did my duty as I saw it,\" he said. \"And I believe in the long run, it worked out.\" On Saturday, Trump once again took to Twitter in support of Tuberville. \"[H]e is a winner who will never let you down,\" Trump wrote. \"Jeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington!\" Sessions responded more forcefully than he has in the past: \"My honor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults.\" I\u2019ve taken the road less travelled.  Not sought fame or fortune. My honor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults.  Your scandal ridden candidate is too cowardly to debate. As you know, Alabama does not take orders from Washington. https://t.co/1I6ROih43E Tuberville's campaign has sought to exploit the notion that Sessions is now damaged goods. \"You can't fake it. You're either strong or you're not. Jeff Sessions, he's not,\" the former Auburn coach says in an ad set in a gym with weightlifters behind him. \"He wasn't man enough to stand with President Trump when things got tough.\" The ad also shows a clip of Tuberville walking down the steps of Air Force One with Trump on a June trip to Dallas. Tuberville earned the nickname \"the Riverboat Gambler\" for taking risks on the football field during his coaching career, but with a polling lead, he has taken few risks in this runoff, which was moved to July from March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tuberville has refused to debate and is generally avoiding media in the run-up to Tuesday's vote. With no political record, he has faced scrutiny for his role in a hedge fund that defrauded investors, and Sessions has criticized him for living in Florida before coming back to Alabama to run for Senate. But out on the campaign trail, Tuberville gets the celebrity coach treatment in a state where college football is the holy grail. \"What's up, Coach Tub?\" fans ask in a Facebook video from Tuberville's visit to a boat parade honoring Trump in Orange Beach over the Fourth of July weekend. \"I need your vote to send a U.S. senator to Washington, D.C., to represent this state, this country and Donald Trump,\" Tuberville tells people packed on boats flying Trump 2020 campaign flags. On June 11, Tuberville (second from left) joined Trump and others on a trip to Dallas.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On June 11, Tuberville (second from left) joined Trump and others on a trip to Dallas. Back at Battleship Park in Mobile, Reginald Hartz, a veteran who served in the Iraq and Gulf wars, said he's torn about which Republican to vote for. He's a Trump supporter but says the president's demeaning tweets about Sessions aren't a factor for him. \"Just nitpicking, to me that's childish,\" he said. Hartz thinks the race comes down to whether Alabama needs a political outsider or someone who knows the halls of power. \"I'm an Auburn fan but yet you got a career politician versus a guy that's never set foot and knows very little about politics,\" Hartz said. Whichever candidate wins the GOP runoff will have the advantage heading into November against the Democrat Jones, in a state where Trump has his highest net approval rating in the country.",

When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned down an invitation to the White House this week, it sent a message in line with the current mood in Canada: This is not a good time to travel between Canada and the United States \u2014 with the coronavirus still surging in parts of America \u2014 to meet with President Trump. The White House had floated the possibility of an event with Trudeau and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Wednesday to mark this month's start of a new trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mexico's leader is already on his way. On Monday, Trudeau's spokesperson, Chantal Gagnon, said in a statement that the prime minister would remain in Ottawa this week \"for scheduled Cabinet meetings and the long-planned sitting of Parliament.\" Trudeau said last week that Canada was discussing with the United States whether a summit \"makes sense.\" His administration was troubled by the threat of new U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, he said, adding that \"we're also concerned about the health situation and the coronavirus reality that is still hitting all three of our countries.\" Canada has reported more than 107,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and more than 8,700 related deaths as of Tuesday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. However, new daily numbers have fallen to levels seen in March, while new cases in the United States are surging above the country's April peak. On Tuesday, Canada counted 399 new cases, compared with nearly 50,000 in the U.S., according to Our World in Data, a research project at the University of Oxford. The U.S. and Canada have partially closed their shared border since March to prevent the spread of the virus. The rules do allow for diplomatic trips and other travel deemed essential. A large majority of Canadians, across a wide cross section of society, think the travel restrictions should stay in effect \"for the foreseeable future,\" according to Nik Nanos of Nanos Research, a public opinion firm. Its new poll shows 81% of Canadians want to maintain the partial border closure. \"Canadians looking south see chaos,\" said Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University, including confusion around the state-by-state reopening and rising case numbers. \"They're just nervous.\" That Trudeau's not looking to travel to the United States \"shouldn't be a surprise,\" Nanos said. \"The prime minister has put a very high premium on leading by example, everything from wearing a face mask at press conferences through to social distancing,\" he said. Trudeau is looking \"to avoid engaging in any activities which would be inconsistent with what he's asking average Canadians to do.\" For example, most travelers arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and police have conducted spot checks to ensure compliance. The border restrictions, extended until at least July 21, have also separated some families. On Monday, members of Congress from northern U.S. border states called for easing travel for people with relatives or property on the opposite side of the border. Trudeau also has nothing to gain from a White House visit now, said Nelson Wiseman, political science professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. \"Trudeau loses in Canadian public opinion to be seen chumming around with a very unpopular Trump,\" he said. If Trump loses November's election, Wiseman predicted, \"I don't expect they will ever meet again.\"",

Updated at 9 p.m. ET Fresh off a rally in Tulsa, Okla., in which nearly two-thirds of the arena was empty, President Trump on Tuesday addressed a crowd of student supporters at a tightly packed megachurch in Phoenix, amid the state's growing number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The Arizona rally was part of a series of smaller events in the state centered on his reelection pitch, focusing heavily on border security, preserving monuments of Confederate soldiers and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which the president has controversially described using the racist phrase \"kung flu.\" \"The radical left \u2014 they hate our history, they hate our values, and they hate everything we prize as Americans. Because our country didn't grow great with them. It grew great with you and your thought processes and your ideology,\" Trump told the group of young supporters, a majority of whom did not appear to be wearing masks. The state on Tuesday reported 3,591 new cases of COVID-19. More than 1,380 Arizonans have died of the disease thus far. As Trump was delivering his remarks, protesters outside were declared unlawful, and police reportedly fired tear gas and deployed flash bangs to force their dispersal, according to KJZZ's Jimmy Jenkins. Phoenix PD have declared the protests outside the Trump event an unlawful assembly and are using flashbangs to disperse the crowd pic.twitter.com/r2d2RaKXYR \"Our people are stronger. And our people are smarter. And we are the elite. We are the elite,\" Trump said during the event. Earlier in the day, the president participated in a roundtable discussion in Yuma with border and law enforcement officials to commemorate the upgrading of 200 miles of wall along the southern border. Trump called the barrier \"just about unclimbable\" and trumpeted what he called lower border crossings and drug seizures. Trump was joined by Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy DHS secretary; and Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.

Trump also spoke about the tearing down of statues in recent weeks and his desire to enforce a 2003 law that gives fines or jail time to those who attempt to destroy federal property such as monuments. After surveying the wall, Trump delivered remarks at a Students for Trump rally at Dream City Church in Phoenix, hosted by Turning Point Action, a pro-Trump group. The church, which can hold about 3,000 people, released a statement saying it only found out that Trump would be speaking at the event after it agreed to rent its facilities. \"Dream City's facility rental does not constitute endorsement of the opinions of its renters,\" the statement said. Coronavirus concerns Arizona has seen a spike in cases of the coronavirus recently, and Phoenix has joined several cities across the state in requiring residents to wear masks in public spaces. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego had said she was concerned about the president's trip. \"We are actually seeing the fastest rate of growth among our young people in the community, and here it is, a rally specifically focused on that demographic,\" she told CNN. \"Public health professionals in Phoenix are trying to tell young people to take this seriously.\" Students for Trump included a waiver similar to the one the Trump campaign gave to attendees of the Tulsa rally, acknowledging the health risks. \"By attending this convention, you and any guest voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Turning Point Action, their affiliates, Dream City Church, employees, agents, contractors, or volunteers liable for any illness or injury,\" it read. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden called the president's trip \"reckless and irresponsible\" and said it is a \"distraction from Donald Trump's failed response to combat the spread of COVID-19.\" A changing state Tuesday marked Trump's third trip this year to this once-red, now purple state. He hosted a rally in Phoenix in February and visited a mask-making facility in May. Trump won Arizona by 3.5 percentage points in 2016, a far cry from Mitt Romney's 10-point victory over President Barack Obama in 2012. Democrats regard Arizona as a critical 2020 battleground state and are closely watching its Senate race between Republican incumbent Martha McSally and Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. Kelly has been leading in the polls, but the race is still considered a toss-up. Gov. Doug Ducey appointed McSally to her seat following her loss during the Senate campaign to then-Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. Nearly a third of the electorate in Arizona doesn't belong to either major political party, but Democrats are hopeful that a growing Latino population will translate to a shift in November.",

Texas is one of the states seeing a big uptick in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. About 120,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus. While the national number of daily deaths has declined in recent weeks, new confirmed cases are on the rise in almost half the country, including spikes in Florida, Texas and Arizona, where the president is headed Tuesday. \"We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up,\" President Trump said definitively Saturday night during his campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla. Trump's referring to an earlier estimate that found there could be up to 2.2 million deaths if the country did nothing to contain the outbreak. But he spent months downplaying the virus when health experts were imploring more action sooner. And those experts are now warning it's not time to act as if the pandemic is over. \"[T]hat's why I think you're seeing right now increases in a number of states, because everybody's back to a pre-pandemic mindset,\" Michael Osterholm, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and author of Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. He warned that the coronavirus is like a \"forest fire\" that is showing no signs of slowing down. Early on, the pandemic was largely affecting \"blue,\" or Democratic-leaning areas, especially New York, but now most new cases are in the South and redder parts of the country. The Trump administration and some Republican governors have been blaming increased testing for the rise in cases, but in many places cases are increasing more than testing \u2014 and that certainly doesn't explain away rising hospitalizations in places like Texas. The campaign of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is making competence a core part of its argument against Trump, and it hit him again for it because of other remarks he made Saturday night. \"When you do testing to that extent, you are gonna find more people, you're gonna find more cases,\" Trump said. \"So I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down, please.' They test and they test. We have tests that people don't know what's going on.\" The White House says he was being \"tongue in cheek,\" but Trump has repeatedly said testing makes the United States look bad by, in his view, increasing the number of reported cases. A Democratic group has already cut an ad centering on his remarks. It will be key to watch political reaction on the right if cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in these parts of the country, as things like wearing masks \u2014 something the president initially encouraged Americans to do \u2014 have become politicized. So far, though, Trump's power of persuasion with his base continues to outweigh the coronavirus's shift toward Red America. 1. Possible progressive surge in elections: Five states hold primaries Tuesday \u2014 Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Mississippi. State Rep.

Charles Booker, pictured, faces Amy McGrath in  Kentucky's Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate. In Kentucky, the race between the two Democrats vying for the right to take on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is coming down to the wire. State Rep. Charles Booker has all the momentum and progressive backing over Amy McGrath, a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot who has all the money and the party endorsement but also lost a congressional race in the 2018 Democratic wave. Either faces an uphill battle in a general election against McConnell in Kentucky, but a new video from Booker encapsulates a lot of the messages Democrats are trying to push nationally about working class economics, protests and Black Lives Matter. In New York, pay attention to progressives going after establishment Democrats, especially in the race between longtime Rep. Eliot Engel and Jamaal Bowman, a former Bronx principal who has won the endorsements of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Missteps from Engel, who last faced a competitive primary 20 years ago, opened the door for Bowman, who has raised $2 million and is surging. 2. Battleground Arizona, Wisconsin: Speaking of elections, Trump heads to Yuma, Ariz., on Tuesday to survey part of the border fence with Mexico before heading to Phoenix. Vice President Pence, meanwhile, will be in Wisconsin. It's no coincidence that they're heading to those places amid the president's slipping poll numbers. Wisconsin and Arizona could very well be tipping-point states this November. 3. Hearing on DOJ independence Wednesday: Like something out of an episode of Showtime's Billions, Attorney General William Barr announced the resignation of Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan last week. Problem: Berman, who has been investigating people close to Trump, said he didn't resign. Barr later said in a statement that Berman had \"chosen public spectacle over public service\" and asked Trump to intervene and fire him. Trump did, but added, \"[T]hat's really up to him [Barr]. I'm not involved.\" And now Congress is involved to investigate it all. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., is promising to try and secure Berman's testimony. \"The whole thing smacks of corruption and incompetence, which is what we have come to expect from this President and his Attorney General,\" Nadler said in a statement. Nadler was already slated to hold a meeting Wednesday with two whistleblowers on political interference at the Department of Justice. 4. Votes on police reform on Capitol Hill expected: The Senate will debate, and possibly vote on, police reform. There's a key procedural vote scheduled for Wednesday. On Thursday, the House is expected to pass the Democratic police reform bill mostly along party lines. You wonder how many people are tuning in to politics for the first time and watching the meat grinder of Congress work and what their impressions are \u2014 do they turn away, thinking politics is futile and not a great way to effect change, or does it make them more likely to vote? 5. Trump's immigration executive order: Following his administration's loss over the DACA program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, at the Supreme Court last week, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order suspending temporary work visas through the end of the year, NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez reports. The suspensions are expected to include visas that affect skilled workers like in the tech industry (H-1B), executives at large corporations (L-1), seasonal workers like hotel and construction workers (H-2B) and research scholars and professors (J-1). \"I said, 'General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, general.' \" \u2014 Trump during his Tulsa rally on Saturday, delivering a defense of his walking down a ramp at West Point. The president noted that he had leather-soled shoes on and didn't want to fall like former President Gerald Ford coming out of the airplane. Trump went on a long tangent to discuss and, at times, reenact, his gingerly walking down the ramp and questions raised about his using a second hand to drink water. He said he didn't want to get any on his tie. Philip Bump at The Washington Post found Trump spent one out of every eight minutes of his Tulsa speech talking about West Point, or 14 minutes and 53 seconds of a speech that lasted one hour and 43 minutes.",

Denver Riggleman, R-Va., who's seen here speaking on the House floor on Dec. 18, 2019, lost a GOP convention Saturday that was done via drive-through because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was defeated by Bob Good, a former official in the athletics department at Liberty University. Republican Rep. Denver Riggleman, who received blowback from some members of his party after officiating the same-sex wedding last year of former campaign volunteers, has lost the GOP nomination for his central Virginia seat. Riggleman, a first-term congressman who had received President Trump's \"Total Endorsement,\" lost to challenger Bob Good, a born-again evangelical Christian and former Liberty University official. Good had called Riggleman \"out of step with the base of the party\" on marriage, immigration and other issues. Good won 58% of the primary vote, according to data provided by the 5th District Republican Committee. The vote took place at a nominating convention at a Lynchburg church on Saturday, where roughly 2,500 party activists cast ballots in a drive-through format, because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Virginia allows political parties to choose between a party-run nominating convention or a primary. Two members of the district committee that decided on the nomination contest format had received payments from Good's campaign, NPR has reported. Riggleman had called the party convention process corrupt. Around midnight Saturday, Riggleman said on Twitter that voter fraud \"has been a hallmark of this nomination process\" and that he's evaluating his options. Voting irregularities and ballot stuffing has been reported in multiple counties in the #VA05. Voter fraud has been a hallmark of this nomination process and I will not stand for it. @VA_GOP needs to reevaluate their priorities. We are evaluating all our options at this time. Riggleman voted in line with Trump about 95% of the time since he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, according to a FiveThirtyEight tally. He's also consistently voted against efforts to expand LGBTQ rights, despite officiating his two former campaign volunteers' same-sex wedding in July 2019. Good, who worked as an associate athletic director at Liberty University, a private evangelical college, has said he's on a mission to return Judeo-Christian values to Washington. He campaigned on issues including making English the official language of the U.S. and ending birthright citizenship. The 5th district in Virginia encompasses 21 counties, including regions such as Charlottesville, and stretches west of Washington, D.C., to the North Carolina border. Riggleman won the seat in 2018 with 53% of the vote, and Good's nomination may make the seat a bigger Democratic target in November. The Cook Political Report changed the race from Likely Republican to Leans Republican, following Good's win. Democrats will hold their own primary for the 5th district seat on June 23.",

Updated at 10:24 p.m. ET North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said Tuesday that it's \"very unlikely\" the state can permit a packed Republican National Convention in Charlotte to go forward this summer. \"The people of North Carolina do not know what the status of COVID-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,\" Cooper wrote Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. President Trump shot back Tuesday evening on Twitter, saying Cooper is \"still in Shelter-In-Place Mode,\" and \"we are now forced to seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention.\" ...millions of dollars, and jobs, for the State. Because of @NC_Governor, we are now forced to seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention. An RNC official said Tuesday that it still hopes to conduct the official business of the convention in Charlotte but that President Trump may make his acceptance speech in a different city. After Trump threatened to move the convention last week, top GOP officials gave Cooper a deadline of Wednesday to specify the conditions under which the convention in the 19,000-seat Spectrum Arena could proceed. The uncertainty over the convention's fate comes less than three months before the gathering in a state that Trump won in 2016 and is crucial to his reelection effort. \"We are happy to continue talking with you about what a scaled-down convention would look like and still await your proposed plan for that,\" continued Cooper, whose state is continuing to see an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations. In a statement Tuesday, McDaniel said Cooper was \"dragging his feet\" and said RNC officials would begin visiting other cities and states that have offered to host the convention. Among the places that have been floated as potential replacements are Atlanta; Jacksonsville, Fla.; Orlando, Fla.; and Nashville, Tenn. The back-and-forth between the GOP and Cooper's administration is the latest turn in its two-year rocky relationship with the convention. 'We would rather be incinerated than seem small-time' The fast-growing city \u2014 one of the nation's leading financial centers \u2014 bid on the convention because it wanted to be on the world stage. The city's longing to be recognized goes back decades, said Bob Morgan, a former leader of the city's Chamber of Commerce. \"We've long been ambitious like that,\" he said. \"Someone once famously described us in the 1950s as saying that when the Russians launch missiles against the United States that if Charlotte's not on the list, we would be very disappointed. Because we would rather be incinerated than seem small-time.\" That ambition \u2014 and insecurity \u2014 led to Charlotte hosting the Democratic National Convention in 2012 and to bid on Trump's renomination convention for this August. But the mostly-Democratic city was embarrassed when it realized that no other municipality submitted a formal bid. \"I don't know where the quote comes from, but I know somebody said, 'There's a fool in every room and if you look around and can't find them, then maybe it's you,' \" former City Council member Justin Harlow said in 2018, when the City Council voted 6-5 in favor of hosting. \"It's important to ask why no other local government in America is bidding on this convention.\" At the time, the debate over the convention focused on whether the city wanted to share the spotlight with the president's controversial policies, such as the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexican border. Now the city's relationship with the GOP is further strained by the coronavirus pandemic and the sometimes-violent protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Charlotte has had three nights of demonstrations that have resulted in at least 75 arrests and property damage to stores and offices. For much of April and May, top Republicans, including McDaniel, said they were willing to hold a convention in line with Cooper's health mandates. \"Obviously we're going to put the safety of the attendees and the president and the vice president first and foremost,\" McDaniel said in May. \"And if that means people wear masks, we're going to have people wear masks.\" But Trump has expressed a desire for something different: a packed house with no face coverings or social distancing. McDaniel shifted her position quickly, sending letters last week to the state's top health official two letters saying the GOP wanted a more-or-less normal convention, even though the state's current limit on indoor gatherings is 10 people. The RNC has proposed that convention attendees pass a pre-convention health screening and have their temperature checked before entering the arena. It also proposed having hand sanitizer available and cleaning areas where people gather. Mandy Cohen, the state's top health official, indicated on Monday that the state will not green light a normal convention. \"What we know about the spread of this virus is if you are indoors, close together, without 6 feet apart and without face covering, then the virus spreads,\" she said. While the Republican National Committee has threatened to move the convention, a spokesperson for the committee, Rick Gorka, said last week that Charlotte will still be the host site \u2013 either with 19,000 people inside the arena or 100. Republican Charlotte City Council member Ed Driggs, who supports bringing the convention here, said the two sides are far apart. \"I saw that letter from the RNC and I thought there is still a big gap,\" Driggs said. \"It really is a tough situation. You talk about a rock and a hard place. I don't see any satisfactory way out.\" The city has already started buying police equipment to prepare for the RNC. The Justice Department is contractually obligated to reimburse the city from a $50 million security grant, but, as a businessman, Trump has a history of unpaid bills, while the Trump campaign has refused to pay police security costs in some cities where it has held rallies. Driggs said the city would go to court if it's not paid back. Economic pain The uncertainty around the convention comes as the city's tourism and hospitality industries are suffering. Last month's revenue at the downtown DoubleTree hotel was $125,000, compared with $800,000 a year ago, said general manager Bill DeLoache. He wants the RNC to come but is worried the two sides are too far apart. \"It was very disheartening, and I finally quit listening to the news because neither side really seemed to want to make it want to work,\" he said. Democratic city council member Malcolm Graham says most emails and phone calls he receives from constituents are against hosting. \"People are now voicing concerns not only about the public health, but they're voicing concerns about the public safety \u2014 some of the inflammatory comments from the president over the past couple of days, rioting in the streets Charlotte,\" Graham said.",

The federal government is planning to put 69 miles of its massive border wall along the river in Texas' Webb and Zapata counties. When it became clear that the imposing barrier would plow through the center of the proud city of Laredo, a remarkably diverse coalition of wall-haters assembled to fight it. Folks in black \"No Border Wall\" T-shirts marched in the streets earlier this year. They share their movement with sedate bankers in starched, white shirts and gray suits who are just as passionate. \"Here we have a beautiful river, a historic river that is an amenity for our city,\" said Dennis Nixon, chairman of the International Bank of Commerce, headquartered in Laredo. \"It's disheartening. Would you want a wall on the Potomac or a wall on the East River in New York City?\" Other members of the growing anti-wall coalition are outraged property owners. Tony Medina is a 72-year-old retired land surveyor with a small tract upriver from Laredo that the feds want. He goes out there to enjoy nature, amid the ticks and rattlesnakes, and he lets fishermen launch their flatboats to haul in the big Rio Grande catfish. With only three acres, he thinks his property would be effectively covered up by the wall and its 150-foot-wide enforcement zone \u2014 as wide as a four-lane highway. \"I don't think we have a national emergency here on the Mexican border. People aren't flooding across the border, I haven't seen it in my lifetime,\" Medina said, his voice rising with anger. \"I think Donald Trump is just trying to appease and energize his racist base with this promise of a border wall.\" Landowner Tony Medina says a 30-foot-tall wall and its 150-foot enforcement zone would wipe out his property, which is popular with catfish anglers.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Landowner Tony Medina says a 30-foot-tall wall and its 150-foot enforcement zone would wipe out his property, which is popular with catfish anglers. Downriver, outside the historic town of San Ygnacio, Elsa Hull, a state water quality monitor, lives on a remote plot with her two daughters. The government wants her three acres, too, for the wall, which will have stadium lights installed every 150 feet. \"One of the things we like to do out here, I have a telescope and we like to observe the night sky, meteor showers,\" she said. \"And the bright lights will wash out our night sky, no more Milky Way. There's so many reasons that this wall is just a horrible idea.\" Medina and Hull are among some 250 private landowners along the river in Webb and Zapata counties whose land the government is condemning through its powers of eminent domain. They will ultimately be offered a monetary sum, which they can appeal. Customs and Border Protection says more than half of the property owners who've been contacted have voluntarily signed Rights of Entry papers to allow surveyors onto their land, and a quarter of them have refused. Elsa Hull lives on three remote acres downriver from Laredo and she fears a wall and its bright security lights will ruin her dark skies.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Elsa Hull lives on three remote acres downriver from Laredo and she fears a wall and its bright security lights will ruin her dark skies. The largest landowner to refuse the government is the City of Laredo. The Justice Department has sued the city to get access to 983 acres of city-owned riverfront. In its response, the city maintains the wall is illegal because when Congress appropriated the funding it did not specify that the structure would be built in Webb County. That issue is pending before a local federal judge. Many Laredoans are offended that the steel and concrete barrier would cut across a golf course, a riverside park and an orphanage. And it would symbolically sever Laredo from its sister city, Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, with whom it maintains deep cultural and familial ties. \"It's an insult to us and to our neighbors to the south,\" said City Councilman Mercurio Martinez III, who traces his lineage back to ranchers who settled on a Spanish land grant. \"Laredo has always been unique. We were once the capital of the Republic of the Rio Grande. We split off when Texas became its own country and they couldn't defend us,\" he said, noting that this month was Laredo's 265th birthday.

Plan B is that if the wall is coming anyway \"make lemonade out of lemons,\" he said. There are discussions ongoing with CBP to build a concrete riverwalk, or bulkhead, instead of an ugly levee wall topped with steel bollards. The structure would stop illegal crossers, supposedly hold back seasonal floods, and function as a promenade. \"It would be more easy on the eyes. It would be aesthetically pleasing. In this world, you gotta make choices sometimes, especially when you're pinned down and they got you beat,\" the mayor said with a chuckle. \"We're doing the best we can with the situation we confront ourselves with.\" The agency confirmed to NPR that it is open to constructing a mile-long bulkhead, but the other 68 miles of steel fencing would continue as planned. An Alabama construction company has been selected to build the first 14 miles at a cost of $20 million a mile. \"The Laredo Sector is an area of high illegal activity, with over 21,000 illegal alien apprehensions and over 19,000 pounds of drugs seized this fiscal year to date,\" according to CBP. The agency asserts the wall system \"will improve Laredo Sector's ability to impede and deny\" illegal border crossings and drug and human smuggling.

This is what baffles locals. CBP's own figures show that apprehensions in the Laredo Sector have been among the lowest on the southwest border, consistently, for more than two decades. Moreover, the Drug Enforcement Administration says the vast majority of illegal narcotics are smuggled in vehicles crossing international bridges, not by backpackers trekking through the bush. \"We live across from Nuevo Laredo which is one of the most dangerous cities in northern Mexico,\" said Carlos Flores, a local lawyer who's part of the anti-wall movement. \"And Laredo is one of the safest cities in America and we don't have a border wall. So where is the problem?\" CBP says construction won't begin until early 2021. With that in mind, opponents are still working on Plan A \u2014 hold off the bulldozers until after the presidential election. The area's democratic representative, Henry Cuellar, is urging his constituents to stonewall the feds. \"Do not give 'em entry. Delay the process,\" he said from his Washington DC office. \"And hopefully by November we'll have a new person at the White House.\" The new president and his new CBP commissioner would, presumably, halt wall construction, Cuellar said. Among the handful of Laredoans who support Trump but oppose his wall, there is a Plan C. In this scenario, if Trump wins perhaps he could be convinced that he no longer has to pander to his base and he would abandon his \"big, beautiful\" border wall. \"I want him to change his mind,\" said Dennis Nixon, the bank chairman. He contributed $7,700 to the president's 2016 campaign and a pro-Trump PAC, and he's hoping for a second Trump term. \"When you spend some time really looking at the issue and maybe take it out of the political arena when he's not running for reelection again, time changes things. People do learn. People do evolve,\" he said. The anti-wall coalition is looking for anything to keep Laredo connected to its storied river.",

            "article_content": "An unusual coalition is forming in the Texas city to oppose President Trump's border wall. The city is standing up to the Justice Department, which is trying to seize hundreds of acres of land there.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: President Trump's border wall is coming to Laredo, Texas. The federal government plans to build 69 miles of the massive barrier through the city's historic downtown but not if opponents in Laredo have anything to do with it. NPR's John Burnett reports that an unusual coalition of activists, landowners, city officials and business leaders are banding together to try and stop it. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: When it became clear that Trump's imposing border barrier would plow through the center of this proud city, Laredo assembled what may be the most diverse coalition of wall haters anywhere on the U.S.-Mexico divide. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Our waters (ph). BURNETT: That's a noisy contingent of folks in black No Border Wall T-shirts who took to the streets. They share the movement with sedate bankers in starched white shirts and gray suits who are just as passionate. DENNIS NIXON: Here, we have a beautiful river, a historic river that is an amenity for our city and our area. It's disheartening. And so it's just, why would you want a wall on the Potomac? Or why would you want a wall on the East River in New York City? BURNETT: That's Dennis Nixon. I talked to him in his plush offices at the International Bank of Commerce, where he's chairman. Also joining the anti-wall coalition are outraged property owners like Elsa Hull. She lives on a remote three-acre plot downriver where there are plans for the wall and stadium lights every 150 feet. ELSA HULL: And one of the things we like to do out here - I have a telescope - we like to observe the night sky, meteor showers. And the bright lights will wash out our night sky, no more Milky Way, you know? There's so many reasons that this wall is just a horrible idea. BURNETT: And leading the charge against the border wall is the Laredo City Council. The federal government has sued Laredo to get access to nearly a thousand acres of city-owned riverfront. The city has refused to allow surveyors on its property, contending that Congress did not specify the wall to be built in Laredo. That issue is pending before a local federal judge. Mayor Pete Saenz embodies the close ties between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in his double life as a mariachi singer. PETE SAENZ: (Singing in Spanish). BURNETT: Laredo was founded 265 years ago as a Spanish colony, and it retains deep cultural and familial relationships with its sister city opposite the Rio Grande. SAENZ: Our policy, again, has been that basically we're against any physical structure. But as a last resort, I mean, there's always a plan A and a plan B. BURNETT: Mayor Saenz says plan A is to block construction of the 30-foot rampart. Plan B is if the wall is coming any way, don't let it deface downtown. There are discussions ongoing with Customs and Border Protection to build, instead of an ugly levee wall with steel barriers on top, a concrete riverwalk or bulkhead. The structure would stop illegal crossers, hold back seasonal floods and function as a sort of promenade. SAENZ: It would be more easy on the eyes. It would be aesthetically pleasing, as I said. In this world, I mean, you got to make choices sometimes, especially when you're pinned down and they've got you beat. So, you know, we're doing the best we can with the situation that we confront ourselves with. BURNETT: The agency confirmed to NPR that it is open to constructing a mile-long bulkhead, but the other 68 miles of steel fencing would continue as planned. An Alabama construction company has been selected to build the first 14 miles at a cost of $20 million a mile. CBP says the Laredo sector is an area of high illegal activity and that the wall is needed to protect people from drug and human smuggling. This is what baffles locals. CBP's own figures show that apprehensions in the Laredo sector have been among the lowest on the southwest border consistently for more than two decades. Moreover, DEA agents say the vast majority of illegal narcotics are smuggled in vehicles across international bridges, not by backpackers through the bush.

CARLOS FLORES: Laredo is across of Nuevo Laredo, which is one of the most dangerous cities in northern Mexico, and Laredo is one of the safest cities in America, and we don't have a border wall. So where is the problem? BURNETT: CBP says construction will not begin here until early 2021.

Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar is urging his constituents to stonewall the feds. HENRY CUELLAR: Do not give them entry. Delay the process, and hopefully November, we'll have a new White House, a new president at the White House. BURNETT: And the new president would presumably halt wall construction. But wait, there's a plan C in case Trump wins. In this scenario, maybe he could be convinced that he no longer has to pander to his base and he could pull the plug on the wall. This is what Dennis Nixon hopes for. He's the bank chairman who's a big Trump supporter. NIXON: I want him to change his mind. I want him to spend some time to look at the issue and maybe we'll take it out of the political arena at that time when he's not running for reelection again. And time changes things. People do learn and people do evolve. BURNETT: Anything to keep the city of Laredo connected to its storied river. John Burnett, NPR News, Laredo, Texas.

Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who as President Obama's chief of staff during the Great Recession famously said \"never allow a good crisis go to waste,\" points out that after the Civil War came land grant colleges and the national railway system; after the Great Depression came rural electrification and Social Security; and at the height of the Cold War President Eisenhower proposed a national highway system \u2014 all big federal investments that changed the fabric of life across the country. The current pandemic and expected recession could result in a new, expanded role for the federal government again. Big policy changes could also rearrange traditional political divisions, now that Republicans in the Senate have voted unanimously for policies they've opposed in the past, like paid sick leave, a guaranteed minimum income, student debt relief protections for renters and support for gig economy workers. Of course, this massive package of federal help for ordinary people is only temporary, but Democrats are hoping that not all of it is. \"Suddenly, in a crisis like this, people realize across the political spectrum that unless we can provide a floor, the whole economy can crash,\" said Slaughter, noting the potential for permanent changes to the political debate. \"That paid sick leave is not about coddling workers. It's about making sure that sick workers don't come to work and infect others. People are equally realizing, if workers have no money to spend, the economy can't function.\" Democrats have advocated many of these policies for decades. But now that Congress has approved the largest federal intervention in the economy since the creation of Medicare, they see a new opportunity to push for big investments in modern digital infrastructure like 5G, a better public health system, universal health insurance that doesn't disappear when you lose your job, and a stronger social safety net. Former Clinton White House aide Bill Galston summed up the Democrats' argument this way: \"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a brutal x-ray of the weaknesses of our social safety net in dealing with national emergencies. We shouldn't be caught flat-footed by the next emergency any more than we should be caught flat-footed with a nearly empty national health emergency reserve, which was never restocked when it should have been.\" But Democrats aren't the only ones who see a political opportunity in the pandemic. The nationalist, populist wing of the Republican Party that's been warning about the dangers of globalization also appears to have gotten a boost. \"One of the core arguments of the Trump 2016 campaign is that in our supply chains and our manufacturing economy, we'd become too dependent on a globalized world, especially China,\" said conservative J.D. Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy. \"It turns out that if you want to have an economy that can weather a crisis, you actually have to be able to make some core things yourself, whether it's wireless technology, whether it's pharmaceutical products, whether it's ventilators and hospital masks.\" And that's exactly the argument that you're hearing from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, President Trump's pandemic equipment czar. \"If there's any vindication of the president's 'Buy American, secure borders and a strong manufacturing base' philosophy, strategy and belief, it is this crisis,\" Navarro said during a White House press briefing earlier this month. On trade, the pandemic gives a clear advantage to the anti-globalists in the GOP led by Trump, but on domestic policies and the role of the federal government, while Democrats know what they want, Republicans aren't so sure, according to Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics & Public Policy Center in Washington. \"I think the debate within the Republican Party over what it stands for has been heating up, and the pandemic is going to kick it into overdrive,\" Olsen said. \"You've got the people who are holding onto the neo-libertarian version of the past. But you've seen more and more calls for reform, which is moving more in the direction of engaging the Democrats on their core issue, which is, how do we help people rather than saying the government can't help people?\" He added, \"I think you'll see that debate ramp up once we return to more normal politics after the lockdowns are over. Then, I think the battle in the Republican Party is going to be fierce.\" There are already lots of splits. Freshman Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for instance, wants to beef up the social safety net, advocating a European-style unemployment backstop, where the federal government would pay companies 80% of wages to prevent layoffs during the crisis. Other Republicans, however, support nothing more than the current temporary emergency measures. And in addition to Tea Party-style protests against the stay-at-home orders, there's also conservative pushback to the exponential increases in federal spending \u2014 even the temporary ones. Republicans shouldn't expect to get any guidance from the president on resolving these internal disputes, according to Olsen. \"If Donald Trump does what he usually does, he will gyrate between positions that each side can support,\" he said. \"And if the party does what it usually does, in the short term it will be locked in stasis, trying to figure out which iceberg Trump is going to land on and try to be there.\" But in the meantime, until Republicans agree on what they stand for, it may be hard for the president and his party to continue to argue that popular programs, like Obamacare, should be eliminated lock, stock and barrel. \"I think the appetite for small-government, everyone-is-on-their-own approach to the welfare state, frankly, was always pretty small and it's gonna be even smaller, I think, over the next couple of years,\" said Vance, particularly given the massive numbers of people applying for unemployment benefits, which hit 22 million last week, canceling out nearly all of the job gains since the Great Recession. How this debate resolves itself depends on how long the pandemic recession lasts and how popular the government rescue programs turn out to be. As Olsen points out, \"If the giant government rescue plan works, it will legitimize government intervention in the economy in a way we haven't seen in decades.\" Until then, the pandemic has given both parties an opportunity to appeal to the vast number of Americans who will need help from the federal government for some time to come.",

Mike Parson announces the state's first death from the coronavirus during a news conference in Jefferson City, Mo., last month. When it comes to the spread of America's coronavirus outbreak across the 50 states, Missouri's infection rate and death rate fall roughly in the middle of the pack. The state's stay-at-home order is currently set to expire on April 24 \u2014 at least a month earlier than many other states \u2014 though some cities in Missouri have issued longer stay-at-home orders. In an interview Wednesday with All Things Considered, Gov. Mike Parson (R-Mo.) said he will decide when and how to reopen the state based on available data, such as the rate of infection and the availability of ICU beds and ventilators. \"It will be based on facts that we're receiving every day,\" the governor said. Testing is limited in the state, but Parson said he believes it will become more available in the coming weeks. Currently, the state is running 3,000 tests a day, which he said was not enough. The governor estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 tests per day are needed. \"Testing is going to be a big factor when you really 'reopen' the state ...  where people start feeling they're safe again to go out and come back to some sort of normal life,\" he said. Until then, the governor is also looking at larger data trends that show how rural and urban areas are impacted differently by the coronavirus. \"I think you could see that in the next several weeks, we'll have a phased approach,\" Gov. Parson said. \"We'll probably open the state up for economics, probably different areas of the state at different times.\" The governor postponed municipal elections that were scheduled for last week until June 2 and confirmed that he does not plan to expand vote-by-mail options for those elections, describing it as a partisan issue. \"That's an issue that has to be done through the legislative process,\" he said, noting that the state legislature isn't in session right now. \"I just don't think any one individual should be out there making that call.\" Listen to the conversation in full at the audio link above.",

            "article_content": "NPR science and politics reporters and a Wisconsin Public Radio correspondent relay the latest updates in the United States response to the coronavirus epidemic.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump has repeatedly criticized the World Health Organization's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Well, at today's daily briefing at the White House coronavirus task force, he indicated that what he sees as the WHO's mismanagement may come at a price. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known, and they should have known, and they probably did know. So we'll be looking into that very carefully, and we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see. SHAPIRO: Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, today was Election Day after a last-minute bid to postpone because of the pandemic failed late yesterday. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris, political correspondent Scott Detrow and Shawn Johnson, capital bureau chief for Wisconsin Public Radio, are all three with us now. Welcome. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Shawn, let's start... RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: ...With you. You are in Madison. What was it like for voters in Wisconsin today trying to maintain social distance and still cast ballots? SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: I could tell you the answer to that question was very different depending on where you were in Wisconsin. So in Milwaukee today, you saw some of the most pronounced lines, and that's because they had a shortage of poll workers, poll workers that didn't want to go out and work amid the COVID-19 crisis. And because of that shortage, they reduced the number of polling places from 180 to just five. So you had huge lines there, people waiting in line for hours to vote. In Madison, where I'm at, that was a different story. They had more polling places open, largely quiet today as people were voting. But you did see people coming out to vote wearing masks, gloves, protective gear - poll workers doing the same thing. One of the voters I spoke with today in Madison was Steve Clavin (ph). He's 65. Clavin said he wishes the election would have been delayed, but when that didn't happen, he felt he needed to vote in person. STEVE CLAVIN: I know I'm in the higher-risk group, and I felt like it was just really important to be here and to exercise my right to vote and to counteract the voter suppression that I think is going to take place as a result of this decision by the Supreme Court. JOHNSON: And I can tell you that at least among the voters I talked to in Madison today, that was a common feeling. They didn't really want to be there, but once the election went forward as scheduled, they felt that they needed to be. SHAPIRO: At the briefing today, President Trump said he supports Wisconsin going forward with its election today. What was his reasoning, and how does that sync up with what you're hearing in Wisconsin? JOHNSON: Yeah. Trump said today that he doesn't trust mail-in voting, which is something that our governor, Democrat Tony Evers, wanted to move to avoid crowds that happened with in-person voting. He said it was a political move, the president said - a political move by Democrats in Wisconsin. And when he was asked how it lines up with social distancing guidelines, you know, he essentially blamed it on Wisconsin's governor. I mean, I can tell you that what he's talking about with a mail-in election, which is something that our governor wanted to move to but Republican lawmakers rejected - the debate sounds very similar. If you're looking for what Wisconsin can say about how this debate might play out nationally, I can tell you this is something that Democrat Tony Evers strongly supported and Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin were strongly against. SHAPIRO: Well, as we mentioned, at today's briefing, President Trump also lashed out at the World Health Organization, even threatening to cut off funding. Richard Harris, turning to you - what do you make of that threat? HARRIS: Well, it's not the first time the president has complained that the WHO should have acted months earlier. But in fact, the WHO acted quickly. Their - officials in China learned about the outbreak at the end of December, when it was still just a few dozen cases. The WHO shared that news with the CDC and others in early January, and by the end of January, the WHO had declared it a public health emergency of international concern. That's their highest level of alert. It's true they didn't use the word pandemic for a while, but the WHO was constantly updating countries around the world about the developing epidemic and really treating it very seriously. SHAPIRO: If Trump follows through with his threat to cut off funding to the WHO, how significant would that be in the middle of this pandemic? HARRIS: Well, the United States is the largest single contributor to WHO. It contributes more than 20% of the agency's 4 billion-plus annual budget. The president mentioned a figure of $58 million, which is the amount of money the U.S. was supposed to pay as a regular assessment in January. But the U.S. has long contributed far more than the minimum partly out of concern for the billions of people who have poor access to health care but really also out of self-interest. As we have seen, diseases don't respect international borders. So whether it was Ebola outbreaks or Zika or SARS or now the new coronavirus, we need information from around the world, and we need action from around the world to bring diseases under control. SHAPIRO: Well, Richard, as you mentioned, the president has floated the trial balloon of cutting off funding to the WHO before. And, Scott, turning to you, put this in context for us with the president's statements in general. I mean, how does this fit in with his approach? DETROW: Yeah, this is an important point. The president regularly floats things, threatens things then changes their mind or just doesn't follow through. That's been the case his entire presidency. There are two recent examples during the coronavirus crisis, though. That day that he said and tweeted that he was considering stopping people from leaving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that would have had been a drastic step that would have affected millions of people. But at the end of the day, President Trump said he wouldn't actually do it. Another example is that he's been talking for several days about stopping flights into specific U.S. cities, but there's been no official action yet. SHAPIRO: Scott, the president also expressed his unhappiness yesterday with an inspector general report about testing. And today there's news that he pushed aside the head watchdog for the $2 trillion coronavirus aid package. What's going on there? DETROW: Yeah. President Trump has long bristled at inspector general reports that he doesn't like, and now the president has sidelined the acting Pentagon Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to oversee this massive new spending effort. President Trump did not give a specific reason for the move today other than alluding to the fact that Fine had worked under the Obama administration. That is true, but he also worked under the George W. Bush administration. He has had a long career at the Pentagon and, before that, the Department of Justice. He talked to NPR about his career in 2011 and about how he approaches his job. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GLENN FINE: Whenever you're doing a sensitive report, it's bound to make someone unhappy. We're not going to be the most popular people here in the Department of Justice, but our job is to do an aggressive, tough but fair review and to lay out the facts. And we try to do that. DETROW: So Fine has now been demoted, which means that he is not eligible to be the chief watchdog for this $2 trillion effort. And let's remember this. Just last week, President Trump fired the Intelligence Community inspector general, who had played a key role in validating that whistleblower report that led to his eventual impeachment. SHAPIRO: One last question for you, Richard - the president today also talked about the troubling observation that African Americans are far more likely to die of COVID-19. For example, more than 70% of the deaths in Louisiana are among black patients. What is behind that trend? HARRIS: Well, scientists are still trying to sort that out, but a few things stand out. Dr. Anthony Fauci pointed out that some of the health conditions that put people at higher risk for serious complications and death include high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, and those are more prevalent among African Americans. People are also examining the link to poverty because poor access to quality medical care, of course, doesn't help at all. And the disease has exposed yet again the persistent and serious health disparities that we see in this country. SHAPIRO: That is NPR science correspondent Richard Harris, political correspondent Scott Detrow and Shawn Johnson, capitol bureau chief for Wisconsin Public Radio. Thanks to all of you.

The coronavirus outbreak has halted other ballot initiatives in Idaho and other states.\n                \n                    \n                    James Dawson/Boise State Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteers pass boxes of signatures to qualify a 2018 ballot measure to expand Medicaid in Idaho. The coronavirus outbreak has halted other ballot initiatives in Idaho and other states. Updated April 6 at 12:49 p.m. ET The sounds of signature gatherers walking door-to-door in many states would normally be just on the horizon as spring comes into bloom. As the coronavirus began spreading in Washington state in late February, Linda Larson, a volunteer organizer across the border in Idaho for one effort to get on the ballot, decided to take precautions to protect her group and the public. \"All of our volunteers would have an apron with hand sanitizer in the apron and some alcoholic wipes and we were cleaning the pens before we would give them to someone to sign,\" Larson, of the group Reclaim Idaho, said. The initiative she and her fellow volunteers were gathering signatures for would have expanded state education funding by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. It needed about 55,000 signatures to get on the November ballot. Larson even took precautions herself, since she had to notarize each and every one of these petitions. \"I put all of the petitions in a basket and I would wait 48 hours before I would handle those,\" she said. But just two days after President Trump's March 16 announcement of national guidelines in favor of aggressive social-distancing practices to slow the spread the of the virus, the effort Larson was working on pulled the plug. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted elections and political campaigns all over the country. But elections can be rescheduled and conducted by mail. Campaigns have tried going virtual. Ballot measures almost completely rely on canvassers to gather thousands of signatures in person in order for an initiative to make it on the ballot. And the current public health concerns about social interaction have forced ballot measure organizers to shut down their efforts as large events and door-to-door canvassing become impossible. \"Everyone was kind of grieving, I guess, over the work that had been put in that, now we are struggling to see a path forward with this election cycle at least,\" said Rebecca Schroeder, the executive director of Reclaim Idaho. The group was also the driving force behind a ballot measure that expanded Medicaid in Idaho in 2018. Once it became clear that it was unsafe for volunteers to pass around petitions in public, Schroeder decided to end the campaign. After carefully reviewing the latest recommendations of public health authorities, we have concluded that it is no longer safe for volunteers to engage in the face-to-face interactions that are necessary for effective signature gathering. #SafeSigning #COVID19 #IdahoCovid19 \"I would rather, I think, just go out kicking and screaming and just lose the right way. You know? It is not how anyone wanted it to happen,\" she said. It's not a good time to be a ballot initiative organizer in any of the 24 states or Washington, D.C., where they're allowed, according to Josh Altic, who tracks ballot measures for the website Ballotpedia. \"A lot of the states have essentially either shut down signature gathering through stay-at-home orders or there's no events and events are the bread and butter of petition drives,\" Altic said. Deadlines are fast approaching to turn in petitions, and the tens of thousands of signatures necessary, to put an initiative in front of voters. Altic says 40% of states that allow ballot initiatives set their deadlines from now through August. Amy Pratt, a volunteer for Reclaim Idaho, gathers signatures by going door-to-door in Idaho Falls in October 2018 to encourage voters to expand Medicaid eligibility in Idaho. Social distancing measures are making the kind of campaigning needed for ballot measures nearly impossible.\n                \n                    \n                    James Dawson/Boise State Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Amy Pratt, a volunteer for Reclaim Idaho, gathers signatures by going door-to-door in Idaho Falls in October 2018 to encourage voters to expand Medicaid eligibility in Idaho. Social distancing measures are making the kind of campaigning needed for ballot measures nearly impossible. Some states are giving these campaigns some reprieve. Oklahoma has paused the clock on a signature-gathering deadline. Colorado granted one campaign a 15-day extension to gather the signatures it needs to qualify for the ballot. But other states aren't doing much to help out these campaigns so far. Two groups in Arkansas \u2014 one which would've legalized gaming machines and another that would've established a citizen's redistricting commission \u2014 folded signature gathering efforts in mid-March. Since then, other campaigns have suspended operations in Arizona, California, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Oregon. Reclaim Idaho asked Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, and state lawmakers to allow voters to sign petitions online \u2014 something no state currently allows. The request was never taken up. Four campaigns in Arizona have filed a petition with the state supreme court to allow them to collect signatures online using the same system political candidates already use to collect signatures. The lack of interest from state legislatures doesn't surprise Altic, who says there's often friction between organizers and state lawmakers. In some cases, voters are directly overruling the legislative process. \"I suspect that there's not going to be a whole lot of sympathy or a lot of treating this as sort of a political emergency,\" he said. After Reclaim Idaho suspended its campaign, organizer Larson said she and her fellow volunteers are \"discouraged\" and \"demoralized\" after putting in months of work to try to boost education funding. \"If our legislators aren't willing to solve it, then OK, fine, we'll do this. But give us the tools to be able to do this,\" she said. \"That's all we're asking.\" If it were safe to collect signatures, she'd be back on the streets immediately. For now, Reclaim Idaho is going back to one of its original missions: trying to help people sign up for Medicaid as the country's economic outlook gets worse.",

As the coronavirus shuts down their daily routines, some Americans have expressed the hope that the crisis would at last \"bring us together\" \u2013 or at least restore some sense of a shared national fate. That is profoundly to be hoped. Public trust is essential in a public health crisis. Beyond that, there would be much to be gained by restoring a sense of national purpose. As President Trump himself said Monday: \"If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we're going to have a big celebration altogether.\" But in this moment, in this crisis, the portents are not good for such unity. So far, the sudden emergence of a killer disease rampaging coast to coast has served less to unite us than to emphasize what divides us. This stands in marked contrast to the iconic moments of crisis and national response in our past. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 transformed the country overnight, converting a predominantly isolationist mood to one of implacable wartime resolve. The achievements that followed made the U.S. the preeminent military, economic and political force in the world for the next 75 years. The terror attacks on New York City and near Washington, D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, ended years of popular complacency about world affairs and did it in real time as the twin towers of the World Trade Center melted to the ground on live TV. Within hours, members of Congress from both parties were standing together on the steps of the Capitol singing \"God Bless America.\" The nation mobilized immediately to meet the foe, even though that foe was hard to see or define. In between those traumatic touchstones of history, there were other major shocks such as the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Suddenly, Americans were on the brink of nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, which was delivering the means to launch nuclear weapons from bases 90 miles from Florida. The White House responded, the nation united, and the Soviets pulled back. But in 2020, confronted by the coronavirus, our national spirit of shared challenge and commitment has been uneven, at best. To be sure, many responsible leaders in the public sector have been stepping up, closing schools and other government functions. Many in the private sector are also voluntarily taking steps to mitigate risk. This includes many businesses and the major professional sports and the collegiate athletic programs as well. It includes many private colleges and universities, theaters and churches, and civic groups of various kinds. Polling reveals divisions But is everyone on the same page? Far from it. Among the surprising revelations in recent days is the persistence of popular denial regarding the crisis itself. As of March 15, the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found only a bare majority of Americans (53%) are worried the virus could infect someone in their family. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this week found the percentage of those taking the threat of coronavirus seriously had actually declined since February among Republicans and political independents. In the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, only about one quarter of Republicans say they think the virus will affect their lives in a major way. Only about 30% said they would stop attending large public gatherings, despite frequent warnings. (The NBC-WSJ poll was taken before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked for a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people for eight weeks, and the NPR/PBS/Marist poll was completed before Trump said people should avoid gatherings of 10 or more for 15 days.) When talking to conservatives and those generally who lean to the right, we often hear that the threat is being exaggerated by the mainstream news media.  On Tuesday, the morning after the new guidelines were issued from the White House, the website Conservative HQ ran the headline \"Fake News Kills\" over a post by Adam Guillette, president of Accuracy in Media. \"The mainstream media is desperate to turn the coronavirus scare into President Donald Trump's Hurricane Katrina,\" wrote Guillette. \"It means they're motivated to overhype this story.\" President George W. Bush's response to the 2005 storm has been widely criticized. An echo chamber To some degree, this reflects what the nation was hearing in February and early March from the president. Initially, he cast it as China's problem and added the Chinese were handling it well. As recently as Feb. 28, he was telling a rally crowd in South Carolina that the media were over-dramatizing the danger, calling that treatment \"the latest liberal media hoax.\" (The next day, he explained that he had not meant to call the virus itself a hoax.) Those themes have been echoed and amplified on countless media platforms that regularly support the president. On Fox and Friends last Friday, viewers saw Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of the evangelical Liberty University founded by his televangelist father, explaining why his school would stay open when so many others were sending students home. Falwell wondered whether it was all a conspiracy between China and North Korea, then he turned his fire on the media, saying: \"It's just strange to me how many are overreacting. It makes you wonder if there's a political reason ... their next attempt to get Trump.\" With Trump himself having joined the health professionals in his administration in acknowledging the reality of the crisis (\"It could be really bad\"), a sea change may be coming among his followers.  On Tuesday, Falwell decided that Liberty would close after all. But the long resistance to the facts, and scope, and the insistence on blaming others has so far prevented this president from turning the crisis into a consensus-building opportunity for himself. Pearl Harbor carried President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to new heights of national support, despite his controversial pursuit of a third term. In the Cuban missile crisis, John F. Kennedy found the zenith of his brief presidency. And in 2001, George W. Bush saw his Gallup Poll approval soar above 90% in the days after the horrors of Sept. 11. A political football Trump's performance in the latest crisis has, by contrast, inflamed his critics and once again tested the loyalty of his supporters. To date, the latter have held firm.  That was why many evangelical leaders over the weekend rallied to his side and generally continued their church services even as many in other denominations were moving theirs online. That viewpoint suggests that the populist inclination to cast certain kinds of experts as an elite and to regard science as a challenge to tradition and belief is insulating or even isolating many Americans. Millions seem unconvinced that this disease is as widespread or as virulent as reported \u2013 even when those reports from respected government officials such as Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. As a result, the presence of a new and deadly pathogen in our midst was for many days downgraded to the status of a political football. It was subjected to partisan interpretation and polarized reaction, much like any other controversial issue or personality. It has spurred the latest surge of hyperpartisan charges and countercharges on cable TV news shows and in the tar pits of Twitter and other social media. Why is this so? As in the past, the threat clearly comes from outside our own borders. But this attack is not military, and because it has manifested itself around the world, it can hardly be said to be targeting the U.S. in particular.  The usual sense of us vs. them is missing. The attacker in this case, a virus, is not great and imposing but small, microscopic \u2013 indeed, invisible. We don't know which way to strike back, which may be one reason many are reluctant to believe the attack itself is real. Beyond that, the changes that have overtaken our communications, our social interactions and our political conversation have greatly complicated the process of information sharing. In the time of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, the fundamental difficulty was getting even a basic message to a population that had no general system of electronic communication at all. Roughly half of all Americans still lived in rural areas a century ago, and the idea of hourly or even daily bulletins was utterly unknown. Information overload Today our problem may well be the opposite. We have bulletins every minute. We have near-constant communication on 24-hour news outlets and endless torrents of individual observation on social media. In this welter of competing sources, who is to say which source can be trusted? Most people have long since constructed their own method for sorting through it all, and they are most likely to rely on that highly personal mechanism when deciding what to think and how to react to a crisis. It does not help, of course, that 2020 is also a political year in which we have elections for president, Congress, and other offices. Political awareness is everywhere; political antennae are extended to the max. Everything that happens is instantly interpreted for its prospective election impact. That said, the key factor in the division between attitudes over coronavirus would still appear to be the attitude of the president.  In similar moments in the past, the role of the president has been regarded as reflecting a national consensus. That is not to say the actions of past presidents have been without controversy.  There were those who questioned Roosevelt's handling of the Japanese prior to Pearl Harbor, even suggesting he lured them into an attack so as to precipitate American entry into World War II. This viewpoint still has its adherents today. Similarly, there were those who faulted Bush's reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks, especially his channeling of the resulting political anger toward Iraq, which he invaded 18 months later. Some also questioned whether the Sept. 11 attacks had even happened as reported, suggesting the damage was far greater than three airplanes could have caused. This fringe group of dissenters, known as \"Truthers,\" never gained much traction in the national conversation. But what Trump faces today is a far more generalized sense that the government has been slow to respond even in the face of an obvious danger. Indeed, the NPR/PBS/Marist poll found more Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic than approve by a 49%-44% margin. The simple truth in this instance is clearer now than ever: The danger of coronavirus was never a creation of the president's critics, nor had it been imagined by the current and former members of the administration who had been sounding the alarm. It was real all along, and remains so today.",

            "article_content": "U.S. death toll from the coronavirus rises to 11. As primaries continue, Biden and Sanders campaigns face specific challenges. And, migrants are pawns in political standoff between Turkey and E.U.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We have a portrait of health workers trying to do their jobs as a virus spreads. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: They're health workers in Washington state, a center of the outbreak of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus. California declared a state of emergency yesterday after one person there died of the virus. Washington state did so days ago. And in that state, the death toll is now 10. Vice President Mike Pence visits there today as officials take extraordinary precautions. A school district near Seattle is going to hold all its classes online for up to 14 days. Seattle-area officials are urging anyone over the age of 60 to stay home, and they are telling everyone to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. INSKEEP: So what's it like if you're in Washington state and your job is to come in very close contact with people? Will Stone of KNKX in Seattle has been talking with health workers. Good morning. WILL STONE, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Who you been hearing from? STONE: I've talked with people you could say are on the front lines of this situation. These are the paramedics, nurses, doctors and those who are running the local agencies that are spearheading this very big and challenging public health response. And there is concern among health care workers mostly revolving around whether they have enough information to do their jobs safely and not end up possibly expose themselves. INSKEEP: Yeah. What is the basic situation they face? STONE: Many of the serious cases and deaths are linked to a nursing home east of Seattle called Life Care Center. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah. STONE: Those who've died are primarily in their 70s or older. But public health leaders have been candid that the new coronavirus is circulating here, and it's likely been here for longer than we realized. So just as an example, someone who died last week had been transferred from the same nursing home to a hospital, and that was actually before the first deaths here were reported. And it turned out after the fact, we learned that that person had been infected. But we didn't know that at the time. INSKEEP: So if you're a health care worker and you're confronted with someone who is sick, you can't be sure what you're dealing with - at least at first. What does that lack of knowledge mean for doctors and their patients? STONE: The state public health agency has managed to improve the capacity to test so people have a little more sense of what they're dealing with. I mean, understandably, people who are sick with flu-like symptoms want to know if they have the illness. And people who believe they may have been exposed also want to be tested. At the moment, that's just not feasible given the capacity here. I spoke to Tove Skaftun, who's the chief nursing officer for the Community Health Center of Snohomish County. TOVE SKAFTUN: Definitely an increase in visits. And then the patients that are coming in to be seen are fearful. They're anxious. They want reassurance that they're not going to get it, and that's not something that we can provide for them. STONE: Skaftun says her clinic is now allowed to test anyone they suspect could have the illness. And they're getting lots of phone calls. But if they did that for everyone, they would quickly run out of supplies and kits. INSKEEP: Yeah. Well, how does that affect first responders, like EMTs or firefighters, say? STONE: They are taking new precautions. There's additional screening when people call 911. And if they come to a call that sounds anything like coronavirus, they just need to assume it is and wear all that protective equipment we've been seeing - gowns, gloves, so on. A bunch of firefighters who responded to the nursing home when there was a cluster of cases - Life Care Center - are now in quarantine. And that's because they responded to calls that did not seem related to any respiratory illness in the days before we learned about the coronavirus outbreak there. INSKEEP: Well, can the first responders not in quarantine still do what they need to do in the community? STONE: At the moment, they're making it work. They have enough staffing. I spoke with Evan Hurley, who is with the Kirkland fire and was not quarantined. He's still transporting patients this week back-and-forth from that nursing home and says it's taxing. The department has more than two dozen firefighters who are in isolation, and some actually are now showing flu-like symptoms. EVAN HURLEY: You know, we've got a lot of husbands and wives at home that are having to be either isolated within their own homes, or I know of a few guys that are living in campers in their driveways, including people with young kids. So there's a lot of stress. STONE: Hurley says that, you know, the best they can do is just wear all the appropriate equipment and just keep an eye out for anything that could be worrisome INSKEEP: Wow, hard job. Will Stone, thanks so much. STONE: Thank you. INSKEEP: He is with KNKX in Seattle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: At this point, the Democratic presidential contest is a question of math - which candidates can still see a way to add up enough convention delegates to win? MARTIN: After big wins on Super Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a slim delegate lead. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders - not far behind. Each campaign is facing challenges, even as other rivals back away. INSKEEP: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro has been counting. Hi there, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve. INSKEEP: Where do things stand? MONTANARO: Currently, it's Biden with the delegate lead with 566-501 over Bernie Sanders. Now, look; it's important to note that not all the delegates have been counted yet in California because of how large it is. And not all the delegates have been allocated from Super Tuesday. There's about 300 left to be allocated from Super Tuesday. About half of that's in California. But given how well Biden did outside of California, winning 10 of the 13 other states, he's likely to come away with a delegate lead, if not be a very close split out of Super Tuesday. INSKEEP: Well, Sanders was the clear front-runner just a few days ago. What has not worked for him? MONTANARO: You know, Sanders has really banked on young voters coming out for him. And the whole theory of his case has been that he can beat Donald Trump because he would turn out record-high numbers of voters under 30. But so far, that hasn't happened. And even Sanders is acknowledging that. Listen to what he said about this yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? And the answer is no. We're making some progress, but historically, everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in. I think that will change in the general election. But I am - to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. It is not easy. MONTANARO: You know, that's a remarkable admission from Sanders. Before Super Tuesday, voters under 30 as a share of the electorate had only gone up in one state, in Iowa. And on Super Tuesday, in every state that had exit polls or entrance polls in 2016, young voters went down as a share of the electorate. So this is big for Sanders. And it may be him, you know, calling out his troops, saying, hey, guys, I need you now, or I might not be the nominee. INSKEEP: Although, we have to note, just a week ago, things looked pretty bad for Joe Biden. How deep is his support, really? MONTANARO: (Laughter) Yeah. I mean, look; every time we've thought that we have this race figured out, it's changed. So let's see what happens. But Biden has run up pretty big margins with black voters, which had helped - which have helped him in the South and the mid-South. He's winning big margins of older voters and moderates. Sanders, on the other hand, is winning wide margins with liberals, Latinos and those young voters. When you look at those coalitions, though, and the states coming up, Biden clearly has the inside track here. If those margins hold, you know, Biden is going to be favored in places like Florida and Georgia, which come up later this month - big states - and places like New York and New Jersey next month. INSKEEP: Domenico, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We're going to take you to the border between Turkey and Greece now, where thousands of migrants are stranded. MARTIN: Yeah. These people are from many countries. Some have fled the war in Syria. Others are from Iran, Afghanistan, elsewhere. They are in Turkey right now, which has encouraged them to actually move on into Europe. But the first country they come to, Greece, hasn't let them in. INSKEEP: Durrie Bouscaren is on the Turkey-Greece border and has been reporting on this. Hi there. DURRIE BOUSCAREN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What have you been seeing? BOUSCAREN: So where reporters are allowed to get to, yesterday, it was a cornfield where these buses from all over the country have been dropping migrants off. And then they're told to walk. Basically, they walk towards the Greek border, and then they're pushed back, sometimes with tear gas, sometimes with live ammunition. The Turkish authorities say at least three migrants have been shot so far, some fatally. So under this 2016 EU deal, Turkey was supposed to actively stop migrants from getting into Europe. It used to be very risky. People would leave in the dead of night. Now it's being broadcast breathlessly by pro-government media outlets, and people can go in the light of day. It's almost as if they're being encouraged. Turkey is not actively policing its border anymore. INSKEEP: What are the refugees and migrants, then, telling you as they try to make this crossing? BOUSCAREN: I mean, some are actually quite angry. They feel like they're being used as pawns, but they do it because they're desperate. A lot of them have lived in Turkey for a long time. The economy and government policies towards foreigners are making life harder. Here's one father I met. His name is Walli Mohammadi (ph). He's from Afghanistan. And he shows me his 2-year-old son's eyes. They're bright red from what he says was being tear gassed when they tried to cross the Greek border. Here's what he said. WALLI MOHAMMADI: (Speaking Dari). BOUSCAREN: Now, it's in Dari, and he's telling me and my translator that he's been living in Turkey without papers for 2 1/2 years, eking out a living, doing farm work. And he says he has no future here. When he heard Erdogan's announcement about the border being open, he used his last savings to get to the border. So now he and his family members - there are 17 - 18 in total - they're stuck. They're staying in a mosque, and they have no idea what to do. They didn't know what they were getting into. INSKEEP: Have any people been able to cross the Turkey-Greece border? BOUSCAREN: Some do make it. The Turkish government claims that 130,000 have made it, but it really seems unlikely. What we're told is that when people try to cross the border, they're loaded onto buses and dropped back off on the Turkish side. Many people have tried multiple times. I met one group camping out by a river. It acts as a border between Greece and Turkey. And at one point, they made it into Greece but were picked up by police, stripped down to their underwear and driven back to Turkey. Samiullah Sami (ph) - he's from Pakistan. He says his mom had to wire money from Lahore to get money and clothing for everyone. SAMIULLAH SAMI: (Non-English language spoken). BOUSCAREN: He's saying that Turkish organizations are coming by with tea and donations, encouraging them to stay and saying the border will open. So he's planning to keep trying, even if it takes a month. INSKEEP: Very briefly, might the border be open in a month? BOUSCAREN: I get this question all the time, and there's no indication that's going to happen. But Erdogan has been successful in getting the EU to the bargaining table on this. What he wants is support in Syria. INSKEEP: Durrie, thanks so much. BOUSCAREN: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's reporter Durrie Bouscaren near the Turkey-Greece border. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Climate change has become a key issue in the Democratic primaries, but voters are split in the swing state of Pennsylvania \u2014 where the fracking boom has boosted the economy.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Climate change has become a key issue in the presidential primaries, but it's a tricky one for Democrats in big oil and gas states like Pennsylvania, a swing state where the fracking boom has been a major boost to the economy. Reid Frazier of the Allegheny Front and StateImpact Pennsylvania reports. REID FRAZIER, BYLINE: Standing on the side of a road, Jeff Nobers looks across the Ohio River at a massive construction site. Shell is building this multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant that will turn natural gas into plastic. Nobers heads the Western Pennsylvania Builders Guild, which includes many union members working on the plant. JEFF NOBERS: You know, work here is a lot of overtime, so you have, easily, people making well over six figures. FRAZIER: Nobers says if Democrats nominate someone who wants to move away from fossil fuels, they'd have a tough time winning over some of these workers. He says the union leaders he works with wouldn't necessarily tell their rank-and-file members who to vote for. NOBERS: But they would be very clear to say, look. If you vote for this person, this is what they stand for. And, you know, at the end of it, you know, this is your livelihood and the livelihoods of many others. FRAZIER: Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both said they support a ban on fracking for natural gas or oil. Legal experts doubt a president could do this without congressional approval. But political observers are starting to wonder whether this stance could hurt a candidate with swing voters in Pennsylvania, where 30,000 people work in the oil and gas industry. CHRIS BORICK: I think the answer's probably yes. FRAZIER: Chris Borick of Muhlenberg College says lots of people in the state are concerned about climate change in the environment, but... BORICK: I think the proven method and the method that is shown to be successful time and time again is to win moderate Democrats, moderate voters. FRAZIER: But that group might include some who are just fine with an antifracking candidate. Recent polls find Pennsylvania voters are split on whether to ban fracking. One found support for a ban was strongest in the state's two biggest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) We won't rest until you divest. We won't rest until you divest. FRAZIER: At a recent rally at the University of Pittsburgh, students call on the school to divest from fossil fuels. Brianna Mims, who's from outside Philadelphia, watches between classes. BRIANNA MIMS: I am someone that really values the environment, and I feel like anything that we can do to stop the way that we're torturing the environment is beneficial. FRAZIER: Then there are voters like Gerald Medved. A retired coal miner, Medved is a registered Democrat who voted for Trump in 2016, a decision he now regrets. He says his groundwater was temporarily polluted when a gas company drilled a well near his house along the West Virginia border. GERALD MEDVED: When you ask me what I feel about the gas company, I feel some good and a lot of bad. FRAZIER: He's OK with an anti-fracking candidate. He says he's seen the climate changing with his own eyes. MEVE: I think you have to look at the scientists in the United States. The people are saying there's global warming. And figure, do you want to do something about it now or wait until it's too late? FRAZIER: For this election, Medved says he's willing to give the Democratic candidate, whoever they may be, his vote.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have stepped up their criticism of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus, accusing his administration of \"incompetence.\" The president has noticed. Speaking to supporters Friday night in South Carolina, he accused his Democratic rivals of using the virus for political ends. \"The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,\" Trump said. \"One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.' That did not work out too well. They could not do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. ... They tried anything. ... And this is their new hoax.\" During the rally, Trump said \"the best professionals in the world\" were working on the nation's response to the virus. Trump then held a news conference Saturday, after the first U.S. coronavirus death was confirmed in Washington state. Trump said a woman in her late 50s has died from a coronavirus infection. (Washington state public health officials later said the person who died was a man.) At the news conference, the Trump administration announced new travel restrictions and advisories for Iran, Italy and South Korea; and that the U.S. government has contracted with the company 3M to produce 35 million more face masks per month. Responding to a reporter's question about his use of the word \"hoax\" the night before, Trump said: \" 'hoax' referring to the action that [Democrats] take to try and pin this on somebody because we've done such a good job. The hoax is on them.\" What the Democrats have said The South Carolina primary is Saturday. At a campaign event Saturday morning in Greensville, S.C., former Vice President Joe Biden said it was \"bizarre\" and \"dangerous\" for Trump to have used the word \"hoax\" at all. In an interview Friday with CNN, Biden said the Trump administration should defer to the experts. \"Let the experts take this over,\" Biden said. \"Everyone will have more confidence.\" One reason stock prices are falling, Biden said, \"is not just the pandemic concern, but the way in which the president is handling this.\" At every stop in South Carolina on Friday, Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders blasted Trump for focusing on politics instead of the growing coronavirus threat. \"Everybody knows there is a coronavirus spreading all over the world,\" Sanders said at his first stop of the day, at a church in St. George. \"You would think that you'd have a president of the United States leading, working with scientists all over the world, bringing people together to figure out how we're gonna deal with this crisis. He is here in South Carolina,\" said Sanders, ahead of the Trump campaign rally later that night in Charleston. \"He doesn't even have any opposition in the Republican primary. Why is he here? He's here to try and disrupt the Democratic primary.\" The Sanders campaign has also released statements criticizing the Trump administration's response to the growing public health and economic threat as \"inadequate, misleading, and dangerous.\" The concerns appeared to be shared by some voters. A handful of Sanders supporters at rallies Friday were spotted wearing protective face masks. At campaign stops across Tennessee on Friday, billionaire and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg repeatedly attacked Trump's management and blamed the president for the upheaval in the stock market. \"The coronavirus has already arrived here in America, and make no mistake: The incompetence in the White House is endangering lives and hurting our economy,\" Bloomberg said, accusing Trump of \"burying his head in the sand\" when he was first briefed on the issue two months ago. For Bloomberg, who took office three months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it's also a way to remind primary voters concerned about a possible pandemic, or economic unrest, that he was a competent manager in times of crisis. \"In times like this we need strong, proven leadership in the White House,\" he said. Bloomberg plans to air a three-minute-long video on CBS and NBC during commercial airtime Sunday night to discuss the virus, and the importance of having a president who can respond appropriately to such crises. \"This can't be about politics. We've got to have leadership that puts the input of public health experts first,\" former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg told CNN Friday.\"I don't know where the president got the idea that this is something that could just take care of itself when it got warmer. This is going to take sustained coordination, both within and across the federal government and the interagency; between the federal government and the private sector as there is a race to find new therapies and perhaps a vaccine; and internationally, among all of the different authorities and countries, that must be tightly coordinating the response to this issue.\" Billionaire hedge fund investor and climate activist Tom Steyer has been making increasingly dire warnings about the threat posed by the coronavirus, during his final sprint across the state of South Carolina ahead of the primary. Steyer has repeatedly said that Trump's response is an indicator of his \"incompetence in a neon sign\" and said that Trump is \"months late to do anything.\" He also faulted Trump for \"clearing out the Centers for Disease Control [and Protection].\" But at a packed event in Myrtle Beach, S.C., his warning was more dire. \"He's just discovering two months later, 'Whoa, this could hurt my reelection attempts,' \" Steyer said. \"That's how superficial a man he really is. He is incompetent. This is his Katrina event, where it's like 'Whoa, I have to do a job?' Who knew?\" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has also faulted Trump for proposing to cut funding for the CDC. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Thursday introduced legislation that would redirect $10 billion of border wall funding to fight the coronavirus. \"Rather than use taxpayer dollars to pay for a monument to hate and division, my bill will help ensure that the federal government has the resources it needs to adequately respond to this emergency,\" Warren said in a statement. Warren accused Trump of failing to direct \"significant financial resources\" to the coronavirus response. The administration has asked Congress for $2.5 billion to combat the virus; many lawmakers feel that's not enough, and have proposed doubling or even tripling that amount. The White House acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, accused the press on Friday of playing up the coronavirus story because \"they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president.\"",

            "article_content": "As voters prepare to go to the polls on Super Tuesday, there's an ad war playing out in Charlotte, N.C.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: North Carolina is a key state in next week's Super Tuesday primaries. Charlotte is, of course, that state's largest city. And its metro area borders South Carolina - that's where voters go to the polls today. So residents in the area have been deluged with political ads. NPR's Sarah McCammon is spending time this year in Charlotte. It's part of our series called Where Voters Are. And she looks at how all those ads may be shaping voters' views of the Democratic primary race. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: OK. I just got in my car. And I am in a little college town just outside of Charlotte. I'm going to turn on the radio and see what happens. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We need to think different. Tom Steyer is a progressive businessman who... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mike knows investing in our teachers is investing in our children. TOM STEYER: I'm Tom Steyer, running for president. And I approve this message. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I'm Mike Bloomberg. And I approve this message. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Paid for by Mike Bloomberg 2020. MCCAMMON: Campaign ads are all over radio and TV and social media platforms, like Facebook. It got to be a bit much for Shawn Abbas. SHAWN ABBAS: I have blocked quite a few things just because, as you would suspect, I mean, there was so much that was being shared from all candidates. MCCAMMON: Abbas is a Democrat in his early 40s working in Charlotte's banking industry. Liz Albertorio is 30 and works at a museum downtown. She's an independent planning to vote in the Democratic primary. And she says she's also resorted to blocking political ads on social media. But they're inescapable on her drive to work, especially one name in particular. LIZ ALBERTORIO: Oh, well, I just came in from 77. And there was this big ad - Mike Bloomberg. MCCAMMON: The billionaire former New York City mayor and latecomer to the race has skipped the early primaries and is making a big play for Super Tuesday, especially in Charlotte, where his campaign opened its first field office in the nation. Steve Passwaiter is a vice president with Kantar/CMAG, a media analysis firm. STEVE PASSWAITER: In many ways, of course, in lot of these states, Bloomberg has had the airwaves all to himself. And, of course, he's buying at such a volume, you can't miss him. You can try. But you can't miss him. MCCAMMON: Bloomberg has spent close to $15 million running ads in North Carolina - 10 times more than Senator Bernie Sanders, the next biggest spender, according to the firm Advertising Analytics. But does it all make a difference to Democratic primary voters still making up their minds? ABBAS: Not at all. I don't think so. MCCAMMON: That's Shawn Abbas again. He says he forms opinions mostly by talking to friends - not political ads. Abbas says he's narrowed down his list to three choices - none of whom are Steyer or Bloomberg, the candidates whose ads he's heard the most. Steve Hall is 44 and works in Charlotte in digital marketing for a fantasy sports company. As a voter, Hall finds Bloomberg's ad blitz impressive, though he prefers a former vice president Joe Biden or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. STEVE HALL: I appreciate the Bloomberg ads because I feel like he's doing all the Democrats a service in the fact that he's going after Trump in these ads. But I feel like he's kind of muddling up the message with all the moderates in the same pool of voters. MCCAMMON: The onslaught of Democratic primary ads might have another effect, says Susan Roberts, a political scientist at Davidson College outside Charlotte. SUSAN ROBERTS: Well, I think they help remind people that there is a primary. MCCAMMON: Roberts says she'll be watching to see if the ads bring out more casual voters who don't tend to participate in primaries. ROBERTS: And it doesn't take a political scientist to say - so I think getting people out, maybe not persuading them but to mobilize mostly and to persuade a little. MCCAMMON: The big question will be whose voters are mobilized by all those ads. Sarah Mccammon, NPR News, Charlotte. (SOUNDBITE OF PAPADOSIO'S \"THREES\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "The city of Pueblo, Colo. went for Donald Trump in 2016, but a diverse population and an activated base of working-class voters could flip it in 2020.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: I'm Ari Shapiro in Pueblo, Colo. We've been here for the last week talking with voters as part of our election year project called Where Voters Are. It involves NPR hosts, correspondents and our colleagues at member stations around the country. Between now and Election Day, we'll be talking about where voters are on the candidates, on the issues and where they are in the country because place has a lot to do with how people think about politics. Pueblo, Colo., is a working-class town with a complicated political identity. And so we've enlisted the help of Colorado Public Radio politics reporter Bente Birkeland, who is here with me in Pueblo. Hi, Bente. BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Hi. Happy to talk to you. SHAPIRO: You cover politics for Colorado Public Radio, and this state has been trending blue in recent years. How do the politics of the city of Pueblo fit into the larger state picture? BIRKELAND: It occupies a unique place in Colorado politics. Historically, Colorado has been a swing state, but in 2018, Democrats made significant gains. Democrats now control both chambers of the state legislature. The governor's office flipped a congressional seat near Denver from red to blue and voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Pueblo County is more of a swing area. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, but President Donald Trump won here. SHAPIRO: So interesting. So you've got this blue trend in the state of Colorado. But in Pueblo, a historically labor-union town, it's actually shifting a little more red. I know you've been talking to voters in the city all week. Tell me about who you've met and why you think Trump resonated in Pueblo when he lost in the state of Colorado. BIRKELAND: Well, Pueblo's two hours south of Denver. It's a much more rural area. And Trump's message of changing the status quo played well. The economy here is not as strong as other parts of the state where it's really booming. And Republicans by and large voted for Trump here. Tammy Highberger is one of those Republicans. She's a special education teacher at Pueblo East High School. And she said she likes his personality, his tweets, his policies. She feels he's one of the people. And on one of the big issues she's concerned about, immigration, she really likes his stance. TAMMY HIGHBERGER: I absolutely support the wall, anything to try to keep people who are not supposed to be here out. I think that's one of my bigger problems is everybody allowing these sanctuary cities and allowing illegals in here where taxpayers are footing the bill. BIRKELAND: And she thinks he's delivering on his campaign promises. She's thrilled to vote for him. What's interesting is the school she teaches at is overwhelmingly Hispanic students, and this town is about 50% Latino. SHAPIRO: So Tammy is all Trump all the way in 2020. Did you meet people who were more on the fence? BIRKELAND: I didn't personally talk to anyone who was on the fence about the presidential race. Democratic voters told me they could actually understand why Trump did well here because of the economic argument. This is considered Colorado's mini-Rust Belt, if you will. But right now, those Democrats said they just - they cannot wrap their heads around why someone would still back Trump. They point to his policies, his personality and leadership style, the impeachment. And when I talked to a variety of Democrats, they kept asking, why? Why? Tell me why. SHAPIRO: So, like, the political has become personal here as in much of the country. HIGHBERGER: Yes, and one voter I talked to, Jacqueline Riggs who's another teacher at the high school, she really epitomizes that. She's a mother of seven, grandmother of 21, born and raised in Pueblo. Her husband was in the Air Force, so they traveled the world. And she's back here now. She voted for Trump even though she disagrees with him on some of his major policies. She doesn't back the border wall. She's very pro-union and helped lead a teacher strike here. But she likes Trump's stance on trade, and the economy's good. JACQUELINE RIGGS: Are his personal values, like, the way he's lived his life, divorce and affairs and saying things that he's said about women and about - no. Those are not my values. But his policies are. Like, I don't take it seriously. I think it's this sort of rhetoric, banter, like, political just, like, in your face. I wish he wouldn't do it as much as he does. Honestly, people hear that stuff, and that's all they hear. SHAPIRO: So one thing that makes Pueblo politics so interesting is that two years after Trump won by a razor-thin margin here - less than 1 percentage point - Pueblo voters supported Jared Polis for governor, who won his race. He's the first openly gay governor in the country, Colorado's first Jewish governor. BIRKELAND: Yes, and Governor Jared Polis launched his campaign in Pueblo. And since he's been governor, he's come here close to a dozen times. He granted me a one-on-one interview to talk about Pueblo. He said he considers the area, in some ways, the heart of Colorado, given its ethnic diversity and rich cultural history. And one Democratic political operative I talked to said if we could figure out Pueblo, we could figure out the country. The voter we just heard from, Jacqueline Riggs who backed Trump, she voted for Polis, too. She liked his education policy platform. So I asked Polis, what lessons could Democrats learn from your campaign? JARED POLIS: I ran on my business success as somebody who's created jobs and successful companies. I mean, that's something that Mike Bloomberg would be able to say that I think would resonate well - probably other things other candidates that, you know, can say. But I mean, people want to see that lived experience. Like, you know, don't just talk about it. You know, what have you done? How can we know you can produce? SHAPIRO: A city of 100,000 people that could be considered the political heart of Colorado. Bente, thanks for joining us here in Pueblo. BIRKELAND: Thanks so much, Ari.

It wasn't a coup attempt. But when soldiers briefly occupied El Salvador's congress this month to intimidate lawmakers into passing an anti-crime bill, the scene recalled one of Latin America's darkest eras: In the 1970s and 1980s, much of the region was ruled by abusive military dictators. And it's not just El Salvador. With unpopular presidents facing street protests and demands that they crack down on rising crime and corruption and revive stagnant economies, Latin America's armed forces are once again throwing their weight around. Perhaps the most dramatic case is Bolivia. In an election last October that was marred by fraud, Evo Morales claimed to have won a fourth term as Bolivia's president. Amid protests and demands that he step down, Morales clung to power. But then, the country's armed forces commander weighed in. In a TV address, Gen. Williams Kaliman said: \"We suggest that the president resign for the good of Bolivia.\" A few hours later, Morales did just that \u2014 then fled to Mexico and later Argentina. \"It wasn't a coup in the traditional sense, but it was the military putting its thumb on the scales,\" says Adam Isacson, a military analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. Elsewhere, military officers have helped prop up floundering leaders. For example, when going on TV to announce gas price hikes and other controversial measures, the presidents of Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras have surrounded themselves with stern-looking generals. Such choreographed appearances serve as stark warnings to would-be protesters that the armed forces stand firmly in the president's corner. \"The high command is certainly lending itself to political messaging at key moments,\" Isacson says. \"That is a political role that is pretty crucial.\" In Mexico, Central America and Chile, troops have been sent into the streets to hunt down criminals, disperse protesters or block migrants. Generals and colonels, in turn, are being brought into the inner circles of civilian governments. In Venezuela, authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is deeply unpopular but has retained the support of the armed forces by placing officers in charge of an array of functions, from state food distribution to oil production. Brazil's then-President-elect Jair Bolsonaro (center) and Gen. Walter Braga Netto (second from left) smile during a ceremony marking the 73rd anniversary of the Brazilian Paratrooper Infantry Brigade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Nov. 24, 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Bruna Prado/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brazil's then-President-elect Jair Bolsonaro (center) and Gen. Walter Braga Netto (second from left) smile during a ceremony marking the 73rd anniversary of the Brazilian Paratrooper Infantry Brigade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Nov. 24, 2018. In Brazil, nine of the 22 ministers in President Jair Bolsonaro's government come from the armed forces. They include the vice president as well as Gen. Walter Braga Netto, the army's second highest-ranking officer, who took over last week as Bolsonaro's chief of staff. The far-right Bolsonaro, himself a former army captain, even held a military parade last year to commemorate the 1964 coup that ushered in Brazil's 21-year dictatorship. \"The president does not consider March 31, 1964 a military coup,\" presidential spokesman Gen. Ot\u00e1vio R\u00eago Barros said in response to widespread outrage over the parade. \"He believes that \u2014 considering the danger Brazil was in \u2014 society brought together civilians and the military to put the country back on track.\" However, it turned out to be a tragic period as military strongmen came to dominate South American countries and much of Central America \u2014 largely with U.S. government backing. Amid crackdowns on regime opponents, thousands of people were tortured and killed. When these dictatorships finally collapsed, a new generation of civilian presidents worked hard to rid their governments of military influence. \"Everything from getting the military out of policing, getting the military out of nondefense cabinet posts, getting civilians in charge of defense ministries, getting human rights trials for past abuses,\" Isacson says. He describes this process as a \"brick-by-brick building of this new edifice of civilian control of the military.\" So, why is this edifice now revealing so many cracks? For starters, polls show growing frustration with Latin America's governments. Mass protests erupted late last year in Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, with a variety of demands ranging from new jobs programs, to crackdowns on corruption, to constitutional reforms. Presidents have reacted by shoring up their inner circles with respected military officers and by deploying troops for handle things like crowd control or even garbage collection during sanitation workers' strikes. \"The military becomes sort of the go-to institution at a time when there is a demand from the public to do something,\" says Frank Mora, a former U.S. Defense Department official who now heads the Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University. He says that for younger Latin Americans, who never lived under martial law, the armed forces can seem like a benevolent institution that follows orders and gets things done. True, militaries have helped consolidate authoritarian regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua. However, Mora and other experts say it's unlikely that the region will return to full-fledged military rule. A backer of Bolivia's former President Evo Morales kneels in front of soldiers guarding a street in downtown La Paz, Bolivia, on Nov. 15. A few days earlier, the military advised Morales to resign.\n                \n                    \n                    Natacha Pisarenko/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A backer of Bolivia's former President Evo Morales kneels in front of soldiers guarding a street in downtown La Paz, Bolivia, on Nov. 15. A few days earlier, the military advised Morales to resign. For one thing, officers are actually quite wary about taking on some of their new duties, especially policing. It can tarnish their reputations, as was the case in Bolivia, where the caretaker president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, ordered the army to break up anti-government protests in November. The result was violent clashes in which at least 36 people were killed. \"They do it reluctantly, and in some cases they get out as quickly as possible,\" Mora says. \"The military is not trained to do this and they know that. And that could lead to not just human rights violations, which many militaries that I have interviewed are very concerned about, but it can expose them to corruption.\" Another constraint is money. Even as soldiers take on new tasks, Mora says that overall defense spending in Latin America averages about 1.5% of the region's gross domestic product \u2014 among the lowest of any region in the world, he says. Mar\u00eda Victoria Llorente, director of the Colombian think tank Ideas for Peace Foundation, says militaries did a terrible job of governing back in the 1970s and '80s and that they have spent the past three decades trying to repair their prestige. Not even in Venezuela, where the military is widely seen as propping up President Maduro, have the generals tried to assume full control of the government. Latin American armies \"already learned their lesson, and it was a very hard lesson,\" Llorente says. What's more, she and other analysts say that the way things stand now, Latin American militaries have the best of both worlds. They enjoy growing clout in government \u2014 yet civilian presidents take the rap when things go wrong.",

The course was operated by the University of Texas system, but the border wall cut it off from the rest of the city. A visit to the now-defunct Fort Brown Memorial Golf Course in Brownsville, Texas, is a cautionary tale of how Trump's border wall can create dead zones. The clubhouse is shuttered, par signs are fading and the once-manicured greens are fields of weeds. In 2008, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, working with the University of Texas at Brownsville, built a security fence on the southern edge of the campus that effectively walled off the popular golf course from the rest of the city. Golfers stopped coming, and the course, which was operated by the university, eventually went bankrupt. \"What used to be a very active place, very friendly place, for students and for our golf team and for winter Texans has become a deserted, sad, desolate no man's land,\" says Juliet Garc\u00eda, the former university president, who fiercely fought the border wall. She stands in the empty parking lot, littered with trash and palm fronds. \"None of us come over here,\" Garcia says, looking around sadly. \"You don't feel protected in any part of the land that is south of the wall.\" Juliet Garc\u00eda, former president of the University of Texas at Brownsville, stands behind the border wall.\n                \n                    \n                    Ver\u00f3nica G.

When the government constructs its border barrier in California, Arizona and New Mexico, it runs along the arrow-straight land boundary with Mexico. But in Texas, that boundary is the meandering Rio Grande. And because of flooding concerns about flooding, the border wall is often built some distance away \u2014 as much as a mile north of the river. That leaves thousands of acres between the water and the wall \u2014 all of it American soil \u2014 as no man's land. Landowners fear the wall will effectively sever their acreage from the United States, leaving it abandoned, lawless and unprofitable. Trump has pledged to build more than 500 miles of new border wall by 2021, if he wins a second term. On Thursday, the Pentagon informed Congress it would reprogram $3.8 billion \u2014 that was earmarked for aircraft, vehicles and ships \u2014 to pay for 177 additional miles of barrier to be built along the western desert border. While some applaud a 30-foot-tall structure to keep out immigrants and drug runners, down in the Rio Grande Valley it has run into opposition. So far, 55 property owners have gone to court to try to block the survey and construction crews. The existing border wall divides property adjacent to River Bend Resort & Golf Club.

Nearly 700 Canadians and Americans from the frigid North spend their winters at River Bend. The owners of River Bend Resort & Golf Club, located just west of Brownsville, were planning a major expansion worth millions of dollars when they heard the border wall would slice through their development. \"A 30-foot wall through the middle of the property completely kills our project,\" says Jeremy Barnard, part of the family that owns River Bend. Nearly 700 Americans and Canadians from the frigid north relocate there during the winter to enjoy short sleeves and margaritas, and live in upscale mobile homes amid palm trees on a sharp bend in the river. Trump's wall would go up beside an existing levee that bisects the property. \"The problem with that is 70% of our property is south of the levee,\" says Barnard. That includes the rec center, the pool, tennis courts, and 15 of 18 holes. All of it would be cut off by the wall. The frustrating thing, he says, is they rarely see unauthorized immigrants and drug smugglers passing through the development. Nonetheless, CBP reports that the Rio Grande Valley is the nation's hot spot for narcotics and human smuggling. Memo Ibarra makes a chip shot at River Bend Resort & Golf Club in Brownsville, Texas.

The 18-hole golf course would have 15 of them on the south side of Trump's proposed border wall. His family is negotiating urgently with CBP to move the wall slightly north so it won't cut their property in half. And yet Jeremy Barnard's politics haven't changed. He remains loyal to President Trump. \"I've got friends that disagree with me and they say, 'How could you vote for this man? His wall wants to tear apart your community,' \" he says, \"The main thing I tell them is, 'Look, the thought that I'm gonna agree with somebody a hundred percent of the time, especially a politician, is just outrageous.' But I do agree with what he's trying to do as far as securing the border. I just have an issue with the blanket \u2014 let's build a wall everywhere.\" West of the River Bend Resort, the landscape reverts to fields of onions, cotton and corn. Richard Drawe leans against his pickup truck at his farm headquarters south of the town of Weslaco. He has worked this rich delta soil all his life, like his father and grandfather before him. \"I'm 70 years old and it's gonna ruin my lifestyle here of living in the country,\" he says. \"To have that wall there is just gonna really disturb me.\" Jeremy Barnard's family owns the River Bend Resort & Golf Club in Brownsville, Texas.

Drawe knows he can't beat Washington, D.C., so last fall, he reluctantly sold the government a ribbon of land so they could erect the fence across his property. Like Jeremy Barnard, Richard Drawe supports Trump and is all for increasing border security \u2014 he just doesn't want the wall on his property. \"I told them that this stupid wall is gonna have lights on it. It's gonna be like being behind a prison wall, lights and everything,\" Drawe says. \"And I said, 'You put them lights up on me and my house, I'm gonna shoot em out.' Of course, I had time to calm down.\" He has seen what's happened over the past decade to riverside land isolated by the border wall that was erected by President George W. Bush. He says the acreage is effectively ceded to Mexico. He's worried that bad hombres will cross the river from Mexico and threaten his farmhands. \"Like I told the Border Patrol, I said, 'Look, you know good and well that once you build this wall all the agents will be doing is patrolling up and down the wall. They're never gonna go on down to the river anymore.' And he yelled back at me, 'Oh, the Rio Grande is the first line of defense.'

CBP is aware of landowners' misgivings. A spokesman said, \"The Border Patrol will continue to operate on both sides of the barrier, to include the riverine environment.\" Further, the agency will install electric gates with security codes to give landowners access to the south side of the wall. This is cold comfort to Fred Cavazos, whose extended family owns a rustic campground on the river south of the city of Mission. \"We were raised here,\" says Cavazos, 70 years old and in a wheelchair. \"My dad taught me how to fish here, how to get a shovel and dig for worms.\" His main income is from tenants who have built weekend shanties along the water's edge. \"A lot of them own boats. A lot of them own jet skis,\" he says. \"So they come down with fajitas and sausages Saturdays and Sundays and barbecue.\" Cousins Rey Anzaldua (left) and Cavazos own a rustic campground in Mission.

The government wants to put the wall, a gate and a 150-foot-wide patrol zone along the north end of the property. The family worries that the tenants may not want to be walled off from the rest of Texas. Acreage south of the wall is \"very lightly patrolled\" by the Border Patrol, says Rey Anzaldua, a 75-year-old cousin and co-owner. \"If people come across the river and steal from our tenants who are here on the river, then probably we are going to lose a lot of the tenants,\" Anzaldua says. Like many large families in the Rio Grande Valley, the Cavazos clan is split. Some want to accept what they think is a generous offer from the government \u2014 nearly $400,000 for six acres. But Anzaldua wonders what happens if one day they decide to put the land up for sale. \"The problem is the devaluation of the property,\" he says. \"Nobody wants to buy property that's on the river side of the wall. So this is what the fight's going to be about.\" Anzaldua and Cavazos are fighting CBP in federal court. Maybe if they drag it out until Election Day, they say, a Democrat will win the White House and halt the border wall.

Updated at 6:54 p.m. ET The Trump administration has notified Congress that it plans to divert $3.8 billion from the Defense Department's budget to build the border wall. This is in addition to more than $11 billion that's already been identified to construct more than 500 miles of new barriers along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. That includes money that Congress has appropriated and funding that was previously diverted from military construction and counternarcotic operations. The latest funding diversion takes $1.5 billion originally allocated for buying equipment for National Guard and Reserve units, such as trucks, generators and spare parts, as well as fighter jets and ships. This administration said the diversion of funds was in support of \"higher priority items\" that were \"necessary in the national interest,\" according to the notice transmitted to Congress. It continues: \"[The Department of Homeland Security] has identified areas along the southern border of the United States that are being used by individuals, groups, and transnational criminal organizations as drug smuggling corridors, and determined that the construction of additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the United States border is necessary in order to impede and deny drug smuggling activities.\" The move drew bipartisan criticism, including from the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry. \"The wall should be funded, but the funding must come through the Department of Homeland Security rather than diverting critical military resources that are needed and in law,\" Thornberry said in a statement. He added that Congress must act and is weighing how to proceed. \"Congress has the constitutional responsibility to determine how defense dollars are spent,\" he said. \"The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress's constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action. I will be working with my colleagues to determine the appropriate steps to take.\" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the president of being \"obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise\" while accusing the administration in a tweet of \"stealing billions\" from the Department of Defense. Today\u2019s reprogramming request confirms once again that the President is obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security. This admin has already stolen billions from the DoD for the President\u2019s vanity wall, and today they are doubling down. Meanwhile, Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, the ranking member on the House Committee on Appropriations, championed the President's decision. She blamed Democrats for failing to work on securing the border, which in turn \"forced the president to redirect funds.\" \"I unequivocally support President Trump's efforts to secure our nation's borders and support our men and women in uniform.  Democrats have refused to work with us on border security, which has forced the President to redirect funds from other defense programs in the short term in order to secure the southern border,\" she said in a statement.

Illegal border crossings have plummeted as the Trump administration has extended a policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    Elliot Spagat/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People work at a portion of border wall which is under construction in Yuma, Ariz. Illegal border crossings have plummeted as the Trump administration has extended a policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in the U.S. Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said the Department of Defense was \"committed\" to helping Homeland Security to construct fences and roads, and install lighting to thwart drug smuggling. He said the $3.8 billion will build more miles of barrier \"to protect our borders.\" \"Last month we received a new request from the Department of Homeland Security asking for assistance in blocking drug-smuggling corridors on Federal land along the southern border of the United States,\" Mitchell said. \"In response, the Secretary of Defense authorized support of $3.8B to build approximately 177 miles of fencing that will help to protect our borders. We will continue to support DHS and other agencies as needed to keep our homeland is secure.\" Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York disagree. They issued a joint statement that said Congress, not the executive branch, has the power of the purse, adding that it's \"a power that cannot be nullified so the President can fulfill an outrageous campaign promise.\" \"This latest theft of nearly $4 billion in military funds represents another of President Trump's broken promises to our servicemembers, especially our brave sailors who he assured would receive funding for urgently needed, state-of-the-art ships,\" the press release said. This is not the first time the Trump administration has redirected funds from the Pentagon to go toward a wall along the southern border. Last March the Defense Department announced it would shift $1 billion from a military personnel account in order to pay for a 57-mile section of fencing. The administration said at the time the dollars became available after recruiting goals of some service branches came up short of expectations. The border wall has been controversial since then-candidate Trump made building a barrier a central pillar of his 2016 presidential campaign. He promised back then the wall would come at no cost to U.S. taxpayers and that Mexico would fully fund the project, which it has not. In a status report last month, NPR's John Burnett noted that U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is overseeing the barrier construction, said the price tag for project has exceeded $11 billion dollars, making it the most expensive wall of its kind in the world.

Bernie Sanders takes the stage during a primary night event on Tuesday in Manchester, N.H. His victory, projected by The Associated Press, comes in another close race with Pete Buttigieg. Updated at 10:20 a.m ET Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled off a narrow victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, providing a jolt of energy to his front-of-the-pack status by holding off Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind. The close race means the crowded Democratic presidential field remains fiercely contested, with Buttigieg just barely ahead of Sanders in the national delegate count. Each candidate is pushing a vastly different vision for America's future and offers contrasting paths for the Democratic Party. With 95% of precincts reporting, Sanders captured 25.7% of the vote. Buttigieg claimed 24.4% and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar brought in a surprising 19.8% of the vote. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren brought in 9.2% of the vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden was the fifth-place finisher, clocking about  8.4% of the vote with nearly all the returns in. Speaking to supporters in Manchester late Tuesday, Sanders said his win marked \"the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.\" Sanders was ahead throughout the night but faced a close contest from Buttigieg. His victory in New Hampshire, along with his virtual tie with Buttigieg in last week's still-muddled Iowa caucuses, sets up a contest between the liberal and more moderate wings of the Democratic Party. Loading... Klobuchar, campaigning in the moderate lane, came in third. She was buoyed by a strong showing in last Friday's debate and sagging support for Biden. Initially his party's front-runner, Biden finished in fifth place and received far less than the 15% he needed to get any delegates for the nomination. The Minnesota Democrat boasted that she raised roughly $2.5 million since that debate and that undecided voters flocked to her final campaign events across the state. She needed a strong showing after a fifth-place finish in Iowa, which borders her home state and where she spent a lot of time arguing she was capable of winning in a battleground state. Klobuchar was quick to tout her third-place showing as a win because she exceeded expectations. Even before the results were announced, her campaign announced a seven-figure ad buy for the Feb. 22 Democratic contest in Nevada. Buttigieg argued his second top-tier showing in a row \"has shown that we are here to stay.\" He pushed back, as he has for weeks, arguing that those who do not back the same progressive policies that Sanders proposes make up a large contingent in the party. \"Most Americans don't see where they fit in that polarized vision, and we can't defeat the most divisive president in modern American history by tearing down anybody who doesn't agree with us 100% of the time,\" Buttigieg said. The former mayor faces an uphill climb in the upcoming nominating states, where a more diverse electorate will weigh in. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Buttigieg at 5.5% in South Carolina and 7% in Nevada. Warren, Sanders' primary opponent on the far left, ended with a New Hampshire performance that was a disappointment to her supporters. Her fourth-place finish is on track to provide her no delegates from the state. Four years ago, Sanders won the New Hampshire primary easily, beating Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points. In the days leading up to this year's contest, Sanders told voters that the win helped legitimize his progressive platform of \"Medicare for All,\" a $15 an hour minimum wage and free public college \u2014 all issues viewed at the time by many Democrats as outside the mainstream. Many Democrats have now embraced that agenda, and Sanders appears to have a path to be the party's candidate for the White House, even if his New Hampshire margin of victory was far below his 2016 win. But with Buttigieg and Klobuchar as the second and third top finishers in the primary, the tension inside the party about whether a progressive or more pragmatic agenda would appeal to voters in a general election against President Trump will continue. Alluding to the divisions in the party, Sanders said Tuesday night, \"We are going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.\" Sanders predicted he would win the next two contests in Nevada and South Carolina. His success raising money among a loyal base of supporters with small-dollar donations is a strength over many of his rivals. Facing a poor showing, Biden decided not to sit out election night in New Hampshire and moved onto South Carolina, where he addressed his supporters in New Hampshire via a livestream. He vowed to win contests in Nevada and especially South Carolina, where the Biden campaign believes his strong support from African American voters will deliver a victory. \"We're going to be back in New Hampshire,\" the former vice president said. \"We're going to be back there to defeat Donald Trump in November, elect Jeanne Shaheen the next senator again, and up and down the ticket. So you're not getting rid of us.\" NPR's Elena Moore contributed to this report",

New Hampshire is expected to decide the first primary winner of the 2020 election Tuesday night, just over a week since the Iowa caucuses left Americans confused about the process and without a declared winner. After winning the New Hampshire primary in 2016 and performing well last week in Iowa, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a clear front-runner in the Granite State and continues to dominate in the state polls. Sanders is closely trailed by former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who experienced a post-Iowa surge in the New Hampshire polls after coming in first in the Iowa caucuses last week by just 0.1%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are also vying for a good showing \u2014 but their poll numbers show them around 10 points lower on average than Sanders and Buttigieg. That said, similar to Iowa, New Hampshire voters could always throw a curveball \u2014 as a significant amount may still be undecided. A Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll from Jan. 21 found that almost 50% of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters say they could change their minds or stay undecided.

MICHEL MARTIN (HOST): Senator Bernie Sanders has an early lead as the first returns come in from New Hampshire. From NPR News, this is live Special Coverage. I'm Michel Martin. RACHEL MARTIN (HOST): And I'm Rachel Martin. Polls in New Hampshire have closed, and the nation's first primary results are arriving. M MARTIN: That's right. After Iowa's muddled outcome and much finger-pointing, tonight, New Hampshire promises to deliver actual results. And the candidates have made their case. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PETE BUTTIGIEG (DEM PRES CAND): Remember, mayors have to get things done. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA, SEN/DEM PRES CAND): People are counting on us to get this right. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT, SEN/DEM PRES CAND): To create an economy that works for all of us. ANDREW YANG (DEM PRES CAND): This is how we rebalance the most extreme economy in the history of the world. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN, SEN/DEM PRES CAND): If you are tired of the extremes, you have a home with me. JOE BIDEN (DEM PRES CAND): Let's get up and take back this country and take it back now. M MARTIN: Democrats are vying for a victory they can take to Nevada, South Carolina and onto Super Tuesday. R MARTIN: Stay with us. It is live Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. And we do have a call to make. We can announce that President Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire Republican primary. This is breaking news. The Associated Press is projecting, again, Donald Trump will win, as predicted, the Republican primary in the state of New Hampshire. And we should just lay the land here. This is a - the country's first primary. This comes after a very complicated Iowa caucus, where things were too close to call between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. And so, Michel, a lot of people have that in the back of their mind as they are - as they went to the polls today, trying to decipher what that Iowa decision or non-decision meant as they make their choice. M MARTIN: And we're going to try to make sense of it here - and Rachel and I. We are - suggest - it's been suggested that we tell you that we're not actually cousins, but we do claim each other. R MARTIN: (Laughter). M MARTIN: But we do claim each other. R MARTIN: Two Martins are better than one. M MARTIN: Two Martins are better than one. And we are joined here - we are going to try to make sense of this evening. We are joined by a large array of our colleagues who all have something to contribute. We have Domenico Montanaro, senior political editor and correspondent, with us. We have Ron Elving, NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent with us. We have Danielle Kurtzleben, political correspondent, with us. And, of course, Mara Liasson, NPR national political correspondent is also with us. And we also have an array of correspondents in the field, and we're going to hear from all of them this evening. But we're going to start with Domenico. Couple questions for you, Domenico. First of all, the results are just starting to trickle in, of course. So I'm just curious about what those early results tell us, what the exit polls told us earlier today. And then how is today different from last week? A lot has changed. DOMENICO MONTANARO (BYLINE): A lot has changed. Not everything has changed. But we've got about 9% of the vote in right now. And tracking right now - we have the top three candidates as Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and, perhaps surprisingly for some and not for others, Amy Klobuchar in third, with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden following after that. So, you know, like I said, 9% of the vote in here. But that's kind of what we expected, that Bernie Sanders would be the person who was the favorite tonight. Pete Buttigieg had been on an upswing after that virtual tie in Iowa. But Amy Klobuchar, the thing that's really helping her here and what we saw in the exit poll data was half of people said that they decided within the last few days, in fact, and that half of them said that the debate was very important in their decision that they made. And Amy Klobuchar got a lot of plaudits for how she performed in that debate. You know, you had Joe Biden, the former vice president, immediately off the top essentially say he was going to take a hit in New Hampshire. And I think a lot of the moderates whom were thinking about him eventually said, well, let's go with somebody who actually could win or wants to win here. And that's what we're seeing. And we'll see if this tracks in this direction. But there's a clear distinction between the top three and then the rest of the field. And you wonder what that's going to mean. I mean, going into Iowa, we knew Sanders was the favorite there. Pete Buttigieg, we weren't expecting to necessarily be at the top, but we saw big crowds of his in the days before that. And you expected Joe Biden to do fairly well. That didn't happen. He's got this quote-unquote \"firewall\" in South Carolina where he does very well with black voters. But can he actually get to that point? It's weeks away. There - and there's already polling indicating that he's having some of his support with black voters already eaten away by someone who's not even competing yet in these first four races, Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who we'll have to talk about because he's spent over $350 million of his own money on advertising. R MARTIN: So speaking of Joe Biden and his exodus from New Hampshire to the great state of South Carolina, we have our own - NPR's Juana Summers is in South Carolina. She has been on the ground there reporting for the last several days. And now she is there to witness the vice president making this quite dramatic pivot. Juana, what are you hearing there? JUANA SUMMERS (BYLINE): Hey, y'all. Yes, people are starting to file in for this event. We are in Columbia, S.C., where Joe Biden is expected to kick off his South Carolina campaign here. People are elated here. They are not concerned about not-as-strong finishes by the former vice president in the states of Iowa and what we might see tonight in New Hampshire. They say that doesn't, in fact - that does not affect what they feel on the ground here in South Carolina. They say that Joe Biden cannot take the state's voters for granted, that he cannot take his strength of black supporters for granted. But they feel like he will have a strong showing here tonight. And they're glad to see him here. They're not really interested in talking about New Hampshire very much. R MARTIN: And what are you hearing about candidates who may be lower down? SUMMERS: Absolutely. So we were just able to confirm that Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who ran on the message of having a universal basic income or a freedom dividend, is ending his campaign tonight. He is someone that had banked his fortunes in this race on a strong showing in New Hampshire. He spent a lot of time there, but is now saying that he does not have a path to the nomination, his campaign staffers telling us that he did not feel that he could continue to take folks' money, that it was simply time to end his race, and he will do that tonight in New Hampshire, where I hear he will be addressing supporters. R MARTIN: OK. NPR's Juana Summers there in South Carolina with this news that Andrew Yang has ended his bid to become president of the United States, or at least the Democratic nominee. We are going to move over to NPR's Scott Detrow, who is with the Sanders campaign. Scott, what do you know? SCOTT DETROW (BYLINE): Well, we're seeing something that's a bit different than last week, and that is supporters here in Manchester reacting to precincts reporting. There are actual vote totals to respond to, as opposed to an Iowa last week. And so far, it is great news for the Sanders campaign. He is currently in first place with about 10% of precincts reporting, about a thousand votes and some change ahead of Pete Buttigieg. So everyone in the Sanders campaign is feeling good. As Domenico was talking about, you have seen this real traffic jam, if you will, in the moderate lane of this primary. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders has been really unopposed with his progressive agenda. He has been holding big rally after big rally. I was at an event last night where 8,000 people were there to cheer him and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and others. And they had a band playing, The Strokes. So there's just been a lot of energy in this campaign. They feel very good about New Hampshire. And looking at the map going forward, in contrast to Joe Biden's campaign, they feel like they have a lot of strength with Latino voters and union rank-and-file in Nevada. And those are two key ways to win the Nevada caucuses. R MARTIN: All right, Scott, we'll look forward to catching up with you as the evening goes on. M MARTIN: And now we're going to go to Asma Khalid, NPR political correspondent. And she is with the Buttigieg headquarters at the Buttigieg campaign. Asma, what are you seeing? ASMA KHALID (BYLINE): Hey there. I guess, similar to what Scott Detrow just described, there is a lot of enthusiasm in this crowd, just in part because we're actually getting real-time results. They're playing up on a giant screen here at the Buttigieg party. And so every time we see some results that look good for Pete Buttigieg, you're just actually getting real reaction from the crowd, which is so fundamentally different than that sort of very unclear night we had in Iowa. M MARTIN: Asma, just briefly, tell us a little bit about the crowd there. KHALID: So, I mean, it's large. It's been filling in. We're in - at a community college here in Nashua, which is near the border with Massachusetts. A lot of people here, you know, I asked them, what does success look like for Pete Buttigieg? And interestingly, people are telling me, you know, he doesn't need to win this state. People are reminding me that Bernie Sanders did really well in 2016. So they feel like a solid second-place finish means that Pete Buttigieg did well, and they'll take that as a win. M MARTIN: And before we let you go for now, Asma - you're going to be with us throughout the evening - you've also spent some time with Senator Klobuchar's campaign, the Minnesota senator who's, as Domenico just told us, has kind of been on the march there. What can you tell us about that? KHALID: I did. And I will say a lot of people told me that they were torn between Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar. I was out with her yesterday at a campaign event in Exeter, N.H., and, really, it was amazing to me. She was able to completely fill the venue. There was an overflow crowd. And she seemed really comfortable. She was making jokes. The crowd was eating it up. And, you know, people came up to me afterwards to tell me that they were sold on her message. You know, the big question I have, though, is, does she have the kind of infrastructure and resources to go somewhere after New Hampshire? And, I mean, I think that that is a challenge when you're looking at a campaign like Bernie Sanders, that has already begun to campaign in a number of Super Tuesday states. M MARTIN: That's NPR's Asma Khalid at the Buttigieg headquarters in New Hampshire. R MARTIN: OK. I'm going to bring in another voice to our conversation. He is Howard Dean. He is a former presidential candidate, also former governor of Vermont, former DNC chair. You have so many titles. HOWARD DEAN (D-VT, FORMER GOV): I know. They're former, former and former. R MARTIN: (Laughter) There's so many. Current wise person in our conversation to break down what we're seeing here. Thank you for being with us tonight. I'm going to start off with a question about Joe Biden. What did you make of his decision to punt essentially on New Hampshire and go to South Carolina early? DEAN: You can kind of see it - that coming. So if you see it coming, then why not do what he's doing? South Carolina is the last stand for him. You know, this is not the last stand. I mean, former vice president of the United States of Barack Obama's presidency. So - but... R MARTIN: But you think he has to win in South Carolina. DEAN: I think he has to win or come in second, and he certainly can't come in third or fourth. R MARTIN: And Amy Klobuchar. DEAN: That's a big plus for her. I saw that coming because there are some early - some late polls in New Hampshire that are pretty reliable. And she had a great debate performance. And it looks like - we - by the way, this is much too early to start calling this because we don't know where these precincts are coming from. Some are coming from Manchester. And Manchester and Concord are really important. Manchester is a predictable, more blue-collar place. And Concord is more highly educated, liberal place. You're going to see a lot of Sanders votes, I suspect, in Concord. And in Manchester, it'll be all over the place. So it's a long way to go. R MARTIN: You think it's going be close. DEAN: Well, yeah. I think - I mean, Bernie looks like he's in pretty good shape right now. And I think it'll be close between Klobuchar and Buttigieg for second. And we'll wait. But we have a long way to go. I mean, we've only got - what? - 15,000 votes in or something like that. So we've got a long way to go here. R MARTIN: NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, what do you see right now that strikes you? RON ELVING (BYLINE): Struck by, I think, the location of some of these results that are coming in. Many of the venues around the state that went very heavily for Bernie Sanders in 2016 are still for Sanders but at a much, much reduced percentage of the vote. Now, in 2016, there were only two significant candidates. But the other significant candidate that Bernie was running against was Hillary Clinton, who was at that time considered the front-runner for the nomination, did win the nomination and did go on to win the popular vote in November - so not a negligible opponent. And yet Bernie then in 2016 got 61% of the vote here in New Hampshire. He's not going to be anywhere near that. He's not going to be near half that. And in many of these venues that supported him very heavily, his vote is being somewhat dispersed with some other candidates and surprisingly not so much to Elizabeth Warren who is supposedly the great, great challenge to Bernie Sanders on the left among progressives. And she, last summer and fall for a while, looked like she was really going to overtake him. Then he had a heart attack, and it looked like it was a done deal and she was totally going to take over for the progressives. And then instead, he got a couple of stents put in and came roaring back and got new life in his campaign, in more ways than one, and suddenly was the old Bernie again. And now we see him winning New Hampshire but not getting the same vote or anywhere near the same vote that he got four years ago. R MARTIN: We should just say we still don't have results. He is expected to do well, but we still don't know. M MARTIN: Governor Dean, this is Michel Martin. I wanted to ask you a question as a person who's been out there on the campaign trail. There's what the polls say, and then there's what the voters say when they actually see these candidates perform. Your assessment of Joe Biden on the campaign trail, I mean, one of the things we keep hearing from Domenico, for example, is that people are changing their minds when they see him and not in a good way. What's your assessment about it? DEAN: See, I think a lot of people don't understand what's happening inside the Democratic Party. We have a youth revolution going on inside the party, and it started in 2017 in Virginia. It was certainly accelerated in 2018. If you look at the - look at the pictures on the front of the Virginia statehouse and on the Capitol, they are younger, darker and much more female. That is what the Democratic Party looks like. And they are now taking over. Now, they're probably not going to go all the way to the top and - although they could - Buttigieg is 37 years old - and take over the whole thing at once. But the footprint of that generation is - that's what's driving all of this. R MARTIN: You told me on stage at an event, Governor, not even a year ago that that was a good thing, that you want... DEAN: It's a great thing. R MARTIN: You were tired of people of a certain... DEAN: Right. R MARTIN: ...Age. DEAN: Well, so Michel asked me the question about Biden. The problem is he's caught in this generation. They like Joe Biden. They just want to do it their way. R MARTIN: Mara, you have a question for the governor. M MARTIN: Yeah, I have a question for Governor Dean. R MARTIN: Very short. MARA LIASSON (BYLINE): I agree that, you know - that the new energy is with young voters. But in Iowa, we didn't see a huge surge. We saw just a 30% uptick in 18-to-29-year-olds, but no other young group. R MARTIN: Shortest of answers. LIASSON: The early exits don't show a big surge in young voters here. So where are they? DEAN: That's, you know - that's a very good point. I think they're actually divided. That's the problem. They're divided between Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg. LIASSON: So they're not necessarily left if they're young. DEAN: No, they're absolutely not. This is another story the media misses. Our party is actually moving towards the center. R MARTIN: OK. This is... DEAN: When young - look at all the 40 people... R MARTIN: This is an important topic, and we're going to pick it up. DEAN: Right. R MARTIN: OK? DEAN: All right. R MARTIN: We're going to take a break. You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) R MARTIN: OK. As we were saying, Governor Dean was just talking about the fact that there is a fracturing of the vote. DEAN: Yeah. LIASSON: The young vote. R MARTIN: The young vote. DEAN: There is a fracturing of the vote. People think somehow that the younger people are going to be more left. They're not. They're what we would call very left on racial issues - on diversity, gay rights. This is the civil rights issue of their generation. I mean, of course, and the environment. But on money, they're not. And, you know, many of us have millennial kids. They're not. They're more conservative. They went through 2008. M MARTIN: Well, speaking of conservative, former Vermont Governor Dean, we're going to ask you to pause for a second... DEAN: All right. M MARTIN: ...To bring in a colleague, a current governor, the governor of New Hampshire, whose state is holding its primary today. And that is Governor Chris Sununu. Governor, thank you so much for joining us as well. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH, GOV): Absolutely. Good evening. M MARTIN: And I just want to - first of all, I wanted to ask you about your decision to hold the primary. A number of states have - a number of Republican parties have canceled their state primaries, owing to the dominance of President Trump. You made a different decision. Why is that? SUNUNU: Well, because that's the process, because everybody, especially here in New Hampshire, we really cherish the idea that anybody can run, anybody should run that wants to run. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take name I.D. Everyone's got a shot. So, you know, doing away with the primary is the absolute last thing we would do here in New Hampshire. M MARTIN: And President Trump lost your state by a couple thousand votes in 2016. What do you think's going to be different this time? SUNUNU: In November? He's going to win. And the reason is because - not just wishful thinking, but when you look at the economic success New Hampshire's had - it's had this amazing resurgence. We're the strongest state in the Northeast for business. We're the strongest state for millennials to move into. We're the strongest state for workforce. So this isn't by accident. And since 2017, 2018, the state started really charging ahead. And when you have the lowest poverty rate in the country and one of the lowest unemployment rates, it's economic success that creates opportunity for families. And they vote their pocketbook here in New Hampshire. M MARTIN: I was going to... SUNUNU: They vote in the interest of themselves, their neighbors and their communities. M MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that, Governor, because, you know, that has been sort of the mantra for years now. It's the economy, stupid. And people have long said that presidential elections are essentially a referendum on the economy. This is a very different president with a very different messaging, a very polarizing figure, very alienating to key sectors of the electorate. Do you think that makes a difference? SUNUNU: Well, sure. Look. How he talks definitely makes a difference. But at the end of the day, I still believe that the fundamentals of what people do in that ballot box hold true. I mean, they really do. And people want someone as gruff as he can be, to be sure. That is - you know, it's truthful. That's what Bernie does here, right? What you see is what you get. And you may not like how it's presented to be sure, but what you see is what you get. And there's something very genuine and authentic about that, which is why Trump did so well in 2016, and I think why he's going to continue to do well in 2020. M MARTIN: I mean, he's not known to sort of hold his tongue. Did he have any problem with your - holding the primary? SUNUNU: Did he have any problems with... M MARTIN: Did he have any - did he take issue with the primary going forward when a number of other states have canceled theirs? SUNUNU: No. No, not that I know of. M MARTIN: He was fine. SUNUNU: No, no. Yeah, he never mentioned anything to me. M MARTIN: Oh. All right. That is the governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu. Governor, thank you so much for joining us. SUNUNU: Sure. M MARTIN: And you're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO'S \"CIRRUS\") R MARTIN: The polls have officially closed in New Hampshire. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News with Michel Martin. I'm Rachel Martin. No call in the Democratic contest yet, but Bernie Sanders has a comfortable lead. He's followed by Pete Buttigieg, then Amy Klobuchar. Meanwhile, Joe Biden saw the writing on the wall for his bad chances in New Hampshire and he already left for South Carolina. Earlier today on MSNBC, Biden was managing expectations against Sanders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We got to see what goes from here. I mean, as I said, I didn't mince any words. I think I'm an underdog here. And Bernie won this with 20 points last time. He's got a next-door neighbor advantage. And he's got a real enthusiasm going here. And - but I still feel good. R MARTIN: Amy Klobuchar needs to do well in New Hampshire. I'm joined in studio by a whole host of analysts, including NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Danielle, let's talk a little bit about Amy Klobuchar. She's enjoying what her campaign, anyway, is characterizing as some momentum. How real is it? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN (BYLINE): That's a great question. I mean, listen. She did reasonably well in Iowa, which for her campaign is to say that she exceeded expectations. And that is again what we may be seeing here in New Hampshire. And, you know, listen. When you talk to a lot of voters - I talked to a lot of Iowa voters who told me - who had Amy Klobuchar as their second or third choice - who said, you know, I like her well enough. I just might go caucus for so-and-so. And it seems like she has taken hold. Now, that said, I don't know how or where she goes from New Hampshire. She is not polling very well among black voters, for example, which could hurt her in South Carolina. R MARTIN: I don't think she has money, right? How much money does she have? KURTZLEBEN: Well, I mean, that's a great question. She may well have picked up some fundraising after Iowa. But again, it depends on how quickly she is burning it because she just did have a new ad buy. We saw some new ads that came out for her in Nevada today. So she - whatever money she is taking in, she may well be spending it. So the question is how much she is able to capitalize upon whatever energy there is in the, quote-unquote, \"moderate lane.\" Now, that said, I think the whole framing of this in terms of lanes is a bit overplayed because voters do not necessarily think of this ideologically. R MARTIN: OK. We understand that Elizabeth Warren is actually speaking at this moment. Let's listen in. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) R MARTIN: We've been listening to Elizabeth Warren addressing supporters in New Hampshire. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben - Danielle, you and I were talking right before we went to Elizabeth Warren. Can you just pick up on the Warren campaign - where she is in this moment, why is she talking so early at this point in the night? What do you make of that? KURTZLEBEN: Well, one thing I'll say is that the unity message that she was pushing very hard there, that is a thing that she started really pushing in Iowa in about the last week, give or take, before the Iowa caucuses. She added a line to her stump speech, which, you know, those stump speeches generally don't really change much throughout the campaign cycle. She added a line thanking explicitly everyone else in the race on the Democratic side, saying everyone else who's in this, everybody else who has dropped out, I would like to thank you all for your contributions to this race. You have made our party stronger, et cetera, et cetera - a pretty blatant call for positivity and all of us come together and defeat Donald Trump. And that wasn't something she was explicitly pushing before. And it's a thing that voters will tell you, I don't like negativity, I really want someone who's positive. And you can see that she was trying to capitalize on that. R MARTIN: Mara. LIASSON: I think, as a campaign strategy, it puts her in the position that if things get really ugly, if you have a kind of Bloomberg-Sanders fight - you're a racist billionaire, you're a misogynist socialist - you know, if things get really bad, she could be, you know, that alternative. But I think the Warren campaign is one of the biggest mysteries of this whole episode. I mean, she started out universally considered to have the best stump speech. She explained her plans in common-sense language. She had a great campaign. She was really organized. She was kind of a thought leader in the party on policy. But she made some - I'm curious about what Governor Dean thinks - she made some big strategic errors that seemed to have hurt her. One of them was deciding she had to cleave completely to Bernie Sanders and not let any daylight between her and him and... R MARTIN: Was that a mistake? LIASSON: ...Picked up his health care plan and tried to make it work on paper, something he never felt he had to do. R MARTIN: Was that a mistake, Governor Dean? DEAN: You know, I don't really know. I've thought about this a lot because she's an incredibly attractive candidate and terrific person as a human being. So I don't - I'm surprised at all this. I don't really know. It's almost as if the left wing of the party decided they had to make a choice someplace along the line, and they chose Bernie. Now, we'll see. I think your analysis is correct. If this really gets ugly, she's positioning herself so that she can come back in and save it. I - you know, I'm going to say something that I wouldn't have said for the last 11 primaries that I've followed since 1980. There are going to be six tickets out of New Hampshire. And one... LIASSON: That's a very muddled race. DEAN: And one of them is not on the ballot, which is Mike Bloomberg. So we are going to get a lot of this sorted out. It's inconceivable to me that all six are going to have the money to go to California. But I think you're going to see a couple possibly drop out in - of the six I'm talking about - in South Carolina and maybe one or two more. But I think you may see five or six candidates go to California. If Klobuchar continues strong - she doesn't have much money now, but she may raise some. And the key thing for Elizabeth is going to be money. When her money dries up, if it dries up before California, that's going to be a problem. R MARTIN: I want to bring in NPR's Asma Khalid, who is with the Buttigieg campaign. And Asma has also paid close attention to the Warren campaign over many months. Asma, what are you hearing there from the Buttigieg camp, who feels - I imagine rather secure tonight? KHALID: Yeah. I mean, people here feel really good about his performance. You know, people have told me that they felt a solid second-place finish would be good. They acknowledge that Bernie Sanders, they feel - one woman said she - that she thought Bernie Sanders sort of had a head start in this race overall. People knew him, and he had such a strong performance where he beat Hillary Clinton by roughly 20 points in 2016. You know, but to your point about Elizabeth Warren, I think what's really interesting to me here is, you know, one voter I met said he had really been considering Elizabeth Warren early on. He liked her plans. He ultimately decided to go with Pete Buttigieg. He liked his pragmatism. And I think that what we saw - you know, to Howard Dean's point is that I think that the progressive left ultimately made a choice. And we see this with the endorsements that progressive groups made. They started to tilt more towards Bernie Sanders. We saw this with many of the endorsements he got from members of The Squad as well. You know, early on, you go to Netroots Nation, the progressives were torn between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But somewhere along the line, they largely chose Bernie Sanders. And then you talked about the college-educated white voters who Elizabeth Warren had also been heavily courting, many of them opted to go with Pete Buttigieg. And then she was really left with a very small coalition at that point. M MARTIN: Asma, this is Michel. I wanted to ask you, why? Why do you think that is? What are the voters telling you about why, when faced with the actual choice of Klobuchar or, really, Buttigieg, people went with Buttigieg instead of Warren? They seem like very different candidates. KHALID: Yeah. I mean, I can speak first, I guess, more clearly even to the progressives, why the progressives opted for Bernie Sanders, and that I've done a lot of reporting on. And it seems that many people felt that he had been the original voice in the progressive movement. He had been advocating for these positions for years. They felt that Elizabeth Warren had come to some of these positions later. And they believed that he would fight tooth and nail. You know, I thought it was so interesting. I talked to one progressive voice the other day at a Bernie Sanders rally. And he told me that he thought Elizabeth Warren's \"Medicare for All\" plan was realistic. It was likely the way things would go down. But he says I did not like that she put it out there on the negotiating table. And he feels like if you negotiate and you start giving stuff up, then you're going to be left with very little. And I thought that was just such candor to hear from. You know, when we talk about Pete Buttigieg - yes, and Elizabeth Warren - they are different candidates, very much to the point. But I think that they both courted sort of your very elite college-educated voter. I mean, people do tell me here that they like Pete Buttigieg's intelligence. They like the way he speaks. And that's a lot of what I heard for Elizabeth Warren as well. But people here, at least in the Buttigieg camp, found that some of her policy positions, especially some of the things that she voiced early on around health care, Medicare for All, they felt were just too far left of where they are. M MARTIN: And Danielle Kurtzleben would like to jump in here. KURTZLEBEN: I just want to add one thing on Pete Buttigieg. I do get the sense that, in terms of he and Elizabeth Warren sort of fighting for the same demographic - the white, very educated demographic - Pete Buttigieg very much benefits from Warren and Sanders being in this race because Pete Buttigieg gets this reputation of being in the centrist lane. Pete Buttigieg is still a pretty progressive guy in terms of his policies. He at one point was for Medicare for All, then he backed off of that. LIASSON: Well, mandatory Medicare for All. Let's be clear. There's mandatory Medicare for All and then the opt-in. KURTZLEBEN: All right. He at one point he was for single-payer. But my point is he also - he may not want free college for everyone. He wants free college for 80% of people. That's still a really big change to the structure of the American economy right there. So if he is seen as the practical alternative to Elizabeth Warren, he benefits from Elizabeth Warren being somewhat more left of him. ELVING: You know, we could also say about this arc... M MARTIN: Ron Elving. ELVING: ...The arc of Elizabeth Warren's campaign. We have a very long campaign now. It starts way back in the odd-numbered year before the election year. And she started quite strong. And then she seemed to be plateaued. And then she started talking about just how much money it would cost to do the health care plan that she and Bernie were talking about. Bernie didn't feel - as Mara said - didn't feel a responsibility to do that. She did. That was the essence of Elizabeth Warren to feel that responsibility. And it hurt her, and she never got her momentum quite back. M MARTIN: Lots more to come, more speeches, more analysis, more results. You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. DEAN: Anybody know what just... R MARTIN: We are awaiting results. We are watching them closely, we are with former Governor Howard Dean, who is anxious to see the results, as indicated just now. So we are expecting results on a rolling basis tonight. We already have a good indication of who is leading. We can report that Andrew Yang has dropped out of the race at this point. And right now it is a contest between Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg - Amy Klobuchar is polling quite well in this moment, and she needs a win here. NPR's Domenico Montanaro is watching all of this. Domenico, can you just get us up to speed? Where are we right now? MONTANARO: Yeah. Right now, we have just shy of about a fifth of the vote in. And you have Bernie Sanders with a bit of a lead, 29%, Pete Buttigieg second with about 23 and Amy Klobuchar third at about 20% of the vote. Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden follow after that. One thing, though, to note here - this is a delegate race. And only candidates who get about 15% of the vote, statewide and in congressional districts, are going to get any delegates at all. So Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar look like the only ones who are actually going to net some delegates out of this race. And the more that adds up, the more these other candidates are going to have a very difficult time catching up. M MARTIN: And we can report that another candidate has decided to terminate his campaign. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet has dropped out, joining Andrew Yang in terminating his campaign today. And now we're going to go to Jim Donchess. He's the mayor of Nashua, N.H. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. JIM DONCHESS (NASHUA, NH MAYOR): Well, thank you for having me. M MARTIN: And you've come out for Pete Buttigieg, who's having a very good night. DONCHESS: He is. M MARTIN: And you've said that, as a fellow mayor, you know why Pete Buttigieg is qualified for the job. What do you say to those who criticize his inexperience? DONCHESS: Well, as a mayor, I know that in a city like South Bend, the mayor has to get results for people. And you can see that across the city of South Bend, where there's been an incredible renaissance. He understands communities like Nashua and other communities across the country, understands the needs and the desires of ordinary people. And we need really to turn the page on all of the fighting in Washington and find someone who can get results on the major challenges that have only gotten worse in the last four years - on climate change, on health care, inequality, infrastructure. And Pete - Mayor Pete is the person who can get that done. M MARTIN: Well, there is another mayor who's put his hat into the ring, Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Did you ever consider him? DONCHESS: Well, he didn't run in New Hampshire. And I think Pete is the right guy because he - they're now chanting for Pete, so I am having trouble hearing you. But... M MARTIN: OK. DONCHESS: ...Pete really understands communities, at least like ours. He has a vision for the future that can move the country forward. M MARTIN: That is the mayor of Nashua, N.H., Jim Donchess. Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for talking to us and hope we'll talk again when we have a little bit more time. DONCHESS: All right. Thanks a lot. M MARTIN: You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO'S \"KERALA\") M MARTIN: Bernie Sanders holds a solid lead in New Hampshire. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. The polls have closed in the Granite State. In second place right now is Pete Buttigieg. And after that, it's Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and, in the single digits, Joe Biden. He has already left the state, in fact. And another development - entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who's hovering around 3% tonight in New Hampshire, just dropped out of the race. Here he was on stage earlier this hour. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) R MARTIN: We are going to turn, at this moment, to Josh Rogers of New Hampshire Public Radio. Josh, how's it going? JOSH ROGERS (BYLINE): Well, how are you? R MARTIN: I'm fine. Josh, where are you right now? ROGERS: I am at a Joe Biden-less Joe Biden primary night session in a hotel bar. R MARTIN: (Laughter) So how's that going? ROGERS: Well, you know, it's slowly filled up. It's full of a lot of firefighters, union members, hardcore Biden supporters. And you know, the mood was a bit funereal earlier, but, you know, people are drinking now and it's a little bit more festive. (LAUGHTER) ROGERS: But, you know, there's a - there - people are trying to put the best face on a situation that's obviously pretty grim as far as New Hampshire goes to the former vice president. R MARTIN: Right. So were people there miffed that the vice president just up and left? ROGERS: Not the ones that are showing up at the party. These are people who are - essentially, two of one that I've talked to are saying, you know, this race goes on, New Hampshire and Iowa just a few delegates, they may not be representative of the Democratic electorate as a whole - the kinds of arguments that Joe Biden himself has been making, more or less. And that, you know, former Governor John Lynch, one of Joe Biden's top supporters here, said, you know, Joe did all he could in New Hampshire, and it was time to go to South Carolina. So, you know, that's - you know, he's always indicated that he believes the vice president has - that the first four contests were really - should be viewed in totality. But you know, it's hard to be seen as viable if you're not doing better than he has in Iowa and how he appears to be doing in New Hampshire. M MARTIN: Josh, this is Michel Martin. The governor said that Joe Biden had done all he could in New Hampshire. From your - from where you sit, do you think that's true? ROGERS: Well, he certainly gave a go of it. I mean, I think it's worth remembering that, you know, Joe Biden running for president on his own has never been terribly successful. He dropped out in '88 before any contest. He never made it to New Hampshire in 2008. And you know, while he got elected in Delaware many, many times, you know, there's little in his record that suggests he's necessarily that great a presidential candidate. You know, he's not an adjunct to Barack Obama. And as much as he tried to make the argument that what he was really going to do is further gains made by, as he like to put it, the Obama-Biden administration, you know, he's running on his own. M MARTIN: Can I go back to Governor Dean for a minute on this? Because - and, Josh, if you stay with us. A lot of people who've been out in the field have made the point that Joe Biden has just not been a very good candidate. And Governor Dean, you made the point that there are actually just sort of structural issues within the Democratic Party that are more relevant here, that there is just a new wave of people who have different issues, different concerns. So it's not really so much his failures as a candidate as it is these other sort of forces within the party. But is Joe Biden really an effective candidate in 2020? DEAN: Well, I think that remains to be seen. So far, he has not been. But we don't know. I think that Josh's point about going to South Carolina - and those are two very different states. I mean, they're virtually - I mean, there's a - the number of people of color in Iowa and New Hampshire could probably be counted by the people in this room on their digits. You know, I mean, it's just - so this just doesn't look anything like the Democratic Party. So I think Biden has got a point. He's going to try. And South Carolina is his Waterloo, though. He's got to do well there. And if he doesn't, I think he's gone. R MARTIN: NPR's Ron Elving - Ron, you agree that South Carolina is critical for the vice president? ELVING: Well, indeed, it is. It's clearly so. And the question here is, did Joe Biden ever have at any point in this year's process - and I'd like to toss this question to you, Josh - the kind of appeal to blue-collar white voters that was supposed to be part of his charm, part of his appeal, part of what made him valuable to Barack Obama back in 2008 and 2012 and, certainly, what made him a consistent winner in Delaware and a guy who could go back to Scranton and be a, you know, a son of Scranton? R MARTIN: Right, Joe from Scranton. ELVING: Josh, what happened to that? ROGERS: Well, he certainly went for it. I mean, I accompanied him when he campaigned in Berlin, which is in the north of New Hampshire, a mill city that has really fallen on pretty hard times. He campaigned in Claremont which is another mill town along Connecticut river bordering Vermont, where, you know, there's a lot of poverty. And these are places where - that went Trump four years ago. And you know, Joe Biden took the stage and would say, you know, boy, this reminds me of Scranton, this reminds me of Claymont, Del., you know, union jobs used to be great, et cetera. And, you know, he made a pitch that he was there for the people and that the unions built the middle class, et cetera. You know, a lot of the crowd that is here - there are a lot of union members here. But in terms of really galvanizing that part of the electorate, the results in New Hampshire would indicate that he probably hasn't. R MARTIN: Josh Rogers with New Hampshire Public Radio - we appreciate it, Josh, and we'll be checking in with you throughout the night. I want to turn to Andy Smith. He is director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Andy, what you looking at right now? ANDY SMITH (DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SURVEY CENTER): Looking at those middle candidates as well, like everybody else. One of the problems we're having with the numbers right now is they're coming in kind of scattered across the state. There's still some pockets to look forward to, especially the college towns which typically come in kind of late because they have a lot of new registrants to process their paperwork for, essentially. But right now, it's certainly Klobuchar doing well. The thing that's most surprising to me is that the areas that I thought Sanders - that Elizabeth Warren needed to do well in were those upper-income, highly educated towns, especially among women. Amy Klobuchar has really just cleaned her clock there. And I think part of the problem was that Warren kind of moved away from that kind of a centrist image that she discussed just in her kind of a - her speech just recently where she became the alternative to Bernie Sanders. I think the voters here decided whether than having Bernie Sanders-light, they wanted their full-strength Bernie Sanders. And when she became competing for those same voters that Sanders was doing, it was really tough for her. She didn't have that broad crossover appeal that Klobuchar was able to pull off. R MARTIN: Andy, stay with me. Governor Dean, I want to go to you. DEAN: I have a question. You know, there's much been made about their voter suppression bill that was passed by the Republican legislature and signed by Governor Sununu, which prevents out-of-state college students from voting. Have you seen much evidence of that? And how do you expect that to - 'cause that is going to cut into places like Hanover, which are traditionally very, very liberal and have lots of college students, many of whom from out of state and have been barred from voting by the Republicans this time around. SMITH: Actually, it doesn't bar out-of-state students from voting. They can... DEAN: Well, they have to have a New Hampshire driver's license. SMITH: No, you don't. You can have an out-of-state driver's license. You can have it - you can pay out-of-state tuition at the University of New Hampshire, like many of my students are. It's not really going to impact them much at all. They're supposed to have to get one within, like, 30 days, I believe it is, from the time that they declare that they're - this is their residency for voting purposes. But it's nowhere near as draconian as some of the indications are. We're seeing a lot of turnout coming in from college kids in Durham. Apparently, earlier on today, turnout was up from 2016 in Durham, which is by far the biggest college town. And more than half the students are from out of state. So I think it's less of an issue than has been made out to be. We still let just about anybody vote. We probably are the only state in the country that lets people that have out-of-state tuition, out-of-state driver's licenses and out-of-state car registrations - they can come and vote in New Hampshire. DEAN: Vermont can, too. (LAUGHTER) SMITH: There you go. R MARTIN: Andy, I'm going to bring in Mara Liasson. LIASSON: Hi, Andy. It's Mara. I'm here. SMITH: Hi. Hi, Mara. LIASSON: How are you doing? SMITH: Great. LIASSON: Good to talk to you. So I have a question about the Sanders vote - the difference from 2016 to now. He got a solid victory tonight. Absolutely. You can't take that away from him - a lot smaller than last time, obviously. Some of that could be explained, maybe, by the presence of so many other candidates on the ballot. But what I thought was interesting is, where did that - all those other Sanders votes go? They didn't go to the other progressive candidate in the race, Elizabeth Warren. They scattered themselves among all of these centrists. So that - and when you add them up, they're - still have more votes than Bernie and Elizabeth Warren combined. So does that tell you that this party is still not decided which wing - which direction they want to go in - left or center-left? SMITH: I think that about 40% of the Democratic electorate in New Hampshire has historically been progressive. And I think that's largely the case today, and then Bernie kind of had this ceiling. The big difference in 2016 was a lot of the vote - the support that Sanders got wasn't necessarily a vote for Bernie Sanders as much it was a vote... LIASSON: Right. SMITH: ...Against Hillary Clinton. And I think what you're seeing now is an opportunity for those people that really didn't like Hillary Clinton, but they weren't thrilled with Sanders - he was just more of the anti-establishment candidate - have a lot more options to go to. And I think that Amy Klobuchar at the very end here was able to pick up a lot of those votes. One of the things that I think was really surprising with Klobuchar versus Warren was I kind of expected Warren to do pretty good in the towns that Clinton did in, and that would be, like, the towns with - the college towns among the faculty, not among the students. This time around, Klobuchar really won in towns that Hillary Clinton did well in or won in 2016. And that, I think, is the problem that Warren has had - that she just got out-centered by Amy Klobuchar. LIASSON: Because you're saying that the progressives decided she wasn't progressive enough. They wanted the real thing in Bernie Sanders. And the other thing she was trying to bridge - she wasn't a real centrist either because she had so many plans that seemed like too much change, maybe. SMITH: I think she probably had a plan for that plan. (LAUGHTER) SMITH: But you know... M MARTIN: Let's bring Danielle Kurtzleben in here. KURTZLEBEN: But I also want to get at here and ask the question of how much ideology really has to do with how voters are deciding 'cause I got to say, when I was walking around Iowa talking to voters, I came across remarkably few Sanders-Warren folks 'cause, as we know, people in Iowa - many of them chose a first and a second choice. I spoke to very few people who said Warren-Sanders, Sanders-Warren. I spoke to a fair number of Warren-Klobuchar people or even a Warren-Biden person or - it was all over the map. People have all sorts of ways they decide. And amazingly often, it is not about ideology. M MARTIN: So what is it about? Is it, like, a cut-of-your-jib kind of situation, or what is it? KURTZLEBEN: To a certain degree. I mean, there were some people who said, you know, I think so and so is authentic. And I did have a woman or two say, you know, I love all of the candidates, and therefore, I don't mind saying I would like to see a woman in the White House. Or you know - and, yes, there were also candidates who would say, I like how so-and-so speaks on the stump. They are great on the stump. I like them - or whatever crazy mathematical calculation they are doing about what electability is. R MARTIN: Right. It's a personal choice. Ron. ELVING: And let's go back to what Domenico was talking about at the beginning of our broadcast. A number of people made up their minds in the last two or three days. What does that take you back to? Friday night's debate, the debate in New Hampshire, the debate where Amy Klobuchar had what many people thought was her best performance and closed particularly strongly and had the closing argument that all of them were trying to make, but she had it. And she had the passion. Maybe that was just enough to move - what we're talking about here is just a few percentage points that lift her above Elizabeth Warren and take those votes away from the other alternative candidates to Bernie Sanders and put her in the top three. R MARTIN: Governor. DEAN: Yes. R MARTIN: Governor, did you have some concluding thoughts? DEAN: I have some concluding thoughts. I am watching some of these votes. Buttigieg's margin is now less than four points behind Sanders. It's tightening up. Klobuchar is less than four points behind Buttigieg. So this is - it's really fascinating. This is - I mean, you could probably bet that those were going to be the orders of the top three, but these are pretty damn narrow margins. And I don't think a whole lot has been decided here, other than the top three. MONTANARO: Governor, you know, I heard you say once that with your run in 2003, 2004, that you knew you were in trouble when you had the same group of people following you around. DEAN: Right. That's true. MONTANARO: Remember that? DEAN: That's true. MONTANARO: And I just kind of wonder when you look at this field and you look at Bernie Sanders in particular - and the Warren campaign put out this memo today saying that he has a hard ceiling, that there isn't a - he's not expanding and he, in Iowa, won college towns, and he won urban areas. You know, if you're not seeing this surge of young voters, do you feel like there's the potential that there's this phenomenon with Sanders, too? Can he get to the majority of pledged delegates he needs at the convention? DEAN: That's a great question. We, of course, don't know the answer. But this is why I'm totally relaxed about what's going on. R MARTIN: Real brief. DEAN: I'm not going through the wring-my-hands stage of this at all. This is a process. LIASSON: You're the only Democrat who isn't. (LAUGHTER) DEAN: I'm not. But I - look; this is my 11th one of these. R MARTIN: Very quickly. DEAN: The fact of the matter is we've got a long way to go. This is going to get sorted out. And as it does, if Bernie really has a ceiling, he's not going to win the nomination. R MARTIN: You are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. And we are back with our coverage. We are in studio. We've been listening to former governor of the great state of Vermont, Howard Dean, who is now going to take his leave. Thank you so much, governor. And also in studio, we have NPR's Domenico Montanaro and NPR's Ron Elving. And I'm going to turn now to Michel, my co-host today. M MARTIN: I also want to mention that Governor Dean is also a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, so he does have a big - a broad overview of a lot of these races and has certainly sort of played a big national role. We're going to go now to Melanie Levesque, a New Hampshire state senator. Senator Levesque, thanks so much for talking to us. MELANIE LEVESQUE (D-NH, STATE SEN): You're welcome. M MARTIN: And I understand that you are a supporter of former Vice President Joe Biden. How do you feel about the state of things? How do you think - how do you feel about, first of all, his decision to leave New Hampshire and go to South Carolina? And how do you feel about the state of his campaign? LEVESQUE: Well, I would have liked to have seen him tonight. But for his reasons, he's gone to South Carolina. I think that in South Carolina, he's going to do much better than he did in New Hampshire. I think there's a lot of people in the race, a lot to choose from. And we've also had candidates here in New Hampshire for - it feels like at least a year that we've been getting calls, and we've had an opportunity to meet a lot of these candidates. So these candidates that have been here that are doing quite well have a short period of time to get up to speed in South Carolina. M MARTIN: Yeah. So you - can I switch gears for a second? Senator, you are yourself a first. In 2018, you became the first African American in New Hampshire history to be elected to the state Senate. Was there any part of you that was attracted to supporting another first - for example, the first woman to - possibly for president, the first openly gay candidate for president? Was there any attraction there? LEVESQUE: Well, I actually supported Hillary Clinton, who would've been our first woman president, so in that regard, yes. But in this race, I really had an opportunity to meet all of the candidates except for, perhaps, a couple. But I've seen them all. I've heard their speeches, met several of them. We have a lot of good candidates to choose from. And the previous segment talked about how people would like, like, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who are very different. Well, I felt the same way. I like Joe. I like Elizabeth and Cory. Those were my top three, and they were all very different. But I had to sit down and really analyze, what is it that we need now? Our country is in such a dire-strait situation right now that I felt that what we needed was the experience that Joe Biden offered. M MARTIN: Well, senator, thank you so much for joining us. I'm sorry that our time is short this evening. That is New Hampshire state Senator Melanie Levesque. And I do hope we'll talk again. You are listening to live Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. And we'll be right back. (SOUNDBITE OF THIS WILL DESTROY YOU'S \"THEY MOVE ON TRACKS OF NEVER-ENDING LIGHT\") M MARTIN: An official winner is expected soon in the New Hampshire primary. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. R MARTIN: And I'm Rachel Martin. Bernie Sanders was the favorite, and that hasn't changed throughout the night. He's leading comfortably. M MARTIN: Pete Buttigieg is in second place at the moment, and in third, Amy Klobuchar. Joe Biden had a tough night. He's in fifth place right now with just single digits. R MARTIN: Elizabeth Warren has so far continued to break out from the middle of the pack. She is in fourth place, but tonight she still sold herself as the most electable candidate. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) M MARTIN: Well, we lost two candidates so far. Andrew Yang and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet have both dropped out after results that were disappointing for them, and neither of them saw a path to go forward. Domenico Montanaro, what else can you tell us? MONTANARO: Well, so far, we know that Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar are the top three candidates. They're the only candidates who are going to probably get any delegates tonight 'cause you have to get above 15% to do that. We have, currently, about 30% of the vote in, and Sanders has about 28%, Buttigieg at 23 and Klobuchar at about 20 - really quite a night for Amy Klobuchar to be able to really, you know, capitalize on that great debate performance that she had. And we saw half of voters saying that it was very important to their decision that she - that the debate would be something that they used to decide on their vote. I want to talk a little bit about where the vote is coming from and what's left and not left. Already, Concord, Portsmouth, Keene and Lebanon are all areas where the vote is completely in. We are waiting for about 10 precincts to - there's only two out of 12 so far reporting in Manchester. We're waiting on a whole lot still in Nashua and some in Dover in the east. So Manchester is the biggest city. We're going to see a lot of the vote there still. And we'll see if these results still track between Manchester and Nashua. R MARTIN: All right. We are going to turn now to South Carolina, where Vice President Joe Biden is addressing his supporters via livestream. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) R MARTIN: OK. Brief remarks from Vice President Biden. Again, he is not in New Hampshire. He is in South Carolina. He left New Hampshire early, but he was addressing his supporters who are still in New Hampshire. He was supposed to be at an event there tonight to watch election results. He decided to make a pivot move to South Carolina. He's looking forward because the prognosis for his campaign in New Hampshire is not looking good at this point. I want to bring in NPR's Scott Detrow, who is with the Sanders campaign, Bernie Sanders. You are in Manchester, Scott. Well, just give me the lay of the land. What's the scene like there? DETROW: We've got the room pretty full up. You've got the supporters all shuffled in behind the stage where Bernie Sanders will be speaking and hoping to declare victory here in New Hampshire. He's ahead right now, but it's getting pretty tight. He's got a slim lead over Pete Buttigieg. They've got a full slate of bunting draping the stage like a... R MARTIN: Bunting... DETROW: ...Baseball stadium... R MARTIN: Yes (laughter). DETROW: ...In the playoffs. I'm always a fan of that. And, you know, the Sanders campaign is feeling good where things stand right now. Of course, he did win by more than 20 points in 2016. Nobody in the campaign thought that he would have a margin close to that this time around, and I don't think that was just spin. I think they genuinely expected a tight race but felt good about being toward the top of it or at the top of it. Yeah. R MARTIN: Go ahead, Scott. DETROW: No, that was my point (laughter). R MARTIN: No. You were done. Well, how has that shaped the candidate's expectations, do you think, for how he would perform in New Hampshire - the fact that he did win by such a large margin in 2016? Has it been dangerous at all? DETROW: All throughout the weekend, Sanders would repeatedly talk about that 2016 race. And I wondered what his campaign manager felt about that as he was out there saying, it's not going to be like 2016. But Sanders' argument was that his big win in 2016 against Hillary Clinton validated the platform that he was running on. He was saying that he thought that most of the Democratic Party was skeptical about all the big progressive plans that were very outside the mainstream of what Democrats were running on up until that point - $15 minimum wage, Medicare for All, you know, overhauling the entire health care system, overhauling the entire electricity generation system with his massive climate change plans - all of his proposals that really reshape large swaths of the economy and government. His argument was that 2016 win validated that. And even though he did not end up as the Democratic nominee in 2016, so much of the candidates running for president in 2020 adopted big chunks of Bernie Sanders' platform. Even as the party has this conversation about where it is nationally, you know, Bernie Sanders has had a major impact on this party's agenda and what the conversation is about. And he was saying all week that started with the win in New Hampshire as his campaign's aides were saying, yes, that's right, but don't expect a margin anywhere close to that this time around. R MARTIN: Right. M MARTIN: Scott, can I just ask you - what are folks yelling back there? I can hear that that's a happy crowd. What are they saying? DETROW: I think that was a Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. The regular chants that we've been hearing over the last few weeks are Bernie - you know, makes sense... R MARTIN: Right. DETROW: ...And Bernie beats Trump. With the electability conversation, that's something the Sanders campaign has been trying to get ahead of all along, anticipating the pushback that you've been hearing in the last week from Joe Biden, from Pete Buttigieg, from others, that a democratic socialist would poise a major threat to the party if he is the nominee in November... R MARTIN: Right. DETROW: ...To not just the presidency but the House majority as well. R MARTIN: I like the Bernie, Bernie, Bernie - you know, simple message - simple, simple message. DETROW: Keep it on a bumper sticker. R MARTIN: Right. But what do voters tell you, Scott, about what they think are the odds that Sanders can make these things happen? Like, it's one thing to talk about it on the campaign trail - free college - what are they telling you about what his chances are of actually creating legislation around these things? DETROW: That's a great question, and that would be the biggest hurdle, right? If we get 37,000 steps ahead of where we are right now and Bernie Sanders was the president, it would be incredibly hard. The reason Obamacare looked the way it looked was because that was all that could get passed in a Senate that had an overwhelming historic Democratic majority. You know, the public option that Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden and others talk about just was not politically feasible in that environment. If Sanders or any other Democrat were to become president, the best-case scenario, I think, is a Senate majority of something like 51 seats - you know, one or two seats - seems very hard to get such a massive overhaul of the health care system accomplished or anything else that way. But Bernie Sanders plows past that. He makes the argument about mobilization, about mass movement politics. That's something you heard a lot at the big rally from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders - arguing he would organize his supporters... R MARTIN: Yeah. DETROW: ...To put political pressure. R MARTIN: All right. NPR's Scott Detrow with the Sanders campaign. We'll be checking in with you. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you. M MARTIN: And now we're going to go to Tim O'Brien. He is a senior adviser to a candidate who did not compete in New Hampshire but is certainly competing elsewhere and one might argue is competing nationally, given the depth and breadth of his spending on ads that have appeared all across the country. We're talking about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. And we're hearing from Tim O'Brien now, who is a senior adviser. And he's the author of \"TrumpNation: The Art Of Being The Donald.\" Mr. O'Brien, thanks so much for talking to us. TIM O'BRIEN (SENIOR ADVISER, BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN): Michel, thanks for having me on. M MARTIN: Well, earlier - I don't know if you heard our conversation with Jim Donchess. He's the mayor of Nashua, N.H. He said that he was supporting Pete Buttigieg because Pete Buttigieg, of course, was the mayor of South Bend, Ind. And he said that mayors know how to get things done. O'BRIEN: (Laughter). M MARTIN: I asked him the question about - did he consider another mayor who has certainly had a lot of experience? And he said that Mike Bloomberg didn't compete up here, so no. And do you have some work to do there? O'BRIEN: Well, you know, we weren't in the first four - aren't in the first four primary states, Michel, because of the timing when Mike entered the election. We were just too late to set up shop in those states. We are now in 45 states and territories with over 2,000 people on the ground. This isn't just an ad-driven campaign. You know, I've been now in, I think, 10 states. We're meeting with - and Mike has campaigned in 24 states. We're meeting with people on the ground. I think his movement in the polls isn't just because of the ads. It's because we're touching people locally. We've got, you know, scores of field offices that are staffed by locals who know the people in their communities and the issues that people in those communities care about. And I think that that's been the driving force in his rise in the polls. I think the ads have been a huge advantage, obviously, because it gives Mike a lot of exposure. But if there wasn't a real, tangible, concrete record behind that, you know, he wouldn't be polling in third place nationally, and he wouldn't have the kind of momentum behind him that he does. M MARTIN: And he's certainly gotten some attention-getting endorsements. I mean, here in Washington, D.C., the mayor of Washington, D.C., has endorsed him, Muriel Bowser. The mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, has endorsed him. And that's noteworthy in part because they are both African American women. And as you know, the mayor has had - I don't know how to quite - what word to use - a relationship with African American communities that has at times been fraught. O'BRIEN: Yeah. M MARTIN: And this week, he's come under fire for comments he made in 2015 about the so-called stop-and-frisk policing technique. He said this at the Aspen Institute. He claimed that 95% of murders and murderers and murder victims are male minorities between the ages of 16 to 25 and advocated throwing minority kids up against the walls and frisking them. Now, we know that he's apologized for defending stop-and-frisk as long as he did. But what about that? I mean, is - clearly, people have an interest in putting these comments out and holding him to account for them. What is he going to have to do to overcome the impression that many people already have of him because of his long defense of stop-and-frisk? O'BRIEN: Well, I think it's healthy that this is being put out there. I think our first and foremost response - that has to be that Mike made a huge mistake. And he stood by this for too long. He should've let go of it earlier. I think he deeply regrets, you know, having been part of that policy. And I think he needs to spend the rest of his public career demonstrating to people of color that this isn't who he is as a man or as a politician. You know, this audio came out last year when he had announced his bid. It's been out there for a while. And it's fine. We should be held accountable for that. Having said that, this hardly defines the totality of his time as the mayor of New York or as a philanthropist. He has done enormous work reaching out to communities of color for decades. You know, he began a program when he was the mayor of New York, the Young Men's Initiative, that Barack Obama modeled My Brother's Keeper on. M MARTIN: Sure. Forgive me for interrupting because we're going to... O'BRIEN: Yeah. M MARTIN: I'm sure that the mayor's going to have plenty of time to make his case. And I'm sure you're going to make the argument that it's awfully convenient to have this audio come out now. The conservative media is certainly very interested in it. O'BRIEN: Yeah. M MARTIN: But what do you say to those who say that his apology is certainly very convenient? O'BRIEN: Well, what I was trying to say was I think the apology, I think, reflects where his heart is on this. And his record shows that he's not solely behind - defined by stop-and-frisk. I mean, it's interesting to me that the 1994 crime bill is not out there being discussed as much as stop-and-frisk is. And I think Mike needs to have the support of people of color. Of course, he had to apologize if he wanted to run a race here. And I think it's good that he apologized. There's no mystery to it, I think, about why he did. There's a number of other politicians who have not apologized for similar policies. Our position on this is we will apologize for our mistakes, and we hope we can communicate to people of color in a way in which they trust what the totality of Mike's record shows. And I think, actually, you're seeing that in the polls, Michel. He's - you know, the Quinnipiac poll that came out this week - he's now in second place, behind Joe Biden, among voters of color. And I don't think that is happening because of that. It's because we are familiarizing people with who Mike Bloomberg really is. And he was not a white racist mayor trying to shove white cops down the throats of black people. He's a conscientious man... M MARTIN: OK. O'BRIEN: ...Who's tried to develop sophisticated solutions to really complex public problems. M MARTIN: Danielle Kurtzleben has a question for you. O'BRIEN: OK. KURTZLEBEN: Hey, Tim. So, of course, former Mayor Bloomberg has been rising in the polls, and that's nothing to sniff at. But I'm wondering about something that I've heard from a couple of voters - Democratic voters - who are fearful that, you know, listen; we feel odd about a person who is essentially able to, in their words, buy this nomination. Do you fear a backlash about that? O'BRIEN: Well, I mean - well, you know, again, I think you can buy exposure. You can't buy an election. If Tom Steyer - if you could buy an election, Tom Steyer still wouldn't be at 1% or 2%. Tom Steyer spent more money in New Hampshire on television than every other candidate campaigning in New Hampshire combined. And he's running in sixth or seventh place. Mike Bloomberg has bought exposure. And what that exposure has earned him is the ability to tell people his full story. And I think his voters get acquainted with that. They're impressed by it. There is nobody running that has his governing experience or has solved as many hardcore public policy problems as he has. I think the other... M MARTIN: OK, Tim... O'BRIEN: Yeah? M MARTIN: Sorry, Tim. We're going to have to leave it there for now. O'BRIEN: OK. All right. M MARTIN: I'm sure we'll talk again. That's Tim O'Brien, senior adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. And Tim O'Brien's also the author of \"TrumpNation.\" R MARTIN: You're listening to Special Coverage from NPR of the New Hampshire primary. And I'm going to bring in another voice here, Brendan McQuaid. He is president and publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper. And he endorsed Amy Klobuchar, as did the paper. Brendan, thanks so much for being with us tonight. BRENDAN MCQUAID (PRESIDENT, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER): Thanks for having me. R MARTIN: So the endorsement ran with the following headline - \"Amy Klobuchar Can Win.\" So what do tonight's results prove to you? I mean, right now, she is doing well. She needs to do well. But she's not on top yet. MCQUAID: No. I'd like to say she's doing as well as she is because of our endorsement, but I don't think that's fully the case. R MARTIN: If you do say so yourself. MCQUAID: I think she - yeah. I think she's doing well because she's a strong candidate. And I think people really do look at electability, especially electability versus the current incumbent as part of their decision-making. R MARTIN: What makes her more electable than - I mean, we can go down the list, but let's start with Joe Biden because he's been the national front-runner. MCQUAID: Joe Biden is a great candidate. And Joe Biden is a perennially great candidate. I think Joe Biden did not have the same energy that he's had in the past. And people, rightly or wrongly, are looking for someone a little bit more fiery. They're looking at the current incumbent as someone who needs to be sort of hit with the same level. And Joe Biden's not that guy right now. R MARTIN: What do you make of what - the reporting that we're hearing that Klobuchar's been able to peel off some supporters from Elizabeth Warren? MCQUAID: I think that's probably part of it. I think there are a number of people there, as we said in our endorsement, who think that the time is right for a woman president. And we think that, you know, the time very well could be right. It's got to be the right woman, though. And Elizabeth Warren has some very left-leaning, especially in our opinion, ideas that we don't think fly with a lot of folks, especially New Hampshire pragmatists who don't like trillions of dollars in proposed spending. So Klobuchar is the right candidate for us. R MARTIN: What does she do going forward, though? I mean, if she has a good performance in New Hampshire, does she have the support? Does she have the money to move forward to Super Tuesday? MCQUAID: I am not part of the Klobuchar campaign. I'm not, you know, a national campaign strategist. All I can say is that I think winning in New Hampshire has always proven to be a good springboard. And as we saw with Bill Clinton back in the '90s, a strong showing and a stronger-than-expected showing can really springboard you into the national spotlight. And that's what someone like Amy would need for some big fundraising to help her compete. But I don't think she's going to be able to compete with Bloomberg on money. R MARTIN: But you're feeling optimistic. You like where she's at right now? MCQUAID: Yeah, I think she's a good choice. R MARTIN: All right. Brendan McQuaid, we appreciate your time tonight - president and publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader. His newspaper endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar in the primary. Thank you so much. We do appreciate it. MCQUAID: Thank you very much. Have a good night. R MARTIN: And you are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) M MARTIN: We're still waiting on an official call in the New Hampshire primary. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. But Bernie Sanders has held the lead all night. Behind him is Pete Buttigieg in second place. Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden have both had disappointing nights, but Amy Klobuchar is having a pretty good one. After a strong showing in the debate last week, she's been surging in the polls, and she is in third right now. Here she was yesterday talking about why she believes she connects with moderate voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KLOBUCHAR: I've always told people that if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. And I can't think of a better place to make that case than in the first primary state. R MARTIN: I'm Rachel Martin. And we're going to turn now to NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, just right off the bat, can you just ground us in the reality right now? What do we see? MONTANARO: So there's a few things to mention. First of all, more than a third of the vote in - 35% in. Bernie Sanders is leading with 27% of the vote. Pete Buttigieg is second with 24%, and Amy Klobuchar third at 20%. Elizabeth Warren is fourth - just 10% - and Joe Biden - 8% - below that. That means Warren and Biden are likely not to get any delegates tonight because you have to finish with 15% or higher to get any delegate statewide and in each of the two states' congressional districts. And right now, Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are likely to be the only three to get any delegates. I want to mention Klobuchar's upswing here into third place given where she was. R MARTIN: It's a big deal for her. MONTANARO: Obviously. And her finish in Iowa obviously helped propel her into this place that she's at. Her campaign said they raised about $2 1/2 million last week. That - a lot of that money is going to run ads now in Nevada. That's where they've started to place some of their money. I also want to mention - you guys had on the publisher of the Union Leader. The New Hampshire Union Leader used to be the Manchester Union Leader, and the former publisher of that newspaper, who's the father of the person who's now the publisher, Joe McQuaid - very conservative. So very interesting that the paper actually wound up backing Amy Klobuchar 'cause traditionally, this is a paper that would weigh in on the Republican primary and have quite a bit of sway. And the fact that they're backing Amy Klobuchar tells you something. R MARTIN: So it's interesting that both of these candidates who are underperforming tonight - Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden - seem to have come to that conclusion early, right? We saw Joe Biden move physically - take a plane to South Carolina. And Elizabeth Warren - we heard her come out early and give a speech. We're all listening to hear what this was about. But it was just a rally the troops; I'm still in this. In other words, you know, sure, I may not do well, but I'm still in this. MONTANARO: Her campaign talks about their vaunted organization that they have in a lot of these Super Tuesday states. Her campaign put out a memo today going after, frankly, each of the other candidates, talking about a hard ceiling that Bernie Sanders had. And today, you heard her talk about how she can be the consensus candidate. Now, as the reality sets in over the next few weeks and what conversations, potentially, she has with Senator Sanders, you wonder what that's going to look like. And you wonder how long this winds up going on. Does she have the money to continue? At this point, she does, especially considering the war chest she's had from the Senate - from her Senate time. R MARTIN: All right. Mara - Ron. ELVING: One of the storylines that we have already been seeing a little bit and this evening is that New Hampshire is going to be a muddle - that somehow, we're going to get so many candidates coming out - six tickets out of Iowa, as Governor Dean said earlier - that this is not going to be like a typical New Hampshire in the past that has really set the tone for the rest of the race. R MARTIN: Wait, Ron. This just happened in Iowa. ELVING: Well, and that's what I was next going to say - that that would also continue the theme out of Iowa, which was, where's the clarity? Everything is up in the air. And these two early races - these two early contests are not doing their job the way they have in the past to set the table for everybody else. But I'm just going to say, in contradiction to that a little bit, I think they've scrambled the race quite a bit. If you look back over the last year, the two people who have been ahead in the polls more often than anybody else are Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. And tonight, they're both down struggling to stay in double digits. The other person who's been up and down, up and down through that period is Bernie Sanders, who looks very likely to be winning tonight but not winning by nearly enough. R MARTIN: Right. So... LIASSON: That's why we like voters so much better than we like polls. R MARTIN: Well... LIASSON: Because the voters are telling us something. The voters are telling us that they are not willing to winnow this field yet. They don't want to anoint a powerful front-runner. Bernie Sanders got a solid win here, but he did not become the kind of front-runner that often has emerged out of Iowa and New Hampshire. And the voters tell us they are absolutely not ready to decide who is the center-left alternative to Bernie Sanders. They want to keep that pot boiling. Now you've got Buttigieg, Klobuchar and maybe Biden. I mean, they want to keep this going for quite a while. And I just want to make one - oh. M MARTIN: Well, speaking of scrambling the race or voters not wanting to scramble the race, Joe Biden is in South Carolina. And he's talking to voters there. We're waiting for him momentarily. Juana Summers is there in South Carolina, awaiting the former vice president's arrival. Juana, just as briefly as you can, tell us, like, what's going on down there? What are people talking about? SUMMERS: Joe Biden is taking the stage right now. M MARTIN: He's taking the stage right now? SUMMERS: Yes. M MARTIN: And I think we're going to hear him - hear what he has to say. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) R MARTIN: We've been listening to former Vice President Joe Biden address supporters not in New Hampshire. He is addressing supporters in South Carolina on the night of the New Hampshire primary. The vice president's not doing well in New Hampshire. He knew that was going to be the case, and so he left early and went to South Carolina, where he hopes to do well. We just heard him, Mara, talking about - well, he's essentially trying to say, never mind you, Iowa and New Hampshire. We are moving on. LIASSON: That is the happiest and most relaxed I have ever - I've seen Joe Biden since these primaries began. R MARTIN: Why? LIASSON: I just - he just seemed relaxed, giddy. He was among friends. This is a place where he can do well. I mean, it was a - the events that I went to in New Hampshire with Joe Biden were funereal. He was talking about loss and bread lines and pain. And it was just very downbeat. That was an upbeat, kind of almost gleeful Joe Biden. Now, the thing about Joe Biden is even though he performed very poorly in New Hampshire, he has a place to go. He can go to South Carolina. Now, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who did really well in New Hampshire and are... R MARTIN: Don't have no South Carolina (laughter)? LIASSON: They don't have a South Carolina. They are sharing the centrist lane right now, center-left lane with Joe Biden. So that's going to be the big question. The battle for who is the alternative to Bernie Sanders, who wins the center-left lane is on. And it's going to be very vigorous, and it's very crowded. Elizabeth Warren - one last thought on her is that I think her showing was worse than Biden's. And here's why. She's from Massachusetts. R MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: That's just shocking to me. R MARTIN: It's supposed to be her backyard. LIASSON: Massachusetts shares - Boston shares a media market with New Hampshire. R MARTIN: It's an important point. I want to close with Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: Right. You can't hear it on the radio, but I was nodding furiously along with Mara as she was saying this. I've been to Biden events, too. They are downright somber. He talks a lot about the seriousness of democracy and says that this election is serious and so on. Serious is just the word of the night with him. Now, one thing that I want to talk about, though, looking ahead to South Carolina is that - is just how poorly Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg are doing there in the latest polls. They need momentum coming out of this. I wonder if it'll happen. R MARTIN: All right. We will be back. You are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. All right. I want to bring in Lauren Chooljian. She's a political reporter with New Hampshire Public Radio, and she is the co-host of the \"Stranglehold\" podcast. And, Lauren, I understand you are with the Pete Buttigieg camp. Is that right? LAUREN CHOOLJIAN (BYLINE): You are correct. I'm here in Nashua Community College in southern New Hampshire. And people have their eyes glued to CNN. One woman I was just talking to was trying to will the numbers to get boosted up a little bit more, closer to Bernie Sanders. But, you know, a lot of people in this room know that Sanders is tough to beat in New Hampshire, especially because he had such a strong showing here in 2016. And he has the neighbor thing going to him - going for him, like you guys were just talking about. R MARTIN: Right. So do you know at this point, Lauren, where Buttigieg is performing well in the state and what it says about his voters? Do you have that data? CHOOLJIAN: Well, we're still figuring that out. There have been a couple places - you know, you guys were just talking about this, you know, Boston media market. That's especially prevalent in southern New Hampshire. I saw a couple towns in southern New Hampshire where there are big commuter towns down to Massachusetts that he was doing well in. You know, the seacoast is still shaking out. That's a very strong Democratic area. So I'll be curious to see how that shakes out. But I did also notice he won a town in northern New Hampshire that had originally voted for Obama and then went Trump. And that was a place he was really focused on. And I know he also campaigned hard in similar precincts in Iowa as well. R MARTIN: Can you just give me a sense, Lauren, what do people tell you about their personal connection? Do they feel a personal connection to Pete Buttigieg, because he has been someone who, at the beginning of his campaign, at least, kind of struggled to break through that way as a candidate? CHOOLJIAN: Yeah, I would agree with that. And, you know, what's interesting is as someone who's had to follow him around every time he's been here, you know, sometimes, it feels he's - you know, he's very on-message, very on-the-talking-points. But voters I talked to here say they feel like he is thoughtful, he - they really can connect with him. They like what he's saying, and they're really all-in on this unifying message. Everyone here thinks that it's the pragmatic choice - everyone I've spoken to here, I should say, anecdotally, of course. R MARTIN: Right. CHOOLJIAN: They've said that they feel like this is the pragmatic choice - that if we're trying to build a larger group here, they say that Pete Buttigieg is the one to do it. R MARTIN: Are we hearing - what is that, a USA chant? A Buttigieg chant? CHOOLJIAN: No, it's Boot-Edge-Edge. R MARTIN: Oh, Boot-Edge-Edge. CHOOLJIAN: Yes, Boot-Edge-Edge. R MARTIN: Just with the seconds remaining, Lauren, you've been reporting about the primary as an institution. And something that is true is that New Hampshire - the voters there tend to reward the candidates who spend the most time with them - right? - just working the state. How is that playing out tonight? CHOOLJIAN: Well, I mean, we just saw Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet both drop out. Those are two of the candidates that have spent the most time in New Hampshire. Now, of course, it could also be because of them as candidates. But when I spoke to Michael Bennet about this, you know, he was trying to do that longshot Jimmy Carter, Gary Hart thing, where he would just - he did, like, 50 town halls before primary day. And I asked him, you know, if this doesn't work for you, if you don't do better than expectations, what does that say? And he said, well, maybe that says that people don't like Michael Bennet. But it also could mean that this is becoming a much more nationalized primary. And I think that, you know, that's been a topic we've been talking about at length - right? - about how the DNC set these thresholds for the debates so high that had that winnowing impact... R MARTIN: Right. CHOOLJIAN: ...That New Hampshire and Iowa usually do. So it's different for sure. R MARTIN: All right. We appreciate you. Lauren Chooljian - political reporter with New Hampshire Public Radio, co-host of the \"Stranglehold\" podcast - thank you. And you are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) M MARTIN: You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. We're going to go straight to Amy Klobuchar, who is speaking to her supporters now. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) M MARTIN: We've been hearing from Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who's having a good night in New Hampshire. We're going to go away from her now to talk to a couple of the correspondents who - Juana Summers is in South Carolina, and Scott Detrow is still in New Hampshire. So, Juana, let's go to you first. We heard from Joe Biden earlier. He gave a - well, we have different opinions about that kind of speech that he gave. So give us a sense of the room. How was it there? SUMMERS: Sure. So one of the things that was really interesting from being inside this room is there was almost no signs whatsoever of the vote that was happening tonight, the results coming in from New Hampshire - no TVs broadcasting those results. These folks, when I spoke to them, told me that states like Iowa and New Hampshire that are largely white, compared with the population of a state like South Carolina where about two-thirds of voters are African American - that those states don't have a lot of impact here. This was an elated room, the crowd at times jumping to their feet, announcing the number that you can text to join and support Joe Biden's campaign, along with the former vice president. A lot of energy here. They feel like this is, indeed, as the campaign has said, a state that can be a springboard for Biden's candidacy. And they think that some of this national media conversation around his campaign has been a little bit overblown. They believe he has a shot to win the nomination, that he will be able to deliver the state. M MARTIN: Well, it is interesting that there were no TV cameras - there were no TV screens in the room there. That's kind of a standard feature of a rally at this point, isn't there? I mean, nobody took notice of that, or nobody asked, or they just were - sort of had an agreement to sort of not notice or something like that? I don't know. It's kind of interesting. SUMMERS: Yeah. M MARTIN: Let's go to Scott Detrow, too. Scott Detrow, you are still at the Sanders headquarters. What did you notice? DETROW: From Senator Klobuchar's speech... M MARTIN: Yes. DETROW: ...Or from the Sanders - from Senator Klobuchar's speech, I mean, she - the thing that stuck out to me was that line about all the times that she has been counted out of this race, and I think there's some truth to that. When she got into this race, she was really overlooked by a lot of other higher-profile U.S. senators who entered this campaign with a lot of high expectations. I'm thinking of California Senator Kamala Harris, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. One by one, all of those other senators who had a lot of media attention, a lot of fundraising numbers - one at a time, they all dropped out of the race, leaving Senator Amy Klobuchar. And tonight, she is finishing much higher than Senator Warren, who at one point last year was one of the front-runners of this contest. So Senator Klobuchar really has stuck to it, and it's paying off tonight in New Hampshire. And what's interesting about that is it was Iowa that Amy Klobuchar spent - Klobuchar spent as much time campaigning in. She certainly had a presence in New Hampshire, but it was Iowa that, again and again, she pulled her resources into. M MARTIN: OK. But let's talk about the point that Juana just raised. I mean, Juana just made the point that she - obviously, she's at a Biden event in South Carolina. He notably left New Hampshire early before results were in, knowing that it was not going to be a good night to go to South Carolina and sort of make the point that most of the people of color have not voted yet. What is - what about Bernie Sanders and his appeal to the minority vote? Talk about what efforts he's made there. DETROW: Sure. He's made a huge effort of outreach. The - if you look at the polls, recently, Senator Sanders has done better than former Vice President Joe Biden among voters of color as a whole. And that has a large part to do with strong support that Sanders has from Latino voters. The Sanders campaign over the last few days has been pointing to a study that UCLA did analyzing the Latino vote in the Iowa caucuses last week where, according to their analysis, he got more than 50% of the vote in the 32 high-density Latino caucus locations that UCLA studied. Nobody else came close. And the Sanders campaign feels like they can use that particular appeal in the outreach they've been doing there to do very well in the next contest, which is, of course, Nevada, which often gets overlooked by South Carolina. But Nevada's up next, and the Sanders campaign feels like they're going to have a strong showing because of the appeal that he has with a lot of Latino voters. M MARTIN: OK. So that's where I want to - I want to talk about the other people, the second and third position, which is Buttigieg. What happens now? I mean, it's all been - you know, at every turn, he's kind of defied expectations. You know, people said, oh, you know, it's too small. He's too young. His - he's led a small city. He doesn't have enough experience. And at every turn, he's defied expectations. But now he goes to Nevada and South Carolina. What path does he have there? DETROW: I think this will be an enormous test to Pete Buttigieg. If you looked, all along, he was doing really well in Iowa and New Hampshire, and his poll numbers in those two states were far higher - maybe even double at times - of where he was in national polls. There has been a lot of conversation about Pete Buttigieg really struggling to connect with African American voters. Amy Klobuchar has the same problem. We just haven't paid as much attention to it because she hasn't been at the top of the race. If Pete Buttigieg is going to have to make his case to two very diverse states and states that he has not poured into the resources that he poured into Iowa and South Carolina - so I think the Sanders campaign feels like they'll have an edge on Buttigieg in those next two contests. And I'm really curious to see what happens. I think those next two states will really show whether Pete Buttigieg is a national candidate or not. M MARTIN: And it's getting really loud where you are, so I'm going to go back to Juana, if I can. Juana, what about that? Is anybody - you're in South Carolina. Is anybody - have you heard the words Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar where you are? SUMMERS: I've heard a lot more about Pete Buttigieg definitively (ph) than I have about Amy Klobuchar. I spent all of last week in the state, and one of the things I heard is that the Buttigieg campaign is working specifically among young black voters. He has spent a lot of time at HBCUs - historically black colleges and universities - in the state, like South Carolina State University, which is about an hour away from where I am in Orangeburg, S.C. So he has been working to that community. This is a candidate who is - he's in his late 30s. He's making that promise of generational change, his campaign hoping that is something that transcends race and class and that he can speak to those demographics. But there is no question that for both Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the road here does get harder. They have not spent as much time, perhaps, in South Carolina as they have those first two nominating contests, and clearly that paid off for them in terms of polls and support and having that enthusiasm. But there have been campaigns here who have been on the ground for months even they'll need to play catch-up with. M MARTIN: That's Juana Summers, NPR political correspondent. She's actually in South Carolina... R MARTIN: Standing next to a train. M MARTIN: ...Where Joe Biden made a surprising announcement, leaving New Hampshire early to get there early and to start his - hopefully rebooting his campaign there. You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) R MARTIN: We're going to continue our live Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary. I'm Rachel Martin. And we're going to bring in Marc Lotter. He is someone with a different perspective than those we have been hearing from. He is the communications director - director of strategic communications for President Trump's reelection campaign. Marc, thanks for being with us. MARC LOTTER (DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN): Oh, thanks for having me. R MARTIN: So you had a victory tonight - an easy victory in New Hampshire on the Republican ballot, an expected victory. But, you know, it's instructive to look back to 2016 because then-candidate Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire by only, you know, between 2,700, 2,800 votes. So how does that affect the message right now from President Trump? LOTTER: Well, I think you saw that on display last night, Rachel, when the president was in New Hampshire. He had a rally in Manchester, had over 50,000 - close to 55,000 people request tickets for those - for that rally. We set another record. He beat his own record for the number of people inside that arena. And when you get into the numbers a little bit deeper, you saw that 17% of the people who had requested tickets did not vote in 2016 and 25% of the people who had requested tickets were registered Democrats. And so when you look at that margin with just under 3,000 votes that you had mentioned, the president right there just closed that gap with new people that had signed up, are now in contact with our campaign. We - they stood in line for hours, in some cases days. And we're very confident that when we turn around and say in September and October, November, would you be willing to knock on a few doors, would you be willing to make a few phone calls or go to the polls, those folks will do it. R MARTIN: So let me ask you. We've heard a lot from the Democratic contenders about unity. In particular, we just heard from Amy Klobuchar, who's pulling in third right now. And that's an important point for her that she keeps driving home - the idea that the country needs unity right now. How do you think President Trump can unify the country? Is that a part of his message right now? LOTTER: Well, I think it can be, and because he has made it very clear from Day 1 when he came down that escalator and through his campaign, through the time in the White House and now in this second campaign that he's going to put American workers first. He's going to put America first. So when you look at New Hampshire... R MARTIN: Is that a unifying message? LOTTER: I think it is a unifying message because you see so many people that are succeeding in this economy - 18,000 jobs in New Hampshire have been created since the president was elected, a thousand manufacturing jobs. When you go back to the Obama-Biden years, they lost thousands of manufacturing jobs. So that's a case that he can make. We see a lot of the polls out there right now - I think there was even one out today from Monmouth that said two-thirds of the American people think the president's going to be reelected. R MARTIN: Marc Lotter, we appreciate your time tonight. Marc Lotter is the director of strategic communications for President Trump's reelection bid. Thanks very much. We appreciate it. LOTTER: Thank you, Rachel. R MARTIN: And we're going to continue with our analysis and results coming in from the New Hampshire primary. You are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary. It is coming to you from NPR News. It is still Bernie Sanders' race to lose. This is live Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. M MARTIN: And I'm Michel Martin. Behind Sanders is Pete Buttigieg. Behind him is Amy Klobuchar, who's gained surprise momentum tonight. R MARTIN: Just moments ago, Senator Klobuchar rallied her supporters at her New Hampshire headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KLOBUCHAR: We are going to South Carolina. (CHEERING) KLOBUCHAR: And we are taking this message of unity to the country... (CHEERING) KLOBUCHAR: ...Because we know in our hearts that in a democracy, it is not about the loudest voice or the biggest bank account. It is about the best idea and about the person who can turn those ideas into action. R MARTIN: All right. We are joined in studio by NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, start us off here. First of all, the top three slots have been pretty steady tonight - Sanders in first, Buttigieg in second, Klobuchar in third - but we don't have any confirmed results. How come? MONTANARO: Well, we don't have a call. We have confirmed results. R MARTIN: Correct. MONTANARO: What we have here is about 57% of precincts reporting that Bernie Sanders is ahead. The margin has narrowed between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg - something to watch here. Sanders is about 26.4% of the vote, Buttigieg at 23.7. That's about 3,900 votes that are separating them. And if I can just call to your attention where that vote's coming from, Bernie Sanders does well in urban areas. Manchester's the largest city, and half of his margin against Pete Buttigieg is coming from Manchester. He won Manchester by about 2,100 votes, and that's more than half of his total margin right now. We're still waiting on about eight precincts in Nashua, N.H. Only one of nine are in so far. And there's still some vote out in Dover in the east, and then some of the surrounding towns in between. But that's essentially what we're waiting on. That's probably why you haven't had a call just yet because Nashua, which is one of the larger towns right on the border with Massachusetts, doesn't have all of its vote in. But I bet it's getting pretty close for some of them. They want to see if this margin probably continues to close or if it widens at all for Sanders. R MARTIN: You know, we knew Sanders was going to have a home-field advantage being from a neighboring state. We thought that about Elizabeth Warren. She is not performing as well as expected. MONTANARO: Really faded. She's at only 9.5% of the vote, just 14,000 votes overall so far. Amy Klobuchar has really been the story of the night in many ways. She's got 20% of the vote. She's really performed quite well in various parts of the state in large portions, especially Concord - did very well there. You know, and, look; she was on the upswing. She's caught it right at the right time. There's a lot of people paying a lot of attention. The challenge for her campaign is whether she can sustain some of this momentum, take it into places that now become a more diverse electorate. She hasn't shown any signs, really, that she can win with black and brown voters. She's going to need to be able to prove that she can do that. She's taken a flight of ads out in Nevada, which has a significant Latino and African American population. We'll see what she can do there. ELVING: One point that Joe Biden made earlier tonight in his curious remarks and, really, in some respects, first to New Hampshire by recording and then to people in South Carolina live - he did make the point, though, that something like 99% of all the African Americans in America and something close to that of all the Hispanic Americans have yet to have an opportunity to vote in these primaries. They haven't had any kind of shot at all. So it's one thing to say we haven't seen a lot. The fact is we've scarcely seen any. So that really can have the potential to change things. But even Amy Klobuchar, and certainly Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, are making their appeal to those groups starting tonight. R MARTIN: Mara? LIASSON: You know, the problem for Amy Klobuchar - someone described it as going from a small ride-share company to becoming Uber overnight because it's almost an operational problem. MONTANARO: Well, Uber still doesn't make money. LIASSON: Well, OK. Well, I meant just being bigger. ELVING: But it's big. LIASSON: You get my point here. ELVING: She got a Lyft. Let's put it that way. LIASSON: Yeah. But she caught fire here. But now they're just going to come fast and furious. You've got Nevada. You've got South Carolina. Then, all of a sudden, humongous Super Tuesday states. Pete Buttigieg has a lot more money than she does, and she has to ramp up really fast. And she doesn't have a lot of foot in the African American community. She doesn't have a kind of natural constituency in either of the next two states. So that's going to be a challenge for her. R MARTIN: But are we going to see... LIASSON: But she's got momentum, and that's what the early states can give you. And now she has to do something with it. R MARTIN: Are we going to start to see some consolidation, though, as people look at Biden's very poor performance and are his supporters or his financial backers going to (unintelligible)? LIASSON: Well, here's the thing. The Biden campaign has been calming down their financial supporters and saying, just wait. Just at least be patient through South Carolina. And the thing about conventional wisdom - or as I always say, historical rules only work till they stop working. What we would normally think is, wow, somebody who finished the way he did in Iowa and New Hampshire, that's it. But he believes that he can have a fresh start in South Carolina and especially Super Tuesday when big portions of the electorate are African American. And he can really resurrect himself. MONTANARO: And his team likes their turnout operation in Nevada. He's... LIASSON: Yeah. MONTANARO: ...Big with the unions there. LIASSON: Yes, and the... MONTANARO: And there's a lot of early vote that's already... LIASSON: That's right. MONTANARO: ...Started and they've tried to bank some of that. (CROSSTALK) M MARTIN: Hold on a second. We've all said that Amy Klobuchar is one of the big stories of the night, so why don't we go now to Minnesota Public Radio News reporter Mark Zdechlik who is with the Klobuchar campaign in Concord. Mark, you there? MARK ZDECHLIK (BYLINE): I am. Senator Klobuchar just wrapped up about 20 minutes of speaking to supporters here in Concord. And she is very happy tonight, almost as though she had won the caucus - or the primary in New Hampshire. M MARTIN: And what about some of the people who are there with her? What are they saying? ZDECHLIK: Well, they're happy about it. They think that she's a good candidate. They buy her argument that she is electable, that she can win where President Trump won in 2016. And they think that more people will give her another look coming out of New Hampshire. Obviously, she did much better here or is on her way to doing much better here than she did in Iowa where she placed fifth. So this is kind of a restart for her, or it sure is looking like it's going to be. M MARTIN: We're hearing that among late deciders, Klobuchar seemed to be a popular choice, and a lot of people are attributing that to the strong debate performance that she had on Friday. When you talked to voters, what did they say? ZDECHLIK: That came up over and over. As the campaign manager told me tonight that they heard it over and over on the ground, and a lot of people - some exit polls showed that, you know, nearly half of the folks that voted today didn't make their minds up until the last couple of days. And the campaign says they heard it on the ground over and over that people were talking about her debate performance. I certainly heard it over and over from Democrats in New Hampshire that they think that she posted a very strong debate performance. That caused many people, I think, to take a much closer look at her and ultimately support her. M MARTIN: And from the Klobuchar campaign to the degree that you've had a chance to sort of report on this yet, what are they saying about what is next? Because, you know, they're coming from states - they've had, you know, stronger and stronger showings in states - you know, Iowa, then going to a stronger showing in New Hampshire. And she's from Minnesota which is - none of these are particularly diverse states. Let's just put it that way. And now they're going into completely different territory. Have they - what has the campaign said to you about how they're going to address this next phase where they really have to appeal to a different demographic than they have had to so far? ZDECHLIK: Well, the candidate says that she's going to be strong in Nevada, that she predicts that she'll do well. I don't know specifically how well she's (unintelligible) it, but she says strong in tourism. She's the head of this tourism caucus in the Senate. And she also says she has staff on the ground in Nevada. And when you talk to them about going forward, they will say things like, well, people never thought we'd get through our speech during a snowstorm or make it through the summer or get to Iowa, past Iowa and into New Hampshire. So they just say that they keep defying expectations, and their message is that they're going to continue to do that. M MARTIN: All right. That is Mark Zdechlik who is with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign in Concord. He is a political reporter for Minnesota Public Radio News. Mark, thanks so much for joining us. ZDECHLIK: You're welcome. R MARTIN: All right. Let's turn our attention to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg. He is currently coming in second as we look at results coming in from New Hampshire. Again, we don't have any official calls at this point, but he's doing well from his camp's perspective. We're going to talk with New Hampshire Congresswoman Ann Kuster who has endorsed Buttigieg, and she joins us now. Thanks so much for being here. ANN KUSTER (D-NH, REP): Great to be with you. R MARTIN: So Buttigieg had a strong showing in Iowa. They were quite pleased with the outcome there, coming in neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. And, as mentioned, he is currently, according to the numbers that we're seeing now, running in second place coming out of New Hampshire - again, no official calls yet. Is this where Pete Buttigieg wants to be in this moment? KUSTER: Well, I think it's going to tighten as the evening wears on. What you're seeing, he's holding his own with college students and those towns on the Vermont border where Bernie is very, very strong. But he's coming in stronger than expected in the southern tier. So some of the towns like Londonderry, Salem, Hampstead, these are towns along the Massachusetts border and over into the seacoast where he's well ahead of Sanders and well ahead of Klobuchar. So I think what you're going to see as the smaller towns come in, these numbers will tighten. We've got about a 2% gap that I'm looking at with 60% of the vote in - just off Bernie Sanders by under 3,000 votes. And I think that's a very strong showing when you consider that Bernie won 60% of the vote just four years ago. And, by the way, nobody in New Hampshire had ever heard of Pete Buttigieg, nor could they begin to say his name. So it's an exciting night for Pete. He had a very strong showing. I think the big surprise is, obviously, the late-breaking voters to Amy Klobuchar. R MARTIN: Right. KUSTER: She took a lot from Elizabeth Warren, who had had a very strong campaign in New Hampshire. That's a big surprising result. R MARTIN: How does that change things? KUSTER: And obviously... R MARTIN: I'm sorry to interrupt. KUSTER: ...With Joe Biden. R MARTIN: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but just with limited time, how does Amy Klobuchar's... KUSTER: Sure. R MARTIN: ...Momentum affect Pete Buttigieg? You could assume based on their policy prescriptions and the lanes that they have carved out for themselves in this primary race that they would be competing for somewhat of the same voters. KUSTER: Well, I think it's the discussion that you've been having on the air of whether or not she can keep up that momentum. Look; here's what I know about Pete. He has tens of millions of dollars. He has a 50-state organization. He's got dozens of staff and offices on the ground in - excuse me - Nevada and South Carolina. So he's going to go the distance. And hard to say - this is a little bit of a bump for Amy. New Hampshire's been historically very good to women candidates. I'm part of the first all-female delegation. So I think New Hampshire voters like to give female candidates a good outing. R MARTIN: Right. And you had two to choose from right now - and more. Tulsi Gabbard's still in the race. KUSTER: Exactly, exactly. R MARTIN: And you still went with Pete Buttigieg. KUSTER: Yep. I did because for me, temperament is a very big issue in this race. And I think I saw that - Pete and I have campaigned together over the weekend. We saw 10,000 voters with big, big crowds - 2,000 people down in Nashua, the anchor community to my district in the southern tier. And what I found - people were really responding to this argument. They're exhausted by the president. They're exhausted by the volatility and the divisiveness. They want a candidate who not only can win in November and put together this winning coalition, but a candidate that can turn the page and really make them proud of the presidency again and has the temperament. What I got to see up close and personally with Pete was how he's put together his campaign with the values that he leads with and just how he interacted with his staff. It was just an amazing experience behind the scenes. He's a very gentle person, a very kind, thoughtful person. He empowers his staff. And I think that's really important for the long haul of what these campaigns require. M MARTIN: Congressman Kuster, it's Michel Martin. It's a pleasure to talk to you again. So you just heard - since obviously you've been listening to the program, you heard one of President Trump's campaign managers speak to us earlier. And he says this is all about the economy - and the economy is doing very well - and all this temperament stuff isn't really relevant. Why do you think differently? KUSTER: Just from the turnout of the people that we saw, from the voters that we saw. The economy in New Hampshire is quite strong, but we have 2.4% unemployment. That's very, very low. And what you find is that wages are still extremely low, people having to take two or three jobs just to keep it together, to keep their family moving forward. So Pete's got a vision of the future with higher wages, better jobs, stronger community. Everyone has access to health care, tackle the climate change issue. And I think people were genuinely inspired by that. And I found it to be very exciting myself. But I think that temperament issue is going to be a big thing. It's going to carry through this campaign. As I say, people are just exhausted by this president. They want to be proud of the White House again. M MARTIN: I wish I had more time to ask you again about why you weren't more interested - being a part of a historic delegation yourself - the New Hampshire delegation, one of the few, if only, all-women delegations in the country. R MARTIN: We're going to have to hold that. M MARTIN: We want to talk about that again some other time. R MARTIN: This is Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. All right. She - I think we've got you still on the line. Congresswoman, are you still there? Do we still have Congresswoman Kuster? No. M MARTIN: No? R MARTIN: It appears that we're done with that conversation (laughter). M MARTIN: We threw her a curveball. R MARTIN: We did. M MARTIN: But it is interesting to contemplate that she did make history as part of this all-women delegation from New Hampshire, a state that is - I think a lot of people elsewhere in the country think of as very conservative, as very traditional. And here she is part of this historic moment, this sort of glass ceiling-breaking moment. And there were a number of women candidates to choose from... R MARTIN: Right. M MARTIN: ...Including her neighbor, Senator Elizabeth Warren... R MARTIN: Right. M MARTIN: ...From Massachusetts, and she still went with Mayor Buttigieg. R MARTIN: With Pete Buttigieg. Danielle, what did you make of that? She kept saying the word temperament. He's got the right temperament. KURTZLEBEN: I mean, look; a couple things to get at here. One thing is, most definitely, we - one of the most notable things about this field is that it has been so diverse, and yet, white men have led it for almost the entire time. There was a heartbeat where the RealClearPolitics polling average had Elizabeth Warren leading it. That was it. Now it is Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders who seem to be duking it out. Now, Pete Buttigieg, I will say, we should not forget he is an openly gay candidate, and that is a new kind of diversity we have in this race. But this represents to me such a turn for the Democratic Party because 2018 was, as we heard over and over again ad nauseum, that it was the year of the woman. Now, the Democrats not only elected a lot of women, but a lot - a very diverse slate of women. So to see Democrats take this hard turn back to white men really may speak to their anxiety about electability. But it is definitely maybe not something we all saw coming. M MARTIN: Can I just speak to Ron about this? Ron, you see - Ron Irving (ph) - Ron Elving, you see that the conservative media is trying to sort of make this all like the Democrats are all about identity politics. But President Trump makes appeals to identity, too, does he not? ELVING: One of the things that Donald Trump did very well in 2015 and 2016 was to re-energize people who felt that their particular identity, which happened to be the majority identity in the country at least in terms of Anglowhites, was being re-emphasized again and that he was going to go straight for their votes and be rather explicit about it. Now, in his most recent campaign utterances, he has seemingly been interested in suddenly reaching out to certain elements of the African American community. I think we'll see him do a lot more of that in the Hispanic community in the weeks and months ahead, having consolidated a pretty solid grip on the white vote, not that Republican candidates haven't been pulling the majority of that vote for some while. But he did more so than his predecessors. And it was enough to put him over the top. So this is something that you can describe it as identity when you're talking only about people who diverge from the majority or what has been the traditional majority, or you can describe it as identity going the other way as well. LIASSON: Well, Donald Trump is a master of white identity politics, and white identity politics right now are very powerful. But when he makes those appeals to African Americans or puts them in his ads, he's also appealing to white suburban women to show them he's not a racist. R MARTIN: Right. Lots more analysis and results to come. Stay with us. You are listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary, and it comes to you from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) M MARTIN: New Hampshire results are rolling in a little slower than expected. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. No official winner yet, but Bernie Sanders has held the lead all night. It's Pete Buttigieg in second place. Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are hovering in the single digits. And arguably the biggest story of the night, Amy Klobuchar in third place. She's been gaining steam in the polls lately after a strong debate performance Friday night. And tonight she is exceeding expectations again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KLOBUCHAR: Donald Trump's worst nightmare is that the people in the middle, the people who have had enough of the name-calling and the mudslinging, have someone to vote for in November. (APPLAUSE) R MARTIN: All right. So first place right now is too close to call, but Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are neck and neck, with Amy Klobuchar, as we noted, coming in third. Again we are waiting for a call in this race. And let's turn now to NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid who is with the Buttigieg campaign. Sounds like there's some chanting happening, Asma. KHALID: Yes, Buttigieg. R MARTIN: What's going on? KHALID: Buttigieg in the background. I mean, folks here are excited. The margins have been getting closer all night long here. And, you know, as you mentioned, the race is still too close to call. But our results right now show about just, like, a 2% lead for Bernie Sanders. And that's much closer than what the race was at just a couple hours ago. R MARTIN: Well, so people there, I mean - would Buttigieg be happy, presumably, if he came in in second or at this point, they'd like to come in at the top slot right now? KHALID: You know, I talked to a lot of supporters tonight and even leading up to the New Hampshire primary. And people consistently told me they felt like a second-place finisher would be really good. They do feel like Iowa and his strong finish at the Iowa caucuses kind of set really high expectations. But they also really acknowledge that Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by some 20-plus% in 2016. And so being a neighbor, it's hard to beat a neighbor they say. R MARTIN: Right. KHALID: But, you know, I think that they would like to have a strong second-place finish even. R MARTIN: Has the feeling changed there in the room, or is this what folks there were expecting? KHALID: You know, I think throughout the night, people have been feeling fairly excited. I talked to folks. And, you know, I think that they feel like Pete Buttigieg is the one who's the best able to unite the party. Overall, the campaign seems to feel really positive. They're looking at some of the exit polls that show when you're looking at the person who's best able to defeat Donald Trump, on that particular question, Pete Buttigieg seemed to do pretty well. I spoke to a number of voters. And, you know, some of them - what I thought was really interesting - kept going back to this comparison of Barack Obama. And this is a comparison that the Buttigieg campaign has been trying to message for a long time. And it was interesting to me that this is something that they hear. I talked to one woman. Her name is Marianne Howley (ph), and she kept going back to the fact that Pete Buttigieg really reminds her of that former President Barack Obama. MARIANNE HOWLEY (PETE BUTTIGIEG SUPPORTER): I look at Barack Obama. It was the same thing. They said, you don't have an experience. He's just got the spark. R MARTIN: Spark. KHALID: But I think, Rachel, this is a really interesting argument because while this is messaging that the campaign has really tried to push, that this is the new Barack Obama - he is young; he may not have the experience as some of the other candidates in the field - it is a message that works with white voters in New Hampshire. It is a message that I am very doubtful will resonate as strongly once we get to South Carolina. R MARTIN: Right. A very different demographic, a significant African American vote. And Pete Buttigieg has been polling around 0 to 1%, tops, with that population. If we could just kind of pull back and broaden the aperture, Asma, look at the big picture. You've seen a number of candidates recently. How does Buttigieg's strong performance affect the so-called moderate candidates? I mean, how does it affect a Joe Biden? How does it affect an Amy Klobuchar who is doing well right now? KHALID: Yeah, I mean, I think in some ways, you can make the argument the other way around. You know, how does this strong Amy Klobuchar performance tonight affect Pete Buttigieg? I met a number of people at both Buttigieg and Klobuchar events who told me that they were torn between these two candidates. Her strong debate performance Friday night seems to have resonated with some folks here. And so given how tight the race is at this point and given how many people seem to be really interested in Amy Klobuchar in just the last couple of days, I am really curious that, you know, could there have been a situation where Buttigieg would potentially be doing even better had she not seen a kind of recent uptick in momentum? But to your point about Joe Biden, look. I think it's really interesting. People, you know, I think initially told me they had been leaning towards Joe Biden but moved towards either Pete Buttigieg... (CHEERING) R MARTIN: Something's going on there, Asma. KHALID: They are... R MARTIN: Something's going on. KHALID: They are excited, but no candidate yet. R MARTIN: OK. KHALID: We do not have a Pete Buttigieg. But, you know, look. I think, Rachel, the argument that Joe Biden's camp has been making for a while now about the diversity is really a point that shouldn't be sort of undersold. I mean, no Democratic presidential candidate has gone on to be the nominee of the party who has not won a majority of black voters since 1988. I mean, that's decades at this point. And so, you know, the party has diversified. The country has diversified since then. And I do think that if you look forward, as good of a night as Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar might have here in New Hampshire, they have a difficult path when you get to South Carolina and some of the more diverse states on Super Tuesday. R MARTIN: Right. We should just note the president is watching the results coming out of New Hampshire. President Trump tweeted out recently, (reading) Buttigieg is doing pretty well tonight, giving - and I'm quoting here - \"giving crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!\" I want to pivot, though, before I let you go, Asma, and ask about Elizabeth Warren because it's not a good result for her tonight. And she is - this is her backyard. KHALID: It is. It's her backyard. We're in the Boston media market, and I say this as someone who used to live in Boston. I mean, Boston and New Hampshire are really - they're tight neighbors. I would argue they're even tighter in some ways than Vermont is to New Hampshire because of the media market overflow. She had been spending a lot of resources and energy in the state. As of now, you know, she has less than 10% of the vote. That would mean that she would finish with no delegates from New Hampshire. And I do think it is an extremely difficult path for her forward if she does not really do well in her neighboring state. That all being said, though, I think, you know, when you talk about her night tonight, she talked a lot about being a unifier. I think that, you know, she has invested a lot in some of the more diverse states, in Nevada and South Carolina. And perhaps she sees an opening in the fact that a lot of candidates in this field have not invested so much in some of those diverse states. And I think part of the difficulty she has had is that for a long time, she was competing with Bernie Sanders early on in this primary cycle. And largely, the progressive vote has come home to Bernie Sanders and decided to stick with him. R MARTIN: All right. All right. NPR's Asma Khalid with the Buttigieg camp. Thanks, Asma. We appreciate it. KHALID: You're welcome. M MARTIN: Speaking of what Rachel said earlier, widening the lens, we're going to go to Reverend Leah Daughtry now. She's pastor of the House of the Lord Church in Washington, D.C. But we're going to her in her capacity as a strategist. She was the chief executive officer of the 2016 and the 2008 Democratic National Convention committee. And she's a former DNC chief of staff. Reverend Daughtry, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. LEAH DAUGHTRY (FORMER CEO, 2008 AND 2016 DNC COMMITTEES): Thank you. Glad to be here. M MARTIN: Well, let's just kind of go straight to the point. You've expressed frustration over the primary calendar, Iowa and New Hampshire going first - not the most diverse states by any means. On the one hand, Barack Obama got a big boost out of Iowa because, you know, the argument was made that if he could make the case there and persuade voters there, then that boded well for the rest of the field. So what are you seeing now about this? What are your thoughts about this now given what we see, given the field and what's happened so far? DAUGHTRY: Well, you know, I maintain my concerns about the two of the whitest and the smallest states in the union really going first and having such an outsized impact on what happens in the rest of the state. So tonight, we have New Hampshire with its 24 delegates, fewer than Iowa and really just about 1% of the delegates that you need to win the nomination. And yet what happened - what is happening tonight is being prognosticating and seen as some sort of prediction of what should happen in the rest of the race. And I just think that's unfortunate given its lack of representation of Latino voters of African American voters who everyone knows you cannot win the Democratic nomination without the African American vote. So if anything, I think what this cycle is showing, especially given the diversity of our candidates - and you know we've got center-left. You figure, you know - pick a candidate, and there's somebody for you - you know, is that we really got to go and examine the placement of these two states and literally time to shake up the calendar. M MARTIN: What are you seeing so far, just what - just given what you've seen so far, how the primary is shaping up compared to 2008 and 2016? DAUGHTRY: You know, it's interesting. One of the things that I noticed tonight - and of course, New Hampshire's still too close to call. And the last number, 71% in is Sanders with 26% of the vote and Buttigieg fast closing at 24.2% - 2 percentage points separating them - is that, you know, I worry all of the pundits, all of the numbers would indicate that turnout is flat, right? We haven't seen the surge of Democratic voters going to the polls. And I think that's got to be a little concerning for all of us who are counting on huge numbers coming out of November. And that's just not happening. If I'm the Sanders campaign, I'm a little concerned that, you know, I've got 26% of the vote. And maybe that's a win, but that means 74% of Democratic voters tonight did not support my candidacy. And so I'm worried - I'd be worried about what my turnout machine really looks like. And where is the vaunted Sanders turnout machine, which we've all been waiting for and anticipating? It just doesn't seem to have materialized either in Iowa or in New Hampshire. So I think, you know, those sorts of things don't bode well. It makes me nervous when turnout is flat in this kind of year. And I don't know who the candidate is that's going to emerge from all of this and able to galvanize and unify all of us. I would say to Warren, I'd be - you know, I'm disappointed. I thought she'd do better in a neighboring state. But for her and for Biden, who both are in single digits, don't get out. You still have the vat of South Carolina and then the Super Tuesday states, where you really will begin to see the race settling because, again, it's all about the delegate count and who's going to get to the magic number of 1,991 to become the nominee. M MARTIN: Can I ask you, why do you think the turnout isn't as robust as a lot of people thought that it would be? Just as you just said, that everybody's got somebody to like in this, I mean, from a Democratic perspective. There are all different kinds of perspectives there. I mean, obviously some of the candidates a lot of people were excited about have already dropped out. Kamala Harris, the senator from California has already dropped out. Cory Booker has dropped out, and as of tonight Andrew Yang has dropped out. So why do you think it hasn't been as robust as a lot of people would hoping that it would be? DAUGHTRY: You know, I think there are two sides of this. One is, you know, people are still deciding. A lot of the voters who we've seen break in Iowa and in New Hampshire decided very late, some in just a couple of days before the primary. There's so many options. You know, it's like me at a furniture store. There are too many couches, and so I just turn around and walk out because it's too many to choose from. But it's also, I think, you know, if you look at it on the flip side, where most Democratic voters are saying they will vote for whoever the nominee is. People may just say it doesn't matter because if I can vote for anybody, I'll just wait and see who it is. And, you know, I don't have a favorite. So I'll just sit this out, and whoever emerges is the one I'm going to vote for. M MARTIN: I want to go back to you mentioned that you don't think Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden should drop out. Stay in it. Why do you say that? DAUGHTRY: Because you have only - we've only heard from 2 out of 57 contests, in two states with the smallest number of delegates. So you still have New Hampshire - I'm sorry - South Carolina, which is 60% African American in the electorate. You have Nevada, which has a huge charge of Latino voters, who haven't had their say yet. And so for anyone to get out now without giving the backbone of the party, the African American vote, and also the Latino, the growing - fastest-growing segment of the Democratic Party, a chance to have their say and put their imprimatur on this race is too soon. And, you know, I would be disappointed if either one of them were to not wait to see what those segments of the electorate would have to say. M MARTIN: Are you at all surprised by the fact that Warren and Biden seem to have fallen off the pace? I mean, they were - both of them - I know we spoke earlier - we spoke a couple of months ago. And you noted that Elizabeth Warren was sort of striking a real chord with some of the audiences that you had seen her in, that she seemed to really resonate with people in a way that perhaps surprised some people. And of course, Joe Biden has his long track record. Are you surprised that some - that their campaigns at this point don't seem to be as - I don't know - it's just - have the spark that I think a lot of people thought that they would. DAUGHTRY: Yeah, I am surprised more about Warren than I am about Biden. But I think with Warren, I'm not - I've got to do some analysis on this. I'm not quite sure what happened. I think it's, you know, one is the constant battering around Medicare, around her health care plan, was she was, you know, backed into a corner and forced to answer questions about costs and details that other candidates were not required to answer. I think in the perceived flip-flop or the perceived divergence of one of her initial plan from the secondary plan, you know, kind of left people, I think, a little disenchanted. I think the thing with her saying that Sanders said a woman couldn't win, you know, put sort of a lightning rod up for folks who then may not have had an opinion, but now did have an opinion. And I think we just can't discount the impact of sexism and misogyny in the campaign. I think it was evident in Iowa where her speech wasn't even covered live. M MARTIN: Well, we have to leave it there for now. Thank you so much for joining us to give us your take on things. That's the Reverend Leah Daughtry. She was the chief executive officer of the DNC committee in 2016 and 2008. R MARTIN: All right. I'm going to bring in another voice here, Humberto Sanchez. He is Washington correspondent for The Nevada Independent. He is in Washington, D.C., tonight. Humberto, thanks for being with us. HUMBERTO SANCHEZ (JOURNALIST, THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT): Thanks for having me. R MARTIN: You're going to help us look forward because even though we don't have a call in the New Hampshire primary, we do have some results that give us a picture of what the race might look like in the Democratic primary in the state of Nevada. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are neck and neck right now. Bernie Sanders has made Latino voters a real focus of his campaign. That's going to be important for him in Nevada. How does it look for him there? SANCHEZ: It looks not bad. Sanders has a pretty big staff, about 150 people in Nevada. And he's going to have momentum if he wins this out of New Hampshire. And so it's going to be - it's going to be pretty interesting to see how he does. The one thing in particular is, as you said, it's - as you guys were talking about, that, you know, that the Latino electorate is about 29% of the vote in Nevada. And also African Americans make up 10% in Asian and Pacific Islanders make up 9%. And so that's a significant chunk right there. So this will be of a very kind of make-or-break I think going - especially going into South Carolina for folks. R MARTIN: I want to ask about Joe Biden. He moved from New Hampshire to South Carolina. That's where his focus is right now. But what does he look like in Nevada? What are the polls saying there? SANCHEZ: He has led in the polls and on average in Nevada for quite some time. And Bernie Sanders has come in - he's been in second place in those polls. But Joe Biden has really staked his camp on Nevada. And it's - again, it's a more diverse electorate than Iowa or New Hampshire. And so if he does really well, which he's looking to do, that will catapult him into South Carolina, which is really his bedrock support there. And that would be a huge boon for him because he needs to get some points on the board. R MARTIN: Real quick, we've got a question from my colleague Danielle Kurtzleben. KURTZLEBEN: Hey there. So I know that polling in Nevada is notoriously difficult for a variety of reasons, as I'm sure you know. How difficult does that make it for you to report on this and for really any of us to know or expect what might happen coming out of Nevada? SANCHEZ: It's really tough. My boss, Jon Ralston, likes to say this is a constantly self-evaluating process, so anything that's 24 hours old is old. And so - so we talk to a lot of campaigns and a lot of voters and just try to keep our pulse - our finger on the pulse in that way. R MARTIN: Plus you guys are the second caucus in the nation after all the problems in Iowa. I imagine there are lots of precautions being taken there. SANCHEZ: Today, actually a representative, Dina Titus, told me that she's worried about the party being able to finish counting early voting ballots in time in a timely manner. Nevada is going to have early voting in its caucus, which is the first time I think it's ever been done in a caucus. It's going to happen for four days before the caucus. So we're going to keep an eye on that. The party says it's in a good spot right now. R MARTIN: OK. We're going to have to leave it there. Humberto Sanchez of The Nevada Independent. You're listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) R MARTIN: Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are vying for first place in New Hampshire. This is live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. Sanders has had a comfortable lead for most of the night. But Pete Buttigieg has closed some of that gap. Meanwhile, Amy Klobuchar made a surprise jump to third place. Elizabeth Warren wound up in a disappointing fourth, disappointing for her campaign. And Joe Biden left New Hampshire in fifth place. He flew to South Carolina, where he's hoping to do better later this month. He told his supporters there that a more diverse population in their state and in Nevada will turn his campaign around. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Because up till now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituents in the Democratic Party, the African American community and the fast - and the fastest-growing segment of society, the Latino community. (APPLAUSE) M MARTIN: Let's go to Domenico Montanaro. We're going to talk about some of the things that I think are probably on people's minds right now, which is the first is, why haven't we gotten results yet? MONTANARO: So impatient. My goodness. M MARTIN: (Laughter). MONTANARO: It's very close. I mean, you have Bernie Sanders at 26.2% of the vote, Pete Buttigieg on his heels with 24%, Amy Klobuchar a little further back at 20, but a very good showing for Amy Klobuchar. The thing I think we should mention is since it was at about 64% - now it's 69% of all the precincts reporting - Bernie Sanders has upped his lead by about 1,200 votes. So he's gotten some vote in. There's still a lot of vote out in Nashua, N.H., which is on the of Massachusetts, fairly populous place. So, you know, I imagine that that's where a lot of the decision desks are focusing on right now, an area like that, and in some of the in-between places because there's still some vote out in a lot of those spots as well. M MARTIN: And a lot of times, results come in late because there's a big turnout, and people just, you know - and so has that been the case here? Because we heard our guest earlier just a few minutes ago say not really. What are you seeing? MONTANARO: Yeah, frankly, no. I mean, this is kind of - again this is take two for the Democrats, and again the turnout appears to be lackluster. I mean, unless there's some huge surge in this last, you know, 30% of the vote in these precincts, right now they're only tracking for about 235,000 votes from my back-of-the-envelope math. It was about 250,000 earlier in the night. So, you know, you could see it sort of in between there. Two-fifty, just to put it in context, is more along the lines of 2016 turnout than 2008. 2008 was the record, which is about 288,000 votes. That's exactly what we saw in Iowa. That's exactly what Leah Daughtry was concerned about, said makes her nervous as a Democrat, and said where's this vaunted Sanders turnout operation? M MARTIN: And talk a little bit more about that. Is that mainly a problem for Sanders because that's his theory of the case, that he's bringing these new voters here? Or is that a problem for Democrats overall? MONTANARO: You know, I think it's a problem for Democrats overall to start with. But secondly, when you look at what Sanders' campaign had pushed us all to out of Iowa, which was this jump in young voter turnout, those under 30 in Iowa, that's not been reflected here in New Hampshire. So far, the exit polls have shown a far lower number of young voters coming out, those 18 to 29 than in 2016. 2016 was about 1 in 5 voters were young voters, tonight really only about 11%. LIASSON: Yeah, and the exits also showed that - lower first-time voters... MONTANARO: Right. LIASSON: ...Than before. MONTANARO: Only 12%. LIASSON: And that was the thing that Sanders was saying - I'm going to bring people in who have never voted before. But, you know, it's interesting 'cause when I was in New Hampshire and the crowds seemed smaller and people were predicting not a great turnout, the spin that you got from Democrats were, well, that's because people are paralyzed by indecision. They feel this is so important. They can't decide who would beat Donald Trump. But being paralyzed by indecision and not turning out is really the same thing as not finding anyone that excites you enough to turn out. And that is a bad thing for Democrats. M MARTIN: Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: But that's a thing - you've kind of gotten at the thing that I've been wondering. What else could it be? Because a thing that we saw in 2018, for example, was Democrats very energized. So what has happened? LIASSON: None of these candidates are great. KURTZLEBEN: That - that's it? LIASSON: I think it's as simple as that. MONTANARO: Well, and also I think in Iowa what we saw is... LIASSON: Or they all have big flaws. MONTANARO: In Iowa, a lot of the undecided voters may have stayed home because they're frankly fine with a lot of these candidates. They weren't able to decide. I saw an interview with one person who voted today and said she made her decision by eeny meeny miny mo. You know, that's just something else, I mean, to be able to do that. M MARTIN: Well, in fairness though, one sees - admittedly, Washington, D.C., is a special place - OK? - and it leans very Democratic. But one sees posters around town saying, any functioning adult in 2020. So could it be that? ELVING: But you can't go out and vote for any functioning adult, right? There has to be somebody who motivates you to go out and actually pull a lever, to actually get in line, to actually make the sacrifice of some of your time. Now, here in New Hampshire, it's not anything like what it is in Iowa, where you have to go out at night and invest a lot of time and stand around for a long time and then not get the results. These people expect to get a result tonight, and I'm sure that they will. Although, it may be a lot closer than some of the people were expecting. KURTZLEBEN: This is one thing I want to... LIASSON: Well, when you look at the head-to-head matchups, you know who does the best against Donald Trump? Generic Dem. ELVING: Generic Democrat. LIASSON: Generic Dem. Guess what? Generic Dem decided not to run this year. ELVING: Well, that's the thing that... KURTZLEBEN: Well, one thing... M MARTIN: But does that mean - but does that mean that there are people who just say, look, it doesn't matter who they pick. I'm going to vote for whatever Democrat is there... (CROSSTALK) LIASSON: That is what Democrats are hoping. ELVING: That's the positive spin. LIASSON: But no, but this is true. R MARTIN: Danielle. Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: This is something - I talked to a lot of voters in Iowa, and I asked pretty much every one of them, who do you like this race? And you'd hear any number of answers of who they liked and who they found acceptable. I would ask every single one, are there any Democrats you could not vote for? And earlier in the cycle, you would have - I would have people say to me - and this is anecdotal - I'd have people say to me, I don't know about Bernie Sanders. At this point, I don't know if I had anybody in the last month in Iowa tell me there's no one in this field I could vote for or that I would not vote for. LIASSON: These are people who are at candidate events? KURTZLEBEN: Yes, these are - yes. LIASSON: So these are people... KURTZLEBEN: Which means they're motivated. I get this. LIASSON: Yes, yes, yes, yes. KURTZLEBEN: And, yes, absolutely. Now, on the flip side is this. I was just looking at some polling today. There is a new poll from Gallup that found that 45% of the electorate says they could not vote for a socialist. Now, that is a generic socialist, but that is a very potential weakness for Bernie Sanders in the general. LIASSON: That's what the Trump campaign is going to do - make every Democrat into a generic socialist if they can. M MARTIN: Well, let's bring Scott Detrow into this conversation. He's with the Sanders party in Manchester, N.H. Scott, can you hear us? DETROW: I can hear you. How's it going? M MARTIN: All right. All right. Well, you tell us. I mean (laughter)... DETROW: There is - I would say the excitement has turned into anxiousness here. Everyone here is still confident, but we're talking about that pretty tight margin, folks on the Sanders campaign pointing out a lot of cities that they think they're - places that they think they'd do well still have not reported, including the town of Durham, which is a college town and the site of a massive rally last night with about 8,000 people coming out. So that's one particular precinct they're very excited to have report here. But, yeah, this is a tight race. And for the second time in a row, Bernie Sanders is the leading candidate - or one of the two leading candidates, going back to Iowa. He's doing pretty well. But again, there are pros and cons if you look at it from the Sanders campaign's perspective. And I think one of the biggest cons is something that Mara and everybody else has talked about a lot tonight - that if you add up all the votes going to more moderate candidates, it far outpaces Bernie Sanders' vote total, and Elizabeth Warren's as well. But the thing is, as that lane continues to be muddled, continues to be a traffic jam, he is moving on to places where he feels like his campaign is well-organized, particularly in Nevada. And then the March 3 states - Super Tuesday - where a third of the delegates are up for grabs, his campaign is far ahead above anybody else except Mike Bloomberg in terms of money spent and organization there. M MARTIN: OK, but... DETROW: But. M MARTIN: ...Is it still too close for comfort for the Sanders campaign? He got 60% of the vote there four years ago. DETROW: Yes. M MARTIN: He won the 2016 New Hampshire primary by more than 20 points. You've told us that he's mentioned that a few times over the past few days... DETROW: Yeah. M MARTIN: ...But in what context? I mean, managing expectations? What's he trying to say there? DETROW: He was trying to say that he thought that that 2016 win was an enormous moment for his 2016 campaign and validated him as a national presidential candidate, a national leader on the progressive left. But again, let's go back to about a year ago, right? And the conversation was Bernie Sanders gave Hillary Clinton a much-better-than-expected challenge, but what would he do in a fragmented field like this? He has consolidated a lot more of the progressive vote than I think a lot of people expected, especially given how strong Elizabeth Warren ran for most of last year. But, yeah, it's a much larger field, and he is getting nowhere near the chunk of the vote that he earned in 2016. And I think that would be the case going forward. LIASSON: And I think it's possible that Bernie Sanders could finish this night having been the candidate who won the biggest margin in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire and the smallest margin in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire. ELVING: In history, in history. DETROW: (Laughter) I think any candidate... LIASSON: In history, in the history. ELVING: Yes, in history. LIASSON: Yeah, yeah. MONTANARO: Let me give you... MILES PARKS (BYLINE): His campaign likes to win (ph). R MARTIN: OK, Domenico, quickly. MONTANARO: Let me give you a number here. Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire right now has 26.3% of the vote. Anybody remember what he got in Iowa? I mean... LIASSON: Sixty - 60-something... MONTANARO: Well, no. ELVING: No, no. We're talking about Iowa last week. MONTANARO: Twenty-six-point-one percent of the vote in Iowa. LIASSON: Oh, I thought you were talking about last time in New Hampshire. I'm sorry. MONTANARO: Right. So what I'm pointing out here is that he's very close to the exact margin or the exact total of vote percentage that he got in Iowa. The question here - and this is, again, what we talked about earlier this evening about the Warren campaign putting out that memo saying that Bernie Sanders has a hard ceiling, he can't unify the party. Bernie Sanders, we have to point out - right now, he has the inside track to this nomination. ELVING: Yeah. MONTANARO: He is the favorite at this point because the moderates are not able... LIASSON: Yep. MONTANARO: ...To coalesce. And the further along this gets and the more this becomes a delegate race, the Sanders campaign has the advantage unless the moderates get behind one person. PARKS: And let me... MONTANARO: But is Sanders just at that 26% of the vote, or can he get higher than that? PARKS: I think that's... R MARTIN: So... LIASSON: High ceiling, low - so he has a... ELVING: A low - high floor, low ceiling. LIASSON: ...Low ceiling, high floor. R MARTIN: Everybody, take a pause because I want to bring in Miles Parks into the conversation. We keep saying that Bernie Sanders is on top right now, but we don't know, Miles, because they have not made a call. PARKS: They have not. There's only about 71% of precincts reporting at this point. R MARTIN: I mean, are we supposed to be grateful that at least we're getting some results, unlike Iowa, where things at this point in the night were incredibly chaotic? PARKS: I mean, I'm grateful. R MARTIN: (Laughter). PARKS: I mean, it's really nice to look at real numbers as opposed to just getting, you know, hours go by, and then, you know, the tweets are flying. And, you know, by this time, not only did we not have results, but we were seeing disinformation flowing on social media. People were really confused. It was a truly chaotic event a week ago. R MARTIN: So how does New Hampshire do things differently? I mean, first off, it's a primary, not a caucus. PARKS: Right, exactly. And that's really the biggest difference, which kind of trickles down to all of the election infrastructure. It's kind of two big things. One is the people running the election. Last week, we had people - the party was actually in charge of all of this stuff. This time around, you've got election officials, people who actually - you know, an amazing concept - do this for a living. These are people who get practice every two years. This state votes for a new governor every two years. They have practice running elections. And then secondarily, the technology they're using isn't new. R MARTIN: All right. Miles Parks, thank you. We're going to go now to Pete Buttigieg talking to his supporters in New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) M MARTIN: We're going to leave former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg for a moment and go to Bernie Sanders, who is currently leading the New Hampshire primary. And this is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders talking to his supporters now. (SOUNDBITE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY) R MARTIN: That was Bernie Sanders, feeling very confident. He is in first place right now in the in the New Hampshire primary race. It is too early for the Associated Press to call that race, but Bernie Sanders there giving what amounts to a victory speech. I want to turn to NPR's Scott Detrow and NPR's Asma Khalid. So, Scott, you are there. You are there with Senator Sanders in the room with his supporters. Just tell me, what's the vibe? DETROW: Roaring crowd, chanting Bernie beats Trump, chanting for policy items like a Green New Deal. I think the biggest cheer was when Sanders said this is the beginning of the end of President Trump's presidency. It was notable to me that earlier on, the crowd had some pretty loud boos for Pete Buttigieg as he was giving his speech on the TV monitor, but they all cheered along when Sanders made a point. It was noticeable that both Buttigieg and Sanders paused in their speeches tonight to say, I will support the eventual nominee of the party. I hope it's me, but we're all going to get together at the end of this. R MARTIN: Right. And this was something - I mean, Bernie Sanders was expected to do well here. So he - it would have been news had he not performed well. DETROW: I think that's the case. But I still think in a crowded field, he is the person who seems to be emerging victorious. And that's a big deal for his campaign. I mean, we have talked a lot about the challenges his campaign faces going forward. Two contests in a row, he consolidated a little more than a quarter of the vote. The question is, can he get more than that? But what's working in his favor is that it is a very muddled field on the other side of the ideological spectrum here. And no candidate looks poised to break through to be the main candidate challenging him. And so if that continues, Sanders has a strong case to make in Nevada, South Carolina and especially on March 3, when, again, a third of the delegates are coming up. And there's not much time for a moderate alternative to emerge as the main one at this point in time. M MARTIN: So let's go to Asma Khalid, who is at Buttigieg headquarters, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., spoke earlier just before 11. And I have to note that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders kind of interrupted his speech or went on the air while he was still talking. So, Asma, we missed a little bit of the mayor's sort of closing remarks. But just tell us, you know, what did we miss? KHALID: I mean, largely this was a really optimistic speech. I mean, he talked about trying to be a unifier, which is something a lot of his supporters praise him about. He gave this kind of vent against ideological purity tests. And this is, again, something he's been talking about for a while, that you can't defeat the most divisive president modern history if you're going to be tearing down folks within your own party, people who don't agree with you 100% of the time. And then he talked about moving onwards, moving on to Nevada, moving on to South Carolina. And, you know, he made a number of references to different, you know, racial groups, whether they're immigrants on the border, women in hijab, folks who feel, you know, discriminated against. And one thing that's interesting is, you know, all of these messages - even though this was a largely white crowd - received kind of, like, large rounds of applause here. You know, a lot of those messages do resonate with white Democrats in the party. M MARTIN: OK. Asma, looking also looking ahead to Nevada and South Carolina, what's the campaign telling you? What is the Buttigieg campaign telling you about what they think their path is in Nevada and South Carolina? I mean, resources haven't been a problem yet. KHALID: No, I mean, resources are not a problem. And so, you know, they will point to the fact that they are better staffed in South Carolina and Nevada than a candidate like Amy Klobuchar, who also performed pretty well tonight. So they feel optimistic in that regard. But again, they see this as a race for the long haul. You know, I know that it's widely expected, and I think they expect, you know, Joe Biden to do pretty well in South Carolina. But they feel that they have the resources to take this fight on for a while. And I would certainly expect them to be in this race for a while. But look, I think I agree with Scott when he says that Bernie Sanders really did have a good night. I mean, I don't sort of agree with the idea that just because he didn't win by 20 points, this wasn't a good night. I don't think anyone expected him to win by 20 points. There were just a lot more candidates running this time around. But while the moderates fight and try to figure out which one should be the moderate candidate to take on Bernie Sanders, the fragmentation definitely benefits Sanders at this point. R MARTIN: Asma, thank you. We appreciate that. I want to turn to NPR's Domenico Montanaro, who has been poring over the results as we get them in - again too close to call. But Bernie Sanders right now looks to be edging out Pete Buttigieg by a couple of percentage points. What was - do we know, Domenico, what turnout was like? MONTANARO: Well, I think this is something we should talk about because the turnout seemed to spike. It had a bit of an upswing after we got about 70% of the vote in. It looked like turnout was going to be flat, about the same as 2016, maybe even a little less. But it looks like they may actually get to or become - or come close to the 2008 record at this point. Two-hundred-and-eighty-eight thousand was the record at that point, and we're at about, you know, 250,000 or so with about 20% of the precincts reporting left. So sometimes that happens where you have a percentage of precincts that are reporting, but the number of votes that are actually left within some of those precincts are larger than the overall share of the percentage. R MARTIN: And Ron, Democrats have been saying that this is their game. Turnout is their game. They want people to come. They've been trying to animate an anti-Trump message. The hard part is getting it to coalesce around one candidate. ELVING: It's all a question of what you're comparing it to. If you're talking about 2008, that was a huge enthusiasm election. George H. - and George W. Bush, rather, was rather unpopular at that point. You had the first African American candidate to get as far as he did in Barack Obama. You had Hillary Clinton becoming, at that time, people thought, the first woman president - enormous enthusiasm for those two candidates. And they weren't the only candidates in the field. That's when we set this record. 2016, we came way down. There was a lot of anti-Hillary feeling, as well as pro-Hillary feeling. And Bernie Sanders beat her by 23% points. He was over 60% of the vote. Tonight, he's at about a quarter of the vote, maybe just a hair over a quarter of the vote. So he's lost most of the percentage that he had in 2016. So that's a little different picture of momentum for Bernie Sanders. Although he clearly does have, as Domenico said, the inside track at this point because it's not easy to see what other candidate is going to get in front of him at this point. LIASSON: Right. Yeah... M MARTIN: Mara Liasson, so we haven't called this race because the Associated Press, whose guidance we take, has not called this ratio. But, Mara, what do you think we've learned tonight? LIASSON: Well, what we've learned, I agree, Bernie Sanders is the front-runner. He's not a prohibitive front-runner, but he is the front-runner, right now, best path to get a plurality of delegates, get the most delegates, as long as the center-left lane doesn't coalesce around one candidate. Republicans could never do that in 2016 against Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn't win a majority, I think very few, if any, primaries. Of course, they had a winner-take-all system. So he got all the delegates, but he never got a majority of Republicans on his side. So the big takeaway for me is Democratic voters, not quite ready yet to resolve this race or even to make it super clear. They still have a lot of candidates trying to be the center-left alternative to Bernie Sanders. It tells me that just - I don't want to diminish Sanders' victory at all. But if he squeaked it out by 1-point-something percent, I mean, it tells you that what he did last time was maybe more about the opposition to Hillary than it was about a positive response to his vision of democratic socialism. M MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: One thing about his speech tonight, he was extremely clear. He sticks to the issues. He's going to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industries and the military industrial complex. I mean, he - corporate America is his enemy... R MARTIN: He is consistent. LIASSON: He's very... R MARTIN: He is remarkably consistent. LIASSON: ...Consistent. And he's going to make he - he wants to pass mandatory Medicare for All, and he's going to get a chance to see if Americans, writ large, not just in New Hampshire and Iowa, want that, too. R MARTIN: Right. Ron. ELVING: It's important in these things to look at the arc, to look at where we're going in terms of trend line. Ten days ago, it looked pretty likely that Bernie Sanders was going to be in the driver's seat in Iowa by quite a bit and that he was going to be certainly in the driver's seat in New Hampshire because that was his neighboring state where he was so strong four years ago. And if you had said 10 days ago that he was going to squeak by in Iowa, maybe - because we still don't have the final results from Iowa - we still don't know exactly what happened. And he probably didn't get the most delegates. And then he was going to have a less-than-2% win and maybe one more delegate out of New Hampshire, that kind of squeaking, that's not the one-two punch he was planning to land. R MARTIN: Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: One thing I would add here is, as we're looking ahead - is that South Carolina, along with New Hampshire and Iowa, those are three states with the lowest unemployment in the country. South Carolina has the lowest unemployment in the country, which makes those three states - it means that those mirror the conditions that Democrats are going to be contending with in the general election because Donald Trump, as we know, as we heard tonight, is going to go on and on, understandably, about the low national unemployment. Now, on the one hand, you can make the case - and I have heard this from voters who have gone to especially Sanders and Warren events. You can make the case that with low unemployment, that gives them space to talk about these structural things because you talk to a lot of people who say, I have a job, but I don't have health insurance, but I have literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt. M MARTIN: I'm having flashbacks here because I remember when Bill Bradley - remember him? - the former New Jersey senator, made a brief run for the presidency, that was his argument. You fix the roof when the sun is shining. KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Yeah, and that is a - that is the argument that you could say that Sanders and Warren are making. And one thing that you could say in South Carolina and an argument you may hear candidates making is that, you know, listen, unemployment is low here. But here, as in the rest of the country, black unemployment, for example, is much higher than it is... LIASSON: Well, Donald Trump will say it's lower than it used to be. But one thing about the - it's hard in a good economy for the opposition party to make a good argument. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. LIASSON: You cannot convince people the economy is bad if they don't think it is, and you can't convince them it's good if they don't think it is. But what you can say is, hey, you have a job, but you still can't pay for housing, health care, college or retirement. KURTZLEBEN: This is... M MARTIN: But is that really what we heard tonight from the candidates as they were giving their remarks concluding the evening, whatever the results were? Didn't most of them really make arguments about temperament, tone and the condition of the country kind of culturally? Wasn't that really what most of them were saying? LIASSON: Bernie was... KURTZLEBEN: Except for Sanders. M MARTIN: Except for Sanders. KURTZLEBEN: And I will say this about Bernie Sanders, also, is I mean, like, it is clear - and we all know this - he has appealed, largely - or not - he has appealed in a big way disproportionately to young voters. Well, those are young voters who may have jobs, but who graduated, came of age during a recession and many of whom instinctively feel that, yeah, I have a job, but the economy is broken, even if the economy isn't, quote, unquote, \"bad.\" Now the problem... LIASSON: For them, they're right. KURTZLEBEN: Right. And so the problem then is do they turn out in a general election, which - shrug. I don't know. R MARTIN: Do we know how Bernie Sanders' coalition of voters have changed since 2016? LIASSON: It's gotten smaller. MONTANARO: I mean, they - well, I mean, they haven't really changed all that much as far as the core goes. I mean, his core is young voters, I mean, under 30. He's very strong with them. And I mean, he is so strong with them, it's to the point where I'm not sure if they would vote for another candidate. You know, a lot of them, I mean, tonight in the exit polls, you saw about 13% said that they would not vote for another candidate overall of people in the field. So, you know, that's a significant percentage of the people who turned out to vote. And I would venture to guess that a lot of them are Sanders fans. And, you know, that is the difficulty of a big-tent party trying to keep that coalition together. We saw some of the issues with that at the last convention in 2016 when the Sanders campaign felt like they had the system rigged against them. R MARTIN: They were angry. KURTZLEBEN: Very. MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, some - I think a lot of people would argue it wasn't rigged against them. But, you know, they felt like there were things that they could have - could have helped them do a little bit better, being on stage for debates, etc., or having more debates, rather. You know, that was a big part of the problem and wound up being part of the problem in the general election at the margins. M MARTIN: But this whole - but the question - the issue that Amy Klobuchar kept hammering on at the debate and also tonight and her remarks, this question of what President Trump has done to the fabric of the country, the social divisions. I mean, Joe Biden talked about that as well. Is there any way to test for that? I mean, or is this all anecdotal? Is this all the kind of thing that you hear when you talk to voters, and they tell you how they feel, and you have time to sort of sit down and have a cup of coffee with them? But is there any way to quantify that, people... LIASSON: Sure. M MARTIN: ...Who feel that it's not just the economy. It's not just about the job or the dollars. It's about something that they feel is wrong in the tone and the culture of this presidency that needs to be changed? LIASSON: Well, you can see it in the behavior deficit that Trump has. His approval ratings on the economy is so much higher than his actual job approval ratings. And that's what people call a behavior deficit. They don't like the tweeting. They don't like the divisive talk. They don't like the fact that he doesn't try to unify the country. That's why they - usually a president's approval on the economy would track his overall approval, and Donald Trump's doesn't. MONTANARO: Well, and that's... R MARTIN: OK. I'm going to interrupt for a moment, because we're going to go to the Sanders headquarters in New Hampshire. Our colleague, NPR's Scott Detrow is there, and he's got a guest with him, Jeff Weaver, senior adviser to the Sanders campaign. I'll throw it over to you, Scott. DETROW: Hey, so I'm here. Jeff Weaver, you just won. We've been having a conversation on air. On one hand, you won the popular vote in Iowa, and you've won the New Hampshire primary. On the other hand, both times, it's about a quarter of the vote with a lot of vote-share going to, as a whole, lot of candidates who have a different view of things than Bernie Sanders. So how do you view that going forward? How do you grow that 26-or-so percent? JEFF WEAVER (SENIOR ADIVSER, BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN): Well, look, you know, we did - we are two-for-two down in the popular vote in the first two states. Now we're going on to some very different states. You know, Nevada - we've been working very hard in Nevada. I think you saw in Iowa - there was a smaller minority population in Iowa. But Bernie Sanders did very well in both the Latino and African American communities. So we're going to go to Nevada now where, you know, 40% of the - of people participating in the caucus there are people of color. And I think we're going to do very, very well there, frankly. DETROW: You've been talking a lot about the strong showing Senator Sanders has with Latino voters, with union rank-and-file. We're seeing reports from The Nevada Independent that the Culinary Union, obviously a major political force in Nevada, is distributing flyers about raising concerns about Medicare for All and what it would do for the health care plan that they're so - that they value so highly. WEAVER: Well, look, you know, we've won the endorsement of a number of Unite Here locals, which are what the culinary is part of, Unite Here. Of those locals in California, they have the same health care plan that the folks in Nevada have. And they came out and endorsed Senator Sanders. The truth of the matter is that Medicare for All will mean these folks will get better health care, and they will get a huge bump in their paycheck. DETROW: Can Bernie Sanders win South Carolina? WEAVER: Yes, he can win South Carolina. You know, the first four is going to be harder for us to win because we start started from a lower position in terms of how we did last time. But absolutely, he can win South Carolina, 100%. DETROW: And last question, obviously, you're focused on your win tonight. But one of the big storylines is the former vice president getting less than 10% of the vote, right now 8.4%. What do you make of Joe Biden's campaign as you look at it? WEAVER: Well, look, you know, he went - he left early the state today. So, I mean, I think that hurt his performance somewhat. But, you know, I've heard him on TV. He's committed to fighting in Nevada and South Carolina and other places. And look, Joe Biden, if anything, is a fighter. We disagree, obviously, on some issues. But he's a fighter, and I'm sure he's going to go on and compete strongly in a bunch of states going forward. DETROW: I said last question. This was the real last question - journalist trick. There has been a lot of concern raised - Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and others - that a democratic socialist at the head of the ticket puts the House of Representatives in jeopardy, those moderate districts that they flipped. What is your argument? What is your response to that? WEAVER: Look, we're happy to have a conversation with Donald Trump about democratic socialism. The truth of matter is who's ever nominated will be accused of being a socialist, even if it's Mike Bloomberg. And we're going to talk about Donald Trump's corporate socialism, how he uses the resources of the federal government to enrich his friends and large corporations. We're going to talk about Bernie Sanders' vision of helping people get affordable health care, affordable college and higher wages. So that's a fight that we are happy to have. DETROW: Jeff Weaver, that was the real last question. Thanks so much. WEAVER: Happy to be here. Thank you. DETROW: Talk to you soon. R MARTIN: All right. We're - thank you, Scott. We were just listening to NPR's Scott Detrow. He is at the Sanders headquarters in New Hampshire where the crowd there is celebrating. We just heard from senior Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver. We'll take it back to the room. Ron, the Sanders campaign obviously feeling very good in this moment, but it's not - it's not all smooth sailing from here, far, far from it. ELVING: I like the way he says that they're two-for-two in the popular vote, which sounds great. And it is true that they seem to have had the best initial raw vote in Iowa. And now tonight, they're winning by maybe around 2 percentage points. And so, yeah, they won. And they can take that bragging right, right on into Nevada and see how well they can do with a very different demographic. M MARTIN: A couple of things we didn't mention. We - well, we talked about New York - former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg tonight. We didn't talk about Tom Steyer, another billionaire Democratic activist who's been spending heavily in South Carolina. ELVING: And he finished sixth with about 4% of the vote. And there were rumors going around that he was going to pull the plug. He did not. Those are apparently false rumors. And he was not among the candidates to hang it up tonight, although Senator Michael Bennet and entrepreneur Andrew Yang did decide that the end of the road had come for them. MONTANARO: Yeah, it wouldn't make sense that Steyer would drop out here. He's been making a huge push in South Carolina. He's one of the people who is really threatening Joe Biden with support in the black community. So, you know, I... M MARTIN: And what's his message, just briefly, for people who who aren't acquainted with him and haven't had the benefit of all these ads and visits that people in other parts of the country get? What's his message? MONTANARO: Well, I mean, first of all, it's just running the ads and appealing in the first place and saying that you have to be in communities of color, sort of similar to what he said on the debate stage and making that a principal issue first rather than talking about Trump or the - or some of the other issues in the campaign. Ironically, considering he was the guy who started Impeach Trump and was sort of what launched his high name identification in the country. KURTZLEBEN: Right, and if we're talking about Tom Steyer's platform, I mean, maybe his biggest issue - one of his biggest issues is climate change. A thing that he says over and over and over is that on day one as president, I would declare a national emergency on climate change. And he makes a point of that in every debate. And of course, as we know, climate change has rocketed towards the top of polls among Democrats as being one of their very most important issues in this election. R MARTIN: OK. So let's just take stock of where we are. All the candidates have addressed their supporters. Bernie Sanders has declared victory. Earlier tonight, we heard from the two candidates who had the most disappointing showings, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. In her speech, Warren tried to take the focus off her fourth-place finish and turn it towards the rest of the primary season. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: The fight to save our democracy is an uphill battle. But our campaign is built for the long haul. (APPLAUSE) WARREN: And we are just getting started. R MARTIN: Joe Biden was also trying to shift the narrative. He focused on how many states haven't voted yet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We just heard from the first two of 50 states, two of them - not all the nation, not half the nation, not a quarter of the nation, not 10% - two - two. Now, where I come from, that's the opening bell, not the closing bell. And the fight to end Donald Trump's presidency is just beginning. (APPLAUSE) R MARTIN: Next, we heard from the candidate who beat expectations tonight by pushing to third place, Amy Klobuchar. Her speech was about contrasting herself with the president and many of her fellow candidates. She is a proud moderate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KLOBUCHAR: When I am behind that desk, I will take responsibility instead of passing it on. I will reach across the aisle and work with Americans in good faith instead of picking fights. I will bring this country together instead of tearing it apart. (APPLAUSE) R MARTIN: And the battle for first place has been between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. Sanders is still holding a slim lead. Buttigieg spoke to his supporters in an attempt to frame himself as a champion of a brighter future. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: So as we prepare to go West for the first-in-the-West contest in Nevada... (APPLAUSE) BUTTIGIEG: ...As we head to a state that looks like the future, I ask you to join us in taking a stand for a better tomorrow. (APPLAUSE) BUTTIGIEG: Join us as we turn the page to a new chapter in America's story and a better day for each of us. M MARTIN: Finally, Senator Sanders emerged to address his crowd and declare victory. His biggest applause came when he directed his focus away from the primaries and toward the general election in the fall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) M MARTIN: And that will do it for our coverage this evening. I'd like to thank all of our NPR reporters who've been out on the road with the candidates tonight, Asma Khalid, Scott Detrow and Juana Summers. Thanks, of course, to everybody here at the table, NPR's Mara Liasson, Ron Elving, Domenico Montanaro, Danielle Kurtzleben. You can stay with NPR. There will be a lot to talk about in the morning. I'm Michel Martin. R MARTIN: And I'm Rachel Martin. You have been listening to Special Coverage of the New Hampshire primary from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. (Reading) The Trump campaign is planning to spend more than $1 billion, and it will be aided by a vast coalition of partisan media, outside political groups and freelance operatives who are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. Whether or not it succeeds in reelecting the president, the wreckage leaves behind could be irreparable. That's what my guest, McKay Coppins, writes in his article \"The 2020 Disinformation War: Deepfakes, Anonymous Text Messages, Potemkin Local-News Sites, And Opposition Research On Reporters - A Field Guide To The Year's Election And What It Could Do To The Country.\" It's published in the March issue of The Atlantic, where Coppins is a staff writer. While researching the piece, he tried to live in the same information world as Trump supporters so that he'd receive the same disinformation supporters did. In his article, he explains the surprising impact that had on him. Coppins wrote a 2015 book called \"The Wilderness: Deep Inside The Republican Party's Combative, Contentious, Chaotic Quest To Take Back The White House.\" McKay Coppins, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So what was your mission when you started this piece trying to understand how disinformation works? MCKAY COPPINS: Well, I guess it came from a place of curiosity, primarily because as a political reporter, I kept encountering people either on the campaign trail or at rallies or just even in my day-to-day life who believed things that just were provably false. These weren't, you know, matters of different opinion. They weren't different ideological views. They were just - they were factual things that a lot of people seemed to believe that were not true (laughter). And, you know, as a reporter, I'm always interested in kind of the systems that lead to these views rather than kind of just interrogating individual people. So I knew, of course, that the Trump campaign was - you know, had a shaky relationship with the truth, to put it lightly. And I knew that they were very digitally sophisticated, much more so than in 2016. And so I wanted to kind of go inside that world and see what they were doing to shape their supporters' view of the world and also to get their message out. GROSS: So to do this, you had to get on the right lists. So you'd get the texts, you'd see the tweets, you'd get - you know, you'd see the right Facebook accounts and Facebook ads. What did you do to get on the right lists? COPPINS: Well, you know, it started - I just gave my cellphone number to the Trump campaign so I would get their texts. And I did a few other things, but what was most illuminating was this Facebook account that I created. I kind of sat down and built a separate profile from my own with a fake name, a kind of picture of my face obscured and started clicking like on Donald Trump's official page and his reelection campaign's page and various other associated pages, basically signaling to Facebook that I was interested in pro-Trump content. From there, the algorithm kind of prodded me to follow various other conservative pages - conservative pundit Ann Coulter, Fox Business, fan pages for Trump. I also joined a couple of private groups on Facebook for, you know, Trump superfans. And combined, this created a news feed on my Facebook account that was, you know, just filled with pro-Trump content. And (laughter) I got a good sense of kind of the - what the campaign was pumping out on a day-to-day basis. GROSS: Tell us some of the typical messages that you got and some of the more outrageous ones. COPPINS: Well, as you can imagine, a lot of them were sort of traditional, if especially shouty and aggressive partisan messages. You know, this is a hoax. This is a witch hunt. You know, the Democrats are out to invalidate the 2016 election - things like that that maybe as a political reporter, I've become desensitized to, but they're not completely outside the bounds of typical messaging around an impeachment battle, frankly. I think that what I saw that was different was - first of all, the volume of the content that they're putting out on Facebook is pretty overwhelming. You know, the way that Facebook is structured, when you're scrolling through a news feed, there - it never ends, right? It just keeps repopulating with more and more content. And as I would kind of spend time lying in bed at night or in my office scrolling through, it would almost become overwhelming. There's just this torrent of messaging and, you know, kind of propagandistic posts. And the more that you saw, the more that you kind of became desensitized to it. And some of it was partisan spin, but a lot of it, frankly, was just completely false or posts that were designed to recast the - what was happening in the impeachment proceedings and make people think that something entirely different was happening. GROSS: So give us a sense of the more fictitious narratives that you were reading. COPPINS: So the overall narrative that they were pushing was that President Trump was, in this Ukraine matter, primarily interested in cracking down on foreign corruption and that Democrats were trying to use this to plot or execute a coup. This is a word that comes up over and over again. That was kind of the message that they were pushing. But throughout the impeachment proceedings, every day that there was a new witness or a new development in the case, the Trump campaign would put out these new videos or these ads that were designed to convince you almost that the opposite had happened. So there were days when I would watch the impeachment hearings live on TV and I would see what I felt like was pretty damning testimony about the president's conduct in the Ukraine matter, and then I would check in on this Facebook feed and I would see a video that the Trump campaign had put out that took elements of that testimony but cut them together and recast them to make it look like it was an exoneration of the president. There would also be campaign videos that made it appear that all of the witnesses in the impeachment proceedings were just offering their opinions or how they felt and that they weren't presenting any new facts, which was also clearly not true. But if you were an average Trump-supporting news consumer who wasn't following along on the impeachment proceedings day to day and just saw these videos, you would think that that was the fact, that was what was happening. GROSS: Well, you were following the impeachment proceedings. What impact did this counternarrative, an often fictitious counternarrative, what impact did that have on you? COPPINS: Yeah. I mean, I have to say, I was actually pretty surprised by the effect it had in part because I went into this exercise as a journalist knowing what I was doing, and I felt that, you know, my inherent skepticism of the Trump campaign's messaging and kind of my media literacy as somebody who's a journalist and does this professionally would kind of inoculate me against any of these distortions. But in fact, I found that I became, over time, reflexively suspicious of every headline I encountered. It wasn't that I believed the president and his allies were telling the truth or that their narrative was true; it was more that I had this heightened suspicion or cynicism about all of the content surrounding the impeachment proceedings, and I started to question everything, frankly. It made it - it was almost like the truth about impeachment or the Ukraine affair or any other political issue felt difficult to find amid the rubble of kind of mangled facts and partisan spin. And the more time that I spent in this Facebook feed, the more it felt like observable reality itself had almost drifted out of reach. GROSS: It turns out there's a word for this, an expression for this - scholars call this censorship through noise. Explain what censorship through noise is. COPPINS: Yeah, it's interesting. It's a term scholars use to describe what illiberal political leaders have done in other countries, which is, you know, in the past, the way that illiberal autocrats or dictators or whatever function is that they would do what they could to censor dissenting information. They would shut down opposition newspapers. They would jail journalists. They would cut off access to information that challenged their authority or power. And that still happens sometimes, but a lot of these illiberal leaders have discovered that in the Internet age, in the social media age, in what scholars call the information abundance age, it's a lot easier to harness the power of social media for their own means. So rather than shutting down dissenting voices, they've learned to use the democratizing power of social media to jam the signals or sow confusion. They don't have to, you know, silence the dissident who's shouting in the streets; they can actually just drown him out. And I think that over time, you've seen this in other countries - certainly in the Baltic states, in Eastern Europe, Russia. If journalism and facts are treated as equal in credibility to partisan propaganda or lies from political leaders, if it's all one level playing field, then it becomes almost impossible for political leaders to be held accountable for their actions because you have a population that's either disengaged or distracted or confused and unable to kind of respond to the various corruptions and scandals and things that they're getting away with. GROSS: You say that the Trump campaign might be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. What are some of the signs of that? COPPINS: You combine the fact that this president is willing to lie and traffics in conspiracy theories and says things that are untrue at a rate that is kind of unprecedented for a president, with all of these new tools and these new technologies and social media. And what you have is a presidential campaign that is pushing lies and distortions and conspiracy theories into the bloodstream at an unprecedented rate, with tools that enable them to do it much more efficiently and effectively than any kind of, you know, demagogic leader in generations past. And that's what I mean when I say that this is going to be unprecedented. There's going to be a lot more money involved. The tools are a lot more powerful. And we have a president who has the powers of incumbency, the federal government behind him, willing to do things that most presidents have not shown a willingness to do. GROSS: So Trump has more money and more influence now to spread disinformation than he did during the 2016 campaign. COPPINS: Absolutely. I mean, you have to remember in 2016, Donald Trump, first of all, was - started out as one of 16 Republican presidential candidates. He was not somebody who had a large, sophisticated campaign staff. In fact, most of the people who went to work for him were kind of B-team operatives who didn't get hired by any of the other front-runners early in the primaries. He also was, you know, a reality TV star. He certainly had a lot of reach because he was famous, but he wasn't the president of the United States. Now he's an incumbent. He has the ability to use and leverage his incumbency for reelection. And he's already shown a willingness to use that power in ways that are pretty brazen. You know, I talk about the 2018 midterm elections, where he actually seized on these stories about a migrant caravan traveling to the southern border from Central America and made that a central campaign issue in the final weeks of the election. And to draw attention to it, he militarized the border. He dispatched troops to the southern border. Now, I should say, the president, of course, defended those actions, saying that this was all in the name of national security, to keep the country protected. But within weeks after the midterms, he quietly began calling back those troops from the southern border. And so I think a lot of skeptics saw that and realized that this president has a lot of power, a willingness to use it, and if he was willing to do that, just to pick up a few seats in the midterms, it begs the question what he's willing to do to win reelection. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins. He's a staff writer for The Atlantic, and his new article is called \"The Disinformation War.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic. His new article is called \"The Disinformation War: Deepfakes, Anonymous Text Messages, Potemkin Local-News Sites, And Opposition Research On Reporters - A Field Guide To This Year's Election And What It Could Do To The Country.\" So we've been talking about how the Trump campaign is using social media and using it in part to sow disinformation. The person presiding over the Trump campaign digital effort is Brad Parscale, who was also the digital director of Trump's 2016 campaign. What are some of the techniques that you think he came up with? COPPINS: Well, you know, it's interesting. Brad Parscale is not somebody with a background in politics. In fact, in 2016, the way he got into the campaign was he was hired to design a simple landing page for the Trump presidential exploratory committee, which, you know, seemed at the time like - if anything, was a publicity stunt, maybe a lark, but did not seem like a serious thing. But because Parscale had this history with the Trump family - he had worked for them in the past - and because he was cheap and didn't have a lot of the pretensions that other political operatives had, Trump kind of liked him and brought him into the inner circle. But when you talk to people who worked with him on that campaign, they say that his political experience was actually an advantage because he was really willing to experiment with new tools that other presidential campaigns kind of looked at disdainfully or thought were kind of generally untested or unproven. One of the things that he got really good at was using Facebook ads and particularly microtargeted Facebook ads to raise money and fire up the faithful and target persuadable voters. And so microtargeting is the process of - basically, you take the electorate, you slice it up into very small, distinct, specific niches, and then you create ads that speak directly to those niches. And Facebook allows campaigns to create these ads and serve them to very small groups. So whereas in the past, a presidential campaign would have to create an ad and put it on TV and all kinds of different people would see it, now they can create an ad, let's say, that calls for the defunding of Planned Parenthood - which is, you know, a divisive political issue or a stance - and rather than kind of blasting it on national TV, they can serve it directly to 800 Roman Catholic, pro-life women in Dubuque, Iowa. And they know that it'll probably get a more positive result that way. GROSS: And the Republican Party has information on just about every voter to help them figure out who to target. COPPINS: Yeah, it's been reported that the RNC and the Trump campaign have compiled an average of 3,000 data points on every voter in America. And so that means everything from what you like to watch on TV, what kind of stores you shop at, whether you've been to a gun show or own a gun. They've compiled all this data, and they can use it to carefully tailor messages just for you. And I should say that this is not unique to the Trump campaign. This isn't something Brad Parscale invented. Barack Obama's campaign famously did it in 2012. The Clinton campaign did it as well in 2016. But the Trump campaign's effort was different, both because it was much more extensive and also, frankly, a lot more brazen. One example I give in the piece is - in 2016, the Trump campaign, in the final weeks of the race, tried to depress black turnout in Florida by microtargeting ads to black voters in that state that said, Hillary thinks African Americans are superpredators, so drawing from that famous controversial comment that Clinton had made in the '90s, but obviously taking it out of context and generalizing it a bit more than I think the average fact-checker would say is OK. They microtargeted these to black voters not even really to win them over or get them to vote for Trump but to keep them away from the polls. And we only know about that specific case because a Trump campaign official boasted about it at the time and said, this is one of three major voter suppression efforts that we have that are underway. But the campaign puts out so many Facebook ads that it's really difficult for journalists or watchdog groups to wade through all of them. Just as an example, in the 10 weeks after the impeachment proceedings began, the Trump campaign ran 14,000 ads on Facebook containing the word impeachment. GROSS: So as a comparison between what Republicans have done and Democrats, you write that from June to November, during Trump's campaign in 2016, Trump's campaign took out 5.9 million ads on Facebook; Hillary Clinton's campaign took out 66,000. So, again, that's 5.9 million ads versus 66,000 ads on Facebook. What does that say to you? And do you expect that this time around those numbers will be similarly disproportionate? COPPINS: Well, probably not. I mean, part of the reason that the Trump campaign was willing to go so heavy on Facebook ads was, frankly, because they didn't have the money that the Clinton campaign did to put up TV ads, which are more expensive and more difficult to place. And so this was actually kind of something they stumbled upon that really worked for them. In 2020, Democrats seem much more attuned to the realities of our information ecosystem and realize that to reach voters, they're going to have to be on Facebook and Google and really go heavy on online advertising. But I will say that the president still has a distinct advantage, in part because he has so much more money than any of the Democratic candidates. He formed his reelection campaign immediately after he was inaugurated, and they started raising money right away. And so they have a huge war chest, and so it seems likely that the Trump campaign will still come out ahead. GROSS: My guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic. His new article is titled \"The 2020 Disinformation War.\" After a break, we'll talk about how Trump allies have scraped the social media accounts of hundreds of political journalists, searching for embarrassing posts to be used against them when a story is deemed unfair or politically damaging. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with McKay Coppins, whose new article, \"The 2020 Disinformation War,\" is in the current issue of The Atlantic, where Coppins is a staff writer. He writes about how the Trump campaign and a vast coalition of partisan media, outside political groups and freelance operatives are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. As part of his research, Coppins tried to live in the same media and social media world as Trump supporters so he could monitor the information or disinformation they were receiving. Mark Zuckerberg is allowing candidates to place false political ads. He's not - he's decided Facebook should not have editorial control over that. How does that compare with commercial ads on Facebook? COPPINS: Yeah, this is a very important point because when a company places an ad on Facebook, it is subject to fact-checking. It's not allowed to say obviously false things about its product. And if it does, Facebook will remove that ad and, you know, punish that client. That is not true of political ads. Mark Zuckerberg came under a lot of pressure after the 2016 election to crack down on the spread of misinformation on his platform. And he rolled out a flurry of reforms but, in the end, decided that it was not their place to prevent political ads that are dishonest or even just completely unfactual (ph). He believes that because political ads receive a lot of scrutiny already from the press and from opposition parties and from watchdogs, that it's not Facebooks role to censor them, that he lets politicians put out whatever ads they want and let's kind of the electorate decide whether they're true or not. GROSS: It sounds like during this campaign that the Trump campaign is emphasizing texting more than it did in 2016, and you were receiving Trump campaign texts. How is the texting platform seen as a particularly good one for the campaign? COPPINS: Yeah. And I bet a lot of your listeners have experienced this. You know, there's been a huge uptick in unsolicited political text messages this campaign season, and there's a reason for that. So until pretty recently, you had to opt in to receive mass text messages from politicians or campaigns. But there are these new apps called peer-to-peer texting apps that allow people - volunteers, campaign staffers, whoever - to send hundreds of messages an hour. They just literally have to sit there and press, click over and over and over again. And that's considered by the FCC to be not mass texting, but one-on-one texting. And so a lot of campaigns have taken advantage of this loophole and begun using these peer-to-peer texting apps to send out - you know, send out messages to millions of people, unsolicited. The Trump campaign has gone in on this strategy much more than other campaigns have. That's in part because one of their senior officials, Gary Coby, developed one of these peer-to-peer texting apps. But the reason that they're seen as so valuable is because unlike robocalls that get sent to voicemail or email blasts that get ignored or trapped in spam folders, these peer-to-peer texting companies say that at least 90% of their messages are opened. And so this is a very effective way to reach a lot of voters. GROSS: One of the things you learned about in writing about the disinformation war was how the Trump inner circle amplifies their attacks against journalists who they see as being anti-Trump. So give us an example of one of the stories, you know, that a journalist wrote that resulted in a whole campaign against him. COPPINS: Yeah. Well, I was kind of made aware of this effort last year. I was on the phone with a Republican operative who is close to the Trump family, working on a separate story. And he casually mentioned over the course of our conversation that there was a reporter at Business Insider, the website, that was about to have a very bad day. And the journalist in this case had tweeted something that annoyed Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, and that had prompted the president's son's kind of inner circle, his friends and allies, to work together to put together a hit piece on this journalist. And when I was talking to this operative, he was kind of bragging that, you know, oh, this story is going to demolish the journalist's credibility; just wait - it's going to be great. And honestly, I didn't really know what to make of it. A lot of the sources that I talked to in Trump world tend to boast and gloat a lot, and there's not always a lot of follow-through. But a few hours after that, the operative sent me a link to this Breitbart news story targeting this particular journalist and his history of intense Trump hatred - that was the headline. And what the story was based on was a series of Instagram posts that the journalist had posted in which he was seen kind of making fun of the president or making political jokes or expressing solidarity with liberal causes. And the Breitbart story quickly kind of ricocheted around the conservative social media sphere. Don Jr. tweeted this story to his followers, calling the journalist a raging lib, and other conservatives piled on and called for him to be fired. And, you know, his employer released a statement saying that the posts were not appropriate. And I talked to this journalist after the whole thing happened. And he said that, you know, it was very bizarre and unsettling, and he had the feeling that this was somehow a coordinated effort, but he couldn't quite prove it. What I ended up finding as I did some more reporting on this is that there is a very organized project by a coalition of Trump allies to air embarrassing information about reporters who produce critical coverage of Trump. GROSS: Well, in fact, you say that the Trump organization has basically vacuumed up a lot of information and old social media posts by a lot of journalists, particularly ones who they think might say negative things about Trump so that they have this negative information that they could use against the journalist as needed. COPPINS: Yeah. So what's been described to me is that they have this dossier where, like you said, yes, they've scraped all these social media posts. And I've even been told that they have - they hired a programmer to turn it into a searchable database. So basically, anytime a story is published that is deemed kind of especially unfair or politically damaging to President Trump, they will search this database for the journalists involved - the journalists who wrote the story, maybe editors at the same outlet and see if they have anything embarrassing about those journalists. And if they do, they can turn that over to the right-wing press - Breitbart usually is involved - and turn it into a story that will hopefully, in their view, discredit the journalist or at least embarrass them and, ideally, make them lose their jobs. GROSS: Have you found a specific example where Trump operatives or allies have used information from one of these dossiers to attack a journalist? COPPINS: Yeah, there have been a few examples. They've gone after journalists at CNN, Washington Post, New York Times. These are kind of some of the outlets that the president complains about most often. In one case, they exposed a reporter for using a homophobic slur in college. In another, they found anti-Semitic and racist jokes that the reporter had posted a decade earlier. And in both of those cases, the reporters apologized. They didn't lose their jobs, so these weren't, like, career-ending revelations. But what I've heard is that they have a lot more information, and they're planning to deploy it strategically over the next nine or 10 months as the campaign heats up. GROSS: And then you found a whole mechanism - once information from the dossier is plucked out to be used against the journalist, there's a whole mechanism for amplifying it. What's that mechanism? COPPINS: Well, so often, what happens, I'm told, is that Donald Trump Jr. will flag a story in a text thread that he uses for this purpose. He often texts with, you know, GOP operatives and conservative media people. And once a story's been marked for attack, someone will search the dossier for material on the journalist involved. If they find something, they'll turn it over to Breitbart. They'll turn that into a headline. And then once that's out on the internet, White House officials and campaign surrogates can share it on social media to try to discredit the journalist while still maintaining a distance from the effort. The White House has denied that they're involved in this, but they have shared stories attacking journalists using kind of Breitbart content in the past. GROSS: So what you're describing is this feedback loop where somebody like Don Jr. or a Trump operative sends a story to Breitbart, Breitbart writes the story and then the headline can be tweeted out by Republican operatives or Don Jr. in addition to Fox News. So, like, you send the story to Breitbart. Breitbart writes the headline. Then you retweet it, and it looks like, look what Breitbart said; we're just amplifying that, when they're just amplifying the message of Don Jr. and the Republican operatives. COPPINS: That's exactly right. And, you know, what's notable about this - because I think that some people read about this effort or might hear about this effort and say, look; you know, there's nothing wrong with exposing that a journalist has a liberal political bias if they're not forthright about that. But I think what's notable about this is that, you know, in the past, conservatives have complained about a liberal slant in the media. And I think that that's often merited. I think that they have some good points about that. But the people involved in this effort are not trying to critique the mainstream media or reform it or bring more balance or conservative voices into it. They are very deliberately trying to discredit and dismantle the mainstream media altogether. In fact, Matthew Boyle, an editor at Breitbart who is often involved in this effort, gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation in 2017 where he said, journalistic integrity is dead. There is no such thing anymore. So everything now is about weaponization of information. And that's really at the root of this whole enterprise. They're not trying to make journalists be better or get them to do their jobs better. They're trying to discredit them and weaponize information and make it so that journalism and facts are seen as on par with political talking points and propaganda. GROSS: So that you just give up trying to discern the difference between the two. COPPINS: Exactly, so that everybody feels like, you know, this is all just a matter of opinion. It's all a matter of worldview. It's not a matter of facts. I'll have my set of facts, you have your set of facts, and that's fine. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk more about the disinformation war in the presidential campaign. If you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic, and \"The Disinformation War\" is the title of his new article. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MICHELLE LORDI SONG, \"WAYWARD WIND\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic. His new piece is called \"The Disinformation War: A Field Guide To This Year's Election And What It Could Do To The Country.\" I want to get back to the discrediting of journalists and digging up embarrassing information and storing it and then using it when the time is right to attack them. Do you think that this is having a chilling effect on journalists because - let's face it. A lot of journalists now are not only getting attacked on social media. They're getting death threats. I mean, their families are in - are being threatened, too. It's really a terrible period in that sense. COPPINS: Yeah, so I would say two things. One is that the journalists I know who cover the administration do try to keep this noise out of their mind when they're doing their jobs, but it is hard, right? In the back of your mind, you can't help but wonder, you know, when are these people going to come after me? What do they have on me? What are they going to say or make up to try to embarrass me or get me in trouble with my bosses? It's just natural that you would have those thoughts pinging around in the back of your mind, even while you try to keep them at bay as you focus on doing your job. The other thing I would say is that, you know, there are certainly more dangerous places to be a journalist. And I don't think that the average Washington journalist or political reporter in America is facing anything like the kinds of threats that reporters face in other countries, where you have a much more fragile democracy and civil rights are much more fragile. That said, it is clear that these Trump allies' efforts to discredit the institution of the press are drawing direct lessons from a lot of those countries, you know - because illiberal leaders have long ago learned that when the press as an institution is discredited or weakened, it makes it a lot easier for them to get away with the things they want to get away with. GROSS: Have any Trump operatives gone after you because of your piece on the disinformation war in The Atlantic? COPPINS: Not yet. You know, there have certainly been criticisms from the right. And the Trump campaign put out a statement saying that my story was itself disinformation, which kind of neatly encapsulates, I think, what we've been talking about here. But no, nobody has come after me directly, though I have had my brushes with pro-Trump operatives and allies in the past. GROSS: Give us an example. COPPINS: Well, actually, the first example was years and years ago, before he was even running for president. I wrote a profile of him in 2014, when he was first thinking about running for president. And I ended up spending a couple days at Mar-a-Lago with him through a kind of fluke blizzard that caused him to reroute his plane to Mar-a-Lago while I was on it with him. Suffice it to say, he did not like the profile that I wrote. And it was interesting 'cause, now looking back on it, he was sort of foreshadowing all the attacks that he would wage on the press once he ascended to political power. But at the time, you know, he tweeted a lot of nasty things about me. He actually did place a story in Breitbart that was completely fictitious, accusing me of behaving boorishly when I was at his resort, specifically toward the women there - and, you know, made a lot of other false claims about me. At the time, he was just kind of this reality TV show guy. And it was a little disconcerting to experience it, but it all felt kind of like a game almost. I knew that the things he was saying were untrue. Most of the people in my life just laughed it off, and we all kind of moved on with our lives. But now that he's using the same tactics as president of the United States with a lot more resources and a lot more power, I think it's much more alarming and this kind of treatment of the press should be given a lot more attention. GROSS: I want to get back to some of the techniques that are being used now to spread disinformation. You write that the Trump campaign is planning to open up a new front, which is local news. What's the plan? COPPINS: Yeah. Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, spoke to donors in Miami last year and actually said that one of the things he wants to do is train swarms of surrogates - those are his words - to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers. I actually got a recording of this speech that The Palm Beach Post gave to me, wherein he said, we can actually build up and fight with the local newspapers so we're not just fighting on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people watching every day. And you know, this is a pretty cunning if, I think, troubling approach - because if you look at polls, it's been true for a long time that Americans trust the local press more than they do the national press. And a lot of the negative coverage that's probably most damaging to the president comes from hometown newspapers or local newspapers in election years. So Brad Parscale has talked about building an apparatus, basically, to take the war with the press to a local level. GROSS: They're also apparently creating versions of the local press that aren't really local. COPPINS: Yeah, this is a kind of strange trend that people began noticing a couple years ago. There have been all these websites popping up across the Internet with innocuous names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times. And if you look at them, they look like local news websites. You know, they have coverage of schools and coverage of gas prices and community notices. But if you actually study them, there are often no bylines on the stories, no mastheads. There's no local addresses. And it turns out that a lot of these are actually owned and operated by Republican lobbying groups or just third-party businesses. There's one company called Locality Labs, which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois, that's behind a lot of these websites. And readers are given no indication that these sites have a political agenda, which is kind of what makes them valuable. So I spoke to one political strategist who told me that the way that these are often used is that a candidate who's looking to plant a negative story about, say, a Democratic opponent can actually pay to have the headline that they want posted on some of these these \"news\" sites - I use news in quotes - these faux news sites. And by working through a third-party consulting firm instead of paying the sites directly, they actually are able to obscure their involvement in the scheme when they file their finance reports to the Federal Election Commission. So basically, you have political candidates dictating the coverage they want, getting it placed in these faux local news sites. And the average reader who sees it probably just assumes it's a real local news site - especially as the real local press has become hollowed out over the past couple of decades, these sites have filled that vacuum but as, basically, political propaganda outfits. GROSS: So this is where we are now. When it comes to some local stories, you not only have to ask yourself, is this story true? - but is the website real? Is this publication a real local publication? COPPINS: Yeah, that's right. And look, it's asking an enormous amount of the average news consumer, who does not spend hours a day like I do, frankly, you know, reading the news and reading various publications. They're just trying to check in on something or they're scrolling through Facebook looking at photos of their, you know, grandkids, and they come across a headline like this. They're inclined, probably, to believe it, especially if it's on a website like the ones that are being designed. But yeah, frankly, you should not trust a website that you're not familiar with and that you don't know to be trustworthy just because it looks like it's a local news site. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The New Yorker. His new piece is called \"The Disinformation War: A Field Guide To This Year's Election And What It Could Do To The Country.\" We'll be back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BEASTIE BOYS' \"NAMASTE (ALTERNATE MIX/NO VOCALS)\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic. His new piece is called \"The Disinformation War: Deepfakes, Anonymous Text Messages, Potemkin Local-News Sites And Opposition Research On Reporters - A Field Guide To This Year's Election And What It Could Do To The Country.\" The question has been raised, if Republicans are using dirty tricks - and especially dirty tricks in the digital sphere - does that mean in order to win, that Democrats have to do that, too? COPPINS: This is an active debate among Democratic strategists right now. There are some who say this is precisely the wrong time for Democrats to abandon their principles of fairness and honesty and that we need to be the party of truth and honesty. But there are others who have argued pretty forcefully and pretty transparently that the only way to contend with the president's reelection effort is to co-opt his tactics and improve upon them. There is one guy, Dmitri Mehlhorn, who's a Democratic consultant who's kind of notorious for experimenting with digital dirty tricks. During the Alabama special election in 2017, he helped fund two different false flag operations against Roy Moore - you remember, the Republican Senate candidate. In one scheme, faux Russian Twitter bots actually followed the candidate's account en masse to make it look like Russia was backing Moore. And in another, there was a social media campaign dubbed Dry Alabama that was designed to make it look like Moore had the support of Baptist teetotalers who wanted to ban alcohol. And it was all fictional. I should note that Mehlhorn has actually said he was unaware of these efforts, doesn't support the use of the misinformation. But his group did help fund them. And more broadly, there are Democrats that are pointing to these efforts and say, we need to do more of that and do it on a much bigger scale if we're going to defeat Trump. GROSS: What's your reaction to that? COPPINS: You know (laughter), as a journalist, my bias is strongly toward truth and accuracy. And I have a lot of concern about what will happen to our information ecosystem if the Democrats decide to escalate and do - and mimic the tactics that President Trump and his allies are undertaking. I think that right now - my biggest concern going forward after the 2020 election is not really who wins - which party wins, who comes away with power in the short term - it's what happens to our information ecosystem now. If we get to a situation where Democrats and Republicans have both fully bought into the idea that truth is irrelevant, that advancing disinformation is the only way to win an election, we'll end up in a situation that a lot of other countries have found themselves in, where the average voter, on a day-to-day basis, has no idea what is true in the news, what to believe and generally disengages and just throws up their hands. And that, I think, is a very dangerous situation for our democracy. GROSS: McKay Coppins, thank you so much for coming back to FRESH AIR. COPPINS: Thank you for having me. GROSS: McKay Coppins is a staff writer for The Atlantic. His new article is titled \"The 2020 Disinformation War.\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, our guest will be MSNBC legal analyst Jill Wine-Banks, who was a young lawyer in the special prosecutor's office during the Watergate investigation. She'll talk about confronting Nixon administration insiders on the witness stand, enduring sexism in the courtroom and how the Watergate probe differs from investigations into President Trump. She's written a new book called \"The Watergate Girl.\" I hope you can join us. FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden, Thea Chaloner, Mooj Zadie and Seth Kelley. I'm Terry Gross.

            "article_content": "The town of Dixville Notch votes at midnight on the day of the New Hampshire primary. But after a state investigation found that many of its voters weren't eligible, it nearly lost its polling place.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: There are few traditions more closely associated with tomorrow's New Hampshire primary than the midnight vote in a place called Dixville Notch. As Casey McDermott of New Hampshire Public Radio reports, this tradition isn't always what it seems like on TV. CASEY MCDERMOTT, BYLINE: For almost 50 years, the citizens of this tiny community close to the Canadian border have gathered at midnight on primary day to cast the first ballots in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation contest. And for almost as long, Dixville Notch's midnight vote has fascinated the rest of the nation or at least the national media. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a picture postcard town just shy of the Canadian border... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: A small quaint town in New Hampshire... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: This is really a page out of Norman Rockwell. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Nine voters - not a lot of chance of voter fraud. MCDERMOTT: The midnight vote in this town was always a media-driven event. It started as a way to give the press something to report early on Election Day. And Dixville, long held up to the rest of the world as a symbol of democracy at its purest, has actually come under lots of scrutiny from state election investigators since 2016. Some of Dixville's voters, according to a state investigation, didn't actually live there. Some other election rules also weren't being followed. As Anne Edwards with the New Hampshire attorney general's office explained, the state was tipped off to the problems with Dixville's elections because of all of the press coverage. ANNE EDWARDS: The transparency of the media coverage is part of what led to the concerns that were raised with our office regarding Dixville Notch and whether there were irregularities with the 2016 elections. MCDERMOTT: Once the ineligible voters were removed from the rolls, it wasn't clear that Dixville would have enough people to legally hold its own election again in 2020. As Tom Tillotson, the son of the man who started Dixville's midnight voting tradition, said last year... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) TOM TILLOTSON: It's getting to be a ghost town here. MCDERMOTT: The main business in town, The Balsams Resort, closed down about a decade ago and took most of Dixville's voters with it. The local economy is struggling big time, but Dixville's fortune changed when a developer who's trying to bring The Balsams Resort back to life declared that he would move back. Les Otten says he has a few homes in Maine and Massachusetts, but he decided to declare Dixville his residence for voting purposes so that the midnight vote could continue. LES OTTEN: Midnight voting in Dixville to New Hampshire is like snow is to winter. MCDERMOTT: Otten says his main goal is to make sure that Dixville continues to be a symbol of civic participation, but he acknowledges that keeping the midnight vote alive might also boost his years-long quest to reopen Dixville's shuttered resort. OTTEN: I don't think you can sit there and say that, you know, there isn't part of me that hopes that the tradition of Dixville and the publicity of Dixville doesn't help the project. MCDERMOTT: State officials say they're satisfied that Dixville has resolved the problems with its elections since 2016, but it's keeping a close eye just to be sure. While Dixville will be back in the spotlight for this primary, it's not the only place that votes at midnight. There's Hart's Location, and there's also Millsfield, which happens to be right next door to Dixville. WAYNE URSO: For us in Millsfield, it's kind of humorous. MCDERMOTT: Millsfield, N.H., is actually the birthplace of the midnight voting tradition. Theirs dates back way before Dixville's to 1936, when a 27-year-old woman named Genevieve Nadig dreamt it up. Wayne Urso is something of a self-appointed town historian. URSO: Reporters have come to Millsfield and then go on to Dixville when the big story that's written is all about Dixville with Millsfield being a side note. MCDERMOTT: While an outside PR company has been fielding media credentials and helping to orchestrate national news coverage of the midnight vote in Dixville, Urso and his neighbors will get together a few miles down the road at a local tavern, their designated polling place to cast their ballots at the stroke of midnight. They say the press is welcome to show up, too. For NPR News, I'm Casey McDermott in Concord. (SOUNDBITE OF SUFJAN STEVENS SONG, \"COME ON! FEEL THE ILLINOISE!

            "article_content": "New Hampshire students graduate with some of the highest rates of student debt in the country. Several Democratic presidential candidates have plans that would forgive student loans.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Americans carry $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, and many of the leading Democratic presidential candidates have plans to address that problem. As New Hampshire voters get ready to cast their ballots tomorrow, I sat down with three women who have different perspectives on the issue to hear how their experience with debt is shaping their view of the primary race. MEGHAN MOODY: Hi, Sarah (ph). I'm Meghan (ph). SARAH GROLEAU: Hi there. JESSE WRIGHT: Hey, I'm Jesse (ph). GROLEAU: Hi there. I'm Sarah. MOODY: Just from reading pins on our jackets, we have three different opinions about who we're going to vote for. SHAPIRO: That's Meghan Moody (ph) with Jesse Wright (ph) and Sarah Groleau (ph). We're at a restaurant called May Kelly's Cottage in the town of North Conway. It's an Irish pub, walls covered in antiques and bric-a-brac overlooking a river and mountains. Jesse's 30, and she's been a waitress here for years. WRIGHT: I was in high school when I first started here and have never dropped that second job. It's been such a blessing to be able to count on it. SHAPIRO: She has a master's degree and a job at a conservation nonprofit. But without a second job, she wouldn't make enough to pay down her loans. Each month, her student loan payment costs more than her mortgage. And in addition to those two jobs, Jesse started a group that gives grants to young people to help pay down their student debt and keep them living in this rural community. North Conway, N.H., is halfway up the border with Maine. It's a place where people go skiing on their lunch break. MOODY: How lucky are we to live here and get to do that and come in a little early or stay a little late, get some vitamin D and have some social energy? SHAPIRO: Meghan got a $2,000 grant from Jesse's organization to help with her debt, but Meghan does not have a college degree. Partway through her junior year at Elmira College in upstate New York, her grandfather died. He was the cosigner on her student loan. And when tuition was due, she didn't have any money to pay for it. MOODY: I got a call from my loan company saying that I was no longer eligible for the loan that they awarded me and that I had to figure out how to pay $18,000 by December 15 or something. And so I just came home. And I missed one of those payments, and it went to collections. You know, borrowing $20,000 a year doesn't sound like that much when you feel like you can pay it off. But the second you make a mistake, which I did and I recognize, you dig yourself into a really, really deep hole. SHAPIRO: By the time she's done, she says she's going to wind up paying about $90,000, including interest, for 2 1/2 years of school - no degree. She's 28 years old, and this experience has shaped almost every aspect of her life in the last decade. MOODY: My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 1/2 years, and he bought our home last year instead of us buying our home 'cause emotionally, we wanted to buy the home together. But in no way did I want my student debt - if I defaulted again - to affect our whole future. SHAPIRO: This all sounds familiar to the third woman at our table. GROLEAU: I get a lot of calls about, I can't handle my student loans; I can't buy a house; I can't do this. SHAPIRO: Sarah Groleau got a full ride to her college. Now she's 39 and owns a financial planning practice in nearby Freedom, N.H. GROLEAU: Being a 17-year-old deciding how to go to college and how to pay for it, the idea of borrowing $3,000 a semester or borrowing $30,000 a semester is the same number in their head when they've had no experience with how debt works. WRIGHT: You sign on the same line for both, right? GROLEAU: It's the same line. It's - and the concept of paying it off is just not a real number. Anything with that many zeros, you haven't really dealt with. It makes it a really unclear financial decision, and the rules change. SHAPIRO: So a question that I have for all three of you is, where do you draw the line between, young people don't have the knowledge they need to make good decisions, and therefore, they should not be held responsible for these decisions - and on the other hand, well, you signed on the dotted line, and if you didn't know what you were doing, that's no one's fault but your own? GROLEAU: This is Sarah. I can comment. It's a thing I struggle with. You know, I think the root of the problem is more nuanced. But we also have to recognize there's some ownership there, right? Like, there's some part of it where someone is signing on those dotted lines. But we also need to make sure we're making that information accessible, right? So do you know what rights you have as a consumer of these loans? There's a lot we need to hold elected officials and governments responsible for, especially the federal programs. SHAPIRO: How do you both feel about this question? WRIGHT: I think for me, it's, where's the other option? Right now what we're doing is saying, yes, you're 18. And everybody around you is telling you, go to the best school that you possibly can get into because that's the best for your future. When we bring to the table an option that is public education past grade 12, that's when we can say, here is the best thing you can do for your financial future - is go to higher education past grade 12 that is not going to burden you in the future. SHAPIRO: How do you feel about this, Meghan? MOODY: It's a really excellent question because I don't think that there's, like, a black-and-white answer. Like, I'm going to feel a lot of pride when I pay off my own loans because I signed for them. But how would getting to coach field hockey again instead of having a second job allow me to give back to the community that gave me so much? SHAPIRO: It's funny. I hear you describing these loans almost like handcuffs. But I also hear that it's really important to you to break the handcuffs yourself - that you, like - you don't want somebody to come along with a key... MOODY: I don't need no - yeah. GROLEAU: Welcome to New Hampshire. (LAUGHTER) GROLEAU: We're going to do it ourself. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What do you say to people who didn't take out loans and will now say, why should your debt be paid off when I made the decision not to go into debt in the first place? WRIGHT: This is Jesse. This is an economic issue that is beyond one person's personal debt. It's not just, I don't drive on that road, so I'm not going to pay for it. It's this idea that we're contributing to our community. SHAPIRO: The different experiences these women have had lead them to support three different candidates. The pin on Meghan's coat says Bernie. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders says if he's elected, he will cancel all outstanding student loan debt. MOODY: I was like, I've been screaming this at the top of my lungs forever. I'm drowning, and you hear me. SHAPIRO: Sarah, the financial adviser, says she was a fan of Sanders four years ago. But this time, she's wearing a pin for former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. GROLEAU: The thing I like about Pete's platform is how much emphasis is on the affordability of college and making, you know, tech schools and other forms of secondary education a priority because I think loan forgiveness is more of a - it's addressing a symptom of the overall problem of the cost of higher education. And there is that visceral reaction to student loan forgiveness. There's a lot of people in our electorate who hate that idea for whatever reason. MOODY: What happens, then, for this whole generation? Like, is it just a hiccup and we, like, don't think about them and we're all kind of like... GROLEAU: No, 'cause student loan forgiveness is still part of his platform. It's different than Bernie's. Absolutely. But I like that there's multiple options. So it's looking at career options, student loan refinancing options. That's a big one that I think is important. You know... MOODY: A lot of us aren't available to that anymore because we've made a mistake and... GROLEAU: Right, but that's what I think is important to fix. SHAPIRO: And then there's Jesse, who says Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's tiered approach to student debt appeals to her. WRIGHT: Her approach is to level out debt forgiveness to the amount of income that you're making so that we're not giving Tom Steyer's kids debt forgiveness. I think that's important. SHAPIRO: Tom Steyer, the billionaire presidential candidate. In the divide on this issue, there are echoes of the larger split within the Democratic Party right now. Meghan, the Sanders supporter, says a candidate needs to pursue big, ambitious goals to accomplish anything in Washington today. MOODY: The way that our political climate is, something extreme has to happen for something small to result. SHAPIRO: And Sarah, the Buttigieg supporter, thinks a candidate needs to win over more than just Democrats. GROLEAU: I think that's an opportunity to really have respectful conversation, and I think that there is hope that somewhere we can get Senate to work together on something as important as the student loan crisis. SHAPIRO: While the women disagree on the best approach to this problem, they agree that the candidates are talking about it more than ever before. And they all believe that's a good thing.

Sinn Fein has pulled off a stunning result in Ireland. The outsider party, perhaps best known for its historical links with the militant Irish Republican Army, surged in the country's general elections over the weekend. Its candidates vastly outpaced expectations by winning about 24.5% of the first-preference votes to fill the 160 seats of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, Ireland's lower house of parliament. That represents more than each of its two biggest competitors. Fine Gael, led by Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, got just under 21% of first-preference votes, while Fianna Fail won just over 22%. With more than three-quarters of parliamentary seats allocated by Monday evening local time, Sinn Fein held a substantial lead over its rivals. That does not mean the left-wing Irish nationalist party will walk away with control over the government. No single party is likely to even come close to the 80 seats necessary for a majority, and the leaders of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail \u2014 including Varadkar \u2014 have previously ruled out a coalition with Sinn Fein, citing the party's policies and its controversial historical connections with the violence of The Troubles. So the split vote portends a political muddle far more than it represents a rout \u2014 but the results nonetheless mark a shocking win for Sinn Fein that will have major consequences for Ireland. Here are a few reasons why. Two center-right parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, have enjoyed a virtual stranglehold on Irish politics since the country gained independence from Britain roughly a century ago. Since the enactment of Ireland's constitution in 1937, every Irish prime minister, or taoiseach, has represented one of the two major parties. It's unclear whether Varadkar's position will be endangered by the political wrangling to come. Regardless of how that shakes out, plenty of Irish voters registered their desire to shake up what had effectively become a two-party system. \"Irish people now want an alternative party for government. This isn't a protest vote,\" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told France 24. \"This is an expression of deep dissatisfaction with the traditional big two parties here.\" \"Ideally, I'd like us to form a government that is entirely new, without the two big parties,\" she added, noting that Sinn Fein had begun coalition talks with other small parties, such as the Greens and Social Democrats. Thank you. All of you who voted for Sinn F\u00e9in. Your vote counted. We are your party. We will now do everything we can to secure a government for the people. We will never leave you behind. We will never let you down. pic.twitter.com/6uCmETLTo3 Varadkar himself acknowledged that the weekend was a watershed of sorts for Irish politics. \"It seems now that we have a three-party system \u2014 three parties all getting roughly the same number of votes, the same number of seats,\" the prime minister told reporters Sunday. \"And that is going to make forming a government quite difficult.\" On the surface \u2014 or at least to observers abroad \u2014 Varadkar had plenty of reason to feel confident as voters headed to the polls. Ireland's youngest-ever prime minister, and its first to openly identify as gay, Varadkar successfully campaigned for the repeal of the country's longtime abortion ban and has more than held his own in the bruising Brexit negotiations with Ireland's U.K. neighbors. Yet for all the glowing headlines these wins have earned him beyond Ireland's borders, there was still plenty of domestic discontent over two issues that hit much closer to home for Irish voters: housing costs and health care. The numbers alone can tell the story: As for health care, hospitals in Ireland have grown so overcrowded that \u2014 according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation \u2014 it has become an \"intolerable situation for vulnerable patients and frontline workers alike.\" \"Nobody should have to endure this in a modern health service,\" said the organization's general secretary, Phil N\u00ed Sheaghdha. \"People find it a bit galling, I think, to hear this talk of a fantastic economy and how we've turned it around but then see homeless people on the streets, see their children moving back home because they can't afford to rent or to get on the property market,\" reporter Jennifer Bray of the Irish Times explained Saturday on Weekend Edition. Part of Sinn Fein's success this weekend came from convincing voters that, in McDonald's words, the left-wing alternative to the two major parties could be a \"vehicle for change\" on matters more pressing than Brexit. Sinn Fein's surge shocked observers not just for its present outsider status in Ireland, but also for what fostered that outsider status in the first place: the party's historical connections with the IRA. The paramilitary organization, which tried to achieve Irish unification by violent means, was a key player in the decades-long sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland known as The Troubles. More than 3,500 people died in the violence. The Good Friday peace deal of 1998 ended the violence with a power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland. Today, Sinn Fein nationalists share the regional government there with the pro-U.K. Democratic Unionist Party. Despite the peace, bad memories linger on both sides of the border, and Sinn Fein continues to carry the baggage of its historical association with the IRA. Hence the reluctance of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail leaders to even work with the party \u2014 though Miche\u00e1l Martin, leader of Fianna Fail, appears to be relenting in his opposition since the election. But among voters, it appears that baggage has become lighter with time. Sinn Fein turned to McDonald as the new face of the party in 2018, moving on after 35 years under her predecessor, and campaigned on issues such as housing prices and health care rather than stressing its push for a united Ireland, the group's foundational policy issue. The shift appeared to make a difference for younger voters, many of whom might not personally remember the Troubles. Exit polls published Saturday showed that Sinn Fein was far and away the most popular party among voters under the age of 34. \"It's not very complicated,\" said Donnchadh \u00d3 Laoghaire, a Sinn Fein member who won election Sunday. \"There's a whole generation of people out there who feel locked out of the possibility of ever having their own home.\" \"And I think,\" he added, \"that our policies, our vision for housing, our ambition for housing has clearly connected with young people.\"",

The election year proposals are unlikely to gain traction in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n                \n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hot off the presses: President Trump's budget proposal for fiscal year 2021. The election year proposals are unlikely to gain traction in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Updated at 1:45 p.m. ET President Trump proposed $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade in his budget for fiscal year 2021 \u2014 a document that is expected to be quickly dismissed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The proposal included slashing foreign aid by 21%. Budget chief Russell Vought said the White House wants to boost funding for the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation while cutting other types of foreign aid. \"Our view is that we have trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, and we have to take care of our deficits and those numbers need to get down,\" Vought said in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep. Trump has proposed massive cuts to aid in each of his budget proposals. Congress, which holds the power of the purse, has ignored those past requests. \"Democrats in Congress have opposed his previous budgets. We hope that changes. We probably need to have a national election before it does,\" Vought said. The proposed foreign aid cuts immediately drew fire from retired Adm. Mike Mullen, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011. \"The more we cut the international affairs budget, the higher the risk for longer and deadlier military operations,\" Mullen said in a letter to congressional leaders. The $4.875 trillion budget highlighted Trump's priorities on border security, tax cuts, space exploration and other policies he may pursue if he wins a second term in the November presidential election. Veterans Affairs and NASA were the biggest winners, while the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers saw big declines. The largest declines were seen at the Commerce Department \u2014 that's because the 2020 census will have concluded, accounting for the drawdown in spending. Loading... Trump's political rivals are expected to scour the budget for details they can brandish on the campaign trail \u2014 particularly any signs that Trump wants to cut mandatory spending on safety net programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Trump was asked in a CNBC interview last month whether cuts to \"entitlements\" would ever be considered. \"At some point they will be. We have tremendous growth,\" Trump said. \"And at the right time, we will take a look at that.\" On Saturday, Trump said on Twitter that this was not the right time. We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget. Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country\u2019s greatest ever Economy! \"We're not touching Medicare, we want to keep Medicare, we're not touching Social Security,\" Trump told governors at the White House on Monday. \"We're not decreasing Medicaid but we're doing a lot of things that are very good including [addressing] waste and fraud,\" he said. The White House and Congress negotiated a two-year spending deal last year that sets overall spending numbers for 2020 and 2021, another factor that will curb Trump's ambitions. The budget envisions $135 billion in savings for prescription drugs in the Medicare program, Vought said, a signal that the White House hopes Congress can agree on a plan to lower drug prices. The House passed a bill in December, which the White House promptly rejected. Trump has praised a plan proposed by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and the Senate Finance Committee. But so far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not endorsed it. Budget hawks have long urged curbs on spending \u2014 particularly on the big-ticket entitlement programs \u2014 to address the debt and deficit. Trump promised to eliminate the U.S. debt in eight years when he was first elected. But his budget comes as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated government spending outpaced revenues by about $900 billion in 2019 and said the deficit will balloon to more than $1 trillion each year beginning in 2022. Trump's new budget proposal projects that the deficit can be trimmed by $4.6 trillion over a decade and sees a balanced budget possible in 15 years, Vought said. That relies on the economy growing at 2.8% this year and 3% thereafter \u2014 growth that exceeds the outlook from the Federal Reserve, Congressional Budget Office and private forecasters. Actual GDP growth was 2.9% in 2018 and slowed to 2.3% in 2019. NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Prime Minister Leo Varadker's party is struggling, while Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein has surged into the lead ahead of Saturday's vote. Reporter Jennifer Bray of the Irish Times explains why.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Ireland holds parliamentary elections today. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar hopes to win more seats for his ruling Fine Gael party. But a poll this week shows that his party's in third place. The Irish nationalist Sinn Fein is surging into the lead. We're joined now from Dublin by Jennifer Bray, a political reporter for the Irish Times. Thanks so much for being with us. JENNIFER BRAY: Thanks so much for having me on. SIMON: A lot of people thought it would be a victory lap for Prime Minister Varadkar. The economy's doing well. He negotiated a Brexit deal with the U.K. that avoided a hard border. Why would he be trailing in the polls? BRAY: So I think what we saw that - at the start of the campaign, I think most commentators knew that something was afoot here. So, you know, for decades in Ireland, we have had this sort of duopoly, basically - Fianna Fail or Fine Gael. When the voters didn't want one in power, they'd vote the other one in. And I think what happened - after the recession, things started changing in our political landscape. For years, the left system in Ireland, left parties have been quite fragmented while the economy is strong. We have a number of social crises. So we have a housing crisis. We have health care crises. And we have a crisis with the cost of living. In terms of housing, we now know that rents in Ireland are at an all-time high. We know that there are around - just under around 10,000 people homeless. Elderly people, ill people are left - can't get access to beds and hospitals, and they're left waiting on trolleys. For most families, the cost of child care is basically a second mortgage. And I think people - they find it a bit galling, I think, to hear this talk of a fantastic economy and, you know, how we've turned it around but then see homeless people on the streets, see their children moving back home because they can't afford to rent or to get on the property market. And I think now there is an appetite for change. And I think Sinn Fein are coming in on that wave. SIMON: Jennifer, Sinn Fein is still associated in many American minds, I think, with its ties to the Irish Republican Army. How has it become a contender in recent years after Gerry Adams? BRAY: Well, to be honest with you, I think that after Gerry Adams stepped down as leader and Mary Lou McDonald took over, that's when a shift started in the party. And I think she presents a different face to voters. So when Gerry Adams used to go on and do the TV debates that we have, he would, of course, rightly always be asked about those links to the IRA, which he always denied, and kind of historical legacy issues in the past. And actually, some of it's not historical. Some of it's quite present. I think when Mary Lou McDonald took over, she has made the campaign about those things that I've talked about - housing and health. And their - they've got new faces, as well. They have spokespeople who are very effective and have been viewed as being standout performers in those debates I talk about. And it just - the shift is there. SIMON: Would Sinn Fein be able to form a government if it wins the most seats? BRAY: No. The trend is undeniable towards Sinn Fein. Even if they continue on, they - basically, in our Parliament, our Dail... SIMON: We should explain. The Dail is the Irish parliament, yeah. BRAY: Indeed, in the Irish parliament. Now, to get a majority in the next Dail, you need 80 seats. You need that majority of 80 seats. Sinn Fein have only around 42 candidates. So even if they return every single one of those candidates, which is not going to happen, they cannot form a government. That's where the focus will move next week. The focus today is people out casting their votes. Apparently, turnout is quite high. It's our first Saturday election in a century. And then, by Monday, the focus will turn completely to, how do you form a government on these numbers? SIMON: Jennifer Bray, political reporter for the Irish Times, thanks so much. BRAY: Thank you.

            "article_content": "The Iowa caucuses are Monday night. It's an event that gets a lot of attention \u2014 but only the first in a long election season with many big forces at play across the country.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: From impeachment to the 2020 campaign, which moves from anticipation to action with tonight's Iowa caucuses, it is just the first of many contests on the road to the Democratic nomination and eventually to the presidential election in November. NPR's Mara Liasson is here with more on what to expect along that road. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So it's almost felt like the arrival of caucus and primary season has felt backburner because we have been so deep in the impeachment trial. That is all about change. LIASSON: It certainly is. Today, tonight and tomorrow are the formal opening events of the 2020 elections. Obviously, in Iowa, tonight Democrats will cast their ballots at their caucuses. Tomorrow night President Trump appears in the well of the House before - speaks to both houses of Congress for the big curtain-raiser for him, the State of the Union address. It's the biggest audience he'll have all year. It's - every president gets to kind of kick off his re-election campaign with the State of the Union address, and we can expect to hear a campaign message from him tomorrow. KELLY: All right. So when you look at the Democrats and the Democratic race, which starts getting sorted out tonight, what are you watching for? What do you see? LIASSON: I see a very unsettled race, large numbers of Democrats undecided. Democrats are paralyzed by indecision because for them, electability is paramount. They consider President Trump an existential threat to everything they care about, and they just can't decide who is the best person to beat him and for good reason because none of the candidates seem like a sure thing to defeat Donald Trump. Each of one of them has huge vulnerabilities for the president to exploit. We've seen how he's gone after Joe Biden about his son's position on a board... KELLY: In Ukraine. LIASSON: ...In Ukraine. Bernie Sanders - you don't even need to do the research part of oppo research because his policy positions are opposed by big majorities of Americans. He wants to ban fracking and somehow win Pennsylvania. Even a majority of Democrats don't want to end private health insurance. Majorities of voters don't want to get rid of ICE or decriminalize border crossings. But still, you see every single Democratic candidate in Iowa spending so much time and effort just trying to convince people they can beat Trump. Uniformly across the board, that is every candidate's message. KELLY: Right. LIASSON: I'm the one who can beat him. KELLY: Well, and who can? I mean, what are the polls telling us? LIASSON: Well, right now according to the polls, the idea of Joe Biden beats Trump by the biggest margin. But if the reality is that Biden starts losing primaries, he might not look so electable. The person who polls the best against Trump is generic Dem. Too bad he or she is not running. KELLY: Not on the ballot. LIASSON: Yes. And even though Democrats want this to be a referendum on the president, it's not just a referendum. It is a binary choice - Trump versus someone. KELLY: What about Trump's standing? He's just looking like he's going to have weathered the impeachment drama that's unfolded in Washington. How's his... LIASSON: Yeah. KELLY: ...Standing looking? LIASSON: His standing is either a glass half-full or a glass half-empty. He's the least popular incumbent. His approval rating has never crossed 50%. Majorities say they will not vote for him under any circumstances. His strong disapprove number is higher than his strong approve number. But if you talk to any dozen professional political people in the universe, they'll say he is the favorite right now. He's got a strong grip on his base, structural advantage in the Electoral College, all the advantages of incumbency. He dominates the media. He can use all the levers of government at his disposal. Witness what he was able to do even when he couldn't get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden. He's now got Republicans in the U.S. Senate saying they want to investigate him. And he's got an economy that is not perfect, but it's pretty strong, and he's got a story to tell about black and Hispanic employment. KELLY: Speaking of the economy, people, when asked, often will tell you they vote with their checkbook. Is the economy going to be the big issue on people's minds this year? LIASSON: Actually, it might not. We may have moved on from, it's the economy, stupid, to, it's the culture, stupid. Of course, the president's going to lead with an economic message. Are you better off than you were four years ago? He believes the answer is yes. But according to the Trump campaign, he's going to run another us versus them campaign - immigration, prayer in schools, abortion, demonizing kneeling black athletes or The Squad, those four freshmen Democratic representatives. He wants to fire up his base, depress turnout on the other side. Trump is a culture warrior at heart, and one data point that might show he's right is that in the parts of the country that have benefited the most from the Trump economy, that's where his numbers are the worst. Where the economy is doing the worst - record farm bankruptcies, a manufacturing recession - that's where his numbers are the best. So maybe culture trumps economics. KELLY: We shall see in the long road ahead between now and November. Looking forward to working with you, Mara. LIASSON: Thanks. KELLY: NPR's Mara Liasson.

            "article_content": "Democratic voters in Decatur County, Iowa, are trying to figure out which candidate stands the best chance of beating President Trump in this year's election.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: The Iowa caucuses have almost arrived. They're on Monday. And the focus will be on Democrats and who they pick as their preferred candidate to take on a Republican president who won their state overwhelmingly four years ago. Morning Edition host David Greene is on the road there. And he's traveled to a county that backed Trump big. Good morning, David. DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: Hi there, Renee. MONTAGNE: The Democrats, of course, are mobilizing where you are. GREENE: Yeah. I mean, I've - Democrats are are feeling very energized, I think, as they go into Monday - a lot of strong views about getting President Trump out of office in 2020. But the conversations here, they're not like in some other parts of the country that feel very polarized - you know, your next door neighbor, the person you sit next to a church might have completely different political views. And so you really do hear people trying to talk things out. MONTAGNE: So it's not like those Thanksgiving dinners we've heard of or even experienced, where people have to leave the table? GREENE: It's not like that. At least it wasn't in Lamoni. It's this little town in Decatur County, down by the Missouri border that Trump won by 30 percentage points - this county. We hosted a roundtable there with voters. It was pretty powerful, Renee. There were four Democrats, one Republican sitting with me. I was asking them what they were basing their choices on in these caucuses Monday. Matthew Kolb (ph) was sitting there. He's 18 years old. He's a high school senior. And he brought up that he has a speech impediment. He told me that and says he spent much of his life being pretty quiet. But he really wanted to speak out today. And he made it clear that he doesn't want four more years of a president who he sees as a bully. MATTHEW KOLB: I just can't support a candidate who goes and talks down and insults and name calls because I don't want anyone to be treated like that. And I don't think that anyone wants to be treated like that because folks have opinions. And whether they're right or wrong, they deserve to be acknowledged and debated, not yelled at. GREENE: And so, Renee, just to my right was Marjie Foster. She's the county Democratic chair. She's also a pastor. And she was speaking about why she wants Trump out of office. MARJIE FOSTER: I have two grown children who owe more for their college loans right now than I have ever owed in my life - with the exception of my mortgage. I have family members who are members of the LGBTQ+ community whose lives have been jeopardized by some of the policies of this administration. To have any policies that benefit one socioeconomic class, one gender, one sexual orientation over another is just so abhorrent to me. MONTAGNE: And, David, you said a Trump supporter was right there listening to all of this. GREENE: Yeah - Republican sitting right near Marjie. They're actually friends. His name is Les Gardner (ph). He's 90 years old. He's going to be caucusing on Monday for the president in the Republican caucus, although there's not much suspense there. He is all in again for Donald Trump. And he said that all the noise has obscured this administration's accomplishments. LES GARDNER: If we hadn't been so distracted by political nonsense this last year, we'd have seen these extraordinary accomplishments. GREENE: You know, he spoke about the economy humming along, low unemployment. But given what I had heard before him, Renee, I had to ask him this. You're sitting at a table with people who feel that he has done things that hurt them to their core. What do you say to them? GARDNER: They are valid issues. And they should be discussed. And we should look at them. We might also look at what he's doing. GREENE: But I pressed him, Renee. I asked Les, you know, what about the president's divisive tone? GARDNER: If tone really matters that much - you mean the sweet talker? I don't know. That's nice. But as we've seen in the eight years before the current president's term, that didn't bring the benefits to society, the economic benefits to our society that our society needed. GREENE: You know, listening to Les there made me want to turn back to Matthew, the 18-year-old. And I wanted to ask him about the tone from some Democrats, you know, who are pretty dismissive of Trump supporters. He said those Democrats could take an example from him. KOLB: Both of my grandparents voted for Trump. That doesn't make them any less my grandparents. Like, I may disagree with them on some political things. But they're not racist. But just know all Trump voters are not racist. Again, we just have to talk to folks like they're people. MONTAGNE: So, David, what did you take from sitting there listening to this mix of voters? GREENE: I mean, it was interesting to hear who the Democrats are caucusing for, I'll say that. Matthew, the 18-year-old, is backing Pete Buttigieg. Marjie's supporting Amy Klobuchar. But beyond that, I was just struck by the neighborly tone - I mean, you know, that this group could be at the table sitting together talking about stuff, you know, during these very angry times. It was something kind of refreshing. MONTAGNE: And that's Morning Edition's David Greene joining us from Iowa this morning. Thanks very much, David. GREENE: You've got it, Renee.

European Union officials will be closely monitoring results of local elections in Italy Sunday that are seen as a bellwether for the fate of the national government. Polls suggest that the far-right populist League Party could win control of a region that has been a leftist bastion for 75 years. The northern region of Emilia-Romagna is home to Parmesan cheese, Prosciutto and luxury car makers. It's a poster-child for good government and social services. At 5%, unemployment here is half the national average. And yet, polls suggest the incumbent Democratic Party Governor Stefano Bonaccini is running neck and neck with the little-known right-wing candidate Lucia Bergonzoni\u2013 for whom the League Party secretary, Matteo Salvini, has been campaigning nonstop. Last Saturday, Salvini came to Maranello \u2013 home of Ferrari sports cars \u2013 cheered by enthusiastic middle-aged supporters like Silvana Valdinocci. She embraces Salvini's \"Italians-First\" slogan and anti-migrant policies.

He moves through the exuberant crowd, shaking hands, pausing for selfies. As he passes close to her, Simona Qualtieri can't hide her emotion. \"Matteo is unique, he's everything for me,\" she says, \"even bigger than a rock star!\" With the crowd cheering and shouting his name \u2013 \"Matteo, Matteo!\" \u2013 over and over, Salvini takes the stage. Flanked by Bergonzoni, Salvini tells the crowd that their regional vote on Sunday will have repercussions on the national political stage. \"Our beautiful victory here on Jan. 26 will be historic,\"Salvini shouts, \"it will totally change this country. With our victory, you will evict the government in Rome and send the Democratic Party packing!\" Last September, in a rare political miscalculation, Salvini walked out of the national governing coalition, hoping to trigger early elections.

I should close the country. I should protect my border, my society, the root of my country.\" Salvini and his rightwing allies have been gaining ground across the country and they have won eight regional elections since mid-2018. He's betting another League victory would destabilize the Rome government. That alarmed a group of 30-somethings who in November mobilized an anti-Salvini flash mob in Bologna.

The power to have a word, to be listened to, to be capable of expressing their vision. Against whom? Against leaders like Salvini who occupy the entire domain of opinion formation and the domain of media,\" Urbinati says. Mattia Santori, one of the Sardines movement founders, contrasts the Sardines' strategy with that of the populist League. \"On the digital side, the populists are really strong. They have a great organization. They have good money. They know how to do this job. But we also know that we are really strong on the street, on the square.

In 2016, it voted for candidate Donald Trump by 20 points. Of Iowa's 99 counties, 31 swung from voting for the Democrat Obama in 2008 and 2012 to the Republican Trump in 2016, according to Ballotpedia. Howard County, with its 41-point shift, saw the biggest swing. National reporters have descended on the county, trying to understand the massive shift, and people there offer a few possible explanations. Some point to white, working-class union voters who bought into Trump's economic promises. Others point to the moment the local theater showed a movie that smeared Hillary Clinton. Whatever the reason, local Democrats want to make sure they can win back some voters. But they're torn on how to do that. \"Republicans stand behind their candidate,\" Hubka said. \"Like, the Democrats have to fall in love. We have to be, like, 'Oh, Barack Obama.' You know, I don't feel like people are, like, 'Oh, Joe Biden,' you know \u2014 and that's a problem.\" Hubka is not supporting the former vice president. Instead, she's backing Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. So is Dale Ernst. \"I think he's just kind of a calm voice in the middle of the chaos, which is what we're in the middle of now,\" said Ernst, who's a precinct captain for Buttigieg. I met Ernst recently, along with some 20 other Democrats, at the local chamber of commerce, which also houses the Iowa Wrestling Hall of Fame. (Random fact: Tiny Howard County is home to multiple Olympic wrestlers.) The local chamber of commerce also houses the Iowa Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The local chamber of commerce also houses the Iowa Wrestling Hall of Fame. Ernst, like some other folks at the Democratic committee meeting, is looking for a moderate candidate. And he's worried about some ideas on the left of his party. The 66-year-old is skeptical of \"Medicare for All.\" \"I just don't think it's reasonable,\" he said. \"I just really don't. I think for people younger than 65, they see this more free than, really, the cost of it.\" Another voter at the chamber, Sally Godwin, thinks Buttigieg is too young. And she would love to see a woman, though she thinks Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is too old. \"Amy Klobuchar is kind of right in the middle,\" Godwin said. \"I like what she has to say.\" \"She is, she is right in the middle,\" chimed in her friend Connie Hvitved, who's also leaning toward the Minnesota senator. Democrats, regardless of whom they're supporting, insist that people are more involved this presidential election. But they're still not confident about their odds in 2020. \"I will do my best to try to get this county back,\" said Hubka, the party chair. \"I don't have high hopes. ... I don't know in November that it'll flip completely. I hope that I can get at least 10 of the points back or, you know, 15.\" Local Democrats like Ernst say the best way to ensure the county flips back is for national Democrats to pay attention to places like his. \"Coming to a place like here, where the swing was 20 [for Obama] to 20 [for Trump], I think it steers the ship,\" he said. \"It gives a good idea of where we should go.\" Democrats can turn to history for some hope. The last time the county went for a Republican prior to Trump was in 1984 for Ronald Reagan. Four years later, it turned blue again.",

            "article_content": "The 2020 campaign is about to kick into high gear. Candidates are dropping out and others are announcing fundraising numbers. Meanwhile, voters will start voting in Iowa and New Hampshire in a month.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: 2020 is here, and along with it, the race for president begins in earnest. A month from tomorrow, Iowa Democrats hold their caucuses. But one candidate, Julian Castro, won't be there. He dropped out today. And as Castro gets out of the race, other Democrats are sharing their most recent fundraising totals. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins us to sift through all these latest developments. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. So former Housing Secretary Julian Castro - he suspended his presidential campaign today. But I mean, he never really gained traction. So does his departure reshape the race in any way? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, not really from a standpoint of who's going to win the nomination because, you know, he was really struggling to gain traction in the polls. He was lagging behind in fundraising. And it led him to not making the last couple of debate stages. That made it pretty tough for him to get his message out. So you know, he's not really somebody who was a strong contender for the nomination at this point. CHANG: Right. But that said, Castro did introduce some policies that got a lot of attention, like decriminalizing illegal border crossings. He was the only Latino candidate in the field. Could you say his candidacy actually had a much bigger impact than polling numbers would suggest? MONTANARO: You know, he really talked a lot about underrepresented and underserved communities. And you noted he really pushed the field, especially on decriminalizing border crossings. For a few weeks there, it got a lot of attention. And that policy, though, we have to say - we started polling on it, and it was very unpopular, even among Democrats. But being the only Latino in the race was notable. I mean, his departure certainly highlights a lack of diversity now at the very top of the field. Castro spoke pretty bluntly about how white Iowa and New Hampshire are, for example - those first two nominating states - and that he didn't think that they should go first. And he said so in Iowa. Let's take a listen to what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JULIAN CASTRO: I'm going to tell the truth. It's time for the Democratic Party to change the way that we do our presidential nominating process. Part of the reason for that is that I don't believe that the two states that begin the process, Iowa and New Hampshire, are reflective of the diversity of our country or of our party. MONTANARO: You know, that's not usually how you go about trying to get votes in those states - by saying that. But it's worth pointing out that voters of color are supporting some of the top candidates. Black voters, especially older voters, are saying that they prefer Joe Biden; younger ones of color and Latinos saying that they are backing Bernie Sanders. CHANG: Well, let's talk about some of these top Democratic candidates. We have some new fundraising numbers. MONTANARO: Yep. CHANG: These cover the last three months of 2019, right? MONTANARO: Yep. CHANG: So tell us what you're seeing. MONTANARO: So topping the field for the fourth quarter, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raising nearly $35 million - pretty big haul - followed by former mayor of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 25 million, former Vice President Joe Biden at almost 23 million, Andrew Yang next at 17. We have not heard what Senator Elizabeth Warren's fundraising numbers are yet, which means she's not touting them, exactly. And notably here, Sanders' grassroots strength still very strong, unparalleled in the field. His average donation - $18 - and gotten some 5 million donations, way more than many of the others. CHANG: All right. That's NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Brett Bruen (@BrettBruen) was director of global engagement in the Obama White House and was a U.S. diplomat for 12 years. He now runs a crisis communications agency and teaches on the topic at Georgetown University. What's the difference between traditional diplomacy and the menace of modern-day meddling? President Trump and some Republicans in Congress suggest Russia and Ukraine both sought to interfere in our 2016 presidential elections. Yet, the actions of the two countries could not have been more different. It's not a difficult distinction to draw. Lots of nations, including our own, express views on policies, problems and the general process during elections in other countries. They do so openly and without seeking to affect the outcome of those polls. Then, there are the pernicious phenomena of adversarial influence operations. These are covert actions that attempt to tip the scales or twist the truth. The latter endangers democracies, while the other actually strengthens them. Let's look at why. I spent a lot of time trying to influence democracies as an American diplomat posted overseas. We met with politicians and public officials, encouraging them to adhere to certain norms and consider America's policy preferences. We operated openly. We bought Facebook and Twitter ads, clearly labeled as coming from our government. We were especially interested in confidential insights that could help inform our position. But we never weaponized that information against candidates or parties. Going back centuries, the rules of diplomacy prohibit interfering in the \"internal affairs\" of a host country. Sometimes the leaders where we serve try to pull out that red card when ambassadors or others say things they don't want to hear. The recent departure of the U.S. ambassador from Zambia after speaking out for LGBTQ rights is an illustration of this issue. Discussing difficult topics isn't disinformation or designed to destabilize democracies. Ukraine's ambassador to the United States wrote an op-ed in The Hill during the 2016 presidential campaign. Candidate Donald Trump had suggested that perhaps Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, belonged to the invading country. This would have dramatically changed U.S. policy toward the inviolability of countries' borders. Kyiv's representative to Washington absolutely was within his rights, and indeed it was his solemn responsibility, to speak up for his nation's security. During the impeachment hearings and in a Politico article at the beginning of 2017, it was suggested that Ukraine was actively trying to \"sabotage\" Trump's candidacy. Apart from the ambassador's editorial, volunteer efforts by a young Ukrainian American to investigate Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, were cited. She was not alone. A lot of people were concerned by connections between Trump and Russia. Information is the currency of diplomacy. Our embassies regularly receive information or briefings from people who have investigated issues on their own and would like to bring their findings to our attention. Unlike Russia, there's no indication the Ukrainian American stole information or was in any way directed by the Democrats or Kyiv. It's not surprising that Ukraine's government may have been quite alarmed by Trump. The country depends on U.S. aid and assurances of support to contain Russian intrusions from going farther into Ukraine. Yet, there is no evidence that Ukraine ever mounted a coordinated campaign to \"sabotage\" Trump or influence American voters' decisions. The fact that Politico used such a loaded term to headline its story is indicative of how little even major outlets understand about the rules and conduct of diplomacy. If a major candidate or party in Australia were advocating for closer ties to China, the United States would speak up. Our ambassador would write editorials. Our diplomats and their contacts would seek to uncover every bit of information we could find about the Australian politicians and their background. Our embassy would conduct extensive meetings with political, media and other influential actors on the danger of their candidacy. In short, the United States of America, a much more powerful nation than Ukraine, would do exactly what Ukraine did during our 2016 elections. As we head into the 2020 elections, we must do a better job of distinguishing between earnest diplomacy and destructive disinformation. Brett Bruen, former diplomat When Trump won, Ukraine opted for the only path remaining. It hired an expensive Washington, D.C., lobbying firm to help enhance relations with the new administration or, at the very least, stave off the worst-case scenarios. That isn't meddling. The country registered its actions with the Justice Department and regularly reports on its activities. That's how diplomacy is supposed to work. Russia, by contrast, reported nothing and denies everything. It continues to build an elaborate asymmetric influence apparatus to generate doubt, distrust and division across America. The danger of its work derives from its secrecy and subterfuge. Disinformation and meddling more broadly operate in the shadows; diplomacy is conducted openly. Conflating the two only serves to buttress Moscow's efforts to blur the line between right and wrong. We want Ukraine and other nations to speak up when they have concerns. Our democracy does not thrive in isolation. It is crucially important that countries feel as though they can contribute to our national debate in constructive ways. Similarly, it is critically important that we be able to recognize and react when adversaries attempt to damage our democracy. As we head into the 2020 election, we must do a better job of distinguishing between earnest diplomacy and destructive disinformation. One seeks to strengthen our international relations. The other strives to weaken them, our ideals and institutions.",

Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino candidate in the Democratic field, has ended his presidential campaign. Castro released a video on Twitter on Thursday, saying that his campaign had \"stood up for the most vulnerable people\" and had \"given a voice to those who are often forgotten.\" He adds in the video: \"I'm not done fighting. I'll keep working toward a nation where everyone counts.\" It\u2019s with profound gratitude to all of our supporters that I suspend my campaign for president today.I\u2019m so proud of everything we\u2019ve accomplished together. I\u2019m going to keep fighting for an America where everyone counts\u2014I hope you\u2019ll join me in that fight. pic.twitter.com/jXQLJa3AdC Castro served as secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration and, before that, was mayor of San Antonio, Texas. He was one of the first presidential candidates to announce a run, in January 2019. But Castro struggled to stand out of a crowded Democratic field and didn't gain much traction in national or state polls. He didn't qualify for the last two Democratic debates, in November and December. But Castro's policies often stood out. In an email Thursday, his campaign highlighted that he was the first Democratic presidential candidate with policies on immigration, police reform and ending hunger, among other issues. On immigration, he advocated for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, a position that other candidates then adopted. \"For a long time in this country, we actually did not treat crossing the border as a criminal act. We treated it as a civil violation,\" Castro told NPR in May 2019. \"A lot of the problems that we see in the system today flared up after we started treating it as a criminal offense.\" Castro also criticized the Democratic Party itself, urging it to change the presidential nominating process. In Iowa, he told attendees at a town hall, \"I don't believe the two states that start the process \u2014 Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 are reflective of the diversity of the country, or of our party.\" Castro often praised the support of his family, specifically his identical twin brother, Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, and his mother, Rosie Castro, a Mexican-American civil rights activist who took part in the Chicano movement. In an interview with The Washington Post in early October, Rosie Castro argued that her son was not climbing in the polls partly because of media coverage. \"There was no respect, if you will,\" Rosie Castro told the newspaper. \"It's just the way that he's talked about sometimes makes you feel like they just don't get it, you know, that they have not been around minorities enough to be able to have a sense for \u2014 we can also create, we can also lead.\" Castro had criticized President Trump on NPR as \"the biggest identity politician\" in modern politics. \"What he's trying to do is, he's trying to split people along racial and ethnic and religious lines,\" Castro told the NPR Politics Podcast. \"His specialty, if you will, is division, trying to just amp up a base. He's the biggest identity politician that we've had over the past 50 years.\"",

DAVID GREENE, HOST: The Trump administration will stop accepting new applications for a program that protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. As NPR's John Burnett reports, the administration is defying a federal court that said the program should be fully restored. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: When the Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration had illegally canceled the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, it left open the door for the president to circle back and try to kill it again. On Tuesday, the administration announced it would thoroughly reconsider DACA, and in the meantime, the government would not accept any new applications from young people who want to qualify, and it would only renew current DACA recipients for one year, down from two years. Though Tuesday's announcement angered immigrant advocates, it stops short of cancelling the program outright, as Trump did earlier in his presidency. Here he is at an afternoon press conference. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we're also going to end up with a fantastic merit-based immigration system. BURNETT: The move to reject new applicants goes against a Maryland federal judge who, earlier this month, told the White House it had to accept them. The program gives some 640,000 immigrants who were brought here by their parents illegally as kids permission to work, and it shields them from deportation. Some observers believe the president, aware of the program's popularity among Democrats and Republicans, is careful not to attack the so-called DREAMers. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah is president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. KRISH O'MARA VIGNARAJAH: I do think, in punting on this, there is some recognition that it is not just the wrong thing to do but, politically, stupid for them to take even further action against DREAMers. BURNETT: The White House did not say whether it will take further action on DACA before or after the November election. John Burnett, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court has extended a life-support line to some 650,000 so-called \"Dreamers\" on Thursday, allowing them to remain safe from deportation.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has been following this case as it made its way through the courts. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Chief Justice Roberts' opinion for the court was a narrow but powerful rejection of the way the Trump administration went about trying to revoke the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Writing for the court majority, the chief justice said, we do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies. The wisdom of those decisions is none of our concern. Here, we address only whether the administration complied with the procedural requirements in the law that insist on a reasoned explanation for its actions. Initially, the chief justice observed, the attorney general offered no detailed justification for the rescission, nor did the secretary of homeland security. As Roberts noted, she didn't address the fact that thousands of young people who'd come out of the shadows were enrolled in degree programs, had embarked on careers, had started businesses, bought homes and even married and had some 200,000 children of their own who are U.S. citizens. Joining the Roberts opinion were the court's four liberals. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the principal dissent, accusing Roberts of writing a political, rather than a legal, opinion. In tweets, President Trump condemned what he called horrible and politically charged decisions coming out of the court. Do you get the impression the Supreme Court doesn't like me? He added. So what is the future of DACA? The consensus among immigration experts is that there's not enough time for President Trump to try to abolish the program before January. Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr is the author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law. STEPHEN YALE-LOEHR: It's not remotely possible before the election. TOTENBERG: But if Trump is reelected, he almost certainly will try again. For now, though, more individuals eligible for DACA status may be able to apply. Marisol Orihuela, co-director of the Yale Law School Immigration Clinic, notes that until today, the administration had refused to accept new applications. She thinks that will have to change now. MARISOL ORIHUELA: Our understanding is the program is restored to what it was in 2012, when it went into effect, up until 2017. TOTENBERG: Politically, today's decision played out as expected, with anti-immigration groups condemning the decision and DACA recipients jubilant and relieved. But aside from Trump, lots of Republicans are relieved as well. If today's decision had gone the other way, the pressure on congressional Republicans in an election year to pass legislation protecting the DREAMers would have been intense. DACA is an astonishingly popular program, with recent polls showing up to 85% among Democratic and independent voters and huge majorities also among Republican voters as well. Indeed, 200 major corporations filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting the DACA recipients - among them, Microsoft and its president, Brad Smith. BRAD SMITH: There's more than 30,000 DACA registrants working in the health care space alone. So we've never needed these people more than we do today. And every time I meet with them, I have the same reaction - we are lucky, as a country, to have them. TOTENBERG: Not all DACA critics, of course, are against DACA; they're against the fact that President Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction, put the program into effect by executive order, and they warn of unforeseen consequences. Here's Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute. ILYA SHAPIRO: This raises profound issues of executive power and, in effect, sets out a ratchet whereby statutory changes can be enacted by presidential executive order but can only be rescinded through jumping through various administrative law hoops. TOTENBERG: At the end of the day, of course, the man of the hour is Chief Justice Roberts. Amid a politicized and polarized society, he repeatedly tries to portray the court as apolitical. He sees the growth of organizations on the hard right, like the Judicial Crisis Network, and on the hard left, like Demand Justice, each trying to stack the court with like-minded justices or to pack the court by expanding the number of justices. Harvard law professor Richard Lazarus has known the chief justice for decades. RICHARD LAZARUS: What these decisions this week underscore is we have a chief justice who is, plainly, working hard to try to demonstrate to the American people that the court, unlike the other two branches, is doing its job. He wants the American people to believe there's a thing called law, and a justice's job is to apply it. TOTENBERG: Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

But Biden will not necessarily have the congress he wants to easily pass it.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Joe Biden laid out an ambitious agenda for what he would like to do after he is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States in January. But Biden will not necessarily have the Congress he wants to easily pass it. And we're going to hear more about that from NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who's with us now. Sue, welcome. Thanks for joining us. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: Talk a little bit more about what the next Congress will look like for Joe Biden, just based on the results we have at this point. DAVIS: Yeah. And I think this is important because, you know, obviously, Joe Biden is projected to win this election. That's a great night for Democrats. But down the ballot tell us a little bit of a different story. You know, Republicans had a good night on election night. Republicans are poised to gain seats in the House. They held off a big Democratic wave in the Senate. Democrats were really expecting sort of a - or seeking a sort of big repudiation of Trump election. And they didn't really get that. In some ways, it was a status quo election down the ballot, that the message that the country was sending is they wanted a different president, but they didn't necessarily want a different Congress. The big question mark here is the Senate. OK. So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is projected to have 50 seats in the next Senate, Democrats 48. We have two special elections in Georgia on January 5. And if Democrats were to be able to pick up those seats, that would be a 50/50 Senate, and it would become a Democratic majority because in a split Senate, the vice president breaks that tie. So the center of the political universe is about to shift to Georgia because so much is at stake in those two Senate seats. But I do have to say a word of caution here. Coming out of this election, Republicans, you know, they are not down and out. And they have a very good track record of winning Senate races in Georgia, especially special elections and runoffs. So I think that they have the advantage going into those races. MARTIN: So we've talked a lot this hour and earlier today about some of the - excuse me - differences of opinion among the Democrats about some of these key issues on how progressive should they be, how moderate should they be. But let's set that aside for a minute and just say that there is a list of things that Democrats do agree on. By and large, they want to repeal the GOP tax bill. They want to expand or perfect, as Joe Biden says, you know, tweak or perfect or improve the Affordable Care Act. They do want a public option. They do want citizenship for DREAMERs, people who are brought here as children, who - brought here illegally as children. They do want to balance the conservative tilt of the federal judiciary, the federal bench, with people who have different views. And they do want to work on policing reform, voting rights - a long list of things that they do agree on, even if they don't agree on all the particulars. Is that basically all on hold if they don't win the Senate, or is there any room for agreement with the Senate Republicans? DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, we have a decade of evidence of what divided Congress looks like, and it's not particularly productive. Gridlock has generally defined the past decade in government. And I think that the safest assumption is that it would probably be a lot more like that than some big legislative breakthroughs. If Mitch McConnell stays the majority leader, you know, he has proudly called himself this entire Congress the grim reaper for the Democratic agenda, things like a public option, things like immigration reform, especially the House Democrats see it. Yeah, they're probably off of the agenda. I also think the Biden administration was, you know, how they were planning for a Democratic-controlled Senate and a split Senate are two very different things. One thing we're immediately going to be looking to watch for is, who does the president appoint to fill out his Cabinet? And are there going to be any of those big confirmation fights that he wouldn't have confronted with a Democratic Congress? But he may have a very potent check on his power with Republicans in the Senate. MARTIN: And before we let you go, the vice president, President-elect Biden often said during the campaign he could work with Republicans, that he had many Republican friends. Some Democrats scoffed at that. But he does have a long relationship with Mitch McConnell, the GOP leader, you know, at the moment, as well as other Republicans. Could that come into play? I know you've done some reporting on this. DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, McConnell and Biden have a long relationship. They cut some of the biggest deals, most memorable deals of the Obama administration era. The two of them were the two that hammered out the deal to head off the fiscal cliff back in 2012. They have a personal relationship, too. McConnell is the only Republican senator who attended the funeral of his son Beau back in 2015. They are definitely two people that can cut a deal. I would caution with that that the deals they cut were always at a time of crisis, when deadlines were impending or something had to get done. I do think two things. We are still in the middle of a crisis. There's still a pandemic going on. And legislation will have to be done. And also, right after this election, the Supreme Court's about to take up a case on the Affordable Care Act. And if that law is dismantled, they might be confronted with having to do health care legislation, whether they like it or not. MARTIN: That was NPR's Susan Davis. Susan, thank you.

But Layune isn't taking it for granted that Democrats will repeat their 2016 victory in the Silver State. And this election is personal to her. LAYUNE: This president - he start to take out the DACA. I say no. PAYNE: She's talking about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Among those DACA recipients is Layune's adult son, who came to the country when he was a baby. President Trump has tried and so far failed to eliminate the program. Biden says he will protect it. LAYUNE: A lot of people, they don't know their countries. My son always say, man, I don't know how is to live in Mexico. I never go there. PAYNE: Layune's canvassing is part of a larger effort by her union's sister organization, the Culinary Workers Union. It represents about 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada, the majority of whom are Latino. The union began canvassing for Biden in August, well before the Biden campaign itself started knocking on doors in Nevada. GEOCONDA ARGUELO-KLINE: Right now, you know, the Latino community's been suffering with this pandemic. PAYNE: Geoconda Arguelo-Kline is the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union. She says President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has hit Latinos especially hard. In Nevada, Latinos make up about 30% of the population but account for more coronavirus infections than any other group. ARGUELO-KLINE: We cannot afford another four years for President Trump, and we need to be sure Biden become the president. PAYNE: But it wasn't Biden who most Latinos in the state caucused for back in February. Bernie Sanders was the most popular candidate. An analysis by UCLA found that of majority-Latino precincts, 70% backed Sanders. This has led to some concern among Democrats that Biden isn't motivating Latino voters. But Adrian Pantoja doesn't see it that way. ADRIAN PANTOJA: That enthusiasm gap is not there. We see a highly energized Latino population. PAYNE: Pantoja is an analyst for Latino Decisions, a public opinion firm focused on Latinos. He says that when it comes to getting Latinos to the polls, enthusiasm doesn't matter nearly as much as voter contact. PANTOJA: People vote because they either have the resources to go to politics or because politics comes to them. And when it comes to Latinos, which is a resource-poor community, politics coming to them is pivotal. PAYNE: Back on the streets of Reno, I speak with Javier Moldonado, the young man Layune was canvassing. He tells me his vote is going to Biden. When I ask why, he talks less about Biden and more about Trump. MOLDONADO: He'll say something, but he'll never really think about how he's going to do it. And later on, he just does the opposite of what he actually said he's going to do in general. That just tells me that he doesn't know what he's doing. PAYNE: As for Layune, herself, she won't be voting at all - not because she doesn't want to, but because she can't. As a green card holder without U.S. citizenship, canvassing is as close as she'll get to the ballot box this election cycle. For NPR News, I'm Benjamin Payne in Reno. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Against twin pandemics of illness and racism, deep economic insecurity, and a president whose relentless fearmongering has reached fever pitch, the ability to vote has never been more important. Desmond Meade's Let My People Vote: My Battle to Restore the Civil Rights of Returning Citizens is a compelling story about one man's rise from addiction, homelessness, and prison to run a successful campaign to re-enfranchise more than one million Florida voters. Meade had been toiling for years when he \"burst\" onto the national scene in 2018. In that year's election, more than 60 percent of Florida voters approved Amendment 4, a ballot initiative to restore voting rights to returning citizens (returning to society from prison). Unfortunately, the story does not end there. But the man and the campaign offer inspiring examples of hope, persistence, and the power of organizing. Meade recounts a challenging personal history in Let My People Vote. After completing high school, he entered the army. His life went dramatically downhill following his service. He struggled with drug addiction and became homeless. He racked up convictions \u2014 arrested for shoplifting, drug possession, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Finally, he ended up in the wrong place (a house where he was squatting) at the wrong time, and was charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Meade gives a harrowing account of his arrest \u2014 writing that the police falsely claimed he'd been standing in a bedroom with a gun in his hand. The gun was in a cupboard and belonged to the owner of the house, he writes \u2014 and the owner lied and pointed the finger at Meade, promising to bail him out. \"That was fine reasoning,\" Meade writes, except that due to prior convictions, Meade's \"life changed in an instant.\" He got 15 years. Incarcerated, Meade not only became a successful jailhouse lawyer, he found a calling to help people. When he left prison, he faced a situation typical in America. As a convicted felon \u2014 even one who'd served his time \u2014 he couldn't get housing or a job, nor could he vote. Yet he faced dire consequences if he stole so much as a candy bar. Meade describes the difficulties of finding a treatment program and getting sober. He credits his late mother with his zeal for education. He began taking classes at Miami Dade Community College, astonished that a Black man with a criminal record, living in a shelter, could enroll for free. In a chapter called \"Community Service is My Lottery Ticket,\" Meade finds his path to leadership. He'd planned on a paralegal career but began volunteering as an anti-homelessness activist. Along with several other promising students, he was selected to represent the college at a lobby day in Tallahassee. On the way, he met the young people who would be pivotal in the \"Dreamers\" movement. He was hooked on advocacy and went on to get a law degree at Florida International University. For six years, Meade worked out of this car, crisscrossing Florida, campaigning for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise former felons. Everywhere he went \u2014 in Black communities and white ones \u2014 he found support to end the voting ban. Plenty of white people had been disenfranchised and, Meade reminds us, racism is not natural; it's learned behavior. His only support were the people with whom he talked day-in and day-out. In his words, the initiative \"was about forgiveness, restoration, and love.\" Despite overwhelming bipartisan support, as soon as Amendment 4 passed, Florida Republicans began to undo it. The Republican legislature limited the constitutional amendment so that only former felons who owed no money to the state could register to vote. Government fines and fees have been used for decades to suspend Americans' civil rights, particularly Black Americans'. According to the Fines and Fees Justice Center: \"People who cannot immediately pay face additional fees, license suspensions, loss of voting rights and, far too frequently, arrest and jail. Millions of Americans get trapped in the justice system simply because they can't afford to pay fines and fees.\" Amendment 4 supporters cried foul, citing an unconstitutional poll tax. The lower court agreed. After several rounds in court, however, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, prohibiting hundreds of thousands of former felons in Florida from registering to vote for the upcoming presidential election. Five out of the six judges in the majority were appointed by Donald Trump. As recounted in Let My People Vote, the Florida voting rights restoration battle is a story of courage and vision and persistence. Too, it is a stark tale of Florida's Republican leadership overruling the will of the people in a blatant move to suppress votes. Following the 11th Circuit decision, Desmond Meade said: \"We will not rest until we live up to the promise of Amendment 4 and see every one of the 1.4 million returning citizens who want to be a part of our democracy have the opportunity to do so.\" He concludes Let My People Go on a hopeful note: \"I still believe that love will win the day.\" Martha Anne Toll just completed 26 years at the Butler Family Fund, a social justice philanthropy.

If this were a normal school year, Denison University senior Matt Nowling and his fellow College Democrats would be \"dorm storming\" around their campus, near Columbus, Ohio. \"We ran to people's dorms, knocked their doors and got them registered to vote,\" he said. \"Sometimes we got kicked out of dorms,\" he added. The start of the new school year is prime time for registering college students to vote and getting them excited about casting ballots in November \u2014 many for the first time. But this fall, those students who can return to campus are doing so under restrictions aimed at keeping the coronavirus from spreading. That means political organizing at universities is going virtual. For Nowling, a political science major and interim president of the national College Democrats of America organization, it's a bit of a letdown. \"All the different events that we would have in person simply can't happen. And I miss that a lot,\" he said. From knocking on doors to pounding on keyboards Figuring out how to reach people during a pandemic is hard, said Ben Rajadurai, executive director of the College Republican National Committee. He led campus Republicans at Stonehill College in Massachusetts before graduating in 2017. \"We were trained, like, knock doors, not keyboards,\" he said. \"And then overnight, it's like, no, no, no, knock keyboards ... You quite literally cannot knock doors right now.\" On campuses across the country, club recruiting fairs are happening on Zoom. College Republicans and Democrats are using Instagram and Facebook to promote virtual events. Members are swapping political memes on messaging apps like GroupMe. \"We have a group chat where people talk all the time, and it's always going,\" said Claire Grissum, president of College Republicans at the University of Missouri. \"There are new people added all the time, hopping into the conversation.\" But, she acknowledges, it's harder online to grab the attention of a student whose mind is on classes and college life, not politics. Someone who might not seek out a group chat, but would, in a normal year, engage in a conversation while crossing campus. \"School picks up and life gets busier. It gets harder to prioritize and sometimes we kind of fall off of their radar,\" she said. \"We're hoping that there will be leniency in the [university's] guidelines for us to sit outside and [set up] table[s] ... because I know that's how we attract a lot of members that stay in our organization.\" Efforts to keep increasing the student voting rate despite pandemic With just two months to go before the election, there is a lot of pressure to get the country's roughly 18 million college students more involved in politics. Younger people are less likely to vote than the rest of the population, but participation has been rising in recent elections. Voting rates for college students more than doubled between the midterm elections of 2014 and 2018, according to research from Tufts University's Institute for Democracy and Higher Education. Events like this summer's racial justice protests are mobilizing college students, said Tufts researcher Adam Gismondi. \"The last few years have been a bit of a civics lesson for everyone in this country. For college students, we've definitely seen growing attention, often around specific issues,\" he said. \"Around [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program], around the safety of Black Americans and around the sort of unavoidable attention that the Trump administration has received.\" Tech companies are also trying to help, building on voter registration efforts that started several election cycles ago. This year, Snapchat is letting people register to vote directly in its app, while Facebook has pledged to register 4 million voters by November. Limitations of digital organizing Campus organizers warn digital tools cannot fully replace face-to-face interaction in the brief window before election day. \"That first touch with an activist or potential voter ... it's arguably the most important contact. That conversation becomes a lot tougher in the digital space,\" said Rajadurai. At Penn State University, College Democrats President Jacob Klipstein says he thinks paper registration forms are still the most accurate method of getting people onto the voter rolls. What's more, not all states allow every eligible adult to register online. His group is planning to register voters in person on campus \u2014 with masks and other precautions. \"We're going to be using gloves. We're going to be using hand sanitizer. We're going to be using clipboards and we're going to have towels to wipe down pens,\" he said. What happens if campuses shut down? There are signs registration efforts are working. In 20 states, more young voters had already registered by this August than had done so in November 2016, according to data analyzed by CIRCLE, a Tufts University research group focused on youth civic engagement. But many students are facing uncertainty over where to register and vote, because it is unclear whether they will still be on campus in November. Universities are already dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks, and some are scaling back their reopening plans. That prospect alarms Serena Ishwar, president of Ohio State University's College Democrats chapter. \"The likelihood of them saying, oh, well, the cases are too high, you guys have to go home like two weeks before the election \u2014 it really worries me,\" she said. That underscores another challenge: while college activists are using all the tools at their disposal to register voters, it is much harder to get students to cast ballots. Just 40 percent of eligible college students went to the polls in 2018, a year when 73 percent of students registered to vote, according to Tufts.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court's DACA ruling on Thursday has shielded Young immigrants shielded from deportation, but only temporarily as the Trump administration is still vowing to end the program.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday slapping down President Trump's attempt to cancel DACA was a moment of deliverance for hundreds of thousands of young people. DACA is the Obama-era program for unauthorized immigrants who are brought to this country as children, and it shields them from removal and allows them to work. For months, DACA recipients had been waiting nervously for this decision. Now they can exhale, but only temporarily because the administration vows to continue its fight to end DACA. NPR's John Burnett reports. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: The anticipation and stress have been nearly unbearable. Then came the long-awaited announcement yesterday morning - the court ruled 5 to 4 that DREAMers could stay. They would not be deported back to countries they scarcely remember, at least for the time being. Jose Martinez is 20 and enrolled in the journalism school at The University of Texas at Austin. He was brought here as an infant from El Salvador. JOSE MARTINEZ: It's crazy, man. Like, I feel, honestly, relieved. But we should not be complacent because I don't know what Trump has planned. Hopefully nothing too crazy. BURNETT: Well, Trump didn't take long to answer that question. He tweeted this morning that the Supreme Court decision wasn't a win or loss for the White House, and he now has a road map of how to end DACA by the book. He said he'll be submitting papers shortly. That would set off a new brawl in the federal courts. Immigrant advocates will sue again, and those lawsuits and appeals take time. If that happens, DACA recipients hope it drags on past the election and a Democratic president and perhaps a Democratic-controlled Congress finally legalize their existence in the U.S. ELLIE PEREZ: For me, it is a moment of celebration. But I hear my mom's voice - you know, celebrate today, but you better get back to work tomorrow. BURNETT: Ellie Perez is a 29-year-old DACA recipient and Democratic Party activist. Her parents brought her from Veracruz, Mexico, to Arizona when she was 4. PEREZ: We still have to put on our organizing shoes and go out and talk to those voters and keep organizing because the work isn't done until comprehensive immigration reform happens, until we have a pathway to citizenship. BURNETT: DACA recipients know just how precarious their legal status is under the Trump administration. Here's Matt Albence, the government's deportation chief, earlier this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATTHEW ALBENCE: The individual, at the end of that process, if they get ordered removed and DACA is done away with by the Supreme Court, we could actually effectuate those removal orders. BURNETT: Translation - if Trump revokes DACA again and that withstands the court's scrutiny, young people currently living under its protections are deportable. And they're keenly aware that the government knows where they live, often still under the same roof with undocumented parents. Juan Belman is a 27-year-old from Guanajuato, Mexico, who was brought here as a child and now works at Georgetown University. JUAN BELMAN: When we submit our applications, we submit our names, our family's information, our addresses. So they have everything on us. BURNETT: In a statement yesterday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had this to say about the beneficiaries of DACA that the agency is charged with helping. Quote, \"Under DACA, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens continue to remain in our country in violation of the laws passed by Congress and taking jobs Americans need now more than ever.\" While this is cause for consternation among DACA recipients, nothing diminishes the elation over the decision by the highest court in the land. Karen Reyes is a 30-year-old special ed teacher in Austin with a master's in deaf education. Her mother brought her here from Mexico when she was an infant and raised her by cleaning houses, which she still does at age 68. KAREN REYES: For now, you know, we'll definitely take this. I'm extremely happy that the Supreme Court sided, you know, on the right side of history. It's just so much relief that, you know, I just - I cried. I cried with my mom. And yeah, it's been a whirlwind of emotions, for sure. BURNETT: And it's not over yet. John Burnett, NPR News, Austin. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump has expressed his anger in tweets, blasting the ruling as politically motivated.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: A big week for the U.S. Supreme Court just got bigger. The court today rejected the Trump administration's effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA was created in 2012 by President Obama, and it allows roughly 650,000 people brought to the country illegally as children to stay here. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four liberal justices in the 5-4 decision. NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez and NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis join us now to discuss the reaction from the president and Capitol Hill and the political implications of the ruling. Hey to both of you. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Hello. CHANG: So, Franco, let's start with you. Tell us what we should know first about this decision. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, I think it's also important to note that Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, said Trump could eventually end the program. But he said the way that Trump tried to do it this time was wrong. He called it arbitrary and capricious. So it was about procedure. So there is a window for Trump to try to do this again. And some of his supporters are already calling for him to take John Roberts up on his word and start a new process of getting rid of DACA. CHANG: So how is the White House responding so far? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, I can tell you that the president is not happy. He's lashing out at the Supreme Court. Barely an hour after the ruling, Trump fired off two tweets expressing his anger. He wrote, these horrible and politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or conservatives. He called for support in November. And he announced he will release a new list of conservative judges to pick from if he gets another nominee on the Supreme Court - for the Supreme Court. And we should also note that these are lifetime appointments, and there's no current vacancy. And in another tweet, President Trump asked whether people, quote, \"get the impression the Supreme Court doesn't like him.\" CHANG: Sue, let's turn to you. I mean, this decision - in a way, it does take the pressure off of Congress once again to act on immigration because when Trump rescinded DACA, he kicked it over to Congress to act. So now, what's been the reaction among lawmakers? DAVIS: You know, Democrats were really surprised, they did not think that the court was going to rule this way. They were expecting it to go the other way. So Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was on the floor of the Senate when he found out, he got really emotional on the floor. He got choked up. The reaction from Republicans has been more muted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters - he said that the ruling is just a reminder that Congress ultimately has more work to do on this issue. And it's important to remember that DACA was created because Congress has been unable to solve this problem and has been unable to act. And the really only long-term solution for these people affected by DACA, for the people who are brought here as children illegally who are now residing in the country is a law. And there has been in the past bipartisan support for what - for the so-called DREAMers. And it's an overwhelmingly popular idea with the public. It's not as controversial as the president's tweets would suggest, but it's always gotten caught up or tied up in the broader immigration reform debate and has been ultimately unable to become law. CHANG: Franco. ORDO\u00d1EZ: And, you know, I'll just add that, you know, it's another wrinkle that, even for President Trump, this does help him in some ways. While it's tough to argue that losing a Supreme Court decision is good for a president... CHANG: Right. ORDO\u00d1EZ: ...It does remove what the president had - what would have been a very difficult challenge come the fall time of the election season. He was concerned, very concerned about being seen as the president who deported this very sympathetic group of young immigrants. And, frankly, few thought he actually would have gone and started to do that before the election, but instead would have tried to use this decision as leverage to get more - get a deal done with Congress. CHANG: So, Sue, going back to what you were saying, I mean, does this mean that there will be no immigration legislation this year? DAVIS: Well, there already has been immigration legislation. When Democrats took over the House last year, they passed the DREAM Act. And it passed with a little bit of bipartisan support. Seven Republicans also supported it. But its chances are now up to the Senate. And Minority Whip Dick Durbin - he counts the votes in the Senate for Democrats - talked to NPR today. And he was pretty clear-eyed about the chances of it getting a vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DICK DURBIN: Right now, it would be a death-defying act in the Senate, but we ought to try for the sake of these 700,000 young people and their families. DAVIS: A death-defying act. He's talking about Senate Republicans because the issue of immigration is just so volatile, especially in primaries. And as you noted, this takes it off the table essentially throughout the end of the year. And Congress is unlikely to do anything unless there would have been pressure to act. CHANG: Right. Well, here's a question for both of you. You know, legislation to address the citizenship of those brought here illegally as children was first introduced about 20 years ago. Can you guys just explain why this debate has been so intractable for Washington to solve, and what might it mean for the presidential election, you think? Sue, let's start with you. DAVIS: I just think you have to take a step back. This is much bigger than Donald Trump, right? This goes back through the presidencies of George W. Bush through Barack Obama, all presidents who tried and failed to get immigration bills that would attempt to solve this question through Congress. And it's not always been a right-left issue. There used to be a much broader bipartisan coalition here. And I like to remind people that 10 years ago, the Senate almost passed the DREAM Act. And it didn't happen because five conservative Democrats blocked it from happening. So it's evolved over the years. I think, in this current climate, the president has made it a much more ideological culture war-type issue. CHANG: Franco. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, it really is a bigger issue than Donald Trump. And the reality is that, on each side, the sides look at this from a very different perspective. And each side has so many emotions baked into all these different issues. CHANG: That is NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez and Sue Davis. Thanks to both of you. DAVIS: You're welcome. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Activists demonstrate in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday as the court rejected the Trump administration's move to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Activists demonstrate in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday as the court rejected the Trump administration's move to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Updated at 6:35 p.m. ET In a major rebuke to President Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the administration's plan to dismantle an Obama-era program that has protected 700,000 so-called DREAMers from deportation. The vote was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the opinion. Under the Obama program, qualified individuals brought to the U.S. as children were given temporary legal status if they graduated from high school or were honorably discharged from the military, and if they passed a background check. Just months after taking office, Trump moved to revoke the program, only to be blocked by lower courts \u2014 and now the Supreme Court. Roberts' opinion for the court was a narrow but powerful rejection of the way the Trump administration went about trying to abolish the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. \"We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,\" Roberts wrote. \"The wisdom of those decisions is none of our concern. Here we address only whether the Administration complied with the procedural requirements in the law that insist on 'a reasoned explanation for its action.' \" In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions simply declared DACA illegal and unconstitutional. \"Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch,\" he said at the time. Sessions argued that the program should be rescinded because he said it was unlawful from the start. But, as Roberts observed, the attorney general offered no detailed justifications for canceling DACA. Nor did the acting secretary of homeland security at the time, Elaine Duke, who put out a memo announcing the rescission of DACA that relied entirely on Sessions' opinion that the program was unlawful. As Roberts noted, Duke's memo didn't address the fact that thousands of young people had come to rely on the program, emerging from the shadows to enroll in degree programs, embark on careers, start businesses, buy homes and even marry and have 200,000 children of their own who are U.S. citizens, not to mention that DACA recipients pay $60 billion in taxes each year. None of these concerns are \"dispositive,\" Roberts said, but they have to be addressed. The fact that they weren't addressed made the decision to rescind DACA \"arbitrary and capricious,\" he wrote. And none of the justifications the administration offered after the fact sufficed either, including a memo issued by then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. That memo, said Roberts, was essentially too little, too late. An agency must defend its action based on the reasons it gave at the time it acted, he said, instead of when the case is already in court. Roberts made clear that an administration can rescind a program like DACA, and indeed immigration experts don't disagree with that bottom line. The problem for the administration was that it never wanted to take responsibility for abolishing DACA and instead sought to blame the Obama administration for what it called an \"illegal and unconstitutional\" program. The chief justice didn't address that issue. Instead, says immigration law professor Lucas Guttentag, the justices in the majority seemed to be saying, \"Why should the court be the bad guy\" when the administration \"won't take responsibility\" for rescinding DACA by explaining clearly what the policy justifications for the revocation are? Joining the Roberts opinion were the court's four liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor wrote separately to say that while she agreed that rescinding DACA violated the law for the procedural reasons outlined by the chief justice, she would have allowed the litigants to return to the lower courts and make the case that rescinding DACA also amounted to unconstitutional discrimination. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the principal dissent, accusing Roberts of writing a political rather than a legal opinion. Joining him were Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, with separate dissents also filed by Alito and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a tweet, Trump blasted the decision as one of the \"horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court.\" The president also asked: \"Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me?\" These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives. We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment & everything else. Vote Trump 2020! Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, on the other hand, celebrated the decision, saying in a statement, \"The Supreme Court's ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored.\" In an interview with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration senior official who oversees immigration and citizenship at the Department of Homeland Security, said Trump is considering his options. \"I do expect you will see some action out of the administration,\" he said, adding: \"He is not a man who sits on his hands.\" While the decision gives DACA and its hundreds of thousands of recipients a lifeline, the issue is far from settled. The court decided that the way Trump went about canceling DACA was illegal, but all the justices seemed to agree that the president does have the authority to cancel the program if done properly. As for the immediate future of DACA, the consensus among immigration experts is that there is not enough time for Trump to try again to abolish the program before January. Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, the author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law, says, \"It's not remotely possible before the election. But if [Trump] is reelected, he almost certainly will try again\" to cancel DACA. For now, though, more individuals eligible for DACA status may be able to apply. Marisol Orihuela, co-director of the Worker & Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School, notes that the administration has refused to accept new applications since 2017. But she thinks that will change now. \"Our understanding is that the program is restored to what it was in 2012 when it went into effect,\" she says. Guttentag, who teaches immigration law at Yale and Stanford University, says if Trump is not reelected, a new administration could repair \"much of the damage\" that he says has been inflicted on immigrants during the Trump administration. But, he adds that the immigration system is \"completely shattered\" and needs \"fundamental reform.\" Politically, Thursday's decision played out as expected, with anti-immigration groups condemning the decision and DACA recipients jubilant and relieved. But aside from the president, lots of Republicans are relieved as well. If Thursday's decision had gone the other way, the pressure on congressional Republicans to pass legislation protecting the DREAMers would have been intense. DACA is an astonishingly popular program, with recent polls showing up to 85% support among Democratic and independent voters, and huge majorities among Republican voters as well. Indeed, 200 major corporations filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting the DACA recipients. Among them was Microsoft, which was a plaintiff in one of the cases that made it to the Supreme Court, and its president, Brad Smith. \"There are more than 30,000 DACA registrants working in the health space alone. We've needed these people more than we do today,\" he said. \"Every time I meet with them, I have the same reaction. We are lucky as a country to have them.\" Not all DACA critics are against the substance of DACA. Instead, some oppose the fact that Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction, put the program into effect unilaterally through executive order. Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute warns of unforeseen consequences if presidents can create new programs that future administrations will struggle to unwind. \"This raises profound issues of executive power and in effect sets out a ratchet whereby statutory changes can be enacted by presidential executive order but can only be rescinded through jumping through various administrative law hoops,\" he said. At the end of the day, the man of the hour is Chief Justice Roberts. Amid a politicized and polarized society, he has repeatedly tried to portray the court as apolitical. He sees the growth of organizations on the hard right like the Judicial Crisis Network, and on the hard left like Demand Justice, each trying to stack the court with like-minded justices or pack the court by expanding the number of justices. \"What these decisions underscore is we have a chief justice who's plainly working hard to demonstrate to the American people that the court, unlike the other two branches, is doing its job and doing its best,\" said Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus, who has known the chief justice for decades. \"He wants the American people to believe there is a thing called law and justice. His job is to apply it.\" (Read the decision here.) Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred contributed to this report.",

Officials deemed Fuller's death a suicide, but his family wants an independent investigation.\n                \n                    \n                    Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A man holds a candle during a vigil around a makeshift memorial at the tree where Robert Fuller was found dead hanging from a rope in Palmdale, Calif. Officials deemed Fuller's death a suicide, but his family wants an independent investigation. After almost three weeks of demonstrations following the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, America seems to be at a threshold moment. Polling shows attitudes shifting more in favor of protesters and embracing the potential for change when it comes to how policing is done in this country. Police departments in at least half a dozen states have already moved to make reforms, but when it comes to sweeping national change, it's not clear how far Washington will go. Many protesters have made \"Defund The Police\" a rallying cry, but most Democrats on Capitol Hill \u2014 and the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden \u2014 have stayed away from that language. Instead, House Democrats introduced a bill that would, among its provisions: A Reuters/Ipsos poll of U.S. adults, conducted last week, found broad support for a lot of those items: (The survey did not ask about no-knock warrants or lynching.) Republicans, who are holding a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday on police reform, are set to release their own legislation this week. The effort is led by Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate. Scott talked about some of those sticking-point legislative items on two Sunday political shows: Scott has said his bill would include making lynching a federal hate crime, and he wants to establish a commission on effective policies that lead to better outcomes that includes former and current police officers and civilians. I've been working on police reform legislation for years. Now is the time to pass a solution. The #JUSTICEAct addresses officer misconduct, brings improved training and tactics, and collects critical information on incidents relating to bodily injury and death. pic.twitter.com/j4EotrqiBV It's unclear what legislation President Trump would sign. At a roundtable on law enforcement last week in Dallas, Trump said he'd sign an executive order that would \"encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards for the use of force, including tactics for deescalation.\" But he fumbled over whether he would be in favor of banning chokeholds. During a Fox News interview in which he claimed to have \"done more for the black community than any other president\" except maybe Abraham Lincoln, he said he doesn't like chokeholds. \"Generally speaking, they should be ended,\" Trump said. But then he indicated that he doesn't really want to limit the police: \"You get somebody in a chokehold, and what are you going to do now? Let go and say, 'Oh, let's start all over again. I'm not allowed to have you in a chokehold'?\" 1. Trump on race: Trump's first campaign rally since the coronavirus pandemic was supposed to take place in Tulsa, Okla., on Friday \u2014 which is Juneteenth, the holiday commemorating the effective end of slavery in the U.S. Trump first defended the selection of the date of the rally, saying he didn't do it on purpose, but that it should be seen as a \"celebration.\" After being pressured, he moved it to Saturday. Trump has fumbled the issue of race repeatedly, and it's not going away any time soon. When Trump, who has largely stuck to a \"law and order\" hard line, releases that promised executive order on police reform, how will that be received? 2. Confederate statues and base names: Speaking of Trump and race, he's largely been out there on his own defending Confederate statues that are still standing, as well as military bases named for confederates. A Morning Consult poll last week found that 44% of voters are in favor of letting the statues remain standing, but that's down from 52% in 2017. Just 32% say they should be taken down, up from 26% in 2017, so the trend is clear. But 71% of Republicans think the statues should remain standing, which has been the group Trump has catered to since taking office. The danger sign for this president is that independents have shifted from 51% in favor of them remaining standing to just 40% now in the poll. And after Trump said there were good people on both sides after Charlottesville, his approval dropped to the lowest of his presidency \u2014 and he's seen a similar, if not as steep, decline now. 3. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing: The committee, led by Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., holds its \"Police Use of Force and Community Relations\" hearing Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. ET. The witness list isn't clear yet, but Democrats penned letters to Graham requesting Attorney General William Barr testify, given his role in the forcible removal of protesters outside the White House before Trump took a walk and photo with a Bible at a nearby damaged church. 4. What about COVID-19? More than 115,000 people are confirmed to have died from the coronavirus in the U.S., and more than 2 million people have contracted it. And now some two dozen states are seeing spikes, especially in the South and West. \"I would hope to get to some degree of real normality within a year or so, but I don't think it's this winter or fall,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Telegraph Sunday. And yet, every state in the country has loosened restrictions, and the Trump campaign is going ahead with a rally in a 19,000-seat arena. Trump and his campaign have downplayed the seriousness of the continuing pandemic and yet appended this disclaimer for those attending the rally: \"By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.\" 5. Watching the Supreme Court: The court will issue opinions on both Monday and Thursday, and it's possible the justices will release decisions in a high-profile LGBTQ employment discrimination case, as well as on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. When the DACA case was argued in the fall, the court's conservative majority appeared ready to go along with the Trump administration's argument that it acted lawfully in shutting down the program. The program was enacted by former President Barack Obama by executive order. The court may also take up cases involving the Second Amendment and qualified immunity. \"All the presidents I've worked for liked to use the military as a prop. I think this president's probably taken that to a new level, but the military has to be very sensitive about being exploited in that way.\" -- Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served both Presidents George W. Bush, a Republican, and Obama, a Democrat, on NBC's Meet The Press Sunday. Last week, several current and former military officials rebuked Trump for his photo op walk to a church. The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, apologized for his role in it after a backlash from troops. \"I should not have been there,\" he said. \"My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\" (Hear more from Gates on NPR here.)",

Hundreds of thousands of people descended on the nation's capital and cities across the country over the weekend in continued demonstrations sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police. The protests were largely peaceful, and their meaning has extended beyond Floyd's fate to the larger issue of policing in America and police treatment of black Americans. \"Don't let the life of George Floyd be in vain,\" a county sheriff said at a memorial service for Floyd on Saturday in North Carolina. Floyd will be remembered Monday in Houston at a public memorial service followed by an invitation-only funeral service Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden will fly to Houston and meet with Floyd's family Monday and deliver a videotaped message at the funeral service, though he won't attend it because of complications his Secret Service detail would create. President Trump won't be attending. He will be in Washington and on Monday will host a roundtable with law enforcement at the White House. The two actions couldn't better sum up where the two men on the ballot this November to lead the country are coming from \u2014 and the bets they're making to win. Trump has taken a hard \"law and order\" line, thinking that will appeal to suburban whites. CBS reported over the weekend that after demonstrations turned violent last weekend, the president wanted 10,000 active-duty military personnel on the streets. And while he has praised Floyd and been critical of police action in Minneapolis that killed the 46-year-old black man, Trump has also sounded off key. \"Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that's happening for our country,\" Trump said Friday of Floyd while touting the latest jobs report that sent stocks soaring. \"This is a great day for him. It's a great day for everybody.\" Thousands of protesters gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Eman Mohammed for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands of protesters gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. Two other actions prompted pushback. Trump's walk last Monday to a church, part of which was burned, across from the White House came after law enforcement forcibly removed peaceful protesters, and the president threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and use the military if governors didn't deploy National Guard troops to quell the protests. Both moves caused controversy \u2014 and breaks with multiple, high-profile current and former military officials. What's more, survey data show his view of the country may be outdated. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found two-thirds of Americans feel Trump has increased racial tensions since Floyd's death, and they largely disagree with his view of the demonstrators. More than 6 in 10 see the demonstrations as mostly legitimate protests rather than unlawful acts. Those are big shifts from the 1960s, when majorities sided with police and had an unfavorable view of civil rights protests. Polls have also shown more people disapproving of the president's handling of the coronavirus, and an NBC/WSJ poll out Sunday showed people say they think Biden would be better to handle the pandemic by an 11-point margin. Trump is suffering politically, losing ground with key groups and losing to Biden in head-to-head matchups. He's down 7 points in both the NPR poll, 50% to 43%, and the NBC/WSJ poll, 49% to 42%. (In 2016, Hillary Clinton led in the NBC/WSJ poll at this time by just 2 points.) There are still five months to go until the presidential election. This could be the nadir for Trump politically, and most political strategists are girding for and expect a close election, but the president has a hole to climb out of right now if he hopes to be reelected.

Protests and the president: The weekend largely saw peaceful, multiethnic protests around the country. Do people continue to go out to the streets in the same numbers? Do the protests die down? On Monday, Trump will hold a roundtable with law enforcement at the White House. Will he continue to take a hard line, given most people said they don't agree with him on his view of the demonstrators? 2. Race and justice take spotlight on Capitol Hill: On Monday, House Democrats will unveil police reform legislation led by the Congressional Black Caucus, and on Wednesday, a House committee holds a hearing on racial profiling and policing. Notably, these are Democratic-led initiatives. Will there be Republicans who join in to press for changes in policing? After all, bipartisan efforts are what led to criminal justice reform legislation in 2018. 3. What about the coronavirus? With masses of people in the streets, it's easy to forget that much of the country was locked down because of an airborne, viral respiratory pandemic. The U.S. has now crossed 110,000 deaths from the coronavirus. Many front-line workers, doctors, nurses and other health care workers are torn regarding the protests and what they could mean for a resurgence of the coronavirus. The New York Times: \"Many say they view the deaths of black people at the hands of police as a public health issue. But they also express worries that large gatherings will cause a second wave of Covid-19 cases, and they are balancing their involvement with calls for protesters and police officers to adhere to public health guidelines.\" There's no way to know what the effect will be yet, but it's something to watch. 4. Watching the U.S. Supreme Court: The high court is set to release orders and opinions on Monday. The big topics to watch for are on LGBTQ rights and DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started during the Obama administration. The LGBTQ case is an employment discrimination one. On the DACA case, when the case was argued in the fall, the court's conservative majority appeared ready to go along with the Trump administration's argument that it acted lawfully in shutting down the program. The program was enacted by President Barack Obama by executive order. The court may also take up cases involving the Second Amendment and qualified immunity. 5. Trump heads to West Point; coronavirus evident there: Trump is slated to give the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Saturday. But 16 cadets and 71 faculty, staff or civilians at the campus have reported positive for COVID-19.

With Joe Biden on the ballot, so is the legacy of Barack Obama, and it appears we're about to see a throwdown between the last president and the current one \u2014 and their polar opposite worldviews. Amid criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump has been falsely laying blame on Obama for leaving the \"cupboard bare\" when it comes to the national stockpile of emergency medical supplies and equipment. And lately, Trump and conservatives have been running with allegations of potentially criminal activity by Obama administration officials for their handling of surveillance that later led to the investigation and guilty plea of Michael Flynn, Trump's three-week national security adviser. (The Department of Justice now wants to drop its case against Flynn.) In the past week, Trump has tweeted \"Obamagate\" (on its own, as a retweet or as a hashtag) 18 times. Three times, he's tweeted simply \"Obamagate!\" with nothing else. OBAMAGATE! Neither Trump nor White House officials have been able to identify a specific crime, but it sure helps fire up the base. Obama, for his part, seemed to reply with one word of his own Thursday: \"Vote.\" Vote. And then, on Saturday, he had more words during two virtual commencement addresses. \"[T]his pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many folks in charge know what they're doing,\" Obama told graduates of historically black colleges and universities. \"A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.\" Then, when speaking to graduating high school students, he said: \"Do what you think is right. Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy \u2014 that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grownups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way \u2014 which is why things are so screwed up.\" Wow. And a week earlier, when talking to former officials from his administration, leaked audio revealed that Obama called Trump's handling of the coronavirus an \"absolute chaotic disaster\" and an example of what happens when a \"what's in it for me\" mindset \"is operationalized in our government.\" Pressed about Obama's remarks Sunday, Trump said he hadn't heard them, but noted, \"Look, he was an incompetent president, that's all I can say, grossly incompetent.\" Welcome to the 2020 presidential campaign. Reelections are always a referendum on the sitting president. But with Biden, Obama's vice president, at the top of the Democratic ticket, it's somewhat of a referendum on Obama, too. And there's reason for Trump to want \u2014 or even need \u2014 to try and take Obama down a few pegs. Currently, Obama is among the most popular politicians in the country \u2014 and one of the highest-polling political figures (besides his wife, Michelle.) It's a clear and stark choice offered up to voters \u2014 and one Trump seems to want front and center. He even tweeted at Republican Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham, who says he wants to hold hearings on the Flynn case, to call Obama to testify. \"Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it,\" Trump tweeted. \"No more Mr. Nice Guy.\" If I were a Senator or Congressman, the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR, is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk! Graham responded, telling reporters he thinks that would \"be a bad precedent\" to compel a former president to testify and would \"open up a can of worms.\" \"I understand President Trump's frustration,\" Graham said, before warning, \"but be careful what you wish for. Just be careful what you wish for.\" 1. Coronavirus death toll approaches 90,000: About 90,000 people are now confirmed to have died from COVID-19 in the United States, and though new cases are slowing, the country is still on pace for 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus before the end of the month. That slowing of new cases is good news, but with two-thirds of states significantly relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, experts are concerned about a potential resurgence. Loading... \"We're seeing a decline; undoubtedly, that is something good to see,\" Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told The New York Times. \"But what we are also seeing is a lot of places right on the edge of controlling the disease.\" Another good sign, though: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Sunday that his state now has \"more testing capacity than New Yorkers are using.\" And he wants not only symptomatic New Yorkers to get tested, but also those who \"have been in contact with someone with COVID.\" That's a first step in what experts say is one of the most important things to do to try and contain the virus \u2014 test as many people, including those without symptoms, as often as possible.

Andrew Cuomo giving a press conference in April.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump and Vice President Pence look on as a video plays of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo giving a press conference in April. 2. Will the Senate make a push for another relief package? Health versus the economy has been the tension since the beginning of the lockdowns. Unemployment has hit almost 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. And as deaths spiked in April, 20 million jobs were lost. Congress has passed four relief packages; the Democratic-led House has passed another, but Senate Republicans \u2014 and the White House \u2014 have balked at a fifth major package.  \"We have not yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week. On Tuesday, there could be more clarity on the state of the economy and what more the administration is planning to do to support people and the economy in the coming weeks when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell appear before the Senate Banking Committee, as required by the CARES Act. 3. Watching for fallout from inspectors general firings: The firing of the State Department's inspector general, Steve Linick \u2014 announced on a Friday night, which is where bad news goes to be buried in Washington \u2014 is raising more questions than answers. Linick is the fourth inspector general the Trump administration has sought to remove in the past six weeks. A Democratic congressional aide told NPR's Michele Kelemen that Linick was looking into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's conduct. The move triggered Republican Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Chuck Grassley to question Trump's motives. Romney said the move \"chills\" the IGs' essential independence and called the moves \"a threat to accountable democracy.\" Collins said Trump had not provided \"the kind of justification for the removal ... required\" by law. Grassley pointed out that \"written reasons\" are \"required\" and that \"A general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient.\" But what does the Republican Senate do to maintain the accountability that they say Trump is threatening or not abiding by? So far, during the Trump presidency, it's done little to hold him in check. 4. Senate Republicans move ahead with Hunter Biden probe: On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on a subpoena to Blue Star Strategies. That's a company that worked with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which hired Biden's son Hunter to sit on its board. Republican senators are looking into whether Blue Star \"sought to leverage Hunter Biden's membership on the board of directors for Burisma.\" Call it the impeachment backlash. With Romney signaling he will vote in favor of the subpoena, it is expected to pass, NPR's Philip Ewing and Claudia Grisales report. 5. Supreme Court opinions Monday: The Supreme Court is expected to issue opinions Monday. We are keeping an eye out for an LGBTQ employment discrimination case, as well as whether the court thinks the Trump administration acted lawfully in shutting down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. When the DACA case was argued last fall, the court's conservative majority appeared it would go along with the Trump administration. Both of these decisions could be released at any time in the next few weeks. \"After much reflection, I've concluded that circumstances don't lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year, and therefore I will not be a candidate.\" \u2014 Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan announcing via Twitter the end of his short-lived Libertarian bid for the presidency. There was much Democratic hand-wringing that Amash could cost Biden votes, especially in Michigan.",

Listen to NPR's live special coverage of the Nevada caucuses beginning at 5 p.m. ET.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., enters Nevada after notching a virtual tie for first in the Iowa caucuses and a first-place victory in the New Hampshire primary. Other candidates, like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hope to reinvigorate their campaigns with a strong finish on Saturday. Read our coverage here.  MICHEL MARTIN (HOST): Senator Bernie Sanders is having a big day today. From NPR News, this is live Special Coverage of the Nevada caucuses. I'm Michel Martin. SUSAN DAVIS (HOST): And I'm Susan Davis. Nevadans are making their choices for the Democratic presidential nominee known today. MARTIN: Senator Sanders recently spoke to an energized crowd as entrance polls show him in the lead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\r\nBERNIE SANDERS (I-VT, SEN/PRES CAND): We can create a government that is based on compassion, is based on love, is based on truth, not what we have now of greed, corruption and lies. DAVIS: But there's still a lot to learn today. We have reporters covering all of the candidates and analysis here in the studio. MARTIN: Stay with us. This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada caucuses from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: I'm Michel Martin, and I'm joined here in the studio with so many - Domenico Montanaro and Danielle Kurtzleben and my colleague Susan Davis. And glad to have you all here in person. Sue, it's nice to get you out of the booth on Capitol Hill. DAVIS: It's great to see you in person, Michel. MARTIN: Yeah, we can actually walk around a little bit. We're going to start with results because the results are coming in hard and fast. Domenico, what do we know? DOMENICO MONTANARO (BYLINE): Well, we've only got about 1% of precincts reporting so far, but Bernie Sanders so far has an early lead according to those results. You know, there's - it's not enough to really draw any huge conclusions. But if you look at the entrance polls so far, Bernie Sanders looks like he's doing quite well and may have a big day because he's leading across most groups, not just the usual groups that you would expect from Sanders' progressives, people who are under 30 years old. He's leading with them, but he's expanding that base, it looks like, according to those entrance polls. Now, people should understand those entrance polls are done before the caucusing actually happens. So people can change their minds as they're in there. They can - remember there's a lot of resorting when it comes to this. You have to get at least 15% in each caucus site in order to get any delegates at all. So these numbers will change. MARTIN: But again talk about the sort of the breadth of the people who are voting for Sanders so far, I mean, because again, there have been certain sort of storylines that have developed. We've only had sort of two contests so far, but certain still storylines are developing. It's young people who like Bernie Sanders. MONTANARO: Right. MARTIN: It's young people of color who like Bernie Sanders. It's older voters don't like Bernie Sanders. And what you're telling us so far is that that's not the case here. MONTANARO: Well, look, Nevada has been our - you know, the first state with a diverse electorate, right? I mean, in 2016, it was 41% nonwhite. It looks like it's similar to that this time around. We'll see what it is when the numbers eventually re-weight themselves. But you have about 17% of the electorate or so, about 1 in 5 voters who are Hispanic. And Bernie Sanders is leading by a huge margin according to the entrance polls with Latinos. He is over 50% with them. And you think about how fractured and splintered this field is. No one is even above 20% of the others. He's doing quite well actually in second place with African American voters who make up about 1 in 10 voters at the caucuses in Nevada. They were a significant chunk in 2016, about 13%. And they really helped Hillary Clinton over the line to be able to win. But what we've seen with Bernie Sanders is, sure, Joe Biden is winning with Latinos, but he's - I mean, with black voters, but he's only getting about a third of them. And Sanders is a pretty close second - so doing pretty well across a lot of groups. MARTIN: Well, I think you also told us a number of things that might be surprising to some people, the fact that there is a significant African American vote in Nevada. I'm not sure that's something that everybody knows. The fact that there is a significant Latino vote, I'm sure people have sort of heard that but they may not know just exactly how important it is to the Democratic election. Why don't - we have a little bit of time and while we're still waiting for sort of big results to come in, could you just remind us of the process? Because the fact is Nevada is a little different than Iowa. I mean, I think people have this idea of caucuses as everybody goes to, like, the gym or the community center and hopefully there's snacks - I would assume there's snacks - and then... MONTANARO: Snacks are always... MARTIN: I would want snacks. MONTANARO: You know, I've got some snacks next to me, so... MARTIN: So - and then they kind of decide, and it's a long night. But there's early vote - and there's just - it's different in Nevada. Could you just break that down for us? Just tell us how it works, and how is it possible that there's early voting in a caucus state? MONTANARO: There's a lot of questions there, but let's - so let's tackle some of what the process is, which is actually quite similar to Iowa this time around. Again, you have to have a 15% threshold to get any delegates, OK? So you walk in there. You sort yourself and say who you're with, which corner you go to. If that person has - if your candidate has above 15%, then in the second round, then people resort who'd got below 15% to go to the other candidate. Now, we've seen a couple instances, for example, where Elizabeth Warren was one short of 15%. On the second round, they were able to actually convince one supporter of somebody who wasn't viable to make her viable for the second round. So that's all doable and all possible. You know, with the early voting which is the first time they're actually doing early voting in Nevada, it's really fascinating because, again, how would you possibly do early voting with a caucus? Well, what they're doing is essentially ranked-choice voting, where you pick your first choice. And they say if that person is not viable, who would you go to? And they give a second choice and so on. So they'll factor that in. And we've seen a pretty high turnout for early voting already, with about 70 to 75,000 people who've come out. There's only 84,000 turnout overall in 2016. And about 118,000 is the record from 2008. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN (BYLINE): We should also say that, you know, early voting really does expand accessibility because caucuses, as we talked about during our Iowa coverage - caucuses mean, you know, you can only show up if you're free. So, yes, early voting allows more people to participate. Aside from that, one thing that Nevada Democrats have also done is they have had early vote - an early-voting site on the strip in Las Vegas and also some late-night caucus locations for people who work odd hours. And there are a lot of those. If you've ever been to Las Vegas, you know that. So making sure that people are able to participate as much as possible. DAVIS: It's a different state with very different voters, and we should bring in now political correspondent Scott Detrow and Asma Khalid who are on the ground in Las Vegas. Hey, guys. How you doing? SCOTT DETROW (BYLINE): Hey there. ASMA KHALID (BYLINE): Hey there. How are you? DAVIS: I'm good. Scott, I want to start with you because you've been following the Sanders campaign. You were listening to Domenico. We see maybe an early surge for Sanders. Does that corroborate with what you're seeing and hearing on the ground? DETROW: Yeah. The two things that the Sanders campaign was really hoping to get out of Nevada was, first of all, an across-the-board win. The results are still very early, but it looks like they are out to a good start on that front. And they also really focused on growing that base. There's been so much conversation - even though Sanders won New Hampshire, he basically tied on top of Iowa with Pete Buttigieg. Each time, it was with about a quarter of the vote. There's been a lot of question of, can Bernie Sanders grow his base? So they're really hoping to get north of 30% to show that he can increase his support. And they also really want to - they're hoping that tonight's results underscore something that the Sanders campaign has been confident about for a long period of time but feel like they haven't gotten a full amount of credit for. And that is the breadth of support that Bernie Sanders has among Latino voters, among other voters of color across the country, that they feel like that's something that, you know - for all the conversation about African American voters supported Joe Biden, they feel like he hasn't tapped into a strong relationship with a lot of voters here. And they're looking forward to today's results bearing out their theory of that. DAVIS: It's so important because Nevada is one of the first states where we're seeing - hearing from a lot of nonwhite voters. That Latino support, how does the Sanders campaign explain why he has so much support among Latinos? DETROW: Among other things, they have really had a big presence on the ground in not only states like Nevada, but also a lot more presence in the Super Tuesday states, like California, like Texas, which have significant populations of Latino voters. Something that his supporters at rallies, at caucus sites like I went to today will tell me - and this cuts across, you know, all ethnicities and ages, I'd say - people who are really onboard with Bernie Sanders often point to the fact that he has such a long track record, that you can find quotes from the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s where he's making exactly the same pitch. And they feel like, especially a lot of his health care positions and some of his social justice positions, are something that, you know, Latino voters in Nevada are really on board with. DAVIS: Now, Asma, you're at a Joe Biden campaign event in Vegas at the Bellagio Casino, yeah? KHALID: Actually, I was at the Bellagio... DAVIS: You were there earlier. KHALID: ...Earlier today to check out a casino site. And I've just moved over to the Biden where - well, where the Biden celebration will be. I will say it is a pretty sparse at the moment, though. DAVIS: Well, obviously the Biden campaign looking for signs of life here in Nevada. What are your takeaways? What are - what have voters been telling you? KHALID: Sue, I will say to kind of echo what Scott was saying there, I think one of the most interesting things to me is in part I went to the Bellagio site because there had been a lot of chatter this cycle about the powerful Culinary Union. And I had seen Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden actually all speak to those Culinary Union members at various town halls. And long story short, there was some concern from the leadership about Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan because the union has a really good health insurance plan at the moment. And I wanted to see if whether those concerns were kind of filtering down to the members. Long story short, Bernie Sanders seemed to get about double the amount of votes there at that Bellagio caucus site where it was mostly Culinary Union members. And to me, that was just a really stark sort of sense of reality of what's happening on the ground because I think if Biden really wants to do well here in Nevada, he needed to peel away some of those Culinary Union members. DAVIS: What does that tell you, that the leadership of the union and their position may not fully reflect their membership? KHALID: I mean, long story short, I feel like a lot of the members told me they understand that they have really good health care, but they want to have better health care for everyone. They do - they do agree with the vision that health care in the country, regardless of whether or not they sort of have currently a good system, needs to be improved. And I would say this is something I heard from a number of Sanders supporters across the board when I asked them why they're supporting him. It was largely health care. And on occasion, I also heard about education. I spoke with one woman. Her name is Mariama Saba (ph). She's a massage therapist. And, you know, we were talking about who she likes. And I asked her about Joe Biden, and ultimately she says that she came down to decide that she's not for him. MARIAMA SABA (NEVADA VOTER): So I like Biden on a lot of levels. But - and I hate to say this 'cause I don't want to be accused of ageism - but I feel like Biden in his responses to things over the course of this campaign has been a little fuzzy. And I feel like we need somebody that's really on their game. KHALID: And so, Sue, I mean, it's worth pointing out that Biden is actually younger than Bernie Sanders. But she finds that Sanders has just been sharper in his debate performances and she believes would be better equipped to take on Donald Trump. DAVIS: You've been talking with the Biden campaign. How have they set expectations for where they're standing and what it means in Nevada? KHALID: So they say that they expect to do well. Joe Biden himself in interviews has made the point that he feels like a first-or-second-place finisher would be solid. I mean, so I think it's tough because I think if you really look at the momentum that Bernie Sanders has developed, I would make the case that in some ways Nevada and the diversity of Nevada is perhaps more representative of the future of the country. There are really sizable populations of, you know, Latino voters, Asian American voters, as well as African American voters. And so he has long said that he will do better once this contest moves on to more diverse states. My question is if a candidate like Bernie Sanders who performed well in largely white states also beats him out by potentially a sizable margin here today, does that really - I don't know - does it sort of poke holes in his notion that he will do better in diverse states, especially as we move on to states like California and Texas that have really sizable Latino and Asian populations as well? DAVIS: Well, we're going to let you guys get back to reporting. Scott Detrow and Asma Khalid on the ground in Vegas, thank you very much. KHALID: You're welcome. MARTIN: Well, we've been talking quite a bit about the fact that Nevada is the first state with a more diverse population than we saw in the early contests. So earlier today, I spoke with Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. She is one of two Democratic senators in the state of Nevada. She's also the first Latina to serve as a U.S. senator. And given all the things that we've talked about, I asked her about how well the candidates have been doing in their outreach to the diverse communities in her state. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-NV, SEN): Here's what I know. We have a third of the population are Latinos. We have the fastest-growing AAPI population in the country, very strong, vibrant African American population, along with a Native American population. And they're turning out. They're paying attention. But you have to be talking to them now. You can't come last minute a month before the final election and say, oh, I want your vote and I want to talk to you. You've got to be engaged and in those communities now. And I don't care what community you live in, it is about economic security for their family, good jobs, education for their kids, access to health care. That is similar no matter what community you're talking to. MARTIN: Do you feel that there has been enough of an effort among Democrats to register and energize and get these voters out? Because that is one of the ongoing criticisms - I'll just have to say it - of the party apparatus, as it were. So are you seeing that effort to get people, you know, registered, organized and out? CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I can see it in Nevada, absolutely, because that's literally what we have to do. So, yes, I see that organization. I see that happening in Nevada. Now, I can't speak for the rest of the country. But I definitely know it's happening in Nevada. MARTIN: We wanted to talk more about that outreach, so we've got Clarissa Martinez De Castro on the line. She is a deputy vice president at the Latino civil rights organization Unidos. Clarissa, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. CLARISSA MARTINEZ DE CASTRO (DEPUTY VICE PRESIDENT, UNIDOS): Thank you. It's great to be with you. MARTIN: So let's talk more about the - some of the things that we've been sort of touching on so far. First of all, how significant are the registration outreach efforts on the ground in Nevada? What are you seeing there? MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Well, one of the things we know - right? - every time the election cycle rolls around, there's all these questions about whether Latinos vote or not. And what we do know is that once registered, Latinos in presidential elections vote at levels very close to other groups. Eighty to 83% of Latinos who are registered vote. The problem is - and you were talking about this a little bit - there's just not a lot of investment in actually closing registration gaps in our country to make sure that eligible Americans are registered to vote. And so... MARTIN: OK. Clarissa, can I get you to take a brief pause here - just a brief pause here. We're coming right back to you. We just need to take a brief pause to say you're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. And we're back with Clarissa Martinez De Castro on the line. Clarissa, excuse me. Pardon the interruption, as they say. Would you pick up your thought there? You're saying that we find that when Latinos are registered, they do come out. Tell us more. MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Absolutely. Nevada is the perfect example of what happens when candidates and parties do their job to make sure that they are known to the community, that their positions are known and that they are reaching out and that there are investments to close that registration gap. Registration is 10 percentage points higher in Nevada than in the rest of the country. And that's not just good for Latinos, frankly, for any voter who cares about affordable housing, which is a major concern in Nevada, about the cost of health care, about sound and good schools and, yes, about an immigration system that we can be proud of. The growth of the Latino electorate is a great development because those are the things that these voters care about and want to see progress on. MARTIN: Now, you've told us about the issues that are of particular interest to the Latino voters that you have surveyed. And I think I heard you say health care is No. 1, housing costs is up there, too. Do you have any data or any insight into what kinds of traits voters say they're looking for? Because, you know, with a larger Democratic electorate, there's this conversation about the progressive lane versus the moderate lane - the progressive lane saying these are people who are going to fight for the things that you believe in, people in the moderate lane emphasizing the fact that they're going to work across the aisle. Do you have any sense of how the Latino voters you've surveyed feel about that? Where are they? MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Absolutely. We did polling with our community to make sure that we're lifting up what voters want to see, not just how they feel about all these different candidates. And what we heard is indeed, and particularly in Nevada, voters want to see somebody who fights for their priorities but who is also willing to compromise to get things done. The second trait that was very important was that they want to see a candidate who values diversity and can bring people together. And the third one was a candidate who has realistic and achievable ideas and policies. So, yes, we have very aspirational vision for the nation, but we also understand that we need to make progress and we need sensible solutions. And the bulk of Latino voters tend to be in that space. MARTIN: OK, before we let you go, I'm going to ask you the e-word question. I know it's become a dirty word with some people - but the electability question. Do you have a sense based on your polling of what kind of candidate Latinos believe - that Latino voters whom you surveyed believe is electable? Is that even something you've asked? MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: We did not ask people directly about that. But the one thing I would tell you on the flip side is that the majority of voters are growing increasingly alarmed about anti-Latino and anti-immigrant rhetoric and are very concerned that if President Trump gets elected, that will get worse. MARTIN: All right. That is Clarissa Martinez De Castro. She is a deputy vice president at the Latino civil rights organization Unidos. Clarissa Martinez De Castro, thank you so much for sharing some time with us today. MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: This is live - oh. This is (inaudible). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. I'm Michel Martin. DAVIS: And I'm Susan Davis. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders continues to make a strong showing as early results roll in. And we have our correspondents in Nevada to give us a sense of what caucus-goers and state party leaders have been telling them. Joining me now is Don Gonyea and Claudia Grisales. Hey there. CLAUDIA GRISALES (BYLINE): Hi there. DAVIS: Now, Claudia, you have been on the... DON GONYEA (BYLINE): Hey, guys. DAVIS: Hey, Don. Claudia, you've been on the ground for several days. You've been spending time with many campaigns. What are the voters on the ground telling you about what matters most to them as they've been making up their mind? GRISALES: I'm hearing multiple themes when I talk to the voters. At one end, they're saying they're tired of President Trump's administration. Many have said they're worried about anti-immigration rhetoric. At the other end, though, they are emphasizing jobs, the economy, health care, that those are top of mind. And so those are some of the things I'm hearing so far from voters here. DAVIS: Claudia, you've spent time with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign, another candidate struggling to get a foothold in these early-state contests. What's the sense of the support for her there and how you expect her to fare today? GRISALES: Well, she has been doing a lot of work, traveling Las Vegas from north to south to the Strip, trying to reach out to these Democratic voters of all stripes, ages, races and trying to make her case that she is the one that will come into office and on day one, she'll be moving everyone out from the Trump administration, which is music to many people's ears here. At the same time, she did have some struggles before Nevada. She has found new life here, but it's not clear if it's going to be enough. So that's what we're waiting to see happen. DAVIS: I'm curious if you've heard any voters bring up her debate performance 'cause she had a very strong debate performance. And we saw in New Hampshire, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar got a real lift from a strong debate performance just prior to that contest. Has anyone brought up that factor to you? GRISALES: Very much so. When I've seen her go to sites, for example a soul food restaurant in north Las Vegas, to a recent visit to a taco eatery closer to central Vegas, the theme for many voters to her is, I like what you did to that mayor. I like what you did to Bloomberg in that debate. Great performance. They're very proud of her in terms of how she approached it. At the same time, she's also highlighting it, saying, yes, you know, this is what I'm going to be doing. I'm going to be asking and pushing billionaires like Bloomberg to do more for our country. So that theme was very loud here from voters and her alike. DAVIS: Don, what about Pete Buttigieg? He's another candidate who - Nevada is different in that it has a lot more nonwhite voters than Iowa and New Hampshire. And nonwhite voters are the exact voter the Buttigieg has had a hard time appealing to. What's your reporting on the ground telling you? GONYEA: So he has been reaching out to those voters through Spanish-language ads. And he's done events. He's done events with - you know, with Native American voters as well. But you don't get a sense that there's any kind of a groundswell toward him or that it's really breaking through. That's at least in conversations that I've been having with people. Yes, you do see Latino voters at his events, but still, just, you know, a small number compared to the - compared to the total audience. But he's also been speaking pretty candidly about his record as mayor when it comes to racial issues. He acknowledges not being responsive enough at times and kind of having a blindspot on certain issues. There was that incident last summer where a white policeman shot and killed an African American man, and there was a lot of tension after that. He says he's learning from all of these things. He's acknowledging he should have done more. He likes to talk about how 40% of the members of his staff are persons of color. He says that doesn't mean, oh, look at Pete. He got (inaudible). He said that means there are people close to me and around me who will tell me when I get it wrong because of my personal experience. DAVIS: Don, so much about caucuses are about ground game, about organization. Which of the campaigns have sort of mastered Nevada and have had the most strategic ground resources? GONYEA: It's - you see a lot of people have been talking about Bernie Sanders. And you certainly see Sanders folks everywhere, but also Biden and also Warren to a large degree. I'm at a caucus site here in Henderson. It's a suburb of Las Vegas, a mostly white suburb. And so at this particular caucus where there was 93 votes counted - looking at my notes here - but only 31 of the people actually in the room because everybody else voted early. But this was a caucus where Joe Biden just happened to do very well with again a mostly white, tending-to-be-older crowd, but Bernie behind him and then Pete Buttigieg as well. And you can see around this caucus site the grassroots-organizing presence of Warren, of Sanders, of Biden. DAVIS: Well, you talk, Don - you talk to more voters than maybe almost anyone I know. What are the issues that Nevada voters have told you that has been making up their mind between these candidates? GONYEA: You know, they still talk about wanting to beat Donald Trump. I mean, that is - that seems to be first and foremost trumping - any trumping - there we go - any single, you know, issue. But you also see person after person say they're worried about their health care. They're worried about premiums going up. They're worrying about the cost of drugs. So that's important, too. And then occasionally you do, you know, have somebody bring up a water use and land use and public lands. But mostly it has been those same big issues, especially Donald Trump himself, that we've been hearing all over the country. DAVIS: Do you get the sense - you were - said you were at a precinct where there was a lot of Biden supporters. Among those more moderate lane of voters, is there concern about Sanders especially as he increasingly looks like one of the front-runners if not the front-runner in the Democratic primary? GONYEA: I had a lengthy conversation here with a gentleman who came as an Amy Klobuchar supporter, and his concern was that without a somewhat centrist candidate, that they'll have a hard time beating Donald Trump. And he specifically said, you know, Trump will use the socialist label to great effect against Bernie Sanders. He ended up - this particular caucus-goer ended up moving over to the Biden group when Amy Klobuchar wasn't viable after the first round of voting. So, you know, you do get those kinds of discussions. There is a sense, at least among the more centrist participants, that Bernie Sanders will run into real trouble in a general election. Of course, you know the Sanders supporters push back hard against that. DAVIS: Right. That's Don Gonyea and Claudia Grisales, NPR correspondents on the ground in Nevada. Thank you both so much. GRISALES: Thank you. GONYEA: It's a pleasure. DAVIS: And joining me now is Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the secretary treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union. Thank you so much for joining us. GEOCONDA ARGUELLO-KLINE (SECRETARY TREASURER, CULINARY WORKERS UNION): Thank you for inviting us. ARGUELLO-KLINE: Now, first for many of our listeners who may not know, could you explain what the Culinary Workers Union is to Nevada and why it's so important politically? ARGUELLO-KLINE: It's very important political because we are the largest some immigrant organization. We represent 60,000 workers. They're working with their families. They 135,000 people using our health care. And we always communicate with the members for every single issue affecting in the state and the federal. And every election, we take a lot of time for people going to vote. You know, we make a lot of phone calls. We do knocking doors. We're talking to them. We give a lot of knowledge about the issues, we present candidates. We're doing very intense work. You know, our union always being No. 1, I think - and try to approach every member to understand what's going on. DAVIS: Well, I would like to talk about the issue of health care with you because the Culinary Workers Union has taken, on the leadership level, this opposition to Medicare for All. But as you - what many of our correspondents on the ground there said that at caucus sites with many of your union members, there has still been support for Senator Sanders. So can you explain sort of that disconnect? ARGUELLO-KLINE: Well, one important thing I think everybody has to remember, we did a press conference of the union. We're not endorsing anybody. We are endorsing our goals. We have a lot of goals. One of our goals was having immigration reform for 11 million people and looking for a candidate who can fight for that and present what they're going to do to the members and that we have the economics. We want one job to be enough. We've been fighting for years to keep in the middle class in Las Vegas in the job as a guest room attendant, for our kitchen workers, food servers. And we want to have a choice. We want to everybody to have the right to have health care, and we want to have an option from the government so they can join the government. And we want to have a choice to give the health care. And I think that today we feel great because we really worked so hard to put that message out. And we have supported members, saying talking to the members about going to vote. We don't say vote for this one or vote for this one or vote for this one. They have the free decision to make. And you look at the numbers at the end, you are going to see what it's going to be for, one, Medicare for All, and, one, it's going to be for choices. That's sort of - at the end of the night tonight, I hope we get the result. But I think that the information is out. And people always forget that the casino is not only our union who votes. You know, you have these dealers vote, the supervisors vote, the - everybody in the casino, you know, not only the people we represent. But our responsibility is to communicate with the members, to let them know when is - where is the vote, what time they have to show up, working with the company so they're letting them go to vote. You know, we do so much work for people to vote their voice. I think we feel very successful about that because we've been having it great till now. DAVIS: But your union has also clashed again with Senator Sanders. You said just last week that many of his supporters had been viciously attacking union members. Have you seen any of that confrontation on the ground today? ARGUELLO-KLINE: No union members are being attacked personally. You know, we have followers of Senator Sanders. You know, I respect every presidential candidate. But the fact is the fact. I pressed on the fact to the press they we received zillions of - you know, thousands of Twitters saying in phone calls and threats and saying this only because we put the facts in a scorecard about the health care. That's completely wrong. I hope that that game is stopped because I think our people have the right to know the facts. And one thing I - you know, I'm really a strong person. But one of the things that really bothers me, my family had to go through that part. And Bethany Khan is the communications director - for only we communicate because Bethany put the scorecard in the, you know, in texting. We put the scorecard inside the hotel. After that, it was incredible, the attack. And the only thing what we want is people have the information. That's our responsibility, you know? We have a commitment with the members. You know, we have elected leaders. We have a responsibility to let it know them - how every single candidate is standing on every single issue. This is a very important election for us. So it doesn't do any - I'm an immigrant. I know President Trump wants all the immigrants out of this country. I know we have 11 million people sacrifice every single day going to work, doing everything. And they're living in fear because he always tried to put the fears in every single family. We work so hard for people go to vote. And today we feel great, you know, because people vote. And people vote for all different candidates, you know? And they work so hard, these candidates, too. And that's what we did. DAVIS: OK. Well, thank you so much. That's Geocanda Arguello-Kline, the secretary treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union on the ground in Nevada. Thank you so much for your time. ARGUELLO-KLINE: Thank you. MARTIN: Let me let me go back to Danielle Kurtzleben who is here with us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Let's pick up on something that the secretary treasurer just talked about. MARTIN: Sure. MARTIN: Complaints about harassment by Sanders supporters is not new, but it's not something that people have generally wanted to talk about publicly. Can you just shed some light on what she's talking about here? KURTZLEBEN: Sure. So what happened here is this, is that the Culinary Union 226 that Ms. Arguello-Kline is the secretary treasurer of, she - that union had put out a sheet sort of stacking up the candidates against each other on various issues, including health care. And that sheet said under Bernie Sanders, who is of course a vocal supporter of single-payer Medicare for All, it said that he wanted to end Culinary health care. And the thing is people in this union have pretty generous health care compared to what a lot of other people do. So that upset some supporters, and that's what happened. MARTIN: We need to take a short break, but when we come back, we'll have more coverage. You're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. We hope you'll stay with us. And we're back with Laila Wallace who's the mayor of Wells, Nev. Madam Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. LAYLA WALZ (WELLS, NEVADA MAYOR): Thank you. Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Now, I understand that you voted early. WALZ: I did have to vote early, yeah. I'm not - I'm not in Nevada today to caucus unfortunately. MARTIN: Well, just how - what are you hearing from your constituents about how things are going? WALZ: Well, you know, I'm in a very heavily Republican part of Nevada. And so, you know, there's not a ton of Democratic support from my constituency in general. I'm a lifetime Democrat, and we're, you know - we're such a small community. And so there are a few of us there. You know, and we all seem to have our own preferences and constituents. And so, you know, it's respect among your fellow community in a small town like that. MARTIN: Well, do you think - and that's - that's one of the reasons we're glad to talk with you because you say that you're kind of one of the - a small group of Democrats. It's a Republican-leaning area. You've endorsed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. Were your Republican neighbors in mind when you chose him as your candidate? Is - were you thinking to yourself that here's somebody who could possibly appeal to my neighbors, who might be willing to give a Democrat a look? WALZ: Absolutely. That was one of the biggest factors, I think, in selecting Buttigieg is because we are, you know - we're heavy agriculture. We're a super conservative community and region. So somebody who appeals to our needs and listens to our needs in ways, that is super important for me, you know, as a community leader and for my region. He absolutely - I think that he's electable. And that's one of the biggest goals for me. MARTIN: Well, you know, there's another mayor in the race. He didn't... WALZ: Yes, there is. MARTIN: He's not on the ballot in Nevada. And I was wondering if you considered the other mayor in the race who feels that he's accomplished some things that merit a look, mayor - of course we're talking about Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. I know he's not on the ballot, but is he somebody that you would consider or that you've given any thought to? WALZ: You know he - I just feel that he was such a late-comer that he's just way behind the game at this point. We just don't know enough about him. He's just not had the opportunity to address the public that some of the early candidates have. And I just don't know enough. MARTIN: Talk a little bit if you would about the fact - we've been talking a lot about the fact, as most people are about, Nevada is the first state among the early contests that really kind of opens up diversity, has a more diverse population. Pete Buttigieg has struggled with some voters of color, even though he does have a diverse staff. What are your thoughts about that? Why do you think that is? WALZ: I really - I really couldn't say it. It may have to do - I really just couldn't say why he would struggle with voters of color. We're just not - we're not in a region in northern Nevada where we have very many voters of color. MARTIN: Do you still feel that he's got a chance? You still feel he's viable. WALZ: Oh, absolutely. I think he's very viable, very viable. He's got some great policies great perspectives, up to this point, one of the front-runners. I think he's a very viable candidate. MARTIN: Well, it's great to talk with you. That is Mayor Layla Walz of Wells, Nev. Mayor, thanks so much for talking to us. And you're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. I'm Michel Martin. DAVIS: And I'm Susan Davis. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders maintains a commanding lead as early results are coming in. And let's take a minute at the beginning to talk about how the caucus votes are being counted, which is of a particular importance given what happened just weeks ago at the Iowa caucuses. Joining me to talk about that is NPR reporter Miles Parks. Hey, Miles. How are you doing? MILES PARKS (BYLINE): Hi, Sue. DAVIS: So how is it going on the ground? You were on the ground in Iowa. You saw the fiasco that happened there. How is it comparing to what's happening in Nevada? PARKS: Honestly, it's going a lot smoother than what we saw in Iowa. DAVIS: That's a good thing. PARKS: It is a really good thing, even the fact that we have some results to talk about only very few at this point - you know, less than 1% have come in. But you think about where we were in Iowa hours - you know, even, like, 12 hours after the caucus process had already finished, and we were still basically kind of twiddling our thumbs and saying, well, hopefully we're going to get these soon. At least we have something to talk about just a couple hours after, you know, people in Nevada went to the caucus sites. DAVIS: Well, there's been some nervousness because Nevada was supposed to use the same app that went haywire in Iowa. They opted against that. Can you very briefly sort of explain how are these votes being counted and why are people confident that this is going to turn out differently? PARKS: Yeah, so they scrapped this plan to use the app that Iowa was going to use and instead went to the system to use these iPads, party-provided iPads that they were given to every precinct chair in the state. These iPads use a series of Google Forms that the precinct chairs, as they went through the process counting people in different sections of the room, they would basically input this data into the Google Form. And then it would calculate - add in the early-vote totals that had come in for each precinct and then give them a number and help them calculate each candidate's viability score. At the high school I went to to observe today, there was a guy with a nametag that said tech guy. He was passing out these iPads to a dozen or so precinct leaders. And they were kind of logging in, putzing with them. But the key is all these precinct leaders were trained earlier this week. It wasn't the first time that they were seeing these. It was the first time they were seeing these specific iPads, but they got a chance to practice with this tech earlier this week. DAVIS: And did they have - let's say there's a tech malfunction and it's not working, is there a backup plan? PARKS: There is, and that's something that Nevada Democrats have been very adamant about talking about, the fact that everything that these iPads were planning to do, these precinct leaders were trained to be able to do it on paper as well. They got paper lists of all of the early voters for their precincts. So if they were either not able to log into the iPad or they just didn't want to use it, they would be able to pull out these reams of paper and do everything manually. DAVIS: But so far, it sounds like the tech is working. PARKS: It seems like the tech is working. At the precinct I was observing, it was actually helping things go really smoothly. It was really easy to log in, and things were getting input easily. The interesting thing is the second part of this is something we're watching now, which is the transmission of results. This doesn't necessarily involve the iPads as much. But these 2,100 precinct leaders are going to need to call the state party to actually tell them how these results went down in all these different precincts. The Nevada Democrats say they beefed up their phone line, that they staffed it with 200 people to make sure that they would be able to take all these calls. But we'll just have to see over the next hour or couple hours whether these precinct leaders are able to get in easily and get these results to the state party quickly. DAVIS: Well, one thing that Nevada has also done very differently from Iowa is this is the first year that they've allowed people to early caucus. And I believe it was around 75,000 people have already cast their ballots prior to today in the caucuses. Does that help facilitate a more smooth process if you let it, you know, play out over a couple of days? PARKS: Well, it's interesting. It was something we were watching the last couple of days knowing how big that early-vote total was over the four days that early vote happened. We were wondering, were those people who were already going to vote or caucus on Saturday, or were those new voters? From the precincts that our team has been watching and the precinct I've visited, it seems like the latter. There were very few people actually caucusing in person at this high school. The precinct chair I talked to said he was told to expect 125 people, and there were 27. So that is actually kind of helpful when you think about the fact that these precinct chairs are having to talk to all these people and sort them. The process can go a little quicker when you're dealing with fewer people. DAVIS: All right. Well, Miles, if you - if you see any signs of trouble, you let us know, OK? PARKS: I will. You'll be the first person I tell, Sue. PARKS: All right. That's Miles Parks from Las Vegas. Thanks so much. MARTIN: Can I know, too? Miles, you're going to tell me, too? PARKS: You can know, Michel, as well. MARTIN: Thank you. PARKS: Yeah, I'll bring you in. MARTIN: All right, let's talk a little bit more about logistics, especially with rural voters. For that, we're going to go to Noah Glick who's a reporter with member station KUNR. Noah, are you with us? NOAH GLICK (BYLINE): I am. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: OK. All right, great. Good to talk with you. So you're at the station now, but earlier you attended the Pyramid Lake caucus location. And that's at the Paiute Reservation in northern Nevada. Do I have that right? GLICK: Yeah, that's right. It's that the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation. That community is made up of essentially three townships on the reservation. But what's interesting about what happened today is that the Nevada State Democratic Party, the way they drew up the precinct for the reservation, it actually split one of those communities basically in half. So half of the community of - half the people in one community actually had to drive into town, which is a little bit farther away than meeting at a central location at Pyramid Lake High School, which is where everyone else met. So there are some people who are frustrated, and actually at least three people were turned away at the door because they were at the wrong site. And the precinct leader I talked to said that one of the people he talked to said that they weren't going to be able to get to the other site in time. So that's at least one person who wasn't able to participate today. MARTIN: And that's because the distances are so large? GLICK: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it takes, let's say, 15 minutes for folks to get from one community to the central high school where this site was today. But to get into town, it could take, you know, 40, 50 minutes depending on where they are. And from some of the folks I talked to, they really just - they like to have tribal people take care of the check-in process, to caucus with fellow tribal people. So a lot of folks are turned off frankly by the idea of going into town, where it's a little whiter and a little bit less like their community. MARTIN: Well, talk a little bit more about that if you would. I mean, we've talked a lot about other communities in Nevada, that Nevada brings a diversity that isn't - it isn't present in the sort of - the earlier caucus state. So talk a little bit more about the Native voters there, what they're interested in. Are there any particular other challenges or opportunities to registering and energizing these voters? GLICK: Sure. Absolutely, I mean, I think the big issue - if we're talking just issues, the biggest thing I heard from people today as well as during early voting was that they're concerned about federal funding for tribal programs. We're talking about Indian education, health care services. Those seem to be top of mind for folks. But the other really big issue that I hear consistently all has to do with climate. Everyone I talked to at the site today, they were pretty upset with a lot of the rollback of environmental regulations they're seeing from the Trump administration. And the other big thing that is unique specifically here in Nevada, about 85% of the state is managed by the federal government. So public land is a big deal here and particularly among the tribal community. Mining is a huge industry here, oil and gas drilling. That stuff happens on public lands a lot. And those are getting closer and closer to tribal lands, tribal boundaries. And that can leave a legacy of toxins in the environment, which is really important to these folks. And, you know, but there's also urban sprawl that's happening both in Las Vegas and up north near Reno that's starting to creep on to tribal lands as well. So, you know, a lot of folks are really just trying to protect the natural resources that they have. For the Pyramid Lake Paiute people, it's the lake itself. They don't want to see development at the lake. They don't want this to become another Lake Tahoe. They really just want to keep it as pristine as possible. MARTIN: And of course you know I'm going to ask, did the voters that you had a chance to speak with identify a candidate who they thought was really speaking to those issues? I know there was a candidate, Jay Inslee of Washington, former - was a candidate who really identified climate as his top issue. He exited the race early not having had the opportunity to make much traction. We know that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg feels that he's made climate a priority. I know that other candidates like Tom Steyer feel that he's done so as well. Did the voters you talked to think that any particular candidate is speaking particularly to the issues that they identify as most important to them? GLICK: Absolutely. The big winner today among the people I spoke to was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. He won every precinct that had people show up in person today. He won the biggest precinct at the site today - there were eight precincts that all met at the high school. The biggest one gave out three delegates. Bernie Sanders took home two of those, and Elizabeth Warren took home one. But everyone I talked to, they seemed really impressed with the fact that Bernie Sanders met with tribal officials when he came through Nevada earlier this year. And that's really important to folks here is getting that face-to-face time and actually feeling as though they're heard. You know, the historical trauma faced by Native American voters is still a very real thing on top of mind for folks. So I think they want to make sure that they feel like they're part of the process and that they feel like they're heard. And Senator Sanders is someone who's listening. MARTIN: All right. That is Noah Glick. He's a reporter with member station KUNR. Noah, thanks so much for talking to us. GLICK: Thanks for having me. DAVIS: The Nevada Democratic caucuses are the first time that Latino voters are having a say in the Democratic nominating contest. And one of the groups that has endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is Mijente, a Latino civil rights group created in 2015. And joining me now is Marisa Franco of that group. Marisa, how are you? MARISA FRANCO (MIJENTE): I'm good. How are you? DAVIS: Thank you so much for joining us. Now, your group made its first ever presidential endorsement this year for Senator Sanders. How did you come to that conclusion? Because you had debated internally among several different candidates. FRANCO: Yes, so our membership decided that we wanted to go through this process to be able to really build up momentum to take on Donald Trump and the reelection campaign for 2020. We did interviews with several of the candidates to really understand their positions on issues that really matter to our community and did internal debate and ended up making a decision earlier this month. And the vast majority of our membership thought that Bernie Sanders was a candidate to go with. And so we just made the announcement earlier this week. DAVIS: Was there a specific issue or issues that ultimately had you land on Sanders? FRANCO: I mean, I think for sure his positions on immigration, but also, you know, issues around climate, issues around economic justice. But I would say I think there's two things that stand out with Senator Sanders' candidacy. One is that he has been consistent. It is not a situation where you see him changing his positions based off of polls or, you know, you look back on statements he's made on things like health care - for example, six months ago, and they're drastically different. There's a consistency, and I think that consistency is a real sticking point for folks in our community. And I think the second piece that is really compelling for folks in our community is that the senator - I think people are really tired of, you know, the political games where elected officials or folks running for office will kind of say what you want to hear, but when it comes time when they actually are elected and they're in office, they're very quick to fold when there's any pushback on bold solutions for the problems our communities are facing. And we're looking for a candidate that's going to fight as hard as we are. And we believe that that candidate is Senator Sanders. DAVIS: Can I ask you about health care? Because his plan for Medicare for All has been - has divided the Democratic Party. You know, there's many candidates in the race who do not support it. He clearly has been the longest and most vocal for it. How does your group see health care as an issue there? And do you think it's potentially a risky political position to take in a general election? FRANCO: I think it's risky to continue to go with solutions that aren't actually getting at the problem. I think people seeing that these issues are not dealt with when you see the grotesque nature of what people have to go through to get basic health care needs met, people lose confidence. They lose confidence in government. They lose confidence in elected officials. And so Senator Sanders being willing to talk about what it's going to take to solve these problems is refreshing. And I think you're seeing in Nevada and you're going to see in states coming up that people are ready for that change. And it's exactly the type of change that we need going up against Donald Trump in 2020. DAVIS: Great. That is Marisa Franco of Mijente a Latin civil rights group - a Latino civil rights group. Thank you so much for your time. FRANCO: Thank you. DAVIS: Joining me in studio is political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, I'd like to get your reaction to this 'cause I do think we should - it's important to note that Latino voters are having their first say today. And we're hearing a lot of different messages. MONTANARO: We are. The thing that, you know, stands out to me is just how separate the Democratic electorate is on replacing private health insurance versus the country overall. You know, our polling had found in December that, sure, some 58% of Democrats nationally were in favor of Medicare for All. But it was pretty unpopular with Independents and Republicans, making it majority people not supporting it. And we saw - we see that in the entrance polls today as well, where Nevada Democrats - 62% said they're in favor of health care as a government health care plan that would replace private health insurance. And we saw pretty moderate-progressive splits like we've seen on a whole lot of other things. When you look at who is leading among those who support that, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the only two that do well, right? Then on the other side of that, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar do well with those who oppose it. This has been the fundamental split among Democrats for, you know, 13 years. I mean 2007, that race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was all about health care. And it still is. DAVIS: That's Domenico Montanaro, live in studio. You are listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. And this is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. And we want to go back to the ground in Las Vegas where we have now joining us Joe Schoenmann, host of the program \"State Of Nevada.\" How are you doing, Joe? JOE SCHOENMANN (BYLINE): I'm doing well. thanks. DAVIS: You know, we are here in Washington. But you're on the ground. You have producers from KNPR out all over the state. What are you hearing on the ground, and what are caucus-goers telling you? SCHOENMANN: Well, one thing we're hearing thankfully is it's going unbelievably smoothly. Nobody really expected that. But again only about 10% of the vote is in, if even that. Bernie Sanders has a massive lead over Joe Biden, then Pete Buttigieg. And what's surprising is that, what some of our producers and reporters at sites where we thought a lot of culinary workers would show up, they're finding a lot of support for Bernie Sanders. And as your guests earlier had talked about, that's kind of surprising because the Culinary Union had come out and said, we don't like Medicare for All. But the huge concern with people in this state is - there is a poor health care system here now. It is getting better, has gotten better over the last couple of years. But health insurance rates are rising quickly, and they're finding that a lot of companies are then cutting back on what people get through their health insurance. So I think health care for all, Medicare for All is sounding better and better to people here. DAVIS: Also this year, the early-voting system seems to be working smoothly. Maybe it has smoothed out some of those issues that could have happened as we've seen out of Iowa where people have been able to vote and the caucus sites aren't overrun and seems to be going pretty well. SCHOENMANN: That's kind of a stunner. (LAUGHTER)\r\nDAVIS: It's good news. Good news. SCHOENMANN: It is good news. There were 70,000 early votes over four days. That did not go that well for the people who had waited. The waits were anywhere from 1 1/2 to six hours, I've heard from some people. So maybe everybody got their votes done, and today, there are just going to be a lot fewer people out there. So it's going well. And the Google Forms, the Google Sheets app that they're using, which is going to automatically tabulate and calculate the priorities - the prioritized presidential candidates seems to be working well. That goes into the caucus system here, which is sort of - to people who don't know it, it's this convoluted system that a lot of people really don't understand. But it basically involves this. If you're at a caucus and your candidate doesn't get 15% of the votes of the people at the caucus, your votes then go to a different presidential candidate. Those early ballots prioritize candidates so that if your first person didn't get there, your second votes go automatically to somebody - to the second person on your list. It sounds complicated. It is, but I think people understand it in the - and the system's working. DAVIS: Really quickly before we have to take a break, one of the candidates not in Nevada, Michael Bloomberg, is he still having an impact in this race? SCHOENMANN: I think so. I mean, the only reason why is because he put up a huge billboard on the Las Vegas Strip saying, Donald Trump made a casino go bankrupt. That has been in the news everywhere here. And it's really - seems to resonate with people 'cause this is a casino town. DAVIS: That is Joe Schoenmann, host of \"State Of Nevada\" for KNPR in Las Vegas. Joe, thank you so much. SCHOENMANN: Yeah, you're welcome. DAVIS: And you are listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. MARTIN: Early results show Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with a sizable lead. From NPR News, this is live Special Coverage of the Nevada caucuses. I'm Michel Martin. DAVIS: And I'm Susan Davis. Nevadans are making their choices for the Democratic presidential nominee known today. MARTIN: Senator Sanders spoke to his supporters as early results appear to show him heading towards a win. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\r\nSANDERS: We can win the Democratic nomination. We can defeat Donald Trump. (CHEERING)\r\nSANDERS: And we can transform this country. Let's do it. Thank you. DAVIS: But there's still a lot to learn from today's caucuses. We have reporters covering all of the candidates and analysis here in the studio. MARTIN: Stay with us. This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada caucuses from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: So we've been following results. They are coming in slowly, but they are coming in. And Bernie Sanders is showing a substantial lead. We're going to go back to our reporters on site. Asma Khalid is at the Biden caucus day event in Las Vegas. She's there now. So let's start with you. Anything going on - a little party starting there maybe. KHALID: Hey there. At Joe Biden's site, you can hear the music behind me, but folks haven't really filtered into the room yet. MARTIN: So the entrance polls show that Senator Bernie Sanders is doing well. I think that the reporting indicates that Joe Biden, the former vice president, was hoping that he would do better in states that were more diverse than the early deciding states. So how are things going with the Biden campaign? How are they feeling about things? Polls don't show him doing well at all, frankly. KHALID: I mean, to your point, frankly, polls show Bernie Sanders winning a majority or I should say a plurality of pretty much every demographic group at this point. I believe that the entrance polls showed Joe Biden winning African American voters and just older voters. And, look, I think this is a really big question about his case of electability. His campaign has long argued that he would do better once this contest moved on to more diverse states. Well, Nevada was the first test of that argument, and, you know, he has said - his campaign has argued that they didn't necessarily expect to win the race here but, you know, a first or second place finish would be good. In fact, one of his supporters even yesterday told me a third place finish he felt would be OK. But I would argue that if Bernie Sanders wins this race by large margins, that's just a really hard argument around electability to pitch as you move into South Carolina. MARTIN: And I want to ask you about something that just came out. I understand that the former vice president is committing to a full moratorium on any deportations in his first 100 days. That's a shift for him, isn't it? KHALID: So this is a pretty big statement. I would say it was first reported by BuzzFeed News, but I did get confirmation from the Biden campaign as well that they have said that Biden is absolutely committed to a 100-day moratorium on any deportations of people who are already in the United States. This is an idea that actually Bernie Sanders put forward, and I will say it is an idea that is largely supported in many Latino communities. Many of the Latino progressive activists I talked to in terms of asking why they supported Senator Sanders, that fact that he came out so early on in such a bold way around a moratorium on deportations they felt was really a key sign of how he felt about their community. And, look, I think for the former vice president, this is a pretty big statement. I mean, he has been questioned publicly many times about the record level of deportations that occurred when he was the vice president to Barack Obama. MARTIN: And, OK, let's go to Scott Detrow now, who has been with the Sanders campaign. Scott, you're with us? DETROW: I am. Yeah. He is... MARTIN: All right. So let's look forward a bit because the Sanders campaign is, too. I just want to mention that Senator Sanders is actually in Texas right now, right? DETROW: Yeah. Usually when a campaign has already fled the state before the polls are closed, it's a sign that they don't think they're doing so well. I think a good example of that would be Joe Biden leaving New Hampshire the day of the New Hampshire primary. But Bernie Sanders feels very confident about Nevada. The very early results bear that out - though, again, only about 3% reporting. He actually spent more time campaigning in California the last few days than he did in Nevada with only one event here in Nevada in the last few days. And today, it's multiple stops in Texas. What do California and Texas have in common? They are the two biggest delegate prizes on March 3, Super Tuesday, a day where about a third of the overall delegates will be awarded. The Sanders campaign has been spending a lot of time in these states, a lot of resources in these states as they build out their schedule over the next few weeks. They are going to be doing events in South Carolina, which is, of course, the next contest, but they are mostly focused on March 3. I talked to Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about this last night in the back of a Sanders rally. And he made the point that this has been a campaign that has been primarily focused around that upcoming date for months now. FAIZ SHAKIR (BERNIE SANDERS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MANAGER): We were most aggressive in California. We've had close to 100 staffers. We are in North Carolina, in Virginia, in Massachusetts, in Maine, in Utah. You know, we have staffers spread out all over March 3 states - Texas obviously a big one. And I think if all goes well with the momentum that we now have, March 3 should be a day when we can open up a delegate lead and never look back. DETROW: And I think that's a big reason why a lot of people in the Democratic Party are now thinking this is Bernie Sanders' nomination to lose at this particular point in time. There's just no other campaign other than that of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that has the financial resources and the organization in these upcoming states that start voting on March 3 and then the week after, the almost just as big Super Tuesday that comes after that. MARTIN: I was going to just - just a little bit more on that, Scott, if you would before I go back to Asma. Does anybody else have the resources to go for a while in this campaign? DETROW: Well, Bloomberg obviously has his endless pocketbook. He's spent about $500 million, which, for him, is remarkably not that much money. I think one thing that we're looking for today is how Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren does. Her campaign has seen a lot of momentum in the days since that debate where she had a pretty strong performance really eviscerating Michael Bloomberg and making a lot of other points. Her campaign says that she - they have raised north of $12 million since that debate, which is a remarkable amount of money, especially considering the amount of money that she had on hand in the last campaign finance report, less than $3 million. So she was a candidate who for a lot of reasons seemed to be on the ropes who suddenly now has the resources to put more money on TV in a lot of these upcoming states. Though it's interesting to note that I also saw Bernie Sanders' campaign release a whole bunch of events in Massachusetts, one of those states that has voting in the next few weeks feeling like they can take Elizabeth Warren out in Massachusetts, that could be a way to kind of coalesce that progressive lane. MARTIN: All right. So let's go back to Asma on this. Asma, how are the other candidates or are the other candidates responding to this show of confidence from Bernie Sanders? KHALID: I mean, I think Scott's point about the way that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren fares here in Nevada is a really valid point. According to entrance polls, one of her best groups today was people who decided in the last few days. The trouble for her with that is that about 75,000 people have already voted early. You know, she had a strong debate performance, and there was a woman I met at the caucus site I visited earlier who told me she really liked Elizabeth Warren. In fact, she had been leaning more towards Bernie Sanders, and I said, well, what are you thinking? You know, what are you ultimately going to do? And she said that as much as she likes Senator Warren, she feels that there are more supporters already going towards Bernie Sanders. And she feels like he tends to do better with minority groups. And in the long run, that may be more important for the candidate who needs to take on Donald Trump. So how we - I think Super Tuesday - I know we've all been saying this kind of ad nauseum, but I think it is a really, really important voting day. I mean, you're going to have a day between California and Texas. You will have - a majority of all the Latino voters who are going to vote in this primary season will have cast their ballots in just the next couple of weeks. MARTIN: So I did mention that Senator Bernie Sanders has already moved on. He's in Texas. Are the other candidates still in Nevada even though we don't have a call yet? Or have they also moved on, too? KHALID: A lot of candidates are moving on. I'm here at the Joe Biden celebration party, which hasn't entirely kicked off yet, but he's in fact really one of the only candidates having a true celebration or party if I could call it that here. Elizabeth Warren is going to be in Seattle - I believe Washington tonight. Pete Buttigieg has a rally in Colorado. A lot of these candidates realized the organizational strength of the Sanders campaign here. And because there are just so many delegates at stake between Super Tuesday and a couple of, you know, days after that, they've decided they need to focus on some of those really delegate-rich states. MARTIN: All right. That's Asma Khalid and Scott Detrow. They are both in Las Vegas or thereabouts. Thank you both so much. We'll keep going back to you later on in the evening. DETROW: Thanks so much. KHALID: You're welcome. DAVIS: Early Nevada caucus results suggest a strong showing for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. And joining us to talk about what that could mean for his campaign is the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz. Mayor, thank you for joining us. CARMEN YULIN CRUZ (SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO MAYOR): Thank you for having me. DAVIS: So if Senator Sanders is - you know, it's too early to call it, but he is - early indication, he's going to have a good night in Nevada. What does a win here mean for his campaign? CRUZ: Well, it means the reaffirmation to everybody of a couple of things. No 1. - his electability. There will no longer be that dialogue or that narrative that nobody likes Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is too radical (ph). He's not electable. He has the most popular vote in Iowa. He won New Hampshire, and it certainly looks like he's going to have a great night in Nevada clinching, of course, that state. But it also means something even more important for the movement that Bernie is creating. It is an understanding that minority groups and Latino groups are not an asterisk on the conversation when it comes to Bernie Sanders. They're not going to be in the back burner just to be used as pawns in a chess game that is politically motivated. Bernie has been fighting for the types of things that Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans, Muslims, LGBTQ, you know, all of these groups that when you put them together really are a force to reckon with. I went to Broadacres Market to campaign many weeks ago for the Sanders campaign - as you know, I'm a co-chair - and also want to the Cardenas supermarket. And it - for the Latino population in Nevada, it was about meeting the state representatives, the Democratic representatives, the Democratic structure, but it was also about building a true grassroots organization. That is the same thing that happened in New Hampshire, in Iowa, and it's happening all across the United States. It also means that Bernie's commitment, courage and consistency are finally really ringing with all the voters. You know, he doesn't have to pay millions of dollars to have somebody know what he thinks. He knows what he stands for, and we know what he stands for - immigration (unintelligible) protection to DACA students. Somebody on the show earlier was reported that Bernie Sanders came for this prohibition or amnesty on deportations. Why does he do it? Not because it's politically convenient but because it is what is right. This idea of having a rent control across the United States, not allowing landlords to really take people for every penny that they have, the idea that health care and education are a benefit, not a privilege - all of these things resonate not only with the Latino voters in Nevada and the African American voters, but it really resonates with anyone that has their heart (ph) placed and living in a society that is fair and just. And furthermore, there's the issue of climate change. Bernie has been dominating the conversation. Bernie has been dominating the ideas that have been circling around in the Democratic Party. And really this has been really taking people for a storm (ph). So I am very proud to be part of this organization and part of this political revolution and movement. DAVIS: Well, I want to ask you about electability because you brought that up. And one thing that we have seen out of these early state contests is the, quote-unquote, \"moderate lane\" candidates collectively do get more votes cast than the progressives in the race. So does that raise questions of long-term electability if a lot of Democratic voters aren't where Bernie Sanders is on a lot of these issues? CRUZ: Well, you know, the question - the answer - the succinct answer is no, and let me tell you why. In the last 10 polls for the last week, Bernie Sanders came ahead on each and every one of them. The other thing that Bernie continues to pound on is when it comes to trustworthiness and when it comes to the candidate that you trust the most, Bernie comes out on top. When it comes to the candidate that Democratic voters feel that will be more able to - can not only commit but do the things that he says he's going to commit to, Bernie comes out on top. And I'll give you an example. One of the most beautiful things that has been happening right now - and as we know, our brothers and sisters from the Culinary Union in Nevada decided not to back any candidate. But one of the most beautiful things that is happening is that members of the union, from the Culinary Union, are going in huge numbers to the caucus in Nevada, and they're caucusing for Bernie Sanders. Why? Because Bernie was in the picket line before it was politically expedient to be on the picket line because he led and has led the war - and it is a war - the war on raising that minimum wage to a living wage because he says it and people think it is a market mantra, but it's not. It's the way that he has lived his life... DAVIS: Mayor... CRUZ: ...Fighting for the working class. DAVIS: Thank you so much for your time. We'll have to leave it there. That is the mayor of... CRUZ: Thank you very much. DAVIS: ...Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz. You're listening to Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. MARTIN: And now we're going to Congressman Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois. He's a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and he has endorsed the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg. And in fact, he's a national co-chair of the Bloomberg campaign. Congressman Rush, thank you so much for joining us. BOBBY RUSH (D-IL, REP): Well, I certainly thank you for the invitation. MARTIN: Well, out of all people I think that people might be surprised are supporting Mayor Bloomberg, I have to say, Congressman Rush, you're one of those that's kind of catches people's attention. You're known certainly as a very progressive member of the caucus. You've been a longtime member of the Black Caucus. You're a former member of the Black Panthers back in the day. And, you know, as you know, the - Mayor Bloomberg has gotten a lot of criticism from people in the African American community for a number of reasons. But he took quite a beating from the other candidates in his first appearance on the debate stage the other day, including because of his prior support for the stop-and-frisk policy when he was mayor in New York. So I presume you've talked to him about that, and how did you resolve that for yourself? RUSH: Well, I tell you, he took meeting (ph), and he wasn't prepared in his own heart and mind - particularly, in his mind - for this. He was in an alley fight when he was trying to and expecting him to be fighting with Marquess of Queensbury rules. I mean, this was not a referee-controlled fight. This was a fight that was the WWF at its best. And he was totally shocked and knocked off his square (ph) and wasn't prepared for it. But I think that that was a good lesson for him. And we'll see whether or not he, you know, will listen to his campaign team, take their advice and know that he's on the ropes now. MARTIN: OK. But I'm more interested in you, Congressman. Why are you supporting Mayor Bloomberg? Why is he the person who has your vote? I know you were worth Kamala Harris first, but she's left the race, the former - the California Senator Kamala Harris. What made you decide to cast your lot with Bloomberg? RUSH: I thank you for that question because, one, I thought that he was the best candidate over the long haul to be Donald Trump, all right? That's the one thing, that he is the best candidate to match him against Donald Trump in November. And secondly - and a close second - Mike Bloomberg enunciated a policy that is rare among all the other candidates for nomination and never was there strong economic development commitment to an African American community. And that's what we've been lacking in the national political arena for decades now is someone who is committed specifically to create and expand black home ownership, to expand the number of black-owned businesses, to invest... MARTIN: OK. Congressman, we're going to have to leave it there for now. I hope we'll talk again. That's Bobby Rush, congressman from Illinois. You're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nMARTIN: This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses I'm Michel Martin. DAVIS: And I'm Susan Davis. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders maintains an early lead as results from the caucus sites are rolling in very slowly. We're going to take a closer look at these results, and to do that, joining me in studio is NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Hey, Domenico. MONTANARO: Hey there. DAVIS: And NPR's Daniel Kurtzleben. Hey, Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: Hello. DAVIS: So, Domenico, what do we know? MONTANARO: Well, so far, only 3% of precincts are reporting according to the Associated Press, who's - which is who we rely on for data. And in that data, we have Bernie Sanders ahead with 55% of the vote and everyone else. (LAUGHTER)\r\nDAVIS: Who's coming in right after Bernie? MONTANARO: You know, you have Joe Biden in that about 18%, Elizabeth Warren about 10%, Pete Buttigieg 9, Tom Steyer at 8. Now, those numbers are going to change because this is 3%. We have 97% of the precincts still out. So I wouldn't pay much attention to that data, but what the entrance polls at least have shown us of the people who are - have walked into the caucuses who were polled before they went in, Bernie Sanders does well across almost all groups. And it looks like, you know, he should have a pretty big day today with Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden doing fairly well. And some of the other candidates, you know, may be competing as well maybe for fourth or fifth place. But it looks like a bit of a gap between Sanders and Biden and Buttigieg. DAVIS: Well, step back for a minute and talk about what Nevada means in the broader context of this Democratic primary nominating contest because, you know, Iowa is still a question mark. But Bernie Sanders won second place there. He won New Hampshire. If tonight - what does a win - a potential win in Nevada mean tonight for the overall race in his campaign? MONTANARO: Well, so two things - one, the overall race, you know, there are a lot of candidates who had a lot on the line. Bernie Sanders was the favorite going in. So a favorite's bar is to win, right? And it looks like if he does pull that off, he's met the bar, and it seems that potentially he's exceeded it. If he exceeds what was the expectation, that he can hold on to his base of young voters, people, you know, who identify as very liberal, that base might have been enough to get about a quarter of the vote. But you got to get more than that if you want to get to look like you're starting to expand. Now, we've had some early signs in our national polling, the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polling, that he was starting to expand at least a little bit - low 30s is where he was at in our poll - 31%. And he was in - he was doing similarly in some of the other national polls that came out. So if he starts to match that, that looks like people are starting to get on board the Bernie train - right? - on board the Sanders Express or whatever you want to call it. But, you know, the other candidates have a lot on the line. I mean, Joe Biden in particular has promised that he could do well with voters of color. According to the entrance polls, Biden is winning with African Americans, but not much ahead of Bernie Sanders, and Sanders winning overwhelmingly with Latino voters. And Joe Biden needs at least, you know, a top-three finish here to have any kind of momentum heading into South Carolina, where African Americans dominate there. DAVIS: Danielle, one thing the entrance polls also told us is that health care is still an issue that is the most dominating force for a lot of voters. KURTZLEBEN: Right. Yeah, and this is something that I've been out there talking to a fair number of voters. I was just in South Carolina. And you ask any Democratic voter, what's your biggest issue? They'll say health care. But often they talk about the problem and not the solution. Often they'll say, listen, my costs are too high. They don't necessarily have a feeling of and I want Medicare for All to fix it or a public option. And this is borne out by a poll that came out this week. The Kaiser Family Foundation put out this poll asking people, Democrats and Republicans, what kind of a plan do you favor? Sixty-two percent of Democrats say they support both Medicare for All and a public option. So for all of the fighting, all of the sound and fury we see on that debate stage, voters themselves just want things fixed. It's not necessarily that they have that same fight with each other. MARTIN: Isn't this in part, Domenico, the first sign that what Democratic voters have been saying all along is true, that they say what they most want to do is beat Donald Trump and all else is secondary... MONTANARO: Right. MARTIN: ...In part because we've been sort of focusing on the fact that, you know, there are these differences of opinion about how health care should be handled. Danielle just brought us some information about that - but that they're willing to vote for a candidate that they, you know, may not agree with on every subject as long as they think that that's a candidate who can win. MONTANARO: The problem is there's not a, you know, quantifiable metric that everyone can agree on to say what electability means. You know, it's a pretty amorphous, ambiguous thing. If you are a Sanders supporter, you die hard - you are a die hard who believes that Bernie Sanders can win and would have won in 2016 - right? - if he was on the ballot instead of Hillary Clinton, they believe that. It's a very difficult thing to quantify. And there are a lot of Democrats who fervently disagree that Bernie Sanders can win and beat Donald Trump. But, you know, you don't know if that's actually true until the race is run. MONTANARO: Danielle has something to say, and then we're going to bring Miles back in. KURTZLEBEN: Well, I want to get at something - I agree with everything Domenico just said. I want to get at something we're seeing in these entrance polls, though. When you - when they ask Nevada voters, do you care more about someone who can defeat Trump or someone who agrees with you on the issues, two-thirds of people said, yeah, I want someone who can defeat Trump. So OK electability is a big deal. But among those people, the differences are very narrow between Sanders, Biden, whatever. The groupings, the order of candidates is very close. When you talk to people about the issues, Sanders won those voters. He won half of those voters. So you could make the case that, yeah, the issue is his stance, his pretty far-left stances are, like - put him over the top in Nevada, however important electability is. MARTIN: It is interesting that we heard from our colleague in Nevada earlier who hosts a talk show there who started talking about the actual problems with health care, the way people are experiencing the health care system, the fact that the costs are so high, the fact that the access is poor. I mean, I think that's kind of the level of what we - what we really need to understand is when people talk about health care, what are they really saying? And that's what he was telling us about is what they're saying. Let's go to Miles Parks now. He's at Nevada Democratic Party headquarters, and I understand that he's got some new information for us. Miles. PARKS: Yeah. Hey there. MARTIN: What do you have? What do you know? PARKS: So basically the Democratic Party is saying that there's nothing to see here in terms of - we're at about 3:30 p.m. West Coast time. The caucuses were about 3 1/2 hours ago. I know we in the media who want to see these results are kind of on them right now to get those results. But what the Democratic Party is saying is we didn't make a time estimate for this reason. You know, it's still early in the day. They said we just want to have results by the end of the day, and we want those results to be accurate more than anything else. What they're saying basically is this wait, this couple-hour wait that we're seeing right now is not out of the ordinary. They had three sets of data to get from each one of these 2,000 precincts across the state. That's just a lot of data to take in and then to verify. What they're saying is what we're seeing is just not out of the ordinary. MARTIN: OK, and - well, just - but, Miles, while we have you, you know, I know there's a lot of debate about whether Iowa and New Hampshire should go first. But what you did see there is people who were interested in the process, who are very - take it very seriously. I mean, they take their sort of first-in-the-nation status very seriously. They're very engaged. They go to a lot of meetings. They put a lot of time into it. I'm just curious about what the atmosphere is like in Nevada, which is obviously a very different place. I mean, there are lots of distances to cover. It's not compact. There are rural voters. There are urban voters. But just what's the - what's the - what's the vibe there? Do people seem excited about this campaign? Are they interested in getting involved? Tell me more. Tell me what you're seeing. MONTANARO: In terms of, like, the caucus process here, I think people are feeling really passionate and excited about this year because they integrated this early caucusing function as a way to kind of deflect from those accessibility issues that Iowa gets kind of banged for every single election cycle. They allowed for four days of early voting. And we saw almost 75,000 people participate, which almost matched the total number of caucus-goers in 2016. So we've seen really high participation. But what some of those anti-caucus folks are saying is, that early voting seemed a lot like a primary. These were people showing up, filling out paper ballots and turning them in. And then they were getting counted. Why don't you just go to a full primary if everyone's so excited about this system? MARTIN: Well, can't argue with that. All right, Miles Parks, thanks so much. I think - OK, Susan. DAVIS: Joining us now is Adam Green. He's the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and he has been a Warren - the group has been a Warren supporter for a long time. Hey, Adam. How are you doing? ADAM GREEN (CO-FOUNDER, PROGRESSIVE CHANGE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE): Good. How are you? DAVIS: So how are you interpreting what we're seeing on the ground in Nevada, which doesn't look like Elizabeth Warren is having a particularly strong night just yet? GREEN: Well, actually some of the initial results show a lot of strength coming at the debate. One thing that was fascinating about the debate was that it happened right after early vote was over. So we actually have a very nice apples-to-apples comparison between, how did she do before the debate, and how did she do after the debate? And early precincts coming in show huge jumps. You know, one precinct, she had 10% pre-debate and 29% post-debate. Another one was 10% pre-debate and 30% post-debate and on and on. So that's the real number that we're looking at because what that signifies is her momentum going into Super Tuesday, where, you know, about a third of the delegates overall will be counted. DAVIS: Did that debate give her strength because she was able to raise some money to continue to compete in this race going into Super Tuesday? GREEN: Yes, although, I think the biggest strength it gave her was people seeing what they loved about Elizabeth Warren. You know, she has seven years of moments as a strong fighter, challenging power, naming villains and being effective, actually holding corporations accountable. And really Michael Bloomberg on stage was the walking personification of her core argument that billionaires and corporations are trying to buy our government, buy our elections and rig the rules for themselves. He was also pretty much a proxy for Donald Trump as an ego-maniacal billionaire who, you know, has a record that's not that great on race, not that great on gender and not that great on corporate issues. And what she did was show America what it would look like for her to be on the debate stage with Donald Trump. And I think that's what people are responding to. MONTANARO: Hey, Adam. It's Domenico Montanaro at NPR. How are you doing, man? GREEN: Hey, hey. Good to see you. Good to talk to you. MONTANARO: Good to hear you. Good to talk to you, too. Let me ask you a question about Bloomberg 'cause I think it's interesting you bringing up how he sort of personifies the villain that she sees as the problem with the entire case that she makes actually. But I kind of wonder Bernie Sanders has said that he would not take any money or support from Bloomberg in a general election. If Warren were to get the nomination, do you think she should take Bloomberg's support? GREEN: I actually don't know what that means for Bernie Sanders to not take Bloomberg's support. I mean, will he take a $2,800 check from Bloomberg? I guess not. Will Bloomberg decide on his own to do hundreds of millions of dollars in TV ads? I doubt he would ask Bernie Sanders for permission. MONTANARO: Right, but do you think she should - do you think she should wave him off from creating a superPAC, for example, in boosting her? GREEN: Honestly, I don't really have deep thoughts on that except that my guess is that Democrats will have a mentality that we must beat Donald Trump at all costs. But what she will not do is have a message of her campaign that is remotely close to Bloomberg's because hers is fundamentally about challenging power, challenging billionaires, challenging big corporations, holding them accountable, whereas Mike Bloomberg on many issues kind of looks and feels like a Republican. So if he wants to do anti-Trump ads, you know, that's one thing. But, you know, the look and feel of their campaigns would be entirely different. MARTIN: Adam, this is Michel Martin. It's good to talk with you. GREEN: Hey. MARTIN: Is it accurate that you advocated in January for the DNC to change the qualifying rules to allow for Mayor Bloomberg into the debate? That's accurate, isn't it? GREEN: It was reported in January. What actually happened was on December 15, the day that multiple candidates put in a request to the DNC to allow Cory Booker on the debate stage, I put in a call to the DNC and advocating them reopening the rules, which would have reopened it for him, for Castro, who I believe was still in the race, and for Bloomberg if they had decide to reimagine the rules then. They didn't. They said no. And then in January, I was asked about whether he's getting enough scrutiny and pointed out that, no, he's not good enough scrutiny. And things will look entirely different if he were on the debate stage, which proved true this week. MARTIN: So I was going to - that's what I was going to ask you was in part the purpose of that to allow Michael - to allow Elizabeth Warren to do what she did, to give him the scrutiny that you feel he hasn't had so far. Was that partly the point? GREEN: Well, yes, in part. Yes, again, it would have been preferable if there were more candidates on stage for people to see, including Cory Booker and Julian Castro. But at the end of the day, I think it's undeniable that having the walking personification of a corporation and a billionaire trying to buy our democracy ended up being a very good foil for Elizabeth Warren and allowed her to get out her core message, allowed people to see the fight, the grit that she has brought to seven years of advocacy. DAVIS: Adam, we don't - we don't have much time left, but I did want to ask you a question because now that this focus is in Nevada - has a lot of Latino voters, a lot of black voters. And what we're seeing - and now a caveat - I know it's early. But we're not seeing a particularly strong performance from Warren from Latino and black voters, and that raises the question of, does she have the same fundamental weakness that a candidate like Pete Buttigieg has? If she can't appeal to black and Latino voters, where can she go in this nominating contest? GREEN: Yeah, so two things. Again, I'm looking at a difference between the early vote and the day-of vote. It'll be interesting to see where those numbers land in particular, as well as, you know, our numbers coming up in South Carolina since her debate performance. But the biggest point I would make is that Elizabeth Warren is really the only candidate that brings under one roof a world view that merges a class, a gender and a racial narrative, which we saw at the She the People forum last year where she was one of the only candidates to get a standing ovation in front of this audience of only women of color. So we hope that South Carolina will be open to her message. DAVIS: Got it. Adam Green, thank you so much. And you're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is showing an early but strong lead in the caucus results. And joining me in studio to talk about it is NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Danielle Kurtzleben. Hey there. KURTZLEBEN: Hello. MONTANARO: Hi. DAVIS: So, Domenico, how do you interpret what we're seeing in the results so far? MONTANARO: So far, you know, still only 3% of precincts are reporting. I think that this party is being very careful about the results that it's reporting because they don't want what happened in Iowa to be a repeat. DAVIS: None of us want that. None of us want that. MONTANARO: Right. And the Nevada Democratic Party has a pretty good reputation as a very strong party within, you know, the myriad parties in the Democratic Party. So, you know, I think they're going to take their time, especially considering it's, you know, only 4:30, you know, Nevada time. They're probably, you know, perfectly fine just taking their time with this. You know, they've put in place a lot of potential things to help with avoiding what happened in Iowa. They scrapped the app that was made by the same controversial company that had the debacle - the reporting debacle in Iowa. So they're not doing that. They increased the number of people answering phones at call centers so that people who are reporting in those results will be able to do so more cleanly than in Iowa where we had people on our special who went to bed not being able to report the results and reported them live on air to us instead. And we hope that maybe somebody in Iowa listened and wrote it down. But that's what you've got going on in Nevada. They tried to sort of, you know, make sure they have a lot of quality controls in check and probably want to take their time here. Now, what we're seeing so far, 3% in, you have Bernie Sanders with 55% of the vote. Joe Biden at 18%, Elizabeth Warren at 10, Pete Buttigieg nine. Those numbers are going to change completely. You know, the entrance polls don't show those - quite those margins, but you do have Bernie Sanders with a fairly significant - with fairly significant leads in with a bunch of different groups beyond his core base. MARTIN: Do we know whether the entrance poll results, the early results that we see, are they sort of broadly reflective of the state or do they tend to come from sort of one place or another? MONTANARO: Well, most of the vote in Nevada comes from one county. Two-thirds of the vote comes from Clark County where Las Vegas is, and Henderson, which is a suburb of Las Vegas, is now the second-largest city in Nevada population-wise. But it's very important to recognize and understand that while we're going to see raw vote, that's not what this game is about. This game is about delegates. And there are going to be a lot of outsize, you know, delegate allocations in some of the more rural areas. So whatever that statewide - whatever that statewide vote is is not necessarily going to reflect how the delegates go. A big number to pay attention to, especially with the splintered field, is you have to get at least 15% statewide and in each congressional district - and there are four of those - to be able to get any delegates at all. DAVIS: OK. Well this is live Special Coverage of the Nevada caucuses from NPR News. We'll be right back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\r\nDAVIS: This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. I'm Susan Davis. MARTIN: And I'm Michel Martin. Early results continue to show Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the lead, but results are still trickling in. DAVIS: So for more on what's happening on the ground, we're joined by Scott Rodd. He's a state government reporter for CapRadio. Hey, Scott. SCOTT RODD (CAPRADIO): Hey, how are you? DAVIS: I'm good. So tell us, where in Nevada are you? RODD: So we're based in Reno right now. We just wrapped up actually at the caucus site at the University of Nevada, Reno. DAVIS: And what was the scene there? How many people showed up? Were people excited? Who won? RODD: There was a lot of excitement there. I would say it was a good maybe 100 to 150 people who showed up, maybe a bit more than that. And by and large, supporters there were for Sanders. He walked away, from my count, with 49 delegates. Warren came away with five and Klobuchar came away with three. And that wasn't all too surprising on a college campus - a lot of young voters out there. And Sanders has a very strong support among young voters. So that's really who came out on top at UNR. DAVIS: What was the reason behind the Sanders support? I mean, is it just because they like his ideas? Was there anything specific that young voters tell you as for why they're drawn to, you know, one of the oldest candidates in the race? RODD: A big one was health care. Many of the voters that I spoke to said that health care was a top issue for them. They liked the idea of \"Medicare for All.\" They like not only that, the idea, but the fact that Bernie was the first to - or among the candidates out there, he was first to really champion this idea. He like - they like that it's a bit radical and that it would shake up the current system. You know, supporters for Sanders that I spoke to said that the status quo for health care in the country is just not doing it for them. I thought it was particularly interesting that these are pretty young kids. A lot of them are likely still on their, you know, parents' health care, but they still were very much attuned to this issue and knew that, you know, even though they may be on their parents' health care, you know, a couple years down the road, this is still going to be - this is going to be something that's going to be impacting them. DAVIS: Scott, you've been reporting a lot on turnout. How has the early caucusing affected turnout this year? RODD: Well, there was an expectation from a number of voters I spoke to that the lines were going to be long the - at today's caucus, that there was going to be, you know, a long wait. But it went really smoothly in terms of checking people in and getting caucusing underway. Some folks that I spoke to in the last couple of days who had done early caucusing, they had actually waited in line for a couple hours. And so I think there may have had almost a reverse effect where people were thinking, you know, I'll go in early, I'll try to get it done quickly, and they may have ended up having to wait longer than some other folks who voted on caucus day. DAVIS: Oh, wow. Well, that's Scott Rodd of state - the state government reporter for CapRadio. Scott, thanks so much for your time. RODD: Thank you. MARTIN: Now we're going to go to Donna West, who is the Democratic Party chair for Clark County. Madam Chair, thank you so much for joining us. DONNA WEST (CHAIR, CLARK COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY): My pleasure. MARTIN: And just to let people know, in 2016, nearly three-quarters of all votes in Nevada came from Clark County. It's home to Las Vegas, where I understand six caucuses were held on the strip, some within the casinos. So how's it going? What are you hearing, Madam Chair? How are things going at the precincts you're overseeing? Any problems, any issues? WEST: You know, we had 10 precincts at Chaparral High School today. We had great volunteers. Wait time was about 25 minutes for people checking in. We had everyone checked in. By 12:15, started our caucuses on time. The feedback from voters was just phenomenally positive, thanking us for the process, had a good time, which is what we want people to do when they come caucus. MARTIN: Talk a little bit more, if you would, about how - what people are telling you? I mean, what are they telling you that's important to them? Just give me just some sense of what you're hearing from people as you go around doing your job. WEST: Well, there's a lot of enthusiasm around the candidates that we have. Obviously, everyone's very concerned about being able to remove Donald Trump from office and not give him a second term. People are concerned about keeping their health care. The changes that have already been made to diminish the ACA have a lot of people concerned. In our state, people are very worried about education, and they're not seeing that the Trump administration is doing anything to help the states improve the quality of their education. They're concerned about minimum wage and, specifically with education, teacher pay. So I think that's driving the enthusiasm. You know, it rained here in Las Vegas today. In fact, that's pouring right now. People don't come out all the time when it rains here because our roads get very slick from the hot conditions that bakes our oil into the streets. It makes it slippy. And so a lot of people stay home. They didn't stay home today. And they certainly turned out with enthusiasm, some waiting at some locations for hours in order to vote. And I think that bodes well for the Democratic Party. We've also registered a high number of new Democrats, people who were nonpartisan voters or Republican voters who are switching parties to participate in the Democratic caucus. MARTIN: Now, how many do you think? WEST: Well, at the site, the early voting site that I worked on Tuesday, we had five Republicans switching parties and more than a dozen independents that came over to register as Democrats and participate in our caucus. They found a candidate that spoke to them that they wanted to vote for, which I think bodes well for us. MARTIN: And you're sure that they're actually voting because they like the candidate, not because they want to cause ruckus. WEST: I don't think anybody was there to cause ruckus. I talked to most of them because I was working the voter registration table most of the day. It's one of my favorite things to do. And, you know, I asked, so why are you here? And some of them said, you know, I voted for Trump in '16. I can't stand what he's doing to the country. He embarrasses us. That's not my party anymore. My party's left me behind. There's a candidate that I like that I want to vote for on the Democratic ticket. And I know I'm not voting for Trump. MARTIN: And can I just ask you to just weigh in on this question that we've been hearing a lot about, this whole question of the Medicare for All versus Medicare for All Who Want It. You know, we were under the impression from the early reporting that this was going to be a big dividing line and that this might be dispositive for some voters. But the early results seem to suggest that perhaps not. What's your take on that? WEST: I think as a party we believe that health care is a human right, and members of the party want everyone to have access to health care. We might disagree on how we get there. But I think there's a good level of trust that if we elect a Democratic president, if we take back the Senate, if we hold the House, we can improve health care so that everybody has the coverage that they need at an affordable rate. And we can work on the details together and work through those issues, where everyone can be happy with the coverage that they have at the price that they are going to be able to get it for. MARTIN: So you're saying the issue - the argument on that or the policy on that as enunciated by any individual candidate, that's not the make-or-break issue. WEST: I don't think so. I think at the bottom line, you know, some candidates are saying that we agree on more than we disagree, and we agree that everyone should have health care. And we agree that it is an abomination that the United States is a country in comparison to everyone else who doesn't have health care coverage for all of its citizens. How we get there - I think that's still open for some discussion. And a lot of it's going to rely on how we do in our senatorial elections, as well as taking back the White House. MARTIN: All right. That is Donna West. She's the Clark County Democratic Party chair. Madam Chair, thanks so much for joining us. WEST: Thanks so much. MARTIN: We're going to go now to Megan Jones, who's a Democratic strategist. She worked for the former Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and she previously advised Senator Kamala Harris' campaign. Megan Jones, thank you so much for joining us as well. MEGAN JONES (DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST): Good afternoon. How are you? MARTIN: Good. So just give me your top-line impressions, if you would. JONES: The top-line impressions are similar to what my friend Donna West just talked about - high enthusiasm in the state of Nevada with record amounts of people registering to vote, as well as first-time caucusgoers. I think about over 50% of caucusgoers were first-time caucusgoers. And I think that points to overall enthusiasm, as Donna West said, in getting the current occupant of the White House out of there. MARTIN: And you've said that Nevada is a make-or-break situation for the former Vice President Joe Biden. What do you make of how he's doing so far? I mean, he's in the - look - we're just getting very early results. JONES: Right. It's stil... MARTIN: I don't want anybody to think that that's dispositive in any way. JONES: Right. MARTIN: But we see him coming in second in what we're seeing so far, but not a very close second. So what do you make of that? JONES: It's clear from the beginning - and I've said this in other places along the way - that Senator Sanders had a phenomenal ground game in Nevada, and it was going to be pretty hard for anybody to catch up with that. But I do think that, as you said, the early vote totals suggest that the vice president is currently in second. But we have a long ways to go before we have the full set of results. I think his campaign is better able to comment on what that means to them and whether or not it gives them enough ammunition to go into South Carolina with a little bit of buzz that he is in second place, if that holds, obviously. MARTIN: And I do want to ask you about the former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg. I mean, is he - what role is he playing in this? I mean, he's not on the ballot in Nevada. JONES: Correct. MARTIN: But he will be in Super Tuesday. And you've heard, like, that, you know, he was on the debate stage, and it was almost in a way sort of a referendum on whether he should have been there at all. Just - what's your take on that? JONES: Well, I think that there is clearly a moderate cluster of candidates that are fighting for their lives come Super Tuesday, and we'll see who has the resources to go into Super Tuesday to compete with Bloomberg. Obviously, he has unlimited funds, and that is a drain for any of these other candidates who are trying to ensure that they have the resources they need to compete for that middle lane. MARTIN: And this whole question of whether - I just wanted to ask you about what I was talking to Donna West about earlier. I mean, sort of the early reporting was that this whole question about - and you've seen the candidates debate this very hard in numerous debates - about what the right strategy is on health care. And yet we saw the Culinary Workers Union - at least the early results suggest that union members are going for Bernie Sanders, even though a lot of them don't particularly like the specifics of his proposal. I mean, what does that tell you? Does it tell you that perhaps we've overstated the case when it comes to the policy differences around how to get to health care? What do you make of that? JONES: I think that's an interesting thing that we should be paying attention to and talking to more voters about. I do think, as my friend Donna West said, that Democrats in general believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege. And, you know, in Nevada, we have some systemic challenges to health care. The culinary union is very lucky - well, not - lucky is the wrong word. They have fought incredibly hard to get the benefits that they have. And I think if you asked the leadership there, they would not want to deny anybody else the right to the kind of health care they have negotiated for their members. So I do think for several culinary members clearly in some of those at-large sites, there were other things on their mind besides the Medicare for All fight that we spend, in my opinion, way too much time on the debate stage talking about when there are so many other issues that are affecting... (LAUGHTER)\r\nMARTIN: Sure. My colleague Danielle Kurtzleben wants to jump in here. JONES: Sure. MARTIN: Yes, and you having said that, of course, let me ask you another question about health care, and it's this... JONES: (Laughter). KURTZLEBEN: It's - I know. Looking at the exit polls, though, in 2016 in Nevada - or the entrance polls - 23% of people said health care is their top issue; this year, 43% of people say it's their top issue. What do you - to what do you owe that jump in people saying, yeah, health care is the thing I'm worried about this time? JONES: 'Cause we talk about it all the time. I mean, that's - it's part of the national... KURTZLEBEN: You think that's what drives... JONES: Well, look - I think it's both. I think it's a combination of both. We talk about it in the national news on - the national narrative is around this health care problem. And Trump has done everything he can since he got into office to roll back benefits for working families when it comes to health care. And it is, as many candidates have said, the number - one of the No. 1 reasons for families being in bankruptcy or in financial stress. And so we have to take care of this health care problem in this country. How we get there, I think people can continue to debate about it. But I do think that the issue in general stems from high costs, low accessibility. And we have to do something about it, and I think that - you know, that voters reflect that opinion. But I don't think that voters care as much about how we get there, to Donna West's point. MARTIN: And Megan, before we let you go, I understand that your former boss, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, is not - has not endorsed. Do you think he will? JONES: I don't know. That's a good question. I don't - up until this point, he's been pretty steadfast to say that he has many friends in the race and doesn't want to do anything to alienate any one of them. So I - we'll see if that changes after the race leaves Nevada. MARTIN: OK. All right. That is Democratic strategist Megan Jones. Megan Jones, thanks so much for talking to us. DAVIS: And you're listening to live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. This is live Special Coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses from NPR News. And I'm joined right now with Washington correspondent for The Nevada Independent, Humberto Sanchez. Humberto, how are you doing? HUMBERTO SANCHEZ (JOURNALIST, THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT): Hey. How's it going? DAVIS: So one thing we know is that the Iowa caucuses did not go smoothly, and Nevada leaders were hoping to learn a lesson from that. How have they tried to approach these caucuses to make sure there is not a repeat of the Iowa situation? SANCHEZ: Well, they scrapped the app, for one, and then they kept changing their plans as they've gone through it. It's been a very difficult process for the campaigns, according to them, about transparency and about how they're going to do this. But they've come up with this software app - or they don't call it an app; the app that's not an app... DAVIS: (Laughter). SANCHEZ: ...To try to do this calculation of how you merge the early vote with the in-person vote. And we're going to see whether that will be a repeat or not here in a few hours. DAVIS: Now, Jon Ralston, the longtime reporter in Nevada, you well - you know him well - has been active on Twitter with the hashtag, we matter, sort of sensitive to the fact that maybe Nevada hasn't been given its due in the top four early primary contest caucuses. How do you feel about that? Does Nevada feel like it needs to take a more prominent role considering the fact that it does look more like the Democratic Party as a whole? SANCHEZ: I think a strong case could be made for that. I think, especially with - I know Nevada is trying to take advantage of the fact that Iowa was such a debacle. And Dina Titus, for example, says, you know, we should be first; we want to be first and - because of the diversity in the state. And so we'll see how that goes going forward, and we'll also see how they can handle tonight. DAVIS: One of those voices is former Senate Leader Harry Reid, who suggested that maybe Nevada should be the first caucus. Do you think that - is that just talk? I mean, is there seriously an effort inside the party to try and push Nevada to the front of the line? SANCHEZ: I think we'll see how that develops. I think that there are a lot of people, Harry Reid in particular, who wants to see, and it's because of Harry Reid that we have the caucus so early as it is now. But I think that there could be a push, especially if this turns out to be success tonight for Nevada. DAVIS: Nevada, obviously, also a place that has Latino voters, voters we haven't really had a chance to hear from yet in the race. And it looks like - and again, caveat; it's still early in the evening - but that there has been a swell of support towards Bernie Sanders. Step back for a minute talk about what the significance of a Nevada win is for the Sanders campaign. SANCHEZ: It would be huge. I mean, he's going into South Carolina. This is the first state where there is a diverse electorate, and he picks up a lot of Latino votes. He picks up African American votes, Asian-Pacific Islander votes. Going into South Carolina, he gets the momentum, and that really sets him up for Super Tuesday, which is the big enchilada, for lack of a better term. And Super Tuesday is really going to be the deciding factor here. And it already looks like he could amass an insurmountable lead against the other candidates here. So it's going to be big if he wins Nevada. DAVIS: And a telling sign that Bernie Sanders is already in Texas this evening, another state with a lot of Latino voters. That is Washington correspondent for The Nevada Independent, Humberto Sanchez. Humberto, thank you so much. SANCHEZ: Thanks, Sue.

With his new book of poetry about race in America, Morning Edition poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander hopes to \"shine a little light for the world.\" In the book, Light For The World To See: A Thousand Words On Race And Hope, Alexander writes three poems on three events: the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protests before NFL games, and the election of Barack Obama as president. \"I think that through the listening of a poem or the reading of a poem about the woes of the world \u2014 and we've got a lot of woes right now \u2014 we can be inspired to find the wonderful in ourselves and in each other,\" he tells NPR. [You can hear Alexander read the poem \"The Undefeated\" from the book in the audio version of the interview or watch a video of the poem here. He also created a community poem, \"Running For Your Life,\" based on submissions to NPR about what it means to be Black and safe in America today that you can read here.] On why he wrote this book of poems I think the weight of being Black was too much to carry for me for a long time. I didn't know how to find answers to assert myself to do something. And then a friend of mine sent me a quote by Toni Morrison that said this is precisely the time when artists go to work. There's no time for despair. No place for self pity. No need for silence. No room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language, that is how civilizations heal. And so I wrote. I used my words to scream, to shout, to sort of lift up my voice to shine a little light for the world. I wanted to write this as a reminder to Black children and families to remember their humanity. I wanted to write it as sort of a wake-up call to white Americans to acknowledge and know the truth, to fight against a proclivity to maintain the hierarchy, whether conscious or not. I think of these poems as sort of negro spirituals in a way \u2014 which are timeless in their comfort and their guidance and their roots in praise houses and ring shouts and other informal gatherings of enslaved Africans who needed to express their sorrows and their hopes, wading in the water. Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Steal away to Jesus. That's what these poems are for me. They are psalms and balms for my soul and hopefully for our souls so that we can get on with the business of making the world a better place. On the parallels he sees in James Baldwin's A Report From Occupied Territory, an essay written in 1966 about police brutality, and what the nation is going through today \u2014 and on his own writing in this trandition I think [it's] in the sense that Baldwin was crying out. It was a plea for our humanity, for the humanity of Black people in particular, of oppressed people in general, to be recognized. I don't know if I'm writing a plea more so that I'm making a demand and that I'm saying we've got to reclaim our own humanity and cannot allow ourselves to be defined by other people. The wound, the wound has been here. The wound has been here since Africans first arrived on these shores. These episodes of police killings and brutality \u2014 they've existed for 400 years. I wrote this to remind us of the tragedy, Rachel, while also showcasing the triumph. The only way for us to do things better in the future is to understand what we did wrong in the past. I do think that we are at a critical boiling point of resistance in America and you see whites and Blacks and all Americans coming together to stand up for what's right. We've got to all say that we are fired up and we can't take no more and I think that's what's happening. Milton Guevara and Reena Advani produced and edited the audio story.

Obama's new memoir is A Promised Land.\n\n                    \n                    Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Barack Obama speaks at a Biden-Harris drive-in rally in Miami on Oct. 24. In his first interview with Terry Gross, Obama talks about what he misses most about being president and reflects on the turmoil of the Trump White House. Obama's new memoir is A Promised Land. Former President Barack Obama still has faith in the American system. Even as his successor, Donald Trump, refuses to acknowledge defeat in the recent presidential election, Obama maintains: \"I don't believe democracy's broken.\" \"We just had record turnout,\" Obama says of the election. \"Despite what the president is saying, you're seeing state officials run an orderly process, and even Republican officials who are responsible for counting votes [are] doing so in a way that reflects their integrity.\" But, Obama adds, \"There is no doubt that [democracy's] been strained.\" Though Obama sees Trump as a major source of that strain, he notes that the problem is larger than one man: \"What I was surprised by over the last four years is the complicity of other Republican elected officials and their unwillingness to call [Trump out] when he was breaking norms or straining some of our democratic institutions.\" Obama reflects on his own journey to the Oval Office and the first four years of his presidency in the new memoir, A Promised Land. Though he sometimes misses the camaraderie and policy work of his White House years, he says the founders were wise to limit presidents to two terms. \"It is a healthy aspect of our democracy that you get eight years, at most, and then it's time for some fresh legs,\" he says. Obama likens the presidency to a relay race: \"You get the baton. You run your race, then you hand off the baton and all you have control over is that portion of the race that you run. And I could say unequivocally that the country was much better off by the time I finished my race than when I started.\" A Promised Land by Barack Obama\n                \n                    \n                    Crown\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Promised Land by Barack Obama On the safeguards his administration had in place for a pandemic that the Trump administration ignored We had set up a pandemic preparedness task force inside the White House, which involved various agencies, and they would do regular tabletop exercises to figure out how we're going to respond. We put together a pandemic playbook, which we actually gave to the incoming Trump administration, indicating here are the steps that you need to take, and if, in fact, this ends up being an airborne virus that is highly contagious, then, you know, the steps that are going to need to be taken in advance of any development of a vaccine, or any other kind of medical intervention, is wearing masks, social distancing, so forth and so on. We had, around the world, set up a global security program in cooperation with other countries, so that when we saw a virus initially emerge, we'd have an early warning system. A number of the individuals we had assigned and [who] were in China had been pulled back, and the Trump administration had eliminated the task force that we had inside the White House, and apparently never read the playbook. ... Any president would have had trouble with this pandemic. It is more virulent, more dangerous, more contagious than anything we've seen since the Spanish flu back in 1918. Even countries that have managed it well have still seen significant outbreaks. But Canada's a pretty good example of what [an] administration or a government that is following the science and the recommendations of epidemiologists can accomplish. Canada's death rate per capita is about 39% of what ours is \u2014 and that is tens of thousands of people who would not be dead if we had been as effective as Canada was in dealing with this disease. On how it feels seeing some of his accomplishments undone by the Trump administration You understand that in a democracy, some of the steps you take can be undone. ... You work out a little harder in the morning, you hit that treadmill a little tougher. Look, one of the things that is a strength of mine \u2014 I think sometimes maybe people consider it a weakness, because it frustrates them to see me not get more frustrated \u2014 is I tend to take the long view on things. And I try to remind myself that history does not just go forward. It goes sideways. It goes backwards sometimes. The path of progress is bumpy and there are going to be setbacks. I try to remind myself that history does not just go forward. It goes sideways. It goes backwards sometimes. The path of progress is bumpy and there are going to be setbacks. Barack Obama Look, the Civil War and the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments were followed by Jim Crow and the Klan and lynching. And that was horrific and heartbreaking. That didn't negate the importance of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. It just meant that you got this far along this trek up the mountain and you made base, and then bad weather comes in and you have to retreat a little bit and some bad stuff happens, but you keep on trying. And I think that's how I ended up feeling about what I got done during the presidency. I felt that we had advanced the causes that I care deeply about and that mattered to the American people. Not all of them were going to stick exactly the way I wanted. That didn't negate the importance of pushing to try to get that stuff done. Even in those areas where Donald Trump completely reversed course, the fact [is] that we set a baseline \u2014 for example, that universal health care is something that the American people should expect \u2014 that changes the conversation going forward in ways that then the next bunch of climbers can build upon. At least that's what I tell myself. Now, look, do I occasionally curse when I'm reading the headlines over the last four years? Yes, I do. Have I had some venting or ranting on occasion with Michelle over the dinner table? Absolutely. On the racist conspiracy perpetuated by the media (and Donald Trump) that he was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to be president \u2014 and when he started to have to take it seriously It seemed silly at first. It seemed silly in the middle and it seems silly at the end. But despite initially treating it as a bad joke, what I was forced to acknowledge was that it was consuming time and energy and bandwidth on my staff and that, ultimately, I ended up having to address it directly in the White House briefing room just to get it to stop so that we could get on with the business of discussing budgets and the Afghan war and other important issues. ... It wasn't just the Fox Newses of the world or the Rush Limbaughs of the world that were amplifying this baseless and, ultimately, racist claim. It was mainstream media. I mean, some of the same folks who are very critical now of Donald Trump and have been critical throughout his presidency regularly had him on their show because he boosted ratings and they thought, \"Well, this is a spectacle that attracts eyeballs.\" And that was frustrating to me. And it gave me a sense of the danger of, in this mass media environment, if somebody is willing and able to just consistently repeat a falsehood, particularly one that taps into maybe pre-existing anxieties that certain segments of the American people feel, then it can end up getting traction \u2014 and the Internet has made it even worse. ... I think [former Breitbart chief and Trump adviser] Steve Bannon explicitly said we're just going to fill up the information pipeline with excrement and it'll get very cloudy. It doesn't really matter whether ultimately what we're saying is disproven, it creates confusion and uncertainty in the minds of voters, and that's enough for our purposes of getting power. On his decision, as president, to not watch news coverage and not see how he was being portrayed in the media Obama runs down a corridor with Bo, the family dog.\n                \n                    \n                    The White House/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Obama runs down a corridor with Bo, the family dog. For my own mental health, and I advised my family members to follow this same practice, I just didn't watch broadcast news of any sort or cable news of any sort. Very rarely did I watch it. ... [\"In the barrel\"] was a phrase we used to use when the media narrative turned south and you are tumbling over the falls, in the sense that all the news is bad. You can't get out of this cycle of people thinking that you're inept, that you're politically wounded, that your allies stop defending you quite as much, your enemies sense blood in the water. And what happens is that visually, the pictures that accompany the stories that are told about you on television start changing. ... Television is a visual medium more than anything else. So suddenly I noticed that in all the pictures that are being used of me, I look really old and somber and I'm more alone, whereas when things were going good, I'm smiling and I'm hugging babies and dogs running around and life looks good, birds are chirping over my head. Probably there was a little bit of a disadvantage for me in not following as carefully what was going on on television. There would be moments during my presidency where there would be something I thought we were handling well and yet my press secretaries or communications folks would have to come and say, \"Listen, this is a problem.\" And I'd say, \"Well, why? I don't understand. Actually, we're doing everything we're supposed to do.\" And they were tracking how the media environment was telling the story. And I wasn't always as attuned to that as I probably would have been if I was a more regular television watcher. On his temperament and if felt like he had to be cautious with his words or deeds because he's a Black man There's a famous story about why Jackie Robinson was chosen by Branch Rickey to be the first Black Major League ballplayer \u2014 and it wasn't just because he was an outstanding baseball player. It was also because Rickey felt that Jackie Robinson had the temperament to keep his cool. And there was probably some element in how I operated that just has to do with my temperament. I'm not somebody who's quick to rise or gets too low. Some of that probably has to do with having been born in Hawaii. You don't have a lot of reason to complain if it's 80 degrees and sunny, the beach is close by. Part of it I attribute to my grandmother, who is a major character in this book and was a plainspoken, no-nonsense woman from Kansas who embodied, I think, a lot of that Midwestern stoicism and not fussing about stuff. And that's part of who I am. Obama and Rep. John Lewis walk across across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches in Selma, Ala.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Obama and Rep. John Lewis walk across across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches in Selma, Ala. But part of it was, no doubt, a recognition that as a first \u2014 in this case, the first [Black] leader of the free world \u2014 that I had to get things right and that I had to make sure that when I spoke, I was reacting not out of emotion, but out of clear convictions and principles, and that I was embodying the kind of responsible leadership that I had promised. And that's probably why I write in the preface that there might have been times where I tamped down on what I was feeling in the moment, in ways that, by the end of my presidency, I was less prone to do. I think this was partly a problem of the first couple of years, where I was much more embracing of a certain way of being president. And, by the end of my presidency, I was like, \"Look, I've been to this rodeo many times. I'm going to say whatever I think about certain things.\" Now, I think that going to the point of race, it wasn't as if there weren't reasons for me occasionally to bite my tongue. There was evidence, in fact, that when I did speak my mind, that there was always a price to pay. On needing Secret Service detail while he was a candidate for president because of the volume of death threats against him Once I'm president, then that's sort of par for the course. I think what was different was that I got Secret Service protection about two or three months into my candidacy. I was still a year and a half away from being president, and that does not normally happen. And it was because the volume of threats directed against me ... was several factors higher than anybody else, than anything Secret Service had ever seen. It's in the back of your mind when you make the decision to run. And in fact ... one of the recurring conversations we'd have in the African American community when I decided to run was people expressing fear either to me or Michelle about the potential danger to us. There were a lot of Black folks who were pretty sure that America's not going to have a Black person as president. Look, they had seen Martin Luther King shot. They had seen Malcolm X shot. It's not as if there is not some history of violence directed at African American leaders. So I think there was a real sense of wanting to protect us. Once you decide to run, though, you can't be carrying that around with you in your head at all times. And I was very grateful, and continue to be, for the incredible job that Secret Service did. Once Secret Service was around, I had confidence that they knew what they were doing and it wasn't something that I thought about on a day-to-day basis. On what went through his mind when he saw the police attack Black Lives Matter protesters in Washington I was outraged, and it was an example of a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes America great and special and important and exceptional, and that is our ability to uphold ideals like freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, not just as empty words, but in practice. Barack Obama I was outraged, and it was an example of a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes America great and special and important and exceptional, and that is our ability to uphold ideals like freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, not just as empty words, but in practice. And that the president of the United States has sworn to uphold the Constitution and the various officers in government that are sworn to uphold the Constitution, that they abide by those ideals and values, even when it's not politically convenient for you to do so. Even when you think it's wrongheaded. And I think one of the most worrying things I saw during the course of this presidency were efforts \u2014 ultimately, I think, unsuccessful \u2014 to politicize our military, to politicize our criminal justice system. And the effort, I think, in this administration to rupture that core tradition that is vital to any democracy, I think, was one of the more troubling things that I saw. On why he titled his book A Promised Land after the African American spiritual Dr. King has a very famous speech where he talks about Exodus and Moses getting to the mountaintop and he can see in the distance that promised land, but he never gets there. And the Israelites wander for 40 years in the wilderness. And Exodus has always been central to the African American experience, naturally, given the bondage that they were experiencing, this idea that somehow, some way, we're going to get there. And that's how I think about America, not just for the African American experience, but for the country as a whole. That there is this extraordinary promise, this possibility of a more perfect union and each generation does its part to travel a little further down that road, to get a little bit closer, and inevitably we're going to fall short and there's still going to be racism and there's still going to be gender discrimination and inequality and suffering and pain that's unnecessary. But if we embrace the journey, if we embrace the possibility that we can better see each other as having common fears and common dreams and being one people, that we can get a little closer to that promised land.

President Trump has been unapologetic about taking such actions. And some Democrats think that should be President-elect Joe Biden's approach. President-elect Joe Biden won the presidency in large part because he promised to be the anti-Trump on policy, temperament, tone and just about everything else. But two men who helped run the Obama White House are urging him to follow President Trump's example in a specific way: by unapologetically leaning on executive actions to implement key policies. The advice from former Obama chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel and Denis McDonough comes as Biden prepares to enter office with an agenda potentially stalled by a closely divided Congress \u2014 a much smaller House majority than expected and a 50-50 Senate, at best. \"There is \u2014 as President Trump himself has demonstrated with the consent, quite obvious consent of Republicans in Congress \u2014 an enormous amount of leeway for the president to institute executive action on things like immigration and energy and climate policy,\" said McDonough, who served as chief of staff for much of President Barack Obama's second term. Obama himself signed many high-profile executive orders and pushed for broad administrative rules changes on environment, education, immigration and labor policies. But unlike Trump, most of Obama's high-profile orders came once his party lost its majorities in Congress and major legislation was no longer an option. \"Trump changes that, and moves aggressively on executive orders \u2014 a multitude of them on multiple fronts,\" said Emanuel, Obama's first chief of staff. \"Everything on immigration, etc., without any legislation.\" Many orders are already in the works. Speaking to MSNBC on Thursday, incoming Biden chief of staff Ron Klain promised a \"sack\" of executive orders Biden will sign on his first day in the Oval Office. Many of those actions will amount to a redoing of Obama administration policies that Trump has spent four years undoing: \"Protecting the DREAMers, for example, starting on Day 1,\" Klain said, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Trump tried to end. \"Rejoining the Paris accords for climate change starting on Day 1, reversing some of the environmental rollbacks we've seen from President Trump.\" Large swaths of Biden's pandemic response will involve executive actions, too, including tapping the Defense Production Act to manufacture more personal protective equipment and setting up a World War II-inspired \"Pandemic Testing Board\" to coordinate and speed up test distribution across the country. But the sweeping, New Deal-style agenda Biden promised was premised on the idea of winning control of the Senate, in addition to keeping the big majority that House Democrats won in 2018. That's not the landscape Biden will face in January. Still, McDonough, Emanuel and other Democrats are confident Biden can deliver many of the same results through the executive branch. \"There's no reason that President-elect Biden should not use the authority that's available to him,\" said McDonough, who's now a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Keough School of Global Affairs. Neither man is arguing Biden should ignore the legislative branch where he served as a senator for decades. McDonough said, \"There are certain things you just have to do with Congress.\" Biden himself talked frequently during the campaign about his experience working across the aisle and the need for bipartisan cooperation. In his post-election speeches, he has repeatedly called for an end to gridlock and constant partisan warfare. But Emanuel, who ran the White House during Obama's window of large legislative majorities, knows perhaps more than anyone that political capital can be limited. So, he argued that Biden should pack as much as possible into executive orders. \"The fewer things you have to clog up the legislative pipeline with allows you to concentrate your political capital in that legislative front,\" he said. The climate agenda Biden has made it clear he'll make climate change a top priority. At first glance, his much-discussed $2 trillion plan to wean the economy off fossil fuel and onto clean energy seems dead on arrival if there is a Republican Senate, but Jamal Raad, the co-founder of climate advocacy group Evergreen Action, has flagged more than 40 broad executive actions in the climate policies the Biden campaign has already laid out. \"You don't have to speculate\" on what a Biden climate agenda looks like in divided government, he argued: \"His plans were littered with pretty significant executive actions on the climate crisis.\" A Biden administration can impose new energy efficiency rules on buildings, appliances and machinery, it can limit new leases for oil and natural gas drilling on federal property, and it can factor climate impacts into scores of regulatory actions across a broad range of agencies. Raad pointed to vehicle emissions standards as one enormous area of executive influence. \"The executive has incredibly authority over mileage standards for cars and trucks,\" he said. \"Ramping up production of electric vehicles is an incredible opportunity to lower carbon emissions.\" Most importantly, a Biden administration could use existing Clean Air Act authority to write new rules to force power plants to shift to renewable energy. Of course, the Obama administration tried to do that, and the Supreme Court blocked the regulations from going into effect before Trump overturned it. The judiciary has gotten much more conservative over the past four years. But McDonough, who lived through all those court fights, still thinks it's possible to advance a Biden agenda with executive actions. \"I think they should be careful in how they put together their plans. They should be discerning in how they structure their plans and make sure it's based in the authorities that are squarely in the president's bailiwick,\" he advised. Still, even if those orders aren't struck down by the courts, the past four years made it very clear that they could always be undone by the next president.

Though he has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones, casting his vote with liberals for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes. Indeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law by a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different. That's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by President Trump, allowing conservatives to have a 6-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others. At the center of this battle will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took the unprecedented step of refusing for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, a widely respected centrist liberal whom Republicans had previously praised as the kind of nominee they would like from a Democratic president. Back then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of Supreme Court justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. In a statement Friday, McConnell said Trump's nominee to fill the vacancy left by Ginsburg's death would receive a vote on the Senate floor. \"In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia's death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president's second term. We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president's Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year,\" McConnell said in a written statement. \"By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.\" It's unclear of the timing of the vote, and the traditional nomination process takes longer than the amount of days left before the November election. McConnell's tactics have worked well for the GOP in the past, firing up the Republican base, and proving a major factor in Trump's 2016 election. With a Republican in the White House, McConnell then stripped from the Senate rule book just about every procedural rule that allowed the minority party to slow down controversial nominees. So what happens in the coming months will be bare-knuckles politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. For some Republicans facing reelection, Ginsburg's death puts them between the proverbial rock and a hard place. A vote to confirm another Trump nominee could, for instance, doom the reelection prospects of Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. But a vote against confirmation could infuriate conservative Republicans in their states, depressing both campaign contributions and turnout for them. But even if both were to vote against confirmation, a huge assumption since they have never voted against a Republican Supreme Court nominee, the Democrats would still need  two more Republican votes. They might get Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, but they would still be one vote shy because of Vice President Pence's tie-breaking vote. It's hard to see where that extra vote would come from. Tennessee's Lamar Alexander is the most moderate of the retiring Republican senators, but he is McConnell's closest friend in the U.S. Senate. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did \u2014 until age 90. \"My dream,\" she said in an interview, \"is that I will stay on the court as long as he did.\"",

Follow NPR's coverage of Ginsburg's death and the political aftermath here. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died Friday. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas. The court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., surrounded by family. She was 87. \"Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\" Architect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign. Just days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\" She knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases. Though Roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes. Upcoming political battle Indeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different. That's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by President Trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others. At the center of the battle to achieve that will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: He refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Back then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. Instead he will try immediately to push through a Trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill Ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if Trump were to lose his reelection bid. Asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, McConnell said: \"Oh, we'd fill it.\" So what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did \u2014 until age 90. \"My dream is that I will stay on the court as long as he did,\" she said in an interview in 2019. \"Tough as nails\" 1 of 9 She didn't quite make it. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nonetheless a historic figure. She changed the way the world is for American women. For more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. When she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. Hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. By the time she donned judicial robes, however, Ginsburg had worked a revolution. That was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the Virginia Military Institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. True, Ginsburg said, most women \u2014 indeed most men \u2014 would not want to meet the rigorous demands of VMI. But the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands. \"Reliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,\" Ginsburg wrote. She was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was \"tough as nails.\" By the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. She was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her \"Notorious RBG\" moniker, a Time magazine cover and regular Saturday Night Live sketches. On one occasion in 2016, Ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate Trump. But for the most part Ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself. Asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 State of the Union address, Ginsburg did not take the Fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. The result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely \"sober judge\" and kept nodding off. The road to law Born in Brooklyn, Ruth Bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student \u2014 and as a baton twirler. By all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but Celia Bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school. Then 17, Ruth Bader went on to Cornell University on a full scholarship, where she met Martin (aka \"Marty\") Ginsburg. \"What made Marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that I had a brain,\" she said. After her graduation, they were married and went off to Fort Sill, Okla., for his military service. There Mrs. Ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job. Two years later, the couple returned to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. She was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that \"should go to a man.\" At Harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. The couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when Marty Ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Surgeries and aggressive radiation followed. \"So that left Ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me,\" Marty Ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with NPR. The experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. During the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. At about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled in an NPR interview. \"Then I'd take out the books and start reading what I needed to be prepared for classes the next day.\" Marty Ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in New York; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. Despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a Supreme Court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed. It was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her \"familial obligations.\" A mentor, law professor Gerald Gunther, finally got her a clerkship in New York by promising Judge Edmund Palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. That was \"the carrot,\" Ginsburg would say later. \"The stick\" was that Gunther, who regularly fed his best students to Palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take Ginsburg, Gunther would never send him a clerk again. The Ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; Palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61. Ginsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. She learned Swedish so she could work with Anders Bruzelius, a Swedish civil procedure scholar. Through the Columbia University School of Law Project on International Procedure, Ginsburg and Bruzelius co-authored a book. In 1963, Ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at Rutgers Law School, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. The ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born. While at Rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination. The \"mother brief\" Her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a Colorado man named Charles Moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. The IRS said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. But Moritz had never married. The tax court concluded that the Internal Revenue Code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer Marty Ginsburg viewed as \"preposterous.\" The two Ginsburgs took on the case \u2014 he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional one. According to Marty Ginsburg, for his wife, this was the \"mother brief.\" She had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. The solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. She won in the lower courts. \"Amazingly,\" he recalled in a 1993 NPR interview, the government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the decision \"cast a cloud of unconstitutionality\" over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with Defense Department computers. Those laws, Marty Ginsburg added, \"were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.\" In 1971, she would write her first Supreme Court brief in the case of Reed v. Reed. Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented Sally Reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband. The constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. The answer from the all-male Supreme Court: no. It was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender. And that was just the beginning. Ginsburg (left) joins the only three other women to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 in a celebration of O'Connor, the first woman justice, at the Newseum in Washington in 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ginsburg (left) joins the only three other women to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 in a celebration of O'Connor, the first woman justice, at the Newseum in Washington in 2012. By then Ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. She would become the first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School, and she would found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. As the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, Ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning. Knowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked Social Security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. For example, in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. The husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing Social Security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits. \"This absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children,\" Ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. The Supreme Court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued. Over the years, Ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well. In an interview with NPR, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the Supreme Court. \"The words of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause \u2014 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' Well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. And the Supreme Court woke up to that reality in 1971,\" Ginsburg said. During these pioneering years, Ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. But by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble. The scrapes were hardly major, and Ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. Finally, there came a day when she had had enough. \"I had stayed up all night the night before, and I said to the principal, 'This child has two parents. Please alternate calls.' \" After that, she found, the calls were few and far between. It seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about. The Supreme Court's second woman In 1980, President Jimmy Carter named Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Over the next 13 years, she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal, and in 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court, the second woman appointed to the position. She was not first on his list. For months, Clinton flirted with other potential nominees, and some women's rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about Ginsburg's views on abortion. She had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in Roe v. Wade. But in the background, Marty Ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife. And finally Ruth Ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president. As one White House official put it afterward, Clinton \"fell for her \u2014 hook, line and sinker.\" So did the Senate. She was confirmed by a 96-3 vote. Once on the court, Ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes. Though she looked tiny and frail, she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing. At home, it was her husband who was the chef, indeed a master chef, while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook. Though a liberal, she and the court's conservative icon, Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, were the closest of friends. Indeed, an opera called Scalia/Ginsburg is based on their legal disagreements, and their affection for each other. Ginsburg speaks at a memorial service for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in March 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Over the years, as Ginsburg's place on the court grew in seniority, so did her role. In 2006, as the court veered right after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively, her most passionate dissents coming in women's rights cases. Dissenting in Ledbetter v. Goodyear in 2007, she called on Congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination. The resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after Obama took office. In 2014, she dissented fiercely in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a decision that allowed some for-profit companies to refuse, on religious grounds, to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans. Such an exemption, she said, would \"deny legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs, access to contraceptive coverage.\" Where, she asked, \"is the stopping point?\" Suppose it offends an employer's religious belief \"to pay the minimum wage\" or \"to accord women equal pay?\" And in 2013, when the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed, Ginsburg dissented. She said that throwing out the provision \"when it has worked and is continuing to work ... is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\" She viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court. \"Some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions,\" Ginsburg told NPR. \"I will not live to see what becomes of them, but I remain hopeful.\" And yet, Ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases. In 2015, for example, she authored the court's decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines. Ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad, even after five bouts with cancer: colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer 10 years later, lung cancer in 2018, and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020. During that time, she endured chemotherapy, radiation and, in the last years of her life, terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely. All who knew her admired her grit. In 2009, three weeks after major cancer surgery, she surprised everyone when she showed up for the State of the Union address. Shortly after that, she was back on the bench; it was her husband, Marty, who told her she could do it, even when she thought she could not, she told NPR. A year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill. As she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die, she found a note he had written to her. \"My Dearest Ruth,\" it began, \"You are the only person I have ever loved,\" setting aside children and family. \"I have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at Cornell. ... The time has come for me to ... take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms. I hope you will support where I come out, but I understand you may not. I will not love you a jot less.\" Shortly after that, Marty Ginsburg died at home. The next day, his wife, the justice, was on the bench, reading an important opinion she had authored for the court. She was there, she said, because \"Marty would have wanted it.\" Years later, she would read the letter aloud in an NPR interview, and at the end, choke down the tears. In the years after Marty's death, she would persevere without him, maintaining a jam-packed schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions. Some liberals criticized her for not retiring while Obama was president, but she was at the top of her game, enjoyed her work enormously and feared that Republicans might not confirm a successor. She was an avid consumer of opera, literature and modern art. But in the end, it was her work, she said, that sustained her. \"I do think that I was born under a very bright star,\" she said in an NPR interview. \"Because if you think about my life, I get out of law school. I have top grades. No law firm in the city of New York will hire me. I end up teaching; it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men.\" And it was that legal crusade for women's rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. To the end of her tenure, she remained a special kind of feminist, both decorous and dogged.",

A central promise of last week's Republican National Convention was a pledge that President Trump would use a second term to build on elements of his first term, with very few updates and changes. The four days of convention programming showed a Republican Party whose policies are bound to Trump. But GOP divisions over many of those policies prevented much of the 2016 Trump agenda from ever becoming law. And that dynamic was in place well before the coronavirus pandemic changed politics. \"This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together,\" Trump said on the final night of the convention in a speech that included sharp attacks on Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee. \"So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country.\" Republicans started their convention by readopting the same platform that propelled Trump to the White House in 2016. That platform included familiar goals of reforming immigration policy, building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, balancing the budget by 2026 and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Longtime Trump backers like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan say that's what voters want. \"The American people appreciate the fact that he's done what he said,\" Jordan said in an interview. \"You go down the list: cut taxes, reduce regulations, lowest unemployment in 50 years prior to the virus.\" Aside from the tax cuts and the updated North American Free Trade Agreement, the majority of the policies Trump now touts were done through executive actions, without agreement from Congress. Republicans controlled Congress and the White House for Trump's first two years in office. During that time, the Republican Party was at an impasse on most major issues, like spending, immigration, infrastructure and health care. But Jordan says a lot of those future plans would be made possible with the return of that full GOP control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. \"I feel like he is going to win,\" Jordan said. \"And then I think the real question is, can we take back the House? But the chances of the Republicans winning the House are slim. And Trump's convention speech \u2014 as well as the message from the four-day event \u2014 did not focus much on Congress, the House, the Senate or the partnership needed to implement the broad agenda. One area that Jordan and other Republicans want to tackle is cutting spending. But budget experts say that's a longtime GOP goal that candidate Trump embraced \u2014 and then largely ignored in office. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a longtime adviser to Republican leaders in the Senate, said the debt and deficit have ballooned under Trump. \"It's kind of perverse that they've even adopted the 2016 platform as the basis for going forward,\" Hoagland said. \"It is terribly inconsistent. But more importantly, on the issues that I'm concerned about from a fiscal perspective, it's somewhat hypocritical.\" The deficit grew from $585 billion in 2016 to nearly a trillion at the end of 2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That spike is due in large part to policies that Trump enacted before the pandemic, like agreeing to spending increases in negotiations with Democrats and enacting the Republican-led tax cuts in 2017. And that was before the coronavirus devastated the economy. Hoagland said he expects the U.S. may have a deficit as high as $4 trillion next year. \"My sense here is that there's a little bit of buyer's remorse that's starting to set in with some of the Republicans,\" Hoagland said. \"And I would like them to get serious about how they're going to address the increasing debt of this country.\" But Republicans showed little political will to cut spending, even before the crisis. When it came to spending priorities, Trump was often forced to negotiate with Democrats to marshal enough votes to keep the government funded and avert a shutdown. Another promise Trump made during the convention is to continue a hard line on immigration. Immigration advocates like Daniel Garza, executive director of the Koch network group Libre Initiative, are holding out hope for remaking immigration policy in a second Trump term. \"The fixed position of the Republican Party is that they want immigration reform that comes with strong security, and the fixed position of the Democratic Party is that they want a clean DACA bill,\" Garza said. \"I think there is room for negotiation. But it's going to take, I think, leadership.\" Garza said he wants to see the two parties work together on legal immigration in a way that addresses the problem holistically \u2014 even if it isn't through a sweeping immigration bill that has been proposed in the past. But Republicans are deeply split on what that kind of reform should involve. Bipartisan immigration talks have repeatedly crumbled in Washington, and a GOP-led effort, as well as various attempts by the White House to float new proposals, has failed to gain support from a majority of Republicans. The issue has become more complicated in recent months as Trump has defied court orders to accept new applicants to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and many congressional Republicans are opposed to reopening that debate. Former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo says if Trump is reelected, congressional Republicans must build their own policy goals. \"If Donald Trump is in office, it becomes or it will remain more difficult to do that,\" Curbelo said in an interview. \"Even with united government, when there was general agreement, it was difficult. Now with divided Congress and this president, it's pretty much almost impossible to advance major legislation.\" Curbelo was a Trump critic before he lost his Miami-area seat in 2018. He and Hoagland both say that some of the division within the Republican Party is the direct result of Trump's influence and the departure, either by retirement or through electoral losses, of moderate Republicans interested in cutting deals. The former Florida congressman says Republicans will have to change if they want to survive in an era after Trump. That involves getting proactive about policies like immigration reform and climate change, which Curbelo says appeal to a younger, broader electorate that may lean more libertarian in their thinking. \"If Republicans want to capture enough of those voters to be a majority party, they have to change,\" Curbelo said. \"They have to grow. They have to evolve.\"",

            "article_content": "Robert Mueller (left) \"gave the president a free pass effectively on the fact that he repeatedly committed obstruction of justice,\" legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb, Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Robert Mueller (left) \"gave the president a free pass effectively on the fact that he repeatedly committed obstruction of justice,\" legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says. Six months after the conclusion of President Trump's impeachment, CNN legal analyst and New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin says special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was fundamentally flawed. \"The tragedy of the Mueller investigation is they did this brilliant investigation proving that Donald Trump repeatedly obstructed justice \u2014 far worse than Richard Nixon did in Watergate, far worse than Bill Clinton did in the Lewinsky matter,\" Toobin argues. \"But then he doesn't finish the job and say what is obvious.\" Toobin says that Mueller's decision to conclude his report without explicitly stating that the president had obstructed of justice left the door open for Trump to claim he had done nothing wrong \u2014 despite evidence to the contrary. \"When he told the FBI director not to investigate Michael Flynn, when he tried to get his White House counsel to fire Mueller, when he told his White House counsel to lie about whether he tried to get him to fire Mueller \u2014 all of that was egregious obstruction of justice,\" he says. Toobin's new book, True Crimes and Misdemeanors, looks at how Trump survived the Mueller investigation and impeachment. He says the conclusion of Mueller's report was driven by the Justice Department policy of not indicting a sitting president. \"It's all laid out in the Mueller report,\" Toobin says. \"But then ... Mueller pulled this punch ultimately. And it gave the president a free pass effectively on the fact that he repeatedly committed obstruction of justice.\" Mueller's report said that while it did not find that Trump had committed a crime, \"it also does not exonerate him.\" Attorney General William Barr concluded in March 2019 that Mueller's findings were \"not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\" Barr said Justice Department leaders made that decision without regard to the considerations of indicting a sitting president. On why it was important to interview Trump face-to-face \u2014 which Mueller didn't do Trump was the protagonist of this entire affair. He's also a pathological liar, and he is someone whose perspective, if you want to call it that, was indispensable to resolving what really went on here, what Trump was thinking, what his intent was in a legal sense. So the failure to have his voice in the Mueller report and in Mueller's determinations about what to do with the information he gathered left, I thought, a massive hole in the investigation. ... The written questions were basically a joke. They were essentially written by the lawyers, and lawyers, doing what lawyers do, answered the questions in such ways that they could not be proven false. So there were an abundance of \"I don't knows\" and \"I don't remembers\" and \"I can't recalls.\" And the lawyers also had matched up the questions to the record of emails, of visits, so that Trump couldn't be contradicted with actual known facts. So the written questions were practically useless. What would have been different in oral questions is that Trump would have done what he always does, which is lie extravagantly. Trump can't help himself. That's how he behaves. His narcissism and his incredible dishonesty when it comes to anything related to things of importance to him would have come through. And that's an indispensable part of this story, and we know that because so much of what he said publicly about the Russia matter and later the Ukraine matter was so obviously false. On how Trump's team turned Mueller into a political opponent In the original defense team, led from inside the White House by Ty Cobb, who was a White House lawyer, and John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, there was an attitude of cooperation with Mueller, and even more so, there was Trump's relative silence about Mueller. People forget that, that ... from May of 2017 to March of 2018, Trump didn't attack Mueller. But [Rudy] Giuliani's insight was once he took over in the spring of 2018, was to turn Mueller into just another political opponent. And Trump joined in that effort. ... Trump and Giuliani went after Mueller as if he were another Democrat in Congress, and that energized Trump. It energized his base and it gave him the political confidence to know that this investigation was never going to end up with his departure from office. Because the only way presidents get forced out of office \u2014 and this is a lesson from Clinton's failed impeachment \u2014 is if it's a bipartisan enterprise. Nixon was forced out of office when the Republicans turned on him in 1974. Trump knew once he had mobilized his base and the Republican Party against [Robert] Mueller in 2018 that he was always going to survive the investigation. And that's what [Rudy] Giuliani did above all, which was turn the Mueller investigation into a political matter instead of a legal matter. Jeffrey Toobin Trump knew once he had mobilized his base and the Republican Party against Mueller in 2018 that he was always going to survive the investigation. And that's what Giuliani did above all, which was turn the Mueller investigation into a political matter instead of a legal matter. On Mueller's efforts to stay apolitical Mueller ... found it deeply distasteful that he became a political figure. He did not want to be the case against Trump from the Democratic perspective. He didn't like that there were Robert Mueller action figures. He didn't like that there were \"Mueller Time\" T-shirts and that he became, you know, the hope and dream of MSNBC. This was not how Mueller saw himself. I think there was this institutional resistance, which Mueller fostered, of becoming a political figure. And I think that contributed to his just-the-fact report, and his reluctance to draw conclusions. I think that was a flawed approach. But it comes out of Mueller's background as someone who was deeply suspicious of the political process. On how Mueller didn't investigate Trump's financial dealings with Russia Another thing Mueller did and refrained from doing was investigating Trump's background before the presidency and before his campaign. One of the things that has been a source of mystery and curiosity throughout ever since Trump declared his candidacy is why he has this incredible solicitude for Vladimir Putin, why he refuses to criticize Putin, why he's so solicitous of Russia. And many people have speculated that relates to some sort of financial dealings that Trump had and has with Russia. Mueller didn't go there. Mueller didn't feel like that was within his jurisdiction. He didn't get Trump's tax returns. He didn't explore Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank, where he got his financing for his projects. So I can't say that there is something there that some prosecutor might have found. But when it comes to the Russia relationship during the 2016 campaign, one thing I think we have to be fair about is to say that when Trump said no collusion, there was no collusion \u2014 I mean, there was no explicit quid pro quo between the Russian government and the Trump campaign when the candidate, Trump, provided something to the Russians and the Russians provided something to him. What's evident is that Trump probably would have done it if he'd had the opportunity, but he didn't. He was just a candidate. He had nothing to give Russia at that point. Russia had plenty to give him. They did the hacking of the emails. They did the social media campaign. There was the meeting in Trump Tower in June of 2016. But in none of those cases could Mueller prove, and I don't think there is anything to prove, that there was any sort of meeting of the minds between Trump himself and the Russians. On the dedication of the book to \"my fellow journalists\" This has been a very tough time for journalists. For the most part, it's a difficult time in a business sense. There are a lot of newspapers that have struggled and gone out of business, a lot of layoffs, and I don't have a particular answer for that. But this has also been a time when people have not just criticized the results of journalism, but the very essence and motivations and character of journalism. And yes, obviously, that starts with the president, but it's not only the president. And I just wanted to be able to add my voice to those who say journalism matters: Journalism is a force for good in the world. Journalism is a flawed institution but is one that is indispensable to a healthy democracy. And I'm proud to be a journalist. And the dedication was one way of trying to respond to a very difficult business and political climate in which journalists find themselves. ... One thing I want to emphasize is in many respects, the Trump presidency has been a golden moment for journalism. I am so proud of my colleagues at CNN and how we have responded and not responded to what the president has done, and the journalism that has come out in The New York Times and The Washington Post has been so terrific during this period. But there is also a sense of peril, and sometimes physical peril. There is anger out there stoked by the president that has put a lot of us in physical jeopardy. And a lot of us have had very ugly experiences relating to this period in journalism. To say that's disturbing is an understatement. And my dedication is just a way of offering a small measure of moral support to all of us who try to do this for a living.

            "article_content": "Bullhorns are seen during a demonstration in front of the Supreme Court on June 29. The court had a momentous term with cases ranging from President Trump's financial records to immigration and abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bullhorns are seen during a demonstration in front of the Supreme Court on June 29. The court had a momentous term with cases ranging from President Trump's financial records to immigration and abortion. A momentous Supreme Court term is over. The last strokes of the pen were devoted to repudiating President Trump's claim that he is categorically immune from state grand jury and congressional subpoenas. But the term also featured just about every flashpoint in American law \u2014 including abortion, religion, immigration and much more. Here are six takeaways: 1. John Roberts may be the most powerful chief justice since the 1930s. He is the first justice since then to be both the controlling vote and the chief justice. That means that when he is in the majority, he has the important power to assign who will write an opinion, and that choice may well determine whether the decision is written broadly or narrowly. This term, Roberts was in the majority an astounding 97% of the time; he assigned the opinion in all but two cases. 2. Probably the most historic opinions he wrote were those rejecting Trump's claim that he is categorically immune from state grand jury and congressional subpoenas for his pre-presidential financial records. But in an election year, Roberts also wrote a variety of decisions that for now will likely keep the court out of the political maelstrom. His signature immigration decision prevented Trump from immediately getting rid of the program that offers protections for people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, known as \"DREAMers.\" But it left ample room for conservative actions down the road. Roberts also cast the deciding vote in a major abortion case that preserved the status quo, for now, but left plenty of leeway for the court to chip away at abortion rights in the future. And he likely wrote the court's unsigned opinion, dismissing as moot the first major gun rights case heard by the court in a decade. That too leaves room for gun rights proponents to come back attacking gun regulations in the future. 3. Religion is the one area where social conservative won consistent victories this term. In three separate decisions, the court made clear that the high wall of separation between church and state, a doctrine that prevailed for much of the 20th century, is now a relic of the past. It has been replaced by a heavy emphasis on the free exercise of religion and an accommodation between church and state. Roberts wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision gutting provisions in most state constitutions that have long barred using taxpayer funds for religious schools. In another case, the court ruled that under the Constitution, lay teachers at  parochial schools may not be protected by the nation's fair employment laws. And in a third case, the court ruled that under the Affordable Care Act,  employers with religious or moral objections may opt out of providing free birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans. 4. While conservatives have a clear five-justice majority, they can't seem to work together. Perhaps for reasons of either ego or frustration, conservatives wrote way more separate concurring and dissenting opinions \u2014 a total of 60 \u2014 compared to the liberals, who wrote far fewer concurring opinions and almost always dissented as a group. The liberals seem to know they are playing defense. When they can get a fifth vote to prevail, they don't go off on their own in a way that could diminish their impact. The four most conservative justices write many more separate opinions and are much more long-winded \u2014 their separate opinions total 734 pages. When you drill down to the 20 cases that were decided by 5-to-4 or 6-to-3 votes, the numbers are even starker. Conservatives wrote 14 of 17 concurring opinions, meaning that they signed on to the outcome of the ruling but not on to all \u2014 or sometimes any \u2014 of the reasoning behind it. And they wrote eight of the nine solo dissents and eight of the 11 solo concurrences, writing for themselves alone. The only time Chief Justice Roberts wrote a concurring opinion for himself alone was in the abortion case, presenting a Louisiana law identical a Texas law  struck down four years ago. Roberts, who dissented from the Texas decision, nonetheless cast the deciding fifth vote to invalidate the same law from Louisiana, citing the duty to adhere to precedent. But he did not join the liberals' reasoning, and in fact seemed to invite future cases that could undermine abortion rights. 5. Of the two Trump appointees to the court, Neil Gorsuch has been at once the most predictable and unpredictable this term. Predictable because in most cases he has turned out to be every bit as conservative as his political supporters hoped, and liberal detractors feared. But in two major  majority opinions that he wrote, he completely defied early predictions. The most headline-grabbing was his decision for a six-justice majority declaring that LGBTQ employees are protected by the 1964 law barring employment discrimination based on sex. In another decision, on Thursday, he delivered to Native Americans their first major Supreme Court victory in many decades. Writing for himself and the court's four liberals, Gorsuch declared that much of eastern Oklahoma, including the state's second largest city of Tulsa, falls within Indian lands belonging to the Creek Nation. Gorsuch's decision invoked the mistreatment and broken promises inflicted on Native American tribes over the course of U.S. history, and concluded that the land in eastern Oklahoma still belongs to the Creek Nation because Congress never revoked the treaties under which the land was designated as, in the words of the opinion, \"Indian Country.\" To hold otherwise, wrote Gorsuch, would \"elevate the most brazen and longstanding injustices ... rewarding wrong and failing those in the right.\" Although the decision could have major consequences, state and tribal officials immediately said that they could reach an amicable compromise to resolve those issues. That said, the fact is that the court's ruling has provided Native Americans the kind of leverage in negotiations that they have not had before. 6. Headline cases buried other personal court news. On June 21, Chief Justice Roberts fell while walking at a Maryland country club near his home, hitting his head hard enough to require stitches and an overnight stay in the hospital. The court did not disclose the incident when it occurred, but confirmed it on July 7, after the Washington Post first reported the incident. Court press officer Kathy Arberg said in a statement, \"The Chief Justice was treated at a hospital on June 21 for an injury to his forehead sustained in a fall while walking for exercise near his home. The injury required sutures, and out of an abundance of caution, he stayed in the hospital overnight and was discharged the next morning.\" Arberg said doctors had had ruled out a seizure (he suffered a seizure in 1993 and another one in 2007). She said doctors believe the fall last month \"was likely due to light-headedness caused by dehydration.\" On a different note, Ginni Thomas, an outspoken conservative activist and wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote to protest an overhead banner on Main Street in the tiny town of Clifton, Va., population 300. The banner reads, \"Welcome to Clifton, where Black Lives Matter.\" Thomas is white; her husband is the Supreme Court's only black justice. \"BLM is a bit of a dangerous Trojan Horse and they are catching well-meaning people into the dangerous posturing that can invite mob rule and property looting,\" Ginni Thomas wrote, according to the Washington Post. \"Let's not be tricked into joining cause with radical extremists seeking to foment a cultural revolution because they hate America.\"",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts, here at the State of the Union address in February, has concluded a momentous term with the Supreme Court.\n                \n                    \n                    Leah Millis/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chief Justice John Roberts, here at the State of the Union address in February, has concluded a momentous term with the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts' double-barreled rejection of President Trump's claims of immunity from grand jury and congressional subpoenas was a stunning end to a momentous term in which Roberts played perhaps the most pivotal role of any chief justice in close to a century. In a remarkable series of decisions over the last month, Roberts has rebuked  Trump on matters ranging from personal to policy. In Thursday's decisions, with seven-justice majorities, Roberts once again pushed back on Trump's assertion of almost unlimited presidential power. In other cases, he cast the deciding fifth vote, as he did when preventing Trump from ending the program that currently protects the so-called DREAMers from deportation. Similarly, he cast the decisive vote against reversing a major abortion precedent, and he even sided with Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch in ruling that the federal ban on discrimination based on sex applies to LGBTQ employees. At the same time, though, Roberts has whittled away at federal agency independence and moved the court decidedly to the right on matters of church and state. Frustration on both sides If the decisions from the conservative chief justice seem dizzying, they are infuriating to hard-line conservative Trump supporters. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has, for all practical purposes, disowned the chief justice he once clerked for, calling the LGBTQ opinion that Roberts joined, \"the end of the conservative legal movement or the conservative legal project as we know it.\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has repeatedly called on Roberts to resign. \"If the chief justice thinks he has such excellent political judgment, I would recommend that he resign and travel to Iowa for the caucuses and see if he can earn the votes of his fellow Americans,\" he said on Fox & Friends on June 20. While progressives may have breathed a sigh of relief after some of his crucial votes this term, they aren't thrilled with Roberts either, noting that when he sides with the court's liberals, his decisions are often hairsplitters that leave plenty room for future challenges from the right. Thus, when the chief justice ruled against Trump's move to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his decision left room for an administration do-over. Roberts' opinion spelled out every administrative hoop that the administration would have to jump through to get rid of the program. And when he cast the decisive fifth vote in this year's abortion case, he refused to join the opinion of the court's four liberals. Instead, he wrote separately, saying that a Louisiana law requiring doctors to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals should be struck down because it was identical to a Texas law the court struck down four years ago. By withholding his signature from the liberal plurality opinion, he deprived it of the power to create binding precedent to strengthen abortion rights. If anything, he walked back some of the progress abortion rights advocates thought they had made in the 2016 decision, and he left plenty of room for anti-abortion forces to chip away at Roe v. Wade in the future. Sending a message What appeared to stick in Roberts' craw was the fact that anti-abortion forces and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals thought they could defy the court and flip the outcome just because one justice had retired and been replaced by a Trump appointee. It was a \"crass political maneuver,\" says Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus, who has known Roberts since the two were roommates in law school. \"He's a very skilled jurist. He could easily have just said, 'Well, the [Louisiana and Texas] cases are different,' as [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh sought to do. But he chose a different path,\" says Lazarus, author of The Rule of Five: Making Climate History at the Supreme Court. Instead, as Lazarus observes, Roberts \"chose to use the case to make a point ... that there is such a thing as a court, and ... you can't expect us to behave like partisan legislators.\" Lazarus also thinks Roberts' vote in the abortion case was a \"shot across the bow\" aimed at presidential candidates who campaign with a list of potential nominees to the court. \"I think he hates that,\" Lazarus says. \"I think he's tried to send a very strong message as much as he can ... and I think he hopes to get the other justices to do some of the same.\" Indeed, Roberts may be trying to set an example in other ways \u2014 for instance, when he joined Gorsuch's opinion declaring that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to gay and transgender employees because it bars discrimination based on sex. Was Roberts giving Gorsuch cover, or did he really agree with the Gorsuch opinion, which was also joined by the court's four liberals? We may never know. Power in the majority Roberts voted in the majority an astounding 97% of the time this term. That means that in 51 out of 53 cases with signed opinions, he chose which of his colleagues wrote the opinion for the court majority, a power reserved for the chief justice when he is in the majority. It is also a power that allows the chief justice, when he is in the majority, to frame whether the opinion is going to be written by a justice using a broad brush, or a narrow one. \"He's taking control of the narrative of the court and imposing his own set of frameworks, imposing his own stamp on the court,\" Duke University School of Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles says. Harvard law professor Noah Feldman says that \"the chief's basic worldview hasn't changed.\" As Feldman sees it, Roberts is still a conservative, and he's \"OK with the court being ideological\" but not partisan, and that means adhering to precedent. Still, as Feldman observes, the chief justice \"wields a very deft doctrinal scalpel,\" which he can use to \"slice and dice a precedent so there's almost nothing left of it.\" Feldman contends that Roberts did just that in a recent case involving funding for religious schools in which the chief justice claimed to be following a precedent written by the man he once clerked for, the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Instead, Feldman says, Roberts \"eviscerated that precedent.\" Roberts' opinions in the Thursday's subpoena cases, which together were much more deferential to state grand juries than to congressional power, saw the court muscle its way into more power relative to Congress, with the chief justice leading the charge. \"I think there is a ... sort of cross-partisan dismissiveness or disdain toward Congress,\" says Georgetown law professor Josh Chafetz, author of Congress's Constitution: Legislative Authority and the Separation of Powers. The chief justice is \"uniquely positioned right now. He is both the chief justice and the controlling vote\" on a court split between hard-line conservatives and traditional liberals, observes Roberts' longtime friend Lazarus. That hasn't happened since Charles Evans Hughes was chief justice in the 1930s. Historian James Simon, author of a book about Hughes, points to a speech Hughes gave in 1927. \"He said, you know, if the public perceives of the court as partisan, politically partisan, it loses its authority. ... Essentially, Roberts is saying the same thing in 2018\" when the chief justice issued a rare rebuke of Trump's reference to \"an Obama judge.\" As Simon told NPR, the main difference is that Hughes was a progressive Republican and Roberts is a conservative Republican. Hughes bided his time until he had more votes and could write broader opinions to the center-left, while Roberts may be biding his time to reach far more conservative decisions. Voting as an outlier There is, however, at least one area of the law where even this term, Roberts hasn't necessarily lived up to his own billing as nonpartisan: voting rights. Duke professor Charles notes that when he was in law school (in the 1990s), law students were taught that one of the major roles of the Supreme Court was to enforce democratic processes. \"This is consistent with what Roberts told us during his confirmation hearings about how he viewed himself, that his role was to assure that the process was fair and that he was calling balls and strikes,\" he says. \"He wasn't going to determine the outcome of the game.\" But Charles says when it comes to policing the political process of voting, Roberts has taken a pass. In 2013, Roberts voted to strike down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act and authored the opinion. That decision effectively gutted the law, helping usher in a bevy of state laws designed to decrease voting power for minorities and making it harder to vote. Even this term, amid a pandemic, Roberts has continued to be a stalwart conservative in voting rights cases. In three cases during the primary elections this year \u2014 in Wisconsin, Texas and Alabama \u2014 Roberts joined with his conservative colleagues to block orders from lower-court judges who were trying to assure voters that they could vote by mail to avoid exposure to the coronavirus. \"We're likely to see more litigation as we come toward November, and we have a court that says ... we're not going to get involved,\" Charles says. \"The court ought to be patrolling the boundaries of the political process. The court ought to help us establish what is fair and what is unfair. And, of course, most of that involves making sure that eligible voters can exercise their right to vote.\" Intern Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred contributed to this report.",

You might notice that we've got a brand new look. If you're worried that anything else is changing, never fear\u2014you'll still be hearing race and culture stories from the same journalists of color. Now, four years after our first launch, we're going to be telling even bigger and bolder stories that explore how race intersects with just about everything. If you're new here or want to relisten to some old episodes, we have a playlist with some of our favorites. We think these show the breadth of the topics and stories you'll hear on our show. Here's a quick guide about some of the episodes. The Black Table In The Big Tent Black Republicans are pretty much unicorns\u2014only 2 percent of the GOP is black, compared with 19 percent of the Democratic Party. The election of President Donald Trump threw a wrench in this already-small voting bloc, and the crossroads many black Republicans find themselves at now can teach us a lot about how both major parties treat black voters. In this 2019 episode, we talked to both unicorns and experts about \"the black table in the corner of the super-white big tent.\" Ask Code Switch: What About Your Friends? Interracial friendships are hard to come by; people tend to form friendships with others from their same racial group. The reasons for those patterns include the usual suspect: systemic racism, like school segregation and the overrepresentation of students of color in lower academic tracks. But even for interracial friendships that beat the odds, talking about race is complicated. With a little help from our friends at WNYC's Death, Sex & Money podcast, we dove deep into these hard conversations this past January. Our Homeland Is Each Other Most adoptive parents in the U.S. are white\u2014and their adopted children often aren't. For transracial adoptees, the messiness of racial identity is further muddled by feelings of loss and a pressure to be grateful. In 2018, we put a call out to transracial adoptees, and they told us how they navigate these complexities in their own words. As one listener put it, \"You know, not everything is gumdrops and rainbows.\" Miriam Gonzalez, a plaintiff in a case that sued the Trump Administration for ending DACA.\n                \n                    \n                    Shereen Marisol Meraji/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Miriam Gonzalez, a plaintiff in a case that sued the Trump Administration for ending DACA. Status Update Nearly 9 million people in the U.S. are part of a \"mixed status family,\" in which each person has a different immigration and citizenship status than their siblings and parents. Thousands of those people are a part of DACA, a program that protects some people in the U.S. from deportation, and one that the Trump administration has used as a political football. In 2019, we talked with three siblings of different statuses on what a Supreme Court case on DACA meant for their futures. As the court decides DACA's fate, with a ruling expected this summer, this episode explains the huge issues at stake. A Strange And Bitter Crop Marianna, Fla. is the \"City of Southern Charm,\" but it's also a city haunted by what has been cited as one of the most violent and well-attended lynchings in U.S history. Eighty-five years ago, thousands of white people witnessed and participated in the brutal murder of Claude Neal. One poet from Marianna, L. Lamar Wilson, learned about Neal when he was in high school. He's been determined to keep his story alive since then.

Death Of A Blood Sport In 2019, Congress passed a ban that made cockfighting illegal in U.S territories. In Puerto Rico, many do not see the sport as cruel but instead, as an essential cultural industry. Many saw the ban as another forceful imposition of U.S power attempting to erase Puerto Rican identity. This episode from last year features some of the cockfighters prepared to fight back. \"Because how could cockfighters ask their roosters to fight to the death and not be willing to do the same?,\" asks one. Carmen Maria Machado Takes Us 'In The Dream House' Carmen Maria Machado wants to be clear: Domestic abuse in queer relationships is \"common as dirt\", even if stories about it are nearly non-existent. With her new and innovative memoir, In The Dream House, she brings to light her own experience with a toxic relationship. We talked to her about her book and writing difficult stories about the LGBTQ community this past January.

            "article_content": "A wall map displays stickers from member stations at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Allison Shelley/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A wall map displays stickers from member stations at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Last week, I wrote about the listeners we heard from who want to hear more varied perspectives \u2014 from outside the DC beltway and the coasts, from rural areas \u2014 and some developments that I find hopeful. Here's one more. NPR is rightfully proud that, over the years, as other national news organizations have cut back on national correspondents around the country, it has kept open many of its domestic bureaus and reporter positions, from Birmingham, Ala., to Boise, Idaho. But that still means that roughly three dozen people are responsible for covering wide territories, and correspondents often need to parachute in when major news breaks. At the same time, it didn't escape the notice of many that NPR has a network of 265 stations (as of this week) around the country that pay dues to air its programs, and that those stations collectively have some 1,800 local journalists of their own. While reporters at some of those stations were tapped regularly to file reports for NPR, others were not. The untapped potential seemed huge. A few years ago, dreamers began to scheme: What if those two assets could be brought together somehow in a more closely aligned reporting system? Bruce Auster, NPR's senior director for what came to be named the Collaborative Journalism Network, calls it the \"power of the national-local blend.\" After countless delays needed to work through myriad challenges, the vision for that network is turning into reality, in the form of regional and statewide hubs of public radio stations with NPR as a partner. In just the last month, a new hub in California that brings together five stations and NPR announced that it had hired a managing editor. A similar regional hub in the Gulf states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama also was formally unveiled. They join a statewide Texas hub, which launched last fall. Others are under discussion. The developments are good news for listeners everywhere, whether you live in a hub region or not. If you are a listener to a local station taking part in one of these hubs, the potential benefit is major. Ideally, the pooled resources of statewide and regional stations will allow for less duplication of effort, freeing up reporters and editors to do more original reporting in their communities. The hubs are unlikely to replace the granular local community reporting that is being lost as small town newspapers fold, but on the bigger local stories, they seemingly have great potential to fill holes in what are now becoming vast news deserts in much of the country. Auster said the chief goal of the hubs is \"to strengthen local and regional journalism.\" He called it \"very much an effort to fill the gap left by the contraction of the newspaper industry.\" While not the main goal, in theory, some of that great reporting should filter back to NPR's national newsmagazines. For the national NPR listener, the hoped-for payoff is reporting resources on the ground, in place to spot stories as they happen and bring local knowledge and depth to that work. The hub reporters can also respond immediately to breaking news. I did my first interviews for this column two years ago, when, after what had already been a couple of years of work, it seemed that the first hub was imminent. As the delay since then underscores, the issues around these collaborations are incredibly complicated, reflecting the realities and complexities of the public radio system itself. A few of the challenges the participants have talked to me about: If this sounds like a lot of inside baseball, it is. But confronting these challenges (each hub is doing so in different ways) early on is a key to making the ventures work. As Joyce Slocum, the president and chief executive of Texas Public Radio in San Antonio (and a former top NPR executive), put it during a panel discussion at September's Excellence in Journalism conference, the conversations had to start from a premise that \"this was not a project; it was a way to do business from now on.\" Participants had to \"check their egos at the door,\" and remember that as public media, they are \"mission- and listener-centered,\" she said. Auster told me that all the planning work that had to be done to get the Texas hub off the ground led to a template for other hubs, which is why they are coming together more quickly. The California Newsroom includes CapRadio, KQED, KPBS, KCRW and KPCC/LAist.\n                \n                    \n                    Juliette Rocheleau/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The California Newsroom includes CapRadio, KQED, KPBS, KCRW and KPCC/LAist. In California, the hub's new managing editor, Joanne Griffith, will start by coordinating statewide breaking news coverage and local and regional coverage of the 2020 election for the five participating stations in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego and the Los Angeles area. She'll also loop in work from the smaller stations in the state. The big-city participating stations are all fairly well off when it comes to resources (four of them already collaborate) and the venture says its goal is to increase coverage of statewide issues and \"boost reporting from and for underserved regions across the state.\" Griffith will work closely with the NPR West Bureau Chief Jason DeRose, who will edit stories for national broadcast. The Gulf States Newsroom includes WBHM, WRKF, WWNO and Mississippi Public Broadcasting.\n                \n                    \n                    Juliette Rocheleau/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Gulf States Newsroom includes WBHM, WRKF, WWNO and Mississippi Public Broadcasting. In the Gulf, WBHM in Birmingham, Ala., Mississippi Public Broadcasting, WWNO in New Orleans, WRKF in Baton Rouge, La., and NPR are joining together to increase regional coverage; the work is designed so that all NPR member stations in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama can take part. Hiring is about to begin; new positions include a managing editor, six beat reporters and two editors. The Texas Newsroom includes KERA, KUT, Houston Public Media and Texas Public Radio.\n                \n                    \n                    Juliette Rocheleau/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Texas Newsroom includes KERA, KUT, Houston Public Media and Texas Public Radio. The Texas Newsroom is furthest along. It already produces six live, statewide newscasts every weekday, drawing on content from public radio stations across the state. The newscasts are carried by about a dozen stations. The stations also share in-depth reporting that airs on the daily newsmagazine Texas Standard. That collaboration already paid off in one breaking news situation, when a gunman opened fire in El Paso, Texas, last August, killing 22. Thanks to the coordinated communication lines already in place, the newsrooms were able to get local reporters to the scene more quickly. NPR sent just one reporter where it normally might have sent more \"because we felt the coverage was in good hands,\" NPR's Auster said. Auster emphasized that while there are core stations taking the lead at each hub, all stations in each region are welcome to participate, contributing reporting and taking content. These hubs are building on public radio regional and state and topic-specific collaborations that are already extensive, from Harvest Public Media to the Mountain West News Bureau to the Environment And Energy Collaborative from NPR and member stations (to name only a few). Just in my five years as NPR's Public Editor, the growth in quality reporting from these many ventures has been impressive, and a great service to journalism. The Collaborative Journalism Network should bring more of that good local work to NPR itself. For all of those listeners who reached out after last week's column to add their voices to those who are hungry for more outside-the-Beltway perspective, this is good news.",

            "article_content": "The role of state attorneys general has shifted toward national politics in recent years, including Ken Paxton of Texas, a Republican, who aligned himself with Trump through attention-getting suits.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We have a profile next of a state official who's made a lot of national news in recent weeks, Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas. He's a Republican who has aligned himself with President Trump through high-profile lawsuits. KERA's Bret Jaspers in Dallas has the profile. BRET JASPERS, BYLINE: When Paxton recently sued to overturn election results in four swing states, the Supreme Court refused to hear it. The spectacle shined a national spotlight on Ken Paxton, but civil rights groups in Texas have been battling him for years. After the court legalized same-sex marriage, Paxton issued guidance to county clerks. SHELLY SKEEN: And said, if it violates your religious beliefs, you can refuse to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple. Now, you might be subject to a lawsuit if you do that. JASPERS: That's Shelly Skeen, senior attorney at Lambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights group. County clerks, by and large, followed the ruling of the Supreme Court, but this was an early indication of how Paxton would use religion as the state's top lawyer. SKEEN: He's putting that first, as opposed to complying with what the law says. And that's his job, is to comply with what the law says, give advice on that and then also to enforce it. JASPERS: The ACLU of Texas has confronted the state AG many times. Andre Segura is legal director. ANDRE SEGURA: This, for me, started in 2015, early 2016, when he tried to block refugees from settling in Texas. JASPERS: Segura has also fought Paxton over voting rights. Paxton has lawsuits pending to end the DACA program and throw out the entire Affordable Care Act. His legal efforts could potentially have a broad effect on national policy. Paul Nolette is a professor of political science at Marquette University and studies state attorneys general. He says the job has evolved over the past 20 years. PAUL NOLETTE: A lot of AGs fall into this category that they're much more interested in national politics than they were in the past. They have this national influence in a way that they didn't even a couple decades ago. And Paxton, I think, is kind of a shining example. JASPERS: Other examples include liberal AGs in California and New York, big states that have often sued the Trump administration. Republican Tom Rath is the former attorney general for New Hampshire, where, unlike Texas, the AG is appointed by the governor. He says suing the federal government can be part of the job. TOM RATH: Look; at times, there could be a federal law or regulation that's at odds with the needs of the state, that runs contrary to how the state operates. And I think that's an appropriate circumstance in which the attorney general may say, this runs contrary to our interests. JASPERS: Rath did not support, however, Paxton's lawsuit attempting to overturn election results in four states. He called the time and money spent on it a waste. The suit brought renewed attention to Paxton and his own legal troubles. He's been under state indictment for securities fraud for five years. Separately, several of his former high-ranking staffers are accusing him of abusing his office. The FBI is reportedly investigating, and Paxton denies wrongdoing. The state attorney general's office didn't return emails seeking an interview, but in November, Paxton spoke to Austin TV station KXAN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEN PAXTON: We're doing some amazing things. And so I would just say the proof is in the pudding. Look at the results of what we've accomplished. JASPERS: Paxton has trumpeted his Obamacare lawsuit, as well as an antitrust investigation of Google and his campaign against purported election fraud, an effort that has yielded scant evidence. Andre Segura of the ACLU of Texas says a new Biden administration should expect plenty of legal challenges coming from Paxton's office. SEGURA: I think we need to be really on our toes about what an attorney general like Ken Paxton will be doing in this new administration to fight back against any movement forward on civil rights. JASPERS: And Ken Paxton is likely to run for reelection in 2022. For NPR News, I'm Bret Jaspers in Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE FALL'S \"YOU GO UP, I GO DOWN\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Axios reporter Jonathan Swan says the president has \"crossed a psychological line\" since impeachment, developing a list of disloyal officials to oust \u2014 and suggesting loyalists to replace them.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. In an article titled \"Trump's 'Deep State' Hit List,\" my guest Jonathan Swan writes about how the Trump White House and its conservative allies over the past 18 months assembled detailed lists of government officials who should be ousted because they weren't loyal to Trump and lists of Trump loyalists to replace them. Swan says he was briefed on or reviewed these memos and lists. Most of the details he revealed had not been previously published. Swan writes that the president's distrust has intensified since his impeachment and acquittal. These lists help explain some of the recent personnel changes in the Trump administration. Swan is national political reporter at the news website Axios and writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peak newsletter. He covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. He's broken some big stories, including that Trump was going to pull out of the Paris climate deal, recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and end DACA. Jonathan Swan, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I want to ask you about your article this week headlined \"Trump's 'Deep State' Hit List.\" What qualifies this as a hit list? JONATHAN SWAN: So President Trump - I mean, we all see the public desire for him to root out his enemies, you know? He's tweeted, you know, we need to get the bad people out of government, et cetera. What we uncovered in our reporting was that there's actually quite a long paper trail behind this, that over the last 18 months, the president has been asking for names of people within his government who are disloyal, who are, quote-unquote, \"Never Trump\" or anti-Trump, or, quote-unquote, \"the bad people.\" He's told aides that he feels that there are \"snakes everywhere,\" quote-unquote. And so what we... GROSS: By everywhere, he means, like, in the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department. SWAN: All of those and also in the White House. So he has a network outside the White House, which is comprised of very well-connected conservative activists. One of them in particular is Ginni Thomas, who is the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Others include Republican congressional staffers, the head of Judicial Watch, which is a conservative legal watchdog group, Tom Fitton. And they have a weekly meeting on Wednesdays where they get together to plan how to attack the left and also how to root out the, quote-unquote, \"deep state\" within Donald Trump's government. They've been providing people within that network memos and lists to the president for the past 18 months, and I reviewed or was briefed on several of those memos that have shaped his thinking in recent times. GROSS: So there literally are lists. Like, when you write hit list, there's literally lists. SWAN: Yes, that's right. There are lists of names, and I've seen both people he should fire and the reasons that he should fire them. And we put some of them in the story - you know, a number of State Department officials that they singled out as being bad apples - and then also lists of people he should hire because they are loyal to the president, pro-Trump. And, you know, we also published the names of those people, including Dan Bongino, who's a Fox regular, a former Secret Service agent. You know, they put him up for a senior counterterrorism role. So it's both fire lists and hire lists. And the reason this matters right now is - the president's been hearing this for a year and a half now, but since impeachment and since acquittal, aides have told me that he's crossed a psychological line in the sense that he feels an urgency to get rid of these people. He saw a number of State Department officials testify in the impeachment hearings, including Alexander Vindman and others. And he felt this intense anger that - here were these people that were supposed to work for him that were betraying him, disloyal to him, bad people. And so what he did was quite extraordinary. He fired the head of Presidential Personnel Office. This office doesn't get a lot of attention in the mainstream media. Most people have never heard of it, but it's a very important office. It's the office that is in charge of picking personnel, political appointees across the government. He put in that job his 29-year-old body man, Johnny McEntee, who had worked on the Trump campaign. He was a college quarterback, a football player, worked on the Trump campaign, came into the White House as Trump's body man - so literally traveling around with him sort of as his personal aide. And then he was fired by the former Chief of Staff John Kelly for some security clearance-related issues. President Trump has brought him back into the White House and put him in charge of this office, and it's really for one reason. He sees Johnny McEntee as a pure loyalist, and he has given him the brief that he needs to get rid of the bad people. GROSS: Wait. So let's back up a second. SWAN: Yeah. GROSS: So he was fired by General John Kelly... SWAN: Correct. GROSS: ...When Kelly was chief of staff at the White House... SWAN: That's right. GROSS: ...For security issues. What were those issues? SWAN: I've been very careful not to say them because I haven't been able to confirm exactly what it was. It was handled in a very strange way, and he was sort of - even people who were there at the time think that it was actually handled quite badly. He was sort of hauled out of the White House. And there were some reports that it may have had something to do with gambling, but again, we've been very careful because we haven't been able to confirm exactly what it was. But Trump brought him back in, and he had this very interesting meeting last week where he summoned the White House liaisons at each of the cabinet agencies to the White House. This is on Thursday. And it was an introductory meeting. It was all very pleasant. But he asked them - he said he wanted to know who were the anti-Trump people at the agencies. So... GROSS: This is McEntee... SWAN: Correct. GROSS: ...The new personnel head. SWAN: Correct. GROSS: OK. SWAN: And so, just so you understand, he's not talking about people who are career government employees who have, you know, worked in the government maybe for 20 years. These are political appointees that President Trump himself appointed or that his cabinet secretaries appointed. So the extent of the distrust is so deep that President Trump is asking his head of personnel to root out the bad people among his own political appointees. GROSS: So Johnny McEntee, the new head of the Presidential Personnel Office - he's 29. He has no personnel experience. SWAN: Correct. GROSS: And he has hired as his new assistant, the Presidential Personnel Office's director of operation, a 23-year-old senior at George Washington University. SWAN: Yes. Politico just reported that story. And he's replacing - this 23-year-old, James Bacon - he's replacing a woman who has had experience for decades in personnel. So it's quite striking. GROSS: So is this a pattern that you're seeing - that Trump has his hit list of who to remove and the people he's replacing them with are loyalists, but they don't necessarily have any experience or credentials for the job they're being appointed to? SWAN: I couldn't say that that's happening everywhere, but it is a pattern. And experience matters far, far less to Trump than loyalty. It's not even close. GROSS: So you said that you actually saw some of the lists in some of the memo that was being given to President Trump of who to fire and who to hire. Give us a sense of what you've read in the hit list of who to get rid of. SWAN: So there's this extraordinary memo. This memo was given to President Trump early last year, I'm told. And President Trump passes the memo on to his then-head of the Presidential Personnel Office, Sean Doocey. And Doocey apparently reads this memo, and it's largely an attack on him. So just to, like, underscore that, the president has funneled this memo to his head of personnel, and the memo is basically saying, this guy Doocey is an obstructionist; he's undermining you - all of this stuff. It lays out a number of people at the State Department who need to be fired, including the deputy Sullivan and various others - David Hale, who ended up testifying in the impeachment hearing. And then at the end, it makes this extraordinary allegation that Sean Doocey had doctored a document, had sneakily changed the name of an appointment knowing that the president wouldn't possibly see it as a way of sneakily getting someone else in instead - you know, an establishment anti-Trump person instead of a loyalist. And I'm told by people who were there at the time that that accusation was just false on its face because of the timeline in which this happened. It just couldn't possibly have been true. But that gives you a sense of what these documents say. It's basically bolstering Trump's instinctive suspicions that he's surrounded by people who are against him, undermining him, don't have his best interests at heart. And that has only been exacerbated by the impeachment hearings. GROSS: So when Sean Doocey gets this memo from Trump with a list of names of people to fire 'cause they're not loyal enough to Trump and Doocey finds that his own name is on Page 1 of this memo, what happens to Doocey afterwards? SWAN: Well, he stays in the job for another year. And my understanding is that there was a conversation with the - that he and a colleague had a conversation with the president about this. I mean, there was false information in this memo. The last part, according to people who were there at the time, was just a false smear against him. So my understanding is that they explained that to the president. And he stayed in the job for another year before he was replaced by Johnny McEntee. GROSS: I think we need to take a break here, so let me reintroduce you. My guest is Jonathan Swan. He's national political reporter at Axios. He writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peek newsletter and also covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DON STIERNBERG'S \"PERDIDO\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Swan. He is national political reporter at Axios. He writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peek newsletter and covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. So let's talk a little bit about Jessie Liu. Now, she had been the D.C. U.S. attorney, which is a very powerful role. And she was leaving that position with the plans of taking a top Treasury job, and then she was told, you're not going to get the Treasury job. So now she's out of a job. What are the reasons why she is not going to get the position that she was told she was going to get? SWAN: So Jessie Liu is a really instructive case. She is a political appointee - again, not some career government person. President Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was the one who wanted her in this senior role at the Treasury Department. President Trump had agreed to that. He had, in fact, nominated her publicly. She had been taken off her role as the U.S. attorney for D.C. and was all prepared for her confirmation hearing, which was happening later that week. And then President Trump suddenly withdraws her nomination. And of course, there's a whole lot of speculation about why that happened. A lot of people believed that it was because, as the U.S. attorney, she had overseen the prosecution of President Trump's longtime political adviser Roger Stone and that that was Trump's vengeance for that. Turns out it's a lot more than that. Again, another memo - so I've been briefed on this memo that was given to the president that apparently had quite an effect on him and that he reviewed before he withdrew this nomination. It was a memo written by Barbara Ledeen, who is a Republican Senate staffer, and she's part of this Groundswell network that Ginni Thomas belongs to - the Wednesday meetings, again. Anyway, this memo has 14 sections to it, each outlining another sin that they believe Jessie Liu committed in her job as U.S. attorney. It's quite an illuminating document because it includes things like the fact that she signed the sentencing memo for General Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser. It includes the fact... GROSS: Wait. Can I stop you there? SWAN: Yes. GROSS: And he's a friend of Barbara Ledeen's, right? SWAN: Yes, he is a friend of Barbara Ledeen's. GROSS: ...Who was making up this list. SWAN: Who wrote the memo, correct. GROSS: Yeah, who wrote the memo. SWAN: So it also includes the fact that Jessie Liu, in her job as U.S. attorney, did not indict Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director and enemy of President Trump's. It includes all sorts of things. You know, there was another allegation that she had, quote-unquote, \"covered up\" James Comey's emails from being released. Anyway, it's a long, long list. GROSS: Wait. Can I add one more... SWAN: Yeah. GROSS: ...That you mentioned in your article? That she didn't act on criminal referrals of some of Justice Kavanaugh's accusers. SWAN: That's correct. That was another item listed in the list. It was a very long list. GROSS: So we've been talking about the hit list, basically, that President Trump has to get rid of people who he considers disloyal. And we've been talking about how he's been replacing them, sometimes with people who really have no qualifications for the job. The hit list was compiled in part by a group called Groundswell, a conservative activist group that's headed by Ginni Thomas, who is the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Tell us more about this group and Ginni Thomas' role in it. SWAN: So the group was formed after the 2012 presidential election. And there are lots of groups that meet in D.C. every week to strategize and, you know, discuss their ideological objectives. There has been a longtime group headed by Grover Norquist. He's a anti-tax, small-government activist, and they used to - they still do. They've met every Wednesday for decades. And I don't think it's a coincidence that they decided to do a competing Wednesday meeting. This is made up of people who, in many cases, see themselves as more ideologically pure or, certainly, more conservative than the group meeting with Grover Norquist. It's a group of people who are social conservatives, national security hard-liners, all sorts of different branches of conservatism. And they meet every Wednesday in the offices of Tom Fitton, who is the head of Judicial Watch. It's a conservative legal watchdog group. He's a close ally of President Trump's. You'll often see President Trump retweeting him. And he talks often about the, quote-unquote, \"deep state.\" And so the Wednesday meetings, they usually begin with a prayer. It's often been led by former Delta Force Commander Jerry Boykin. And they sit around. And there are sometimes, occasionally, conservative journalists who join, and they strategize about how to advance their conservative objectives, how to take on the left. And a big part of their project in the last three years has been personnel. So Ginni Thomas has put an extraordinary amount of energy and time into a project of shaping the president's thinking on the staffing of his government. And one of the most consistent frustrations within this group, I'm told, is that the president has appointed people who are ideologically squishy, who are anti-Trump, quote-unquote, \"Never Trump,\" undermining him. And they've been determined to weed out these people and provide pro-Trump, loyal Trump alternatives. GROSS: So what is one of the accomplishments of Groundswell in terms of removing somebody who they thought was disloyal, somebody who you haven't yet mentioned? SWAN: So one prominent example of a successful campaign they've run is to get rid of President Trump's former national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. They led an aggressive campaign within the conservative movement to portray H.R. McMaster as anti-Trump, working against the president, rooting out people who were loyal to the president. And it, I'm told, had quite an effect on chipping away at his legitimacy inside the White House. GROSS: Why didn't they like McMaster? SWAN: Partly because of some of the people that McMaster fired from the National Security Council. He got rid of a guy named Rich Higgins for writing a memo. So Rich Higgins used to serve on the National Security Council in a senior role in 2017. And while he was on the National Security Council, he wrote a memo that he circulated within the White House, which speculated that President Trump was under threat from - and these are not my words; these are words from the memo - from the deep state, from Islamists, bankers, establishment Republicans and the mainstream media. So it was - he was alleging that there was this group of anti-Trump forces that spread far and wide within the government that were - oh, and by the way, the other word he used is Marxists; that the government was full of cultural Marxists, Islamists and bankers, etc., who were trying to undermine the president. H.R. McMaster fired him from the National Security Council after he circulated that memo. Rich Higgins is a member of Groundswell, attends the meetings. And he told me when I reported out the story that it's a very positive development that President Trump is finally acting upon the recommendations of people to get rid of the, quote-unquote, \"Never-Trumpers\" inside the administration. GROSS: Are people who believe in conspiracy theories now holding key positions in our government? SWAN: (Laughter) Sure. I mean, it depends what you describe as a conspiracy theory. I mean, I don't know of - I can't name you someone in the government that believes exactly that, and I don't want to make some blanket statement. Here's what I'll say. There are people in the government, for sure, who have told me that Higgins was absolutely right, that what he predicted was - has turned out to be true. And there are people within the Groundswell network that certainly believe that. And Higgins himself said that if he would write the memo again today, he stands by everything. He might remove the word bankers and replace it with the intelligence community. But what I will tell you is that President Trump himself and certain people around him have a very, very dark view of the intelligence community. They believe it is - that the U.S. intelligence community is made up of people who are hostile towards the president and are trying to undermine him. And, you know, when he sees things like a briefing down on Capitol Hill where a senior intelligence official tells people that the Russians are, you know, hoping to elect Donald Trump, that sets off the alarm in President Trump's mind that, oh, here's yet another one trying to delegitimize my reelection. GROSS: Well, Trump's acting director of national intelligence, Rick Grenell, has no intelligence experience. SWAN: That's true. He's a loyalist. Trump sees him as someone who is very loyal to him. He was the ambassador - U.S. ambassador to Germany. Before that, he worked - you know, he had a consulting firm. And before that, he worked for the U.N. ambassador as a spokesman. So yes, he certainly has foreign policy experience, but he has no experience working for an intelligence agency. GROSS: My guest is Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for the news website Axios. After a break, we'll talk more about the conservative activist group Groundswell. We'll talk about and hear an excerpt of Swan's interview with Jared Kushner, and Swan will tell us about the challenges he faced interviewing President Trump on camera. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for Axios He covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. His recent article \"Trump's 'Deep State' Hit List\" is about how the Trump White House and its allies over the past 18 months assembled detailed lists of government officials who should be ousted because they weren't loyal to Trump and created lists of Trump loyalists to replace them. These lists help explain some of the personnel changes within the Trump administration. So I want to get back to Groundswell, the conservative activist group that has been compiling lists of people within the Trump administration who aren't loyal enough to Trump. The head of the group, Ginni Thomas, is married to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Is that considered an ethical conflict of interest? SWAN: There are people in the White House who have made that point. Look - Ginni Thomas, in her own right, is a very prominent and powerful conservative activist, very effective, has built this organization, has huge networks inside the conservative world. But there are people in the White House who have told me that one of the reasons President Trump pays particular attention to her recommendations is partly because she is married to Clarence Thomas, and President Trump has huge regard for Clarence Thomas. He's, you know, had the two of them to the White House for lunch and to meet with them, etc. So certainly, people in the White House have raised that issue. GROSS: You write that Trump sees himself as invincible ever since he was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial and that gambles that he took that were criticized, he thinks those gambles have really worked out for him. So can you talk about that a little bit more, about how he sees himself as invincible now? SWAN: The president - it's not just the president; it's also some people in his inner circle - not all of them, but some of them. They are much less likely to listen to the naysayers or voices of caution. And in fact, many of those voices have been fired or have left the administration of their own accord. A good example is early on in the administration, President Trump's Secretary of Defense James Mattis, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others were trying to persuade him not to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. They were basically saying to him that, you know, we're in it, better off trying to work within the system and making changes than getting out altogether. They also told him, look - it'll cause great chaos in the Middle East if you move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. In the end - so President Trump listened to them for a little bit, delayed those decisions. He was inclined to make both of those decisions much earlier. But, you know, when he was sort of getting his feet firmly on the ground as president in the first year, he did listen somewhat to them and delayed some of these decisions. He ultimately made both of those decisions. Oh, and the other one I'll add into that is withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. They also said, look - it's not a good idea. You may as well stay in, work within the system, nourish the alliances. It will, you know, upset the Europeans if you get out. President Trump did all three against their recommendations. He pulled out of Paris. He moved the embassy. He pulled out of the Iran deal. In his view, all of these Chicken Littles have been proven wrong, and he's been proven right, and the world still stands, and the sun rises every morning, and the worst things that they predicted didn't happen. So the next time people warn him against, for example, killing Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general, or any number of very bold, unconventional presidential actions, he is far less inclined to listen to the naysayers and the voices of caution. He is much more inclined to follow his own instincts and to also appoint people who are going to bolster his own instincts. GROSS: Axios has an HBO series that starts again this Sunday night. And in the first season, in the first episode, you and your colleague at Axios, Jim VandeHei interviewed President Trump, and then later in the series, you interviewed Jared Kushner. I want to play an excerpt of your interview with Jared Kushner because you really asked him some challenging questions and really pushed back on some of his answers. So what I want to do is play the part about his vision - this is an excerpt of the section on his vision for Middle East peace and what he plans for the Palestinians. So here's my guest Jonathan Swan with Jared Kushner in June of 2019. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"AXIOS\") SWAN: Do you believe the Palestinian people deserve their own independent sovereign state with a capital in East Jerusalem? JARED KUSHNER: There's a difference between the technocrats, and there's a difference between the people. The technocrats are focused on very technocratic things. And when I speak to Palestinian people, what they want is they want the opportunity to live a better life. They want the opportunity to pay their mortgage. They... SWAN: You don't think they want their own state, free from Israeli government and military? KUSHNER: I think that they want an - look; they've been promised a lot of things for a lot of years, and they've been lied to. I think that they've been misled. And I think that a lot of the things that people have held out for them have just not come through, for one way or the other. And you can blame all different types of things. But I do think that they should have self-determination. I'm going to leave the details until we come out with the actual plan. But I think that what's most important is that they have the opportunity to better their lives, live in peace with their neighbors and have the same opportunities that Israelis have. SWAN: Well, that's sovereignty. KUSHNER: Well, we're talking about the people, not about the actual... SWAN: Well, here's what I want to know - how do you know what the Palestinian people want? Like, I've heard you say that in interviews before. I mean, you're not exactly walking on the streets of Ramallah every day. I mean, you're sort of representing what the Palestinian people want. I mean, how do you, frankly, know? KUSHNER: So we've been talking with a lot of people privately for two years now. I've spoken with a lot of people from the region. I've spoken with a lot of people from the Israeli side, a lot of people from - who've been involved with this in the past, a lot of people... SWAN: It seems mostly Gulf people. Have you really spoken to that many Palestinians? KUSHNER: Again, Jonathan, one thing about the way I've conducted myself is not a lot of people know who I've been talking to and what I've been talking about, and that protects people. I mean, the Palestinian people do live under a fairly authoritative regime today, and a lot of people are afraid to step out. SWAN: Do you understand why the Palestinians don't trust you? KUSHNER: Look - I'm not here to be trusted; I'm here to you... SWAN: Well, you are, frankly. I mean, to look at it from their point of view - and you're a businessman; you always look at things from their view. You've got three Orthodox Jews on the negotiating team. Two of you have, at different points, funded settlements, Jewish settlements in the West Bank. You've got the actions you've taken so far, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. You've cut all aid to the Palestinians, including hospitals in East Jerusalem. And you've shut down the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington. I mean, can you not see why they might not want to talk to you and that they might not trust you? KUSHNER: All right, so there's a difference between the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian people, OK? SWAN: And you think the Palestinian people would be OK with all of those things that you guys have done? KUSHNER: The actions we've taken were because - America's aid is not an entitlement, right? If we make certain decisions, which we're allowed to as a sovereign nation, to respect the rights of another sovereign nation and we get criticized by that government, the response of this president is not to say, oh, let me give you more aid. So again, that was as a result of decisions taken by the Palestinian leadership. With regards to the Palestinian people, I do believe that they want to have a better life, and I do think that they're not going to judge... SWAN: They don't mind the aid being cut. GROSS: That was my guest Jonathan Swan interviewing Jared Kushner in June of 2019 on the HBO series \"Axios.\" And Jonathan Swan is national political reporter at Axios. How did you get the interview with Jared Kushner, and were there any ground rules that he asked for? SWAN: There were no ground rules. And we ask for interviews with top officials all the time, and sometimes, often, mostly, we get rejected, and sometimes they come through. And I think the timing of it was - from recollection, it was shortly after Robert Mueller had handed down his findings from the Mueller report. And my sense is that Jared Kushner felt vindicated and felt like he hadn't really been talking to the press for quite some time, while the Mueller investigation was hanging over the White House. And so there was a burst of interviews that - he had done a few interviews before my interview, and he's done quite a few since. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Swan. He's national political reporter at Axios, where he writes a weekly newsletter called Axios Sneak Peek. He covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF COLD BLOOD'S \"UNDERSTANDING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Swan, national political reporter at Axios, where he writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peek newsletter and covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. You have a lot of sources within the Trump administration. What's in it for the sources to talk with you? SWAN: All sorts of different motivations, and you've got to be wary of all of them. At the start of the Trump administration, there was a lot of very, very brutal warfare between senior officials. You had, you know, Steve Bannon in open warfare with Jared Kushner, and then Reince Priebus was sort of thrown in there. And so you've had a number of different camps and factions within the White House, certainly for the first year, and they were just shooting at each other and their allies. And so a lot of things were very clearly aides trying to pick off other aides and other things like that. Another motivation - and this is by no means unique to the Trump White House - people, occasionally, who work in the administration are horrified by certain policy actions. And by exposing them and leaking them out, you know, my sense is they're doing that to try and stop them from coming to fruition. And then I think there's another kind of group of people who - sometimes I don't even know why. I think they just enjoy - you know, sometimes late-night conversations feel like therapy - sort of 11:00 at night, and maybe they've had a couple of glasses of scotch, and they're depressed and worn out. And you develop these kind of weird relationships with sources, that they feel that they can vent to you. And my thing has always been, I'll talk to anyone. I'm just maniacal about making sure that they're protected and that they know that I will never in any - under any circumstance betray their confidence. I'm also, by the way, going to do my due diligence on what they're telling me. For a lot of people, my working assumption is false until proven otherwise. GROSS: You're a national political reporter and Axios, and Axios has an HBO series that returns this Sunday night. In the first season, you and your colleague at Axios, Jim VandeHei, who's a co-founder of Axios, interviewed President Trump. And before the interview, you both talk on camera about what it's like to interview Trump. And one of the points that you make is that if you go at Trump hard, he shuts down, and also, if you ask introspective questions, those are a waste of time with him. He has to - you have to ask about topics. So tell us how those calculations figure into how you interview him. SWAN: Well, I've only interviewed him on camera once. And my observation from watching every single interview, I think, that he's ever done, basically, is that - I'll give you an example. You know, at the time when we interviewed him, the Mueller report was still very much the big story, and everyone was wondering what was going to happen. We crafted some very good, tough, well-crafted questions on the Mueller report - total waste of time. They ended up on the cutting room floor. And the reason is, it doesn't matter what you - again, come up with the best question in the world; as soon as you insert the word Mueller into the sentence, the response is going to be fake news, witch hunt, you know, a torrent of, you know, invective about Mueller and the 17 angry Democrats and all the rest of it. And no matter how many different ways that you try to come at it, it doesn't actually get you anywhere. It's a very - he's a very challenging interviewer - person to interview. And I don't think I did a particularly good job at all interviewing him, and I don't know that I'd do a much better job now. And I've never really seen a revealing interview with him. I can't think of a single one where I thought, oh, wow, that's - that one really got him in this certain area. The times when he's being tripped up is really - it's not because of - you know, I say this with all due respect to the questioners. It's not because of some brilliant interviewing skill; it's just because Trump has, you know, said what he really thinks. So, you know, the famous one where Lester Holt asked him about the firing of Comey, and Trump just blurted out that, you know, he didn't like that he was doing the Russia investigation. Again, that - I don't think that was sort of - I don't think Lester Holt would have expected that or it was the crafting of the question; it just happened to be that that day Trump happened to say what he really thought and got himself in a little bit of trouble from it. GROSS: I would imagine one of the challenges of interviewing Trump is - well, two of the challenges - one is he speaks in very stream-of-consciousness kind of way. You can ask a question, but the answer will probably go off in several different directions. And within the answer, there's likely to be several statements that just aren't accurate. And then as an interviewer, I'd imagine you'd have to decide - so are you going to try to correct each one of them or challenge him on each one of those statements that aren't accurate, you know, that aren't really factual or just kind of let that go or edit it out? Did you have to deal with that when you interviewed him? SWAN: Yeah, absolutely. And we actually made a pretty - it was my fault anyway - we made a significant mistake when - so I asked him a question at the time - I'd - so I'd been talking to a source of mine for months about this issue. They were telling me that President Trump had been asking his lawyers to do away with birthright citizenship, which is, you know, in the Constitution - basically didn't want people to be able to come to the U.S., have a baby and have them be automatically a U.S. citizen. And Trump was fixated on this idea of doing it through an executive order, so just himself with a stroke of his pen doing away with this in the Constitution. Anyway, so I thought, you know what? I haven't been able to confirm this thing. I may as well just - it was honestly an afterthought. Just going into the interview, I thought, you know, I'll just ask him about it. Why not? And to my great surprise, he just confirmed it on the spot, that, oh, yeah, we're going to do this. And I was sort of stunned, taken aback and not prepared for any kind of rigor or follow up. And, you know, he made a series of statements, you know, that - I think he said something like, we're the only country that has this, and that was a false statement. And again, because it was so newsworthy, we turned it around quickly. And again, it was my fault for not putting the brakes on and, you know, thinking it through. But we published the clip and didn't do what you just said, which is the due diligence and the fact-checking. So that was a great lesson for me. It was of - you know, something where you really - like, it was a huge black eye for me, personally, and I've thought a lot about it since then and reflected a lot on that and thought about how I can put up guardrails so that something like that never happens again. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Swan, national political reporter at Axios, where he writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peek newsletter and covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. Let's take a short break here, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ART ENSEMBLE OF CHICAGO'S \"CHARLIE M\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Swan, national political reporter at Axios, where he writes the weekly Axios Sneak Peek newsletter and covers the Trump presidency and Republicans in Congress. I want to ask you a little bit about your career. So you're from Australia, and you came here - what year did you? SWAN: 2014. GROSS: 2014, which was just a few years ago. And by 2016, like, you're covering the Trump White House - well, Trump's - 2017. So it's really, like, an amazing (laughter) - did you have to learn a lot about American government? And I'm also wondering, too, like, was it helpful for you in a way to be relatively new to America because you didn't have like a preexisting record here that you could be - that people could have preexisting thoughts about, like, oh, we don't like him because we don't like the way he reported this story? Like, you were starting fresh. SWAN: I was... GROSS: And so was the Trump White House. SWAN: Yeah. Look - I think part of it was the fact that it was a very unconventional campaign, the Trump campaign. And I remember thinking in sort of late 2015 - I sort of would look at the Hillary Clinton campaign with sort of - it seemed like an impossible fortress to penetrate. It was this huge edifice, well-defended by, you know, gatekeepers upon gatekeepers upon gatekeepers. You need to go through three gatekeepers to get to the fourth gatekeeper. And in many cases, the reporters that were covering, you know, had known the Clintons for decades, sometimes going back to Arkansas but, certainly, a lot of them, you know, back to Bill Clinton era and were just so well sourced in the whole Clinton orbit. And so what am I going to do? I didn't know anyone. You know, I'm new in Washington. I've had experience as a reporter in Australia. I knew how to develop sources. I spent my whole life, in various ways, in newsrooms because I come from a family of journalist. But I didn't have any connections or sources there. So I thought, well, you look over at the Trump campaign, and it's not a fortress at all; it's a sort of, you know - you can walk straight in. And there's, like, 10 people who matter around the president, and they're all quite chatty, and you get to know them. And he himself is, you know, addicted to media and engaging with reporters in ways that I've never seen someone who's a major party nominee do. Maybe - I guess maybe John McCain, you know, back when he was on the bus, but it's completely different with Trump handing out his cell phone to reporters and all that sort of stuff. So you get to know them, and then - I didn't expect that he was going to win the election, but I sort of woke up the - you know, the day after and sort of thought, oh, gee. All these people are going to be running the government (laughter). This is kind of interesting. So it wasn't by any particular design. It just so happened that it was a completely different campaign. If Hillary Clinton had have won the White House as everyone expected, I would not have been well-positioned to cover that White House at all. GROSS: Having come from Australia, is there anything that you find particularly surprising about how the U.S. democracy works? SWAN: Yes. The two things that I find just the most jarring are the money. The money in politics over here is just - it's this - you can't even explain it to Australians when you try. They just can't even fathom the scale of spending here and the way that you can purchase - effectively purchase offices and certainly purchase huge bumps in polling, the level of undisclosed money through, you know, 501(c)(4)s and these nonprofit groups with benign-sounding names that are incredibly well-resourced from billionaires. It's just a stunning gusher of money in politics. And the other thing is - you know, in Australia, because voting is compulsory and you get fined if you don't vote, voter turnout in Australian elections is, like, 94%. GROSS: So your father in Australia is a health and science journalist. SWAN: Yeah. Yep. GROSS: And you have an aunt and uncle who cover crime. SWAN: Yep. GROSS: When you were growing up, did you see your family doing things in their journalistic positions and their reporting positions that you found especially interesting and exciting? SWAN: One of my earliest memories - oh, gosh, I must have been very, very young. My dad exposed - there was a Dr. McBride who was a sort of hero in Australian medicine, and he was actually a fraud. He was committing scientific fraud and falsifying his evidence and things of that nature. And my dad exposed him, and for years after that, I would hear from people because, again, it would be like - I don't know what the equivalent over here would be, but this was, like, a giant of Australian medicine who my dad just completely exposed. And I saw both sides of it. Like, I saw my dad who spent 20 years in court, effectively, being sued and different stories that he's broadcast, that he's done. He's exposed other people for fraud and been in court. But he's basically spent most of my childhood in some form of litigation or another. And then I saw also, you know, the outpouring of support for him as well, and that, I think, in retrospect kind of was one of my earliest memories of journalism. You know, my - one of my first jobs was as a copy boy but also - I think I was 15 or 16 and worked at the Sunday tabloid, The Sun Herald. And I used to sit up in this room, and you had all the police scanners, you know, tapping into the police radios from around Sydney. And you had to sit there for these eight-hour shifts listening to the scanners. And you're listening to cops talk to each other, and you have to, you know, figure out when there's a story. And in a weird way, that sort of, I think, was one of my first ways of determining what stories were and what constituted news. GROSS: But all the litigation that your father faced didn't scare you off from becoming a journalist. SWAN: It sort of - not the litigation, but I actually didn't want to be a - I had no desire to be a journalist, and I sort of came to it. So I - you know, I worked, even during high school, with the newspaper and through college, but I only really solidified that I wanted to be a journalist probably at the age of 24, 25. So it wasn't like I woke up and, from the moment I was sort of - you know, could walk, I wanted to be a journalist - quite the opposite. But at the same time, my childhood was completely drenched in newspapers and news and the conversation around the table. And, again, my uncle and auntie were crime reporters and very good ones, too. So, again, it was just part of the conversation. GROSS: Jonathan Swan, thank you so much for talking with us, and thank you for your reporting. SWAN: Thanks for having me.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with lawyer and SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein and NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg about the decisions reached by the U.S. Supreme Court this term.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The Supreme Court wrapped up what turned out to be an important term yesterday. The last day was devoted to a rejection of the argument put forward by President Trump's legal team - that a president should enjoy absolute immunity from investigations, whether by state grand juries or Congress. The court ruled on lots of other big subjects with big consequences this term, including abortion, religion, immigration, LGBTQ and Native American rights. Well, here to talk us through what they will be taking away from this term, I am joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and by Tom Goldstein, an attorney who's argued before the Supreme Court and is publisher of SCOTUSblog. So with that, let me welcome you both and, Nina, hand it over to you first - your top takeaways from this term. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The biggest takeaway is that this chief justice has more control of any chief since Charles Evans Hughes in the 1930s. Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority an amazing 97% of the time. And that means that he's assigned which justices write the majority opinions. And that's an important thing because he can pick somebody who will write broadly or somebody who will write narrowly. He's the first justice who controls the narrative because he's also the chief justice. KELLY: And, Tom, your top takeaway. TOM GOLDSTEIN: I think it's that the chief justice also agreed with the more liberal justices in several really big cases just to not do very much, that they were very happy to have the term not be momentous on a lot of those questions. There were big exceptions for LGBTQ rights and employment discrimination. And on the other hand, the conservatives must be really happy with rulings on religious liberty for individuals and for institutions like religious schools. KELLY: Although there was plenty this term for conservatives not to be happy about. And I think that maybe surprised a lot of people because Donald Trump managed to get two of his nominees onto the court. A lot of people were watching and thinking we'd be hearing about all these major 5-4 rulings. We didn't really see that. Nina, why not? TOTENBERG: Mainly because the chief justice moved with the liberals to create in some key cases a sort of limited center. And the conservatives didn't agree with each other. There were 16 separate opinions in those 5-4 and 6-3 cases that were filed by the conservatives. And when they were in the majority, they didn't always agree with the reasoning on the outcome. And when they were in dissent, they were writing solo dissents all over the place. And they were taking hundreds and hundreds of pages to do it. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the left in the Supreme Court is on defense, and they know it. They are just trying to have the law not get worse, and so they stick together. So all four of the more liberal justices voted together at least 80% of the time. The conservatives are on offense but disagree on how fast they can go and where they should go. And so they don't have anything like that level of agreement. As Nina suggested, the two most conservative justices, Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, wrote 500 separate pages of concurring and dissenting opinions. KELLY: So let me turn us to the substance of what they ruled on. And was there a decision that we might be talking about years or decades to come? Did we get a ruling of the stature and longevity of, say, a Roe v. Wade or a Brown v. Board of Education? Tom. GOLDSTEIN: We probably did when it comes to the presidential powers cases, the Trump tax cases. But in general, it was a very incremental term because of the chief justice's agreement with the left. So the court agreed to stick narrowly to a prior precedent on abortion rights without talking about where Roe v. Wade is going. It took a pass on a major gun rights case. It rejected the Trump administration's reasons for eliminating the DACA immigration program but gave the administration a further chance. And even on the tax return cases, it rejected the Trump administration's broadest arguments but left open the real possibility that House Democrats are going to get very, very little of the president's financial records. KELLY: Nina, you want to jump in? TOTENBERG: The church-state area is the one area where they made huge inroads for the conservative agenda and accomplished, I think, most of what the conservative evangelicals and Catholics wanted in the area of church-state relations. They moved dramatically to accommodate religion rather than sticking with the high wall of separation of church and state that had been the standard operating procedure for a very long time. KELLY: So we all head out for summer break now or at least the justices and the people who cover them. You two, I guess, will get a few weeks of rest now I hope. But how does this set us up going forward on the very biggest issues in front of this country? I'm thinking about abortion. I'm thinking about the election that's looming and how President Trump and Joe Biden might use it. Nina. TOTENBERG: Well, Joe Biden will undoubtedly try to use the court and the potential for more appointments as an issue. But Democrats just don't vote on this issue, not yet - perhaps they should, but they haven't in the past. KELLY: Tom. TOTENBERG: Yeah. I think that one of the ways that Chief Justice Roberts is so savvy is he has kept the Supreme Court out of the political picture, out of the election. It'll be very hard for the left to run against the Supreme Court. But conservatives have always, always, always recognized the importance of it and how much they can accomplish on issues like abortion gun and religion. So I expect the president to say, I need more appointments, you need evangelicals to turn out and vote for me. KELLY: Attorney Tom Goldstein, who has argued many times before the Supreme Court, and NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, who has covered the court for many years. Thanks so much to both of you. GOLDSTEIN: Thanks. TOTENBERG: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump uses big rallies to reach voters. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden prefers meeting people face-to-face. But the pandemic has moved both of their campaigns online.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump's favorite way to reach voters is with big rallies. For the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, it's meeting people face-to-face. Both of those things are impossible right now, so our reporters have been spending a lot of time on the virtual campaign trail to bring us an update on how the race is playing out remotely. Here are NPR's Asma Khalid and, starting us off, NPR's Tamara Keith. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If you're a Trump supporter longing for the excitement and MAGA kinship of a rally, the Trump campaign has tried to create the next best thing: a whole world online where Trump is flawless, Republicans are saviors and Democrats and Joe Biden are wrong and dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: This is your source for real news, not fake news, straight from the campaign and the president himself. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: The Biden campaign isn't creating its own universe. They're trying to reach as many people as they can in as many places as they can in this weird moment when Biden and his wife Jill can't travel on planes or hop on campaign buses. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So we're trying something new - virtual visits from our home here in Wilmington, Del. KHALID: That means trying to find people who aren't super dialed-in politics, but might be troubled by President Trump's response to the coronavirus. KEITH: The team Trump webcasts begin every night at 8:00, simulcast on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and in the campaign's new app, starting with a slick intro that's part campaign ad, part movie trailer, part cable news show open. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to Team Trump Online. KEITH: The shows are hosted by campaign aides and members of the Trump family, including daughter-in-law Lara Trump. There are big-name guests, like Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who are teed up to amplify the Trump message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARA TRUMP: Why do Democrats insist on keeping people out of work, holding them hostage over ridiculous demands? MITCH MCCONNELL: You know, I don't know what it is, but I think you're right... KEITH: It looks like cable news, but in reality, it's more like an elaborate infomercial. Graphics in the lower third of the screen rotate through discount codes to buy Trump merch, prompts to download the Trump 2020 app, or to text the campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) L TRUMP: We're going to take one last quick break. Stick around for more Team Trump Online. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: During the coronavirus pandemic, Joe Biden criticized President Trump's China travel ban. JOE BIDEN: Hysterical xenophobia. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He was dead wrong. KEITH: The commercials are a mix of pro-Trump and anti-Biden campaign ads, information about how to volunteer, and another reminder to download the app from Donald Trump Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP JR: The Democrats and the fake news media hate my father more than they love our country, and they're doing whatever it takes to tear us down at the expense of the American people. That's why we need every American patriot to step up and join our fight. Just download our app. KHALID: The Biden campaign doesn't have anything akin to its own version of a primetime cable lineup. Democrats readily admit that the Trump digital operation dwarfs Biden's. His campaign is putting out a mix of virtual programming: some campaign trainings with former presidential candidates, like Beto O'Rourke or Pete Buttigieg, some Zoom fundraisers and some virtual roundtables, like this one at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Thank you for joining this Biden for president event. We'd like to thank our guests, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan... KHALID: Three governors joined Biden to talk about their state's response to COVID-19 and what the federal government ought to do to help. Biden led the discussion from his patio at home. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: That's the geese you hear in the background. JILL BIDEN: (Laughter). JOE BIDEN: There's a little pond out here. Most Canadian geese are trying to get away from the virus. Anyway... KHALID: The central message here, and on pretty much every platform, is that this election is a referendum on how President Trump has handled the virus. Here's Biden on \"Good Morning America.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GOOD MORNING AMERICA\") JOE BIDEN: He's been incompetent, the way in which he's responded to it. We have 80,000 deaths. We have more deaths, we have more of the virus than any nation in the world. What's the story here? KEITH: Meanwhile, Trump has all the advantages of incumbency. With the White House COVID testing everyone who comes near him, Trump is flying Air Force One to swing states for official events that have all the contours of his rallies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF LEE GREENWOOD'S \"GOD BLESS THE U.S.A\") KEITH: Trump was in Pennsylvania visiting a manufacturer of protective equipment used by health care workers. But the walkup music was straight from his rally playlist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. (APPLAUSE) DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. All that social distancing. Look at you people all spread out 6 feet. That's pretty impressive. KEITH: And his speech even included the rally tradition of jeering at the press in the back of the room. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: And the press doesn't ever talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. They are right there. They don't want to talk about it. They are a disaster. KHALID: Biden hasn't traveled anywhere for the last couple of months. Instead, he often beams into TV shows from his basement, flanked by books and family photos. His strategy is about maximizing reach, which often means lots of interviews in battleground states with local TV, which remains a trusted news source across the political spectrum. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Welcome back. In an op-ed published Monday in The Washington Post, former Vice President Joe Biden... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Amanda (ph) sat down with former Vice President Joe Biden about his team's efforts. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: He's not on the campaign trail right now because of the pandemic, but he did grant us an interview. Here in Arizona... KHALID: Last week, Biden did interviews with stations in Nevada, North Carolina and Arizona. He insists that staying indoors while Trump is on the road hasn't changed the race, and that's what he told KLAS TV in Las Vegas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Matter of fact, in a bizarre way, the president - the more he's out there, the more he hurts himself, I think. KHALID: Biden's criticism of the president isn't just about how he's managed the public health crisis, but about how he's handling the economic fallout. It's a message he delivered on the CBS affiliate in Phoenix. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: We're in serious trouble. We have 1 in 5 people in the United States America is unemployed. We're trying very hard to figure out how to get them the help they need. KEITH: The Trump campaign is now training all its firepower on damaging Biden. According to the Facebook ad library, last week the Trump campaign spent more than twice as much on Facebook ads as the Biden campaign. And it included a three-day test of a dizzying array of hits on Biden. Some portrayed him as old and mentally unfit, others as a puppet of China. KHALID: Teddy Goff is a Democratic strategist who ran Barack Obama's 2012 digital operation. He concedes that Donald Trump is good at capturing attention, but he's skeptical that that's actually good politics. TEDDY GOFF: Donald Trump can send a bizarre tweet that kind of ping-pongs around the right-wing Twittersphere and gets, you know, 50,000 retweets. And it probably doesn't persuade a single voter. And it might actually turn off a couple of voters. KEITH: The Trump campaign isn't really doing persuasion. It's firing up the base, and finding people who support Trump who didn't vote last time and getting them to vote this time. Stefan Smith, who was the online engagement director for the Buttigieg campaign, has spent a lot of time looking at the Trump app and the team Trump video offerings. STEFAN SMITH: This is about protecting your voters from anything that might - maybe not persuade them to vote for someone else, but might keep them from turning out. Keep them angry and you keep them engaged. KEITH: President Trump faces incredibly strong headwinds in his reelection bid: a pandemic and a deep recession. His campaign is counting on being able to overcome it all, at least in part, with a digital behemoth it's been building and perfecting since 2015. KHALID: Joe Biden doesn't have the social media dominance or the instincts to entertain and outrage that Donald Trump does. He's the challenger trying to overcome that with a brand built on empathy and experience. And his campaign is counting on the idea that in a crisis, that's what people want. I'm Asma Khalid.

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Trump are engaged in a heated argument over which one is taking a tougher line on China.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke, Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Trump are engaged in a heated argument over which one is taking a tougher line on China. \"Nobody has been tougher on China than me,\" President Trump proclaimed at Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. When the Trump administration has been criticized for how it has handled the coronavirus outbreak, the president has been inclined at times to blame the Chinese and then accuse his Democratic opponent Joe Biden of being \"weak on China.\" Biden's campaign has been trying to turn that argument back on Trump, seeing lots of material to work with as the president has touted an improved trading relationship with China. A side effect of the coronavirus outbreak is that China has become a powerful election year issue. Who's \"tough on China\" has taken on a broader political meaning, with a fight not just about longstanding trade and labor concerns, but also a global health pandemic originating in that country and whether the U.S. response was adequate. A recent ad from a super PAC supporting Trump plays menacing music as a narrator warns the audience that \"for 40 years Joe Biden has been wrong about China.\" An image of Biden with his son Hunter flashes across the screen, and the ad ends with an image of the Chinese flag billowing over Biden's face. The Trump campaign has often pointed to Hunter Biden's past business dealings in China as evidence of corruption, and the focus on China allows it to dive back into broader criticism of the younger Biden's foreign business dealings. After that ad aired, the Biden campaign responded with one of its own, saying: \"Trump rolled over for the Chinese.\" Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime \u2014 and now we're paying the price. pic.twitter.com/aCxcqQqUqw \"Trump praised the Chinese 15 times in January and February as the coronavirus spread across the world,\" the narrator says as images of Trump flash across the screen. That followed an ad from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge criticizing Trump for \"giving China his trust.\" But this \"who's tougher on China\" ad war began in earnest with an inflammatory video the Trump campaign released in early April that implied that Gary Locke, the former governor of Washington and U.S. ambassador to Beijing, was Chinese, even though he was born in Seattle. That ad showed an image of Biden clinking wine glasses with China's leader Xi Jinping as it warned viewers that \"Biden protected China's feelings.\" The tit for tat is indicative of how China has become a central campaign issue. But perhaps more importantly, it shows how there seems to be bipartisan agreement that projecting a strongman image against China has political benefit. A recent report from the Pew Research Center finds that more Americans have a negative attitude toward China now than at any other point since they began tracking this question in 2006. The polling shows that two-thirds of Americans now have a negative view of China; that compares to just 47% in 2017. \"The future is going to involve a lot of second-guessing about the relationship between the U.S. and China. That's clear,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. \"Who people finally decide they trust more, I think that's up for grabs.\" He predicts that China will be the second-most important issue in the presidential campaign, behind only the handling of COVID-19. And both campaigns, Luntz says, understand that political uncertainty. \"Both of them are going for the jugular,\" he added. \"Both of them are trying to show that the other side is weak on China or misinterprets the intentions of China or would handle China badly in the future.\" Some Trump supporters have begun calling the presumptive Democratic nominee \"Beijing Biden.\" Many Democrats have praised Biden's most recent ad as a brilliant show of force that rips apart the president's attempt to prove that he held China accountable for the virus. \"I am delighted he pushed back,\" said Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. \"I think it's right to define the issue and say we're not going to take punches on this question.\" Greenberg said Biden needed to respond to Trump's attempt to \"rewrite history\" on China, specifically at the outset of the pandemic. \"It's going to make it difficult for [Trump] to keep engaging this issue when he's not been very transparent, and been so weak in dealing with China,\" he added. \"So I think that was an important battle to win early.\" But he doesn't believe that who's tougher on China is actually the framework in which the general election will be waged. The escalation of these ads worries Christine Chen, executive director of APIAVote, a political engagement group focused on Asian and Pacific Islander Americans. \"The last six weeks we've seen an increase of hate crimes, hate incidences, blaming of anyone that looks of Asian or Chinese,\" she said. Chen is concerned that both Biden and Trump's ads have exacerbated the environment. \"I understand the natural instinct is for a campaign to respond to another campaign or another ad,\" she said, referring to Biden's recent China ad. But Chen thinks the tone was a mistake. \"I don't think Biden was intending to be xenophobic,\" she added. \"But at the same time, I think it was a misstep.\" A couple of other Democratic activists NPR spoke with were far more critical, wondering why Biden, they say, had stooped to Trump's level. They felt that Trump consistently used xenophobic language, but Biden's ad troubled them because, intentional or not, it seemed to engage in similar language. They pointed to a specific line in the ad about Trump's travel ban where the narrator says: \"Trump let in 40,000 travelers from China into America after he signed it. Not exactly airtight.\" \"It's not a race to see who can be more tough on China or the Chinese people,\" said Alton Wang, a Los Angeles-based community activist. \"I think it's a race to see who could be a more competent president.\" In a statement, the Biden campaign pointed out that it has \"held Donald Trump's feet to the fire over his use of xenophobic labels.\" The statement also said, in part, \"Our ad levels substantive and deserved criticisms at Donald Trump for believing discredited Chinese government propaganda about containment of the virus, something Joe Biden publicly warned him not to fall for.\"",

            "article_content": "The global response to COVID-19 has made clear that the fear of contracting disease has an ugly cousin: xenophobia. As the coronavirus has spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind, manifesting in plummeting sales at Chinese restaurants, near-deserted Chinatown districts and racist bullying against people perceived to be Chinese. We asked our listeners whether they had experienced this kind of coronavirus-related racism and xenophobia firsthand. And judging by the volume of emails, comments and tweets we got in response, the harassment has been intense for Asian Americans across the country \u2014 regardless of ethnicity, location or age. A common theme across our responses: Public transit has been really hostile. Roger Chiang, who works in San Francisco, recalled a white woman glaring at him on the train to work, covering her nose and mouth. When he told her in a joking tone that he didn't have the coronavirus, she replied that she \"wasn't racist \u2014 she just didn't want to get sick.\" Allison Park from Brooklyn told us that when visiting D.C., she saw a man making faces at her on the Metro train. She tried to move away from him, but he wouldn't stop. After a while, she said, he confronted her outright, saying: \"Get out of here. Go back to China. I don't want none of your swine flu here.\" A week later, on a Muni train in San Francisco, another man yelled the same thing to her \u2014 \"Go back to China\" \u2014 and even threatened to shoot her. Even a single cough or sneeze can trigger harassment. Amy Jiravisitcul from Boston said a man on a bus muttered about \"diseased Chinese people\" when she sneezed into her sleeve. When she confronted him, he told her: \"Cover your fucking mouth.\" When South San Franciscan Diane Tran sneezed into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, she said a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her. Children have been targeted, too \u2014 by other children and adults alike. Devin Cabanilla, from Seattle, told us that a Costco food sample vendor told his Korean wife and mixed-race son to \"get away\" from the samples, questioning whether they had come from China. Company executives later apologized to his family, but he's still shaken. \"It just reminds me that when people look at us, they don't see us as American,\" he said. Thirteen-year-old Sara Aalgaard told us that since the outbreak, many middle-school classmates of hers have been targeting the small population of Asian Americans at her school in Middletown, Conn. \"People call us 'corona,' \" she said, or ask if they eat dogs. Rebecca Wen from North Brunswick, N.J., told us that her 9-year-old son reported that his 11-year-old classmate said: \"You're Chinese, so you must have the coronavirus.\" The anti-Asian harassment isn't limited to the U.S., either. International outlets have reported harassment in majority-white countries like Australia, where parents in Melbourne refused to let Asian doctors treat their children, and Canada, where around 10,000 Toronto-area people signed a petition calling for the local school district to track and isolate Chinese-Canadian students who may have traveled to China for the Lunar New Year. In Germany, Thea Suh said that when she sat down on her train to work, the person sitting next to turned away from her and covered his face. A few days later, a woman told her to move her \"corona-riddled body\" elsewhere. Not once did someone step in to help, she said. \"I have also not seen or heard any German politician or major influencer coming to our defenses,\" she said. \"And I feel like as a part of the so-called model minority, we are being left alone.\" That's another common theme from the responses we got: Witnesses and bystanders were slow to intervene. Allison Park remembers that when the man on the D.C. Metro told her to go back to China, the train was nearly two-thirds full, but no one said anything. At best, she got some sympathetic looks. Amy Jiravisitcul said that the other passengers ignored the yelling, which made her wonder whether they thought she was just making a scene. And when the harassment has passed, unease still lingers. Jane Hong from New York told us that when she and a fellow Korean American were walking from lunch, she heard a man screaming \"yuck\" in their direction. Now, she notices whenever people on the street look at her for more than a passing glance. \"I don't know if 'paranoid' is the word,\" Hong said. \"Now it's in my head. I wonder if they are thinking, 'I have to stay away from her, I don't want to walk near her.' Now that the seed has been planted in my head, it's hard to not have that thought cross my mind.\" For more on xenophobia and coronavirus, listen to this week's episode of the Code Switch podcast. We hear from some of these folks, as well as Erika Lee, a historian at the University of Minnesota who studies history, immigration and epidemics.",

In her normal life, Erika Strauss Chavarria is a high school Spanish teacher in Columbia, Maryland. But when schools closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, she moved her classes online, and found another way to help. In March, she founded Columbia Community Care, a grassroots network of neighbors helping neighbors. What started as a Facebook group with about 40 members has become a network of more than 4,000 people. The group runs five sites where it distributes donated groceries and household items, and two pop-up food pantries where volunteers can safely shop to deliver groceries to families who can't leave their homes. Every day, people post offers of help \u2014 from free books and bicycles to donations of fruits and vegetables. One of the group's taglines is \"choose compassion.\" All over the world, people like Erika are mobilizing to help each other through the pandemic. At the same time, though, we also see another kind of response: People placing their own self-interest above everything else, sometimes to the point of putting others in harm's way. There are those who have even tried to profit from the pandemic, like the man in New York accused of stockpiling N95 masks to sell at an inflated price. Such stories of alleged wrongdoing are often what get our attention. So we take action to curtail the selfish bad actor. Legislators pass laws that take aim at transgressors. Regulators and police departments come up with rules that punish lawbreakers. Parents and teachers discipline truants. But what about the helpers like Erika \u2014 have we forgotten them? What are the costs when we design our public and economic policies to focus on the crooks and wrongdoers? Sam Bowles, a behavioral economist and author of The Moral Economy: Why Good Incentives Are No Substitute for Good Citizens, says it's a mistake to focus on the bad, and to ignore the good in people. \"Self-interest in markets and in relations with government isn't going to be a good way to organize the future,\" says Bowles. \"[COVID-19] tells us that we have to rely on other things \u2014 communities, neighborhoods, obligations we have to each other \u2014 which are not self-interested. That's what we're seeing is fundamentally getting people through this.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we explore how laws written to govern the lawless end up changing the behavior of the lawful \u2014 for the worse. And we ask, what would happen if public policy was designed to care less about the man who sold his masks for a profit? What would happen if we put people like Erika at the center of our thinking instead?

At the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Japanese soccer fans did something striking: they started going through the stadium, cleaning up the trash that was left behind. A lot of people were baffled by this behavior, but Michele Gelfand, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, sees their actions in the frame of what she refers to as \"tight\" and \"loose\" cultures. Tight cultures, she says, are more rules-oriented. Loose cultures are more permissive. \"Countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, and Austria tend to veer tight,\" she says. \"And countries like New Zealand, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Greece tended to veer loose. And of course, all countries have tight and loose elements.\" Gelfand studies how individuals, organizations, communities, and nations are shaped by their cultures. Recently, she has looked at the coronavirus pandemic through the lens of tight and loose cultures. The U.S., she says, is a loose culture with ambivalence toward measures that erode our autonomy and liberty. \"The [coronavirus] response so far echoes our loose cultural programming. It's been conflicted. It's been unstandardized, it's been uncoordinated,\" she says. \"We really do need to change our cultural programming in this context. The problem is that ... it's hard for us to give up liberty for constraint. But it's critical for our safety.\" Additional Resources: Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight And Loose Cultures Wire Our World by Michele Gelfand, 2018 \"Differences Between Tight And Loose Cultures: A 33-nation Study,\" by Michele Gelfand et al., Cornell University, ILR School, 2011 \"To Survive The Coronavirus, The United States Must Tighten Up,\" by Michele Gelfand, The Boston Globe, 2020",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., stands onstage with President Trump during a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C. His allegiance to Trump has left some moderate voters feeling snubbed and switching allegiances to Democrat Jaime Harrison. Even the most optimistic Democrats didn't have South Carolina on the list of Republican U.S. Senate seats they seriously thought they could flip at the start of 2020. But a little more than two weeks out from Election Day, it's within reach. Democrat Jaime Harrison \u2014 a 44-year-old former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, congressional aide and lobbyist \u2014 has risen in the polls and is giving three-term incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham something to worry about this election. Make no doubt: South Carolina remains a solidly Republican state, and since Graham was first elected in 2002, he has won easily every time. What has changed this year is Graham himself, specifically how he has aligned himself within the Republican Party. For most of his political life, Graham appealed to the middle \u2014 those more moderate South Carolina voters who saw him as someone who could cut through partisan politics. The best symbol of this was his close friendship with the late GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But now McCain is gone, and Graham's most prominent new relationship is with none other than President Trump, who not only clashed with McCain on issues but also mocked and ridiculed his reputation as a military hero who survived years of torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. At the start of the 2016 campaign, Trump famously said, \"I like people that weren't captured, OK?\" At the time, Graham was running against him for the GOP presidential nomination, sugarcoating none of his critiques. Donald Trump was \"unfit for office\" and a \"religious bigot,\" according to Graham back then. One Harrison TV spot shows clips of Graham from the 2016 campaign, when he seemed appalled by Trump. Then, the ad cuts to more recent statements where Graham proclaims, \"No, I don't think he's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. I like the president. I am like the happiest dude in America right now.\" Some South Carolina voters, like real estate agent Melinda Nicholson, are mystified by Graham moving from such a close friendship with McCain to his current friendship with Trump. \"I'm just not pleased,\" Nicholson says of Graham. \"It's like he's Trump's minion, and I don't like that.\" That opinion comes from a Democrat, but Nicholson quickly explains that she has voted for Graham every time he has run for Senate. This year, she says, \"I'm voting for Jaime Harrison.\" The incumbent's vocal defense of Trump has prompted Democrats from around the U.S. to make online donations to Harrison. With that national support, Harrison has been able to mount an aggressive media campaign, especially with television ads \u2014 some of them biographical, introducing himself to voters, and some of them classic attack ads going after Graham. But he has also had the money to build a campaign organization and reach out to voters through social media, radio, direct mail and phone calls. He went from being more than 15 points down early in the year to virtually wiping out Graham's lead in a series of polls as the campaign reached its final month. Then came the blockbuster news that really put Harrison in the spotlight \u2014 a record-shattering haul in the third quarter, bringing in $57 million and topping the previous single-quarter fundraising record in any Senate race ever, set by Beto O'Rourke in Texas during the 2018 midterms. It's more money than Harrison \u2014 who hopes to be the first African American Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from a Southern state \u2014 could even hope to spend in the final weeks of the campaign. The surge in gifts to Harrison certainly got Graham's attention. He has even used appearances on Fox News to urge viewers to contribute dollars, as he did in late September on the conservative cable network: \"Every liberal in the country wants to take me out.\" He then spelled out the address to his website, making the plea very clear. The incumbent senator spent the past week chairing the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for nominee Amy Coney Barrett, and he even alluded to Harrison's fundraising success during those proceedings when the topic of campaign finance came up. \"I don't know what's going on out there, but I can tell you there's a lot of money being raised in this campaign,\" he said at one point, speaking to the nominee and, seemingly, everyone at the whole hearing. \"I'd like to know where the hell some of it's coming from.\" Early voting in South Carolina is now underway. In the Charleston area, people have been casting ballots at the local sports coliseum. Mike O'Connell, 54, is a police officer who describes himself as an independent who is conservative. He voted to reelect Graham, explaining, \"He supports the police, I know that for sure. Supreme Court, that's a big issue, and even though I'm independent, I would prefer that Republicans hold on to the Senate.\" The Supreme Court is a motivator for anti-Graham voters too. Four years ago, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Graham said it was right to deny President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, a confirmation vote because it was an election year. He said then, and has repeated in recent years, that it was a principle he'd adhere to even under Trump. He broke that pledge by fully backing the nomination currently before the Senate in the final days of the 2020 election. That broken promise is an issue for voter Brenda Toohey, a 56-year-old nurse practitioner from Mount Pleasant, S.C. She says events of the past four years have made her an even stronger Democrat. \"I think that Lindsey Graham is a hypocrite for letting this vote go for the Supreme Court. It's very concerning.\" The big risk for Graham is that this election alters his usual approach to winning. He has always relied on moderate voters \u2014 be they Republicans, independents or Democrats. They famously helped him survive primary challenges over the years from far more conservative Republican hopefuls. This year, many moderates are upset with him and his closeness to the president. Charleston attorney Andy Savage says that his politics are mostly right in the middle and that he regular splits his ballot between Democratic and Republican  candidates. But one constant had been his unwavering support for Graham, as a voter and as a contributor. \"Financially, we supported him,\" Savage said. \"You know, all the bumper stickers and all that sort of stuff in politics that you do. We were all in.\" Not this year. \"We were always eyeball to eyeball on the issues,\" he says. Then the senator \"just veered off into Never Never Land.\" And in the process, Savage says, Graham signaled to voters like him that the senator doesn't need them anymore. Now, it appears, Graham can't spare much of any support.",

            "article_content": "Since being elected in 2002, Graham has won his seat in South Carolina easily every time. This year, Democrats see an opportunity.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Republican Senator Ben Sasse spoke at length about the president this week. He was on a call with constituents in his state of Nebraska. Sasse said the president, quote, \"kisses dictators' butts.\" He said the president flirts with white supremacists. He said the president treats the presidency like a business opportunity. Here is audio of the Republican senator obtained by the Washington Examiner. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEN SASSE: The debate is not going to be, Ben Sasse, why were you so mean to Donald Trump? It's going to be, what the heck were any of us thinking that selling a TV-obsessed, narcissistic individual to the American people was a good idea? INSKEEP: Senator Sasse also said he believes that President Trump is likely to lose this election and - this was his real concern - take the Senate down with him. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has been following this year's Senate elections. Hi there, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: Republicans do have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, which means they could even lose a couple and still keep it. Are they in serious risk of losing that majority? DAVIS: Yes, because it's getting harder and harder for Republicans because the Senate races in play for Democrats just keep expanding as we get closer to the election, while the map has never really expanded for Republicans. They have just one likely pick-up in Alabama. That's where incumbent Senator Doug Jones is unlikely to be able to overcome the conservative lean of his state in a presidential election year. Trump's still very popular there. If you presume Jones loses - and most election forecasters do - Democrats would need to net gain four seats. And that would just get them the smallest of 50-seat majorities. And that would also be dependent upon Joe Biden winning the White House because in a tight Senate, the vice president breaks that tie. So... INSKEEP: Right. DAVIS: ...It's still a pretty tall order for Democrats. It would require defeating a lot of veteran incumbents, which is why Republicans are holding out hope that even if Trump does, in fact, lose, they can hold the Senate just with a smaller majority. INSKEEP: So what are the races that will decide if the Senate flips or not? DAVIS: There's always been a trio of states that Democrats think they have the best chance in. That's Arizona, Colorado and Maine. North Carolina has also been really competitive. But Republicans thought they recently caught a break there because the Democrat in the race, Cal Cunningham, had been caught up in some personal scandals involving extramarital relationships. But, Steve, it hasn't done anything to dent his lead in the polls, so the conventional wisdom there not always applying. The big picture in all of these states - President Trump. He's unpopular. He could lose all of them. And it's just really hard for a Senate candidate to outperform the top of the ticket anymore. In 2016, not a single state split their tickets between who they voted for senator and president, which party. And broadly speaking, in wave elections - and this could be a wave election - competitive races overwhelmingly break in one party's favor. So those fundamentals are benefiting Democrats this time around. INSKEEP: We've been watching these Supreme Court hearings for Amy Coney Barrett all week. It's been presumed we know how the vote is going to go... DAVIS: Yep. INSKEEP: ...In the Senate and that the senators are talking to the country in an election year. Is that having any effect on the Senate races? DAVIS: It has in one clear way, money. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the politics around filling this seat has fueled so much money into Democratic campaigns that there really isn't an under-resourced Senate campaign out there. One great example of that is in South Carolina, where the Democratic candidate just set a record for the most fundraising ever. And our colleague, Don Gonyea, has been there looking into that race. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Make no doubt, South Carolina is a solidly Republican state. And since being elected in 2002, Senator Lindsey Graham has won easily every time. But this year, Democrats see an opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Fired up. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Ready to go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Fired up. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Ready to go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Fired up. GONYEA: This is a Democratic Party get-out-the-vote event in the parking lot of a shopping center in North Charleston this week. That chant actually originated here during the Obama campaign in '08. Democrats think Senate candidate Jaime Harrison can build the same coalition Obama did, including independents and even moderate Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) JAIME HARRISON: I grew up in this house. My grandparents didn't have much, but they raised me right. GONYEA: Some Harrison ads simply introduced him. He's African American. He won a scholarship to Yale. After law school, he was a congressional aide, state party chair and a lobbyist. He's a polished campaigner. But a big reason this race is competitive is Senator Graham himself. Back in 2016, Graham was running for president and called Donald Trump unfit for office, a religious bigot and more. The Harrison campaign has ads out featuring Graham saying all that back then and now saying this. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot. I like the president. I am, like, the happiest dude in America right now. (LAUGHTER) GONYEA: Democrats from far and wide have been sending dollars to the Harrison campaign. In the third quarter, they shattered a Senate campaign fundraising record, hitting $57 million, blowing past the previous mark set two years ago by Beto O'Rourke in Texas. Graham has been going on Fox News, pleading for donations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: Every liberal in the country wants to take me out - lindseygraham.com. If you want to help me, help me by going to my website. GONYEA: The senator who spent this week chairing the Supreme Court confirmation hearings even alluded to Harrison's fundraising success during those proceedings when the topic of campaign finance came up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: I don't know what's going on out there. But I can tell you there's a lot of money being raised in this campaign. I'd like to know where the hell some of it is coming from. GONYEA: Early voting in the state is underway. In the Charleston area, people have been casting ballots at the local sports coliseum. Fifty-four-year-old Michael Connell (ph) is a police officer who describes himself as an independent but conservative. He voted for Lindsey Graham. MICHAEL CONNELL: He supports the police. I know that for sure. The Supreme Court is a big issue. And even though I'm independent, I would prefer that the Republicans hold onto the Senate. GONYEA: He says he doesn't doubt the polls that show it's a close race. The Supreme Court is a motivator for anti-Graham voters, too. Four years ago, Graham said it was right to deny an Obama court pick in an election year. He said repeatedly he'd do the exact same thing under President Trump. Of course, he broke that promise with no apology. Voter Melinda Nickelson (ph) works as a real estate agent. She's a Democrat. Her choice in the Senate race? MELINDA NICKELSON: I'm voting for Jaime Harrison. GONYEA: I asked her if she's ever voted for Senator Graham in the past. NICKELSON: I have. I voted for him every time. But, you know, I'm just not pleased with what's happening now. And he seems to be Trump's minion. And I don't like that. GONYEA: Such former Graham supporters are why this race is close. Now that he's courting hardcore conservatives and the Trump base, its many longtime moderate backers, be they Republican or Democrat, who are feeling snubbed. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Charleston. INSKEEP: OK. We're back with congressional correspondent Susan Davis. I have to ask, are Republicans fearful of losing even South Carolina in the Senate? DAVIS: They are. You know, President Trump is an anchor there like he is everywhere else. Although, he's still expected to win the state. And Republicans are hopeful that's enough to keep Graham alive there. But as Ben Sasse said, 2020 could be a blue tsunami. And if it is, that's what it would take to defeat an incumbent like Graham in a state as conservative as South Carolina. INSKEEP: And we'll underline the other thing that Ben Sasse said, that who controls the Senate is an extremely important question, especially if the presidency were to change hands. DAVIS: You better believe it. INSKEEP: Susan, thank you very much. DAVIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Susan Davis. (SOUNDBITE OF GOGO PENGUIN'S \"WEIRD CAT\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden gives a speech about coronavirus policy from his home state of Delaware. Here's a recap of what he says.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The leading Democratic presidential candidates slammed the Trump administration today for its response to the worsening coronavirus pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) JOE BIDEN: This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president. BERNIE SANDERS: Unfortunately, in this time of international crisis, it is clear to me, at least, that we have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country. CHANG: That, of course, was former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Both of them delivered remarks today on the virus. And NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid joins us now. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: All right, let's start with Joe Biden. You were there for his remarks in Delaware this afternoon. Tell us more about what he said. KHALID: Well, he was very critical of the Trump administration. He essentially called the administration's failure of testing a colossal failure. He talked about the need to have more of a global coordinated response rather than playing into xenophobic fears and travel bans. He outlined a sort of very large, detailed, specific policy plan that calls for widespread free testing and specifically says that there should be mobile testing sites - about at least, I think, 10 per state. And he outlined that Trump was welcome to adopt his policies, but again, he was very, very critical of what the president has done to date. You know, he said that no president can really promise to prevent future outbreaks, but if he were president, he promises that he would be better prepared, and he would help the country recover better foremost by leading with science. And as you know, the Trump administration has been widely criticized by Democrats for their failure to sort of believe all of... CHANG: Right. KHALID: ...Scientific evidence. CHANG: OK, and I understand that Sanders spoke about 90 minutes later. Tell us more about what he said. KHALID: Well, he called on President Trump to declare the situation a national emergency. He talked a lot about solidarity and reiterated a lot of his social safety packages such as - you know, he's advocated for \"Medicare for All,\" paid sick leave. These are policies he has long promoted, but he stressed the urgency of having them in place now for the country to be able to deal with the coronavirus. He again also talked about leaning on scientists and for Congress to take a much more active hand. He criticized the administration's response, you know, as we heard earlier, as incompetent and reckless. CHANG: What about the pretty serious economic fallout that's been happening because of this virus? Did either Biden or Sanders address that? KHALID: They did. They both spoke about the coronavirus not only as a public health emergency but, really, as an economic emergency at this point. They both have called for expanding unemployment benefits. They both have called for guaranteed paid sick time for workers. And these are issues - you know, they feel like the economic consequences are important. But Joe Biden also stressed that, really, in order to protect the economy, the country - you know, the leadership of this country has a responsibility to protect the health of the American public as well. CHANG: And I imagine the White House might have been listening in. I mean, has the Trump administration been responding to any of these criticisms? KHALID: Certainly. The Trump campaign very quickly put out statements critical both of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden's statements today. They have strongly defended what the Trump administration has done and said that essentially, both of these two Democratic candidates are trying to score political points and stoke fears. CHANG: That is NPR's Asma Khalid. Thank you so much, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF TO ROCOCO ROT'S \"TELEMA\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The court ruled the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was operating as a criminal organization, and delivered landmark guilty verdicts in a five-year trial against dozens of defendants, including former lawmakers.\n                \n                    \n                    Yorgos Karahalis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands of people gather for an anti-fascist protest outside a court in Athens on Wednesday. The court ruled the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was operating as a criminal organization, and delivered landmark guilty verdicts in a five-year trial against dozens of defendants, including former lawmakers. After a trial that lasted more than five years, a Greek court ruled Wednesday that the Golden Dawn neo-Nazi party is a criminal organization. It convicted 68 party members of crimes including murder and attempted murder. Eleven defendants were present in the courtroom. Huge crowds massed outside the courtroom in Athens, waving banners that read \"Nazis in Prison.\" The crowds roared after each guilty verdict was announced. \"It's a victory because this means Golden Dawn as an organization does not have the right to exist anymore,\" says Dora Oikonomidou, an Athens business owner and anti-fascism activist who was in the crowd. \"This is the first significant trial of a neo-Nazi party in Europe after World War II. It's not the end of fascism, because fascism is everywhere. But it is an extremely important moment for us.\" Magda Fyssa, the mother of late Greek singer Pavlos Fyssas, reacts immediately after three judges convicted Golden Dawn members of murdering her son, in Athens on Wednesday. She burst into tears and pumped her fists, looking up at the sky. \"You did it, Pavlos! You did it, my son!\" she shouted.\n                \n                    \n                    Petros Giannakouris/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Magda Fyssa, the mother of late Greek singer Pavlos Fyssas, reacts immediately after three judges convicted Golden Dawn members of murdering her son, in Athens on Wednesday. She burst into tears and pumped her fists, looking up at the sky. \"You did it, Pavlos! You did it, my son!\" she shouted. The party emerged some four decades ago. A Hitler-praising former army commando, Nikos Michaloliakos, founded Golden Dawn in the 1980s as a violent fringe party of racist, xenophobic Holocaust deniers. Many Greeks were horrified as they watched the rise of Golden Dawn in the last decade. During Greece's debt crisis, which destroyed the country's economy, many Greeks were left destitute and angry. Golden Dawn tapped into that anger, rising from the fringes and winning 18 seats in parliament in 2012. Golden Dawn members celebrated those political victories by shouting \"Blood, Honor, Golden Dawn!\" \u2014 adapting a Nazi slogan \u2014 as they flanked Michaloliakos, who compared himself to Julius Caesar. \"I came, I saw, I conquered,\" he declared. \"You defamed me. You silenced me. I defeated you.\" The win emboldened party members who were already violently attacking migrants, saying Greece needed to be \"cleaned\" of foreigners. In 2012, Golden Dawn members broke into the homes of Egyptian fishermen and beat them nearly to death with wooden bats and iron rods. These attackers were convicted on Wednesday of attempted murder. The following year, on Sept. 13, 2013, Golden Dawn members stabbed to death a Greek anti-fascist musician, Pavlos Fyssas, who sang under the stage name Killah P. After the 34-year-old performer's murder, his grieving mother, Magda Fyssa, pushed for the government to open a criminal inquiry into Golden Dawn. The trial began in April 2015. Fyssa attended all 454 sessions. When the three judges convicted Golden Dawn members of murdering her son, she burst into tears and pumped her fists, looking up at the sky. \"You did it, Pavlos! You did it, my son!\" she shouted. \"She was there every day, even as the Nazis were taunting her, saying, 'Where's your son now?'\" says Oikonomidou, whose own parents grew up when Greece was occupied by the Nazis and fought fascism in the years when Greece was ruled by a military junta from 1967 to 1974. \"Magda Fyssa fought back all the way.\" Golden Dawn members claim they are victims of political persecution. Party loyalists portray themselves as patriots and even endorsed Donald Trump for U.S, president in 2016 because they believed he promotes, in their words, \"clean ethnic states.\" The long trial of Golden Dawn choked the life out of the party. With its brutality on full display, the party hemorrhaged voters and was so broke it could no longer pay rent for its Athens offices. Infighting prompted resignations and defections. The party did not win enough votes to make it into parliament in elections last year. Political leaders in Greece welcomed Wednesday's verdicts. \"Today's decision is a confirmation that democracy and its institutions are always capable of fending off any attempt to undermine them,\" said Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou. Amnesty International's Europe Director, Nils Muiznieks, said in a statement that the verdicts send \"a clear message to political groups with aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights agendas in Greece and across Europe that violent and racist criminal activity \u2014 whether perpetrated by individuals on the street or members of parliament, will not go unpunished.\" Golden Dawn member Giorgos Roupakias, convicted of murdering Fyssas, faces life in prison. Party leader Michaloliakos and his deputies face up to 15 years of jail time. But there is concern that \"mainstream parties have been complicit in legitimizing xenophobic rhetoric,\" writes Georgia Nakou of the political analysis site Macropolis. She adds that \"anti-systemic, populist slogans adopted at both ends of the political spectrum will also continue to find fertile ground as long as living standards remain depressed.\" Golden Dawn's ultranationalist ideology also lives on in parties like Greek Solution, founded by Kyriakos Velopoulos, a far-right, anti-immigrant journalist who wants to install an electric fence on Greece's border with Turkey. Velopoulos admires the nativist policies of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and President Trump. One of the party's slogans is \"Greece first,\" modeled after Trump's \"America first.\" Human rights groups say there are also Golden Dawn sympathizers in the Greek police. At least 2,000 riot police guarded the courthouse on Wednesday. They drenched the crowd with tear gas and shot a water cannon after some protesters eager to storm the courthouse pelted officers with firebombs and stones. \"After that, people just left,\"Oikonomidou says. \"We were like, go ahead and throw tear gas at us. It's OK. We won.\"",

            "article_content": "Maria Hinojosa has dedicated her career to telling the stories of Latinos and other communities often ignored by the media. The Emmy award-winning journalist and longtime host of Latino USA on NPR is now telling her own story in a raw, very personal memoir, titled Once I Was You: A Memoir of Love and Hate in a Torn America. \"We all have to work at making the immigrant story much more public,\" said Maria Hinojosa, author of a new memoir, Once I Was You: A Memoir of Love and Hate in a Torn America.\n                \n                    \n                    Photo by Kevin Abosch\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"We all have to work at making the immigrant story much more public,\" said Maria Hinojosa, author of a new memoir, Once I Was You: A Memoir of Love and Hate in a Torn America. Hinojosa, who came to the U.S. from Mexico with her family as a child, worked as a reporter at CBS, NPR and CNN when journalism was whiter and even more male than it is now. In an interview with NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, she recalled the prejudice she faced in newsrooms as a Latina. \"People were not saying nice things to me,\" she said. \"They would say, 'Oh, you have an agenda. We know your Latino agenda, we know you have an immigrant agenda.' \" Decades later, President Trump is at the helm of the most anti-immigrant administration in recent U.S. history. Of course, xenophobic rhetoric and policies didn't start with Trump. Hinojosa tied today's anti-immigrant attitudes to a \"continual, repetitive narrative about immigrants\" perpetuated by mainstream media and by politicians on both the right and the left. Diverse, authentic stories of immigrants, she said, are necessary to dispel the myths and \"hatred\" that date back to the founding of America. Now, as founder of Futuro Media, Hinojosa continues to set her own example by working to build a media company that reflects America. \"We all have to work at making the immigrant story much more public because this narrative has been constructed not over the past four years,\" she said. In the full interview, Hinojosa also addresses her fear in once largely white newsrooms, going public about being a sexual assault survivor, and why silenced voices need to keep speaking up. Let's talk about your road to becoming a journalist. That road led through NPR. In fact, my colleague Scott Simon hired you. An executive told you back then that you were rare \u2014 a well-educated, well-traveled Latina. ... I get this job at NPR. I'm the first Latina. I mean, I know it, like there had been no other Latinas at NPR who were not cleaning the offices. I was the first one in the newsroom. And it was terrifying, you know, it was really terrifying. I remember another famous NPR personality once said to me after I had been around the block a long time and I was doing reporting, you know, in gritty communities when this person said to me, \"Weren't you terrified to be in the South Bronx doing that reporting?\" And then I was like, \"No.\" But this person would have never thought to ask me if I was terrified the first day I stepped foot at NPR as the first Latina and I was like, that's what I'm talking about. Like we all see the world from different perspectives and that's why we need so much representation across the media. That's what it's about. On the responsibility she feels as a journalist to talk publicly about being raped when she was teenager ...The reason why I decided to write about it, honestly, was because of what happened with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh. And the reason why I want to talk about is because I held on to this. I didn't realize how much it was impacting, just like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Everybody was looking at her like, \"Yo, girl, come on, this happened to you when you were 15. Come on.\" You know, and that's easy for people to say until you realize what happens when it happens to you. And so, I wanted to write about it also because Latinas, we don't often talk about this very publicly. You know, this happened in Mexico. I mean, my mom didn't know. I had to tell her. The good news, Lulu, is that after you write about it, and you cry about it and you do therapy, there's healing on the other side. On the advice she has for Latinos and other people of color in journalism and elsewhere Don't give up. Don't give up! Oh, my God. I helped to create the newsroom that I envisioned when I first stepped into NPR and I was like, wait, this doesn't look like the newsroom ... it's frankly too white. And so we need you. We need you to power through the invisibility that you feel, own your power, own your voice. Get quiet, connect with your ancestral power the way I had to to write this book, because we all have it and we need you, so don't give up. NPR's Hiba Ahmad and Kitty Eisele produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Emma Bowman adapted it for the Web.",

            "article_content": "The phone messaging app WhatsApp is beloved by millions but infamous as a platform for hoaxes. We speak with the co-host of the new South Africa-based podcast, \"What's Crap with WhatsApp?\"  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging phone applications in the world, with millions of daily users. It's also infamous for being a platform where hoaxes and rumors are easily spread far from public view. But a new African podcast called \"What's Crap On WhatsApp?\" is trying to debunk some of the disinformation. The show is recorded as a voice note and shared on WhatsApp like this. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"WHAT'S CRAP ON WHATSAPP?\") KATE WILKINSON: We saw a message which said that apricot seeds can kill cancer cells, but that's not true. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And then there was the advice to use salt or white toothpaste to test if you're pregnant. This doesn't work. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Kate Wilkinson is a co-host of \"What's Crap On WhatsApp?\" And she joins us now from Durban in South Africa. Welcome. WILKINSON: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So tell us what role WhatsApp plays in Africa and why you chose this particular app to air your podcast. WILKINSON: Well, WhatsApp plays a huge role in Africa because it is a way that normal people who live in Africa, like me, my friends, my colleagues, my family - it's the way that we communicate. And we just realized that the existing fact-checking that we were doing and have been doing for a number of years on Facebook, on Twitter - we'd rarely been getting that right and covering all our bases. But we knew there was this big, black box that was WhatsApp. And we needed to try and get in there and see what was being spread, if it was dangerous and if we could help set the record straight. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The original intention behind this show was to uncover misinformation about South Africa's election last year. But it quickly turned into something else. What happened? WILKINSON: Yeah. So we partnered with Volume, which is a startup that's based in Johannesburg. So we're on WhatsApp, where we collect the misinformation that people want fact-checked. We produce the show and then distribute it back on the platform. And we launched it just before our national elections last year. And we really did expect that we would see mostly political misinformation; we would see people trying to sway voters; we'd see maybe political parties planting mis- and disinformation on the platform. But to be honest, that's not what we saw. For the most part, the clue's in the name. We see a lot of crappy hoax messages being sent to us. But people often get very concerned and are worried about them because they play on our very human fears. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But what hoaxes are we talking about? Give us some examples. WILKINSON: So they start from the very silly, you know, messages that if you find a Coke can outside your garage, it's because criminals are marking your house for robbery. We also see sometimes dodgy medical advice about how to do a pregnancy test with toothpaste. But then we also saw probably what could have been the most dangerous misinformation. We had an outbreak of xenophobic violence in the country, which saw foreigners and migrants targeted. And WhatsApp went wild with videos and very disturbing images. And through the fact-checking that we did on the platform, we were actually able to determine that most of these videos were actually unrelated to the latest round of xenophobic violence. These misleading images, these misleading videos, which were unconnected to the situation, could have really riled up an already tense situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As you probably know, misinformation is a big deal in the United States. You may have heard. As information debunkers, what kind of tips do you have for us here? WILKINSON: So the first thing to do is - when you get a message - is to ask yourself, you know, who created this original message? Can you try figure out a motive or an agenda? Secondly is to think about whether it plays with your emotions. Is it something that's likely to make you angry? Is it something that's likely to make you scared or cross? And is that an emotion that is fueling you to share it? And then thirdly, really, is just to ask, you know, could I be being misled? And when in doubt, don't share. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I say this a lot. Everyone should become a fact-checker of their own feed. Kate Wilkinson is a co-host of the podcast \"What's Crap On WhatsApp?\" Thank you very much. WILKINSON: Thanks, Lulu.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Bernie Sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. But later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. For Mr. Sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. NPR's Don Gonyea takes us to New Hampshire to see how the Vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base. SIMON: A Bernie Sanders rally has kind of a loose, homemade feel to it. Often, they start with a local band to warm up the crowd, like last weekend on a freezing cold Saturday night inside a middle-school gym in Manchester. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jake Swamp and The Pine with special guest, the drummer from Phish, Jon Fishman. JAKE SWAMP AND THE PINE: (Singing) We should left long ago and just gotten out of town. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: And so a night at a Bernie Sanders rally begins.

JOHN CUSACK: We have never ever in our lifetimes had a truer champion of social, economic and climate justice this close to the White House.

GONYEA: Outside, it's been snowing hard since people started arriving hours earlier. SANDERS: I am glad to see a little bit of snow does not intimidate those of us from Northern New England, right? (CHEERING) GONYEA: Sanders' speech is heavy on issues - Medicare For All, climate change, banning assault weapons, the need for a wealth tax, raising the national minimum wage. SANDERS: You know, many of my opponents are saying, oh, Bernie. It's too much. We can't pay teachers a living wage. We can't make public colleges and universities' tuition should free. Really? That's exactly what we intend to do. GONYEA: As for President Trump, the language is blunt. SANDERS: That we can't have a president who is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot. GONYEA: And a boast about the small-dollar donations to fuel his campaign. SANDERS: No campaign in the history of the United States of America has received more contributions from more people at this point in a campaign than we have. That's a political revolution. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Thank you all very much. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS\") THE DOOBIE BROTHERS: (Singing) Takin' it to the streets. GONYEA: Afterward, Sanders doesn't hang around long, taking selfies like most other candidates do. He works the rope line for a bit then exits out a back door. But the audience is clearly energized by this 78-year-old candidate. You seen Bernie before? ALICE SYMMES: Never - this is my first time. And I got my mom to come with me (laughter). GONYEA: This is Alice Symmes, a behavior analyst who works with special needs children and their families. You're here wearing a button that says Bernie beats Trump. SYMMES: Yes, I am. GONYEA: A lot of people say Bernie can't beat Trump. Some Democrats say that. SYMMES: I say they're wrong. And I have confidence that the truth and integrity and character will win. JAKE SWAMP AND THE PINE: Dick Monks is a retired union carpenter who backed Sanders four years ago then voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. Now he's with Sanders again. He looks around at a packed house on a night with lousy weather. DICK MONKS: But this is where people want to be. I think Sanders can win because people really want him. GONYEA: And he worries if someone like Joe Biden wins the nomination then all the enthusiasm Democrats have in 2020 could fade. There's something else he likes about this Sanders crowd. MONKS: They're young people. The way he mobilized the youth in '16 - he's doing it again. That's encouraging to me. GONYEA: There was yet another Bernie Sanders event a day later in Conway at a brewpub a couple hours to the North - again, a full house. Volunteer Frank Thompson is one of those young Sanders supporters. FRANK THOMPSON: So over winter break, I've been campaigning for Bernie, canvassing, putting up signs. Right now, you know, I'm just kind of... GONYEA: When I asked him to size up the audience at this event, he had the opposite take as Dick Monks who appreciated all the young people a day earlier in Manchester. THOMPSON: Every time I come out here, I am super surprised at how many, you know, older folk are here. I think that's really important for them to turn out. GONYEA: Back at the Manchester rally, in that Saturday night snow, I talked to some Sanders supporters outside. Zachary Merriam as a 23-year-old machinist and labor organizer. ZACHARY MERRIAM: He's strongly supports the working class. I don't see any other candidate that stacks up with him. GONYEA: If he's not the nominee, what do you do then? MERRIAM: I'm not going to vote. GONYEA: You won't vote. MERRIAM: No, I won't. I will not. GONYEA: There's no other option. MERRIAM: Nope. GONYEA: That's a sentiment you heard more often from Sanders supporters in 2016. This time, you hear fewer claims that the nominating process is rigged against Sanders and more who sound like Alice Symmes. SYMMES: If I choose not to vote then I feel like that abstaining helps Trump. And there's nothing about me that wants to help Trump. GONYEA: After the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. Music still pipes through the sound system. And with Senator Sanders tied up with the impeachment trial in these days before Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll need the people who show up at events like these to reach out to potential backers and to show that the grassroots can turn out the vote, even if the candidate is around a lot less.

            "article_content": "All four critics agreed that Michaela Coel's series I May Destroy You was \"one of the most exciting of 2020.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Seery/HBO\n                    \n                \nhide caption All four critics agreed that Michaela Coel's series I May Destroy You was \"one of the most exciting of 2020.\" It has been a momentous year for everything we consider TV. A pandemic, civil rights reckoning, streaming war and presidential election shook up the industry in a dozen different ways. It blurred lines between genres, platforms and story forms, while also encouraging us to develop our own, deep rabbit holes of favorite media. So when our team of four critics sat down to figure out what we liked most onscreen this year, we each had a lot of stuff on our lists no one else did. That's why our list crosses a lot of boundaries, including projects technically released as feature films. It's a powerful example of how much quality entertainment was available this year, even after coronavirus lockdowns shut down productions and upended release schedules. In alphabetical order, here's our best of 2020 \u2014 and we know it's a long list, so you can use these alphabetical links to skip around: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, W. Better Call Saul, Season 5 (AMC, Amazon Prime rental, earlier seasons on Netflix) This outstanding AMC series long ago rendered pointless any comparisons to Breaking Bad, of which it is technically a prequel. The story it's telling is so very much its own \u2014 by turns gritty and funny, melancholic and viciously violent. In its penultimate season, the transformation of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Saul Goodman \u2014 a criminal lawyer who's actually a criminal lawyer \u2014 is just about complete. We finally saw the series' two disparate plot threads \u2014 Jimmy's and Mike's (Jonathan Banks) \u2014 come together, a richly satisfying consummation for those viewers who've complained about the series' pacing, and who've longed for those two characters to share the screen. The fact that it's all set against the very real, and immensely worrying, potential downfall of the show's beating heart \u2014 Rhea Seehorn's astonishing performance as Jimmy's girlfriend Kim \u2014 invests us that much deeply in the show's dangerous and duplicitous world. \u2014 Glen Weldon, Aisha Harris, Eric Deggans Black Is King (Disney+)/Between the World and Me (HBO and HBO Max) In a year that saw lots of reflection on systemic racism and police brutality, these two films offered emotional, effective meditations on Black joy and pain in very different ways. Black Is King is Beyonc\u00e9's \"visual album,\" loosely inspired by The Lion King story, using arresting images and banging tunes to portray the peoples of the African diaspora rediscovering their heritage as leaders and royalty. Between the World and Me is a different kind of tone poem, centered on passages read by performers like Oprah Winfrey from Ta-Nehisi Coates' book, which was written as a letter to his teen son. It explores the dangers Black people face from police brutality and the joy which comes from Black love and achievement, perfectly presenting the duality of African American life. \u2014 Eric Deggans BoJack Horseman, Season 6, Part II (Netflix) After five-plus seasons watching a washed-up sitcom horse wrestle with drug addiction, narcissism, childhood traumas and the traumas he inflicted upon others, BoJack Horseman's story came to an end that was as satisfying as one could hope. What the show did best (besides insanely clever animal puns and skewering Hollywood) was really question and challenge the arc of redemption for people (or horses) who have caused an immeasurable amount of pain to others. Right up to its final moments, the writers and animators didn't let up, remaining as inquisitive and creative as ever. \u2014 Aisha Harris Boys State (Apple TV+) Set at Boys State in Texas, a program where high school boys run for office and form a mock government, this is a documentary not for the faint of heart. It shows kids whose approach to politics is already hardened, already combative beyond the substance of it. Combative for its own sake. While there are moments that show the promise of young activists and idealists, there are also dark signs that a lot of kids who have grown up in our fractured and nasty political climate have learned plenty from the politicians who have endeavored at every turn to make it worse. \u2014 Linda Holmes Class Action Park (HBO Max) This documentary functions, at one level, as a document laying out the details of a very specific time and place: Action Park in New Jersey, famous for being the amusement park where kids got hurt. But with the help of excellent input from Class Action Park patrons and comedian Chris Gethard, it turns into a consideration of nostalgia more generally, and of what it means to know you had a great time doing something that was a very bad idea. \u2014 Linda Holmes Da 5 Bloods (Netflix) Spike Lee's usage of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On? album is divine; his nods and references to everything from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to Rambo are thoughtful and layered; Chadwick Boseman, in one of his final roles, is a powerful and spiritual presence. But this movie belongs to Delroy Lindo, who cuts an imposing and indelible figure as Paul, a Vietnam War vet worn down by unresolved guilt, wrecked by bitterness, sadness and fear. He finds shades to play with in every feeling and thought, giving one of the great performances in recent memory. \u2014 Aisha Harris David Byrne's American Utopia (HBO and HBO Max) It was a year when we were starved for good feelings, a year when mere happiness felt like ecstatic joy, and real ecstatic joy \u2014 like that on glorious display on a Broadway stage by a barefoot David Byrne and a cadre of musicians in matching gray suits \u2014 could leave you breathless, swooning and profoundly grateful. Directed by Spike Lee, the theatrical concert film spans Byrne's musical career but \u2014 as with any production associated with Byrne \u2014 it leaves plenty of room to get enthusiastically weird. Wireless technology allows the musicians to roam the stage, and they do so in lock-step choreography, like the hippest high school marching band imaginable. A special treat for longtime Talking Heads fans: We finally get the live version of \"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\" that we didn't know we've been aching for, all this time. \u2014 Glen Weldon First Cow (Showtime, DIRECTTV, and numerous rental sites) It's astounding how much suspense director Kelly Reichardt is able to derive from the act of milking a cow. In early 19th-century Oregon Territory, skillful cook Otis \"Cookie\" Figowitz (John Magaro) befriends King-Lu, an enterprising Chinese immigrant (Orion Lee) and outlaw. Together, they conjure up a successful business at a market outpost selling oily cakes to hungry traders; the recipe requires a very scarce commodity around those parts: cow's milk. It's one-part heist film and another part buddy adventure, with a tender \u2014 and often humorous \u2014 friendship at its center. \u2014 Aisha Harris The Flight Attendant (HBO Max) Based on the novel by Chris Bohjalian, this smart, taut HBO Max thriller stars Kaley Cuoco as, well, a flight attendant who wakes up after a night of partying and realizes something very, very bad happened while she was asleep. Part mystery, part drama about the aftereffects of a traumatic childhood, and part dark comedy, it was one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, impressing with its razor-sharp tone, supporting performances (Zosia Mamet is tremendous as Cuoco's best friend), and heartfelt work from Cuoco. \u2014 Linda Holmes The Forty-Year-Old Version (Netflix) Radha Blank's debut as a feature film director, writer and star is an engaging portrait of an artist at an existential crossroad, professional and personal. This is a refreshingly specific mid-life crisis, one borrowing from Blank's own life as a born-and-bred New York writer and rapper known as RhadaMUS Prime. It's funny and poignant, and the banter and characters feel real and alive. Radha the character may lack confidence at times, but real-life Radha the filmmaker is very self-assured. \u2014 Aisha Harris, Linda Holmes The Good Place, Season 4 (NBC, Netflix, Amazon Prime) The road to this perfectly poignant finale wasn't smooth. Much of seasons 3 and 4 lacked the bite of the earlier seasons, and as the gang fought to prove that there was a fundamental glitch in the sorting of heaven and hell, it felt almost like Mike Schur and his team were spinning wheels. But they stuck the landing anyway, bringing back some of that subversiveness by daring to suggest there can come a point when you feel as though you've done all you wanted to do in the (after)life and it's time to move on. It's a dark thing to contemplate, but it's also honest. \u2014 Aisha Harris The Great (Hulu) Billed as \"An Occasionally True Story,\" this series about young Catherine (Elle Fanning) and her ill-fated marriage to Emperor Peter of Russia (Nicholas Hoult) is stuffed with gleefully ahistorical elements that'll send students of Russian history into aneurysms. Fanning is terrific as an idealistic (and self-satisfied) would-be social reformer, while Hoult's Peter is a nightmare \u2014 a sociopathic boor poured into a pair of tight leather pants. The Great was created by Tony McNamara, based on his 2008 play. McNamara went on to co-write 2018's The Favourite, and if you've seen that film, you know what to expect here \u2014 yes, bustles and corsets, wigs and snuffboxes, but also crisp ripostes, lacerating insults and dialogue that sizzles with withering wit. \u2014 Glen Weldon Harley Quinn (DC Universe and HBO Max) Given the sheer tonnage of live action superhero shows on TV, it's notable that the most gonzo, subversive, hilarious, action packed, explicit and entertaining take on the DC comics universe is actually this animated series. Originally created for the streaming service DC Universe, it now lives on HBO Max, where Big Bang Theory alum Kaley Cuoco voices the Joker's former girlfriend as an unpredictable, profanity-slinging romantic who resists the ex who exploited her. It's a comedy of sorts where even Batman is a bit of a doofus, featuring Harley leading a team of misfit baddies who struggle for recognition as Gotham City's leading villains, redefining adult-oriented superhero stories in the process. \u2014 Eric Deggans The Haunting of Bly Manor (Netflix) The first installment of this Netflix series, The Haunting of Hill House, was packed with plenty of good, ghostly scares \u2014 but it lagged in the middle, and whiffed the ending. With The Haunting of Bly Manor creator and showrunner Mike Flanagan hasn't simply found a new author to riff on (Henry James, instead of Shirley Jackson) he has seriously course-corrected. Though it parcels out the scares more thinly than Hill House did, Bly Manor's story is tighter, and it nails the all-important dismount in a sincere, humane and bittersweet way that directly addresses the nature, and the purpose, of grief. It's not overtly tidy or dully expositional \u2014 yet it feels, in the best way, inevitable. \u2014 Glen Weldon I Hate Suzie (HBO Max) This British series \u2014 just eight episodes, as is their wont \u2014 stars the great Billie Piper as an actress whose nudes end up on the Internet after her phone gets hacked. She then proceeds to make a series of wildly terrible decisions to deal with it \u2014 or not deal with it, as the case may be. It won't be for everyone. Think of it as the anti-Ted Lasso \u2014 there's little here that's comforting or warm. Try it on for size: Watch the first episode, in which a huge crowd comes tromping through her home for a photo shoot just as she's first finding out about the leaked nudes. She keeps trying to find some privacy \u2014 and keep her husband from finding out \u2014 in a long stretch of tense, claustrophobic, downright nightmarish scenes, many of which take place entirely in a tight close-up of Piper's face as she attempts to keep from panicking. If it grabs you, you'll watch the rest of the episodes through your fingers \u2014 but you will watch them, compulsively. \u2014 Glen Weldon I May Destroy You (HBO and HBO Max) Michaela Coel's series about a woman exploring the aftermath of a sexual assault shone a spotlight on Coel's own acting, writing, and in some cases directing. It also became a broader examination of ethics in sex and relationships, from the traumatic to the questionable to the unkind. The supporting cast and dizzying structural turns made the HBO show one of the most exciting of 2020. \u2014 Linda Holmes, Aisha Harris, Eric Deggans, Glen Weldon The Invisible Man (HBO, HBO Max and numerous rental sites) Elisabeth Moss stars as a woman who begins to fear she's crazy when she keeps sensing her dead abusive husband everywhere. From there, the film becomes a consideration of paranoia, trauma and ultimately the desire to reclaim a connection to reality that's come undone as a result of repeated, relentless gaslighting. \u2014 Linda Holmes John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch (Netflix) Point of order: This comedy special debuted on Dec. 25, 2019 \u2014 after we made our annual list \u2014 so it slides in here on a technicality. But it certainly belongs \u2014 no comedy special has won me over so hard, so completely. Mulaney's idiosyncratic sensibility might seem an odd fit for what is essentially an extended riff on old children's television programming, but it works seamlessly here. That's a product of the writing, which is wry but never cynical, but it's also an outgrowth of the casting. These kid actors aren't pushing it \u2014 they easily find Mulaney's particular comedic frequency, and stick to it. \u2014 Glen Weldon The Last Dance (Netflix) Basketball legend Michael Jordan looms over every frame of this revealing documentary series first shown on ESPN, and not just because it expertly documents his final championship season with the Chicago Bulls in 1997-98. It's an incisive look at how that team became a world-crushing, pop-culture-dominating force, with special detail on how Jordan built his legend. Other stories also resonate: How Dennis Rodman nearly committed suicide before he joined the Bulls; how teammate Scottie Pippen was continually underpaid; how Jordan was merciless about pushing his teammates and cultivating grudges to boost his performance. Jordan was involved as a producer and had to approve use of the Bulls' behind-the-scenes footage, giving him even more control. But despite his influence, this miniseries offers a never-before-seen look at a once in a generation team. \u2014 Eric Deggans Lovecraft Country (HBO and HBO Max) Packed to bursting with symbolism, special effects, allegory, social messages, reinvented horror tropes and enough plot to require a YouTube explainer for every episode, this audacious take on Matt Ruff's 2016 novel is a lot. But its story, placing a Black family at the heart of a pitched battle with a white family of witches in the Jim Crow-era 1950s, is a marvel of ambition and craft. Comparing the horrors of racism to the supernatural horrors found in novels by H.P. Lovecraft \u2014 himself an infamous xenophobe and racist \u2014 reinvents the genre in unexpected ways. And the work of executive producer/writer/director Misha Green to showcase the power of Black love and family in a series dropping during the summer's reckoning over systemic racism and police brutality, was exquisitely perfect timing. \u2014 Eric Deggans, Glen Weldon Lovers Rock (Amazon Prime) This entry in Steve McQueen's excellent Small Axe anthology series will surely make you want to seek out its soundtrack, which is bubbling with classics of the reggae subgenre from which it gets its title. But as you follow these young West Indian Londoners mingling, dancing, flirting and rebuffing aggressive strangers at a lively house party on one evening in 1980, it will also transport you to a realm of beauty and intimacy. It's a musical reverie that manages to capture the exultation of the arrival of the weekend, and the sanctity of Black community. \u2014 Aisha Harris Mucho Mucho Amor (Netflix) Netflix presented this documentary about legendary astrologer Walter Mercado to an audience that included both people who grew up watching him on television every day and people who knew him hardly at all. It told a story that was alternatively sad and stirring, but it ultimately gave the man his due as a legend who was part of the lives of many families and who found himself poorly treated by some of those close to him. \u2014 Linda Holmes The New Pope (HBO and HBO Max) The New Pope, like The Young Pope before it, is all about jockeying for a very earthly kind of power behind the scenes of the Vatican. The vaguely odd, singular tone of that first series persists, as does the many Italian actors' tendencies to emphasize words that native English speakers wouldn't necessarily emphasize, and insert long, meaningful pauses (creator Paolo Sorrentino loves his pauses) where native English speakers wouldn't. It all adds to the sense that you're watching the show from across a vague, yet palpable cultural divide \u2014 the ecclesiastical drama as Mentos commercial. Despite the title change and the swapping out of Jude Law's Pius XIII for John Malkovich's Sir John Brannox, Sorrentino's camera still tracks slowly and languidly through immense arched hallways, vaulted rooms and lush gardens, pausing to alight upon small, telling details. Malkovich revels in his portrayal of Brannox as a louche, mascara-wearing British fop who flounces through life \u2014 a man who can be counted upon to find the nearest chaise in any room and recline upon it as if he has just been roughly flung there. \u2014 Glen Weldon Normal People (Hulu) The Sally Rooney novel about two young students who fall in love and watch their lives intersect over many years was a hit, and adapting it into a limited series was a challenge since it's so reliant on the interiority of the lead characters. But leads Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal brought their scenes together an intimacy and grace that kept the wide-ranging story in focus. \u2014 Linda Holmes On The Record (HBO Max) Making a documentary about the reckoning over sexual harassment in music would have been too broad an assignment for any filmmaker. So it makes sense that this one is narrower: It is primarily about allegations against hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, and even more specifically about Drew Dixon, an A&R executive who says she saw her career founder after being assaulted by Simmons. \u2014 Linda Holmes Ozark, Season 3 (Netflix) Critics who dismiss this drama about a family juggling internal drama and FBI scrutiny while laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel in the Ozarks (some have dubbed it \"Breaking Bad: The Family Edition\") have missed the point. Especially in this year's powerhouse third season, Ozark raised its game, adding Janet McTeer as a domineering cartel lawyer and Tom Pelphrey in a shamefully under-recognized turn as the bipolar brother of matriarch Wendy Byrde, played by Laura Linney. Pelphrey was heart-rending as the only person who saw how terrible the Byrdes' activities were, despite his mental illness. And the show's ability to keep viewers invested in Jason Bateman's numbers whiz, patriarch Marty Byrde \u2014 no matter who he gets killed or rips off \u2014 is nothing short of amazing. \u2014 Eric Deggans P-Valley (STARZ) In lesser hands, Uncle Clifford (Nicco Annan) \u2014 the towering, flamboyant non-binary strip club owner whose drawl kind of sounds like Katt Williams \u2013could have easily turned out to be little more than sassy caricature. But Katori Hall's soapy melodrama about a rural Mississippi town and its colorful inhabitants takes its characters seriously, and over the course of this crackling first season they emerge more unique and interesting than their \"types\" might initially suggest. The show also brings a new level of respect to the artistry and precision of pole dancing \u2014 among the highlights are those extensive routines backed by dirty, thumping Southern hip-hop. \u2014 Aisha Harris The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Before I saw one scene of chess play, I was all in for a miniseries showing a talented, self-possessed woman mastering a game dominated by men in the 1950s and '60s, knocking them off like clay pigeons on her way to the world championship. But this series, crafted by Scott Frank based on a 1983 novel, also plays like a superhero origin story. In a magnetic performance, Anya Taylor-Joy brings liquid eyes and an inscrutable manner to chess prodigy Beth Harmon, who must overcome substance abuse, the influence of her suicidal mom and a sexist world to reach her goals. Toss in a period-specific, lavish production and direction that actually makes chess look interesting, and you have the ingredients of a modern TV masterpiece. \u2014 Eric Deggans Ted Lasso (Apple TV+) Saturday Night Live alum Jason Sudeikis is funny, bumbling and occasionally heartbreaking as Ted Lasso, a stupendously optimistic American college football coach hired to lead a Premiere League soccer team in England. The owner is actually trying to sabotage the team by hiring Lasso, who knows nothing about soccer \u2014 or \"football,\" as they call it in Britain. But she doesn't realize his true superpower is that he's so gosh darned nice. It may sound a little hokey, but Ted Lasso somehow builds a wonderful comedy around the healing power of niceness \u2014 deflating any hokum with a well-timed joke or two. And considering how tough 2020 has been, we all could use a lot of that message right about now. \u2014 Eric Deggans, Linda Holmes Tiger King (Netflix) The subjects of this docuseries became the butt of a thousand punchlines, as viewers dug into the tawdry tale of Joe Exotic \u2014 a publicity-seeking, pistol-packing character running a private zoo in Oklahoma who was convicted of paying a hitman to murder his longtime nemesis, self-styled animal conservationist Carol Baskin. Still, the series itself is an amazing achievement, exploring the eccentric and often exploitive underworld of exotic animal collectors and conservationists. Joe Exotic was the show's unstable center, given to stunts like running for president and participating in an unofficial, three-way same sex marriage. But the show also featured footage filmed over years, as directors caught crucial moments on film and climbed inside the heart of a devastatingly dysfunctional subculture. \u2014 Eric Deggans Time (Amazon Prime) There's a profound sadness at the core of Garrett Bradley's arresting documentary about Fox Rich, a Louisiana woman who spent decades tirelessly contesting her husband Robert's 60-year prison sentence for a crime they both committed out of economic desperation. But there's also a sense of optimism humming beneath it all, particularly in how Rich's story unfolds on screen: via footage from approximately 100 hours of daily video diaries she made of herself and their children over the years, in the hopes of eventually having the opportunity to show it all to Robert. Bradley and editor Gabriel Rhodes take this treasure of a time capsule and turn out an absorbing masterpiece. \u2014 Aisha Harris What We Do In The Shadows, Season 2 (FX and FX on Hulu) new bullseye\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption As great as the first season of this modern-day-vampire mockumentary series was, it had trouble stepping out of the long ... well, shadow of the 2014 film on which it was based. That's not to say there weren't plenty of creative additions \u2014 Mark Proksch's cardigan-clad \"energy vampire\" Colin Robinson, for example, the embodiment of all things evil ... and beige. But in the second season, a stronger, more linear plot involving the show's secret weapon (Harvey Guill\u00e9n as Guillermo, the Staten-Island-based vampires' long-suffering thrall/assistant who discovers as dark, hilarious truth about himself) leaves the viewer with the impression that the show has clicked into its groove. And speaking of groove: If the show did nothing but grace us with the presence of the marvelous Matt Barry at his bombastic best here playing the preternaturally self-impressed vampire Lazlo, it would be enough. \u2014 Glen Weldon",

A Greek court has sentenced Nikos Michaloliakos, the leader of the far right anti-immigrant Golden Dawn party, to 13 years in prison. Michaloliakos and others from Golden Dawn were found guilty last week of being part of a criminal organization that ordered or encouraged violence. Other leaders received sentences ranging from five to 13 years on Wednesday. The court will decide soon if any of the sentences will be suspended. The five-year trial put new scrutiny on one of Greece's ugliest modern political developments \u2014 how a violent neo-Nazi party, infamous for harboring racists, xenophobes and even Holocaust deniers, was able to mobilize enough public support to win seats in parliament between 2012-2019 in a country that suffered tremendously under Nazi occupation during World War II. \"We hope to never again see in our homeland, those who proponent ideologies that bloodied the world,\" Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou tweeted Monday, as she marked the 76th-year anniversary of Athens' liberation from German occupation. One party member, Giorgos Roupakias, received a life sentence plus 10 years after being convicted of the 2013 murder of Greek rapper Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist musician who performed under the stage name Killah P. It was Fyssas' mother, Magda, who pushed for the criminal inquiry to expose Golden Dawn as a criminal gang and jail its leadership. She attended the entire five-year trial, bonding with another grieving parent, Khadam Hussein Luqman, the father of Pakistani immigrant Shehzad Luqman, whom two Golden Dawn members stabbed to death in January 2013. The two men were later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014. Other charges centered on a violent attack on Egyptian fishermen \u2013 part of the party's campaign against migrants. Dozens of Golden Dawn members were found guilty of murder, attempted murder, or other crimes last week \u2014 a landmark ruling that cheered anti-fascist activists in Greece. The verdict was \"a confirmation that democracy and its institutions are always capable of fending off any attempt to undermine them,\" Sakellaropoulou said. Those convicted include former party spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, who once slapped a female politician on live TV and has founded a new party, Greeks for the Fatherland, which shares similar views with Golden Dawn. Another former leader, Ioannis Lagos, who is serving in the European Parliament as an independent, was also sentenced to 13 years. He told the judges earlier this week that the court had come under \"pressure from the political establishment\" to punish Golden Dawn. It has been a sharp fall for Michaloliakos, a former army commando who has compared himself to Julius Caesar, and for his party, whose members portray themselves as victims of political persecution. Party loyalists say they're patriots. In 2016, they endorsed Donald Trump during his presidential run because they said he promotes \"clean ethnic states.\" Michaloliakos tweeted last week that he and his deputies were \"condemned over our ideas.\" He also said Greece will remember Golden Dawn \"when illegal immigrants are the majority in Greece, when [the government] hands over earth and water to Turkey, when millions of Greeks are unemployed on the street.\" Twitter has since suspended his account. The long criminal trial has choked the life out of Golden Dawn. With its brutality on full display, the group lost public support and was so broke it could no longer pay rent for its Athens offices. Infighting prompted resignations and defections. But rights groups and political analysts warn that its ultra-nationalist ideology lives on in other parties and institutions. Golden Dawn started as a fringe group in the 1980s, but it rose to new prominence by channeling public anger over Greece's dire economic struggles of the past decade. Its rise was a shock to many Greeks, who were alarmed by the party's virulent anti-immigrant stance and slogans such as \"Blood, Honor, Golden Dawn!\" In last year's elections, Golden Dawn did not win enough votes to earn a single seat in parliament.",
