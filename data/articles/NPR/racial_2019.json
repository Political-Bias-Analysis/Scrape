            "article_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chairs the weekly Cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Gali Tibbon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chairs the weekly Cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem on Sunday. Aaron David Miller (@aarondmiller2) is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department Middle East analyst, adviser and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations. He is the author most recently of the End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President. In March, Israel will hold its third election in barely a year. While that may presage the beginning of the end of the Benjamin Netanyahu era, it's likely going to be a fairly long and painful goodbye. Prime Minister Netanyahu was indicted last month on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. But he will keep trying to maneuver to remain prime minister for as long as he can and avoid a trial and conviction. Many Israelis have a hard time imagining politics without him. That he remains such a potent figure is a testament not only to his popularity among the Likud base. It also reflects the rightward shift that now encompasses the majority of the country and that Netanyahu has come to symbolize. That shift has decimated the Israeli left and given way to a divide between the right and center right \u2014 represented mainly by Netanyahu's conservative Likud party and the center-right Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, a former military chief. Neither was able to form a government in the September election. That Netanyahu remains relevant even now with all his travails reflects the turn to the right among a majority of Israelis and the perception that he remains both an effective prime minister and spokesman for their views. Aaron David Miller Despite his indictments, Netanyahu has been allowed to remain in power because Israeli law says only a conviction can compel a sitting prime minister to resign. (A separate issue of whether a newly elected prime minister under indictment can form a government is awaiting a legal ruling.) But Netanyahu's staying power stems from more than that. He commands respect, even fear, among his party's elite. Likud will have a leadership primary at the end of this month. Although former Cabinet minister Gideon Saar is expected to challenge him, Netanyahu is likely to prevail. Saar believes Netanyahu is dragging the party down and will open the door to a Gantz victory. Still, Likud has had only four leaders since the party was formed in 1973. It is not in the party's DNA to topple its chiefs. Moreover, Netanyahu maintains steadfast support from his right-wing coalition partners \u2014 religious and pro-settlement Zionist parties \u2014 that have allowed Likud to dominate national politics for the better part of the past four decades. The Israeli right has become the dominant force in national politics following the failure of the Oslo peace process during the 1990s and the 2000 Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada, especially Palestinian suicide attacks, and the strengthening of Islamist organizations Hezbollah and Hamas in the wake of Israel's withdrawals from Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2005. Demographic changes have also favored religious Jewish voters in elections. These factors combined have gutted the once-powerful Labor Party that guided the country through its first three decades. That Netanyahu remains relevant even now with all his travails reflects the turn to the right among a majority of Israelis and the perception that he remains both an effective prime minister and spokesman for their views. But can he lead Likud to victory in March and form a government? It would be foolish to rule it out. Yet it is hard to see Netanyahu's prospects improving. One recent poll even projects that in a national election, Saar would bring in more seats for a right-wing coalition than Netanyahu, even though it predicts neither would be able to form a government. Gantz, meanwhile, has held his own. As a former military chief of staff who wants to be prime minister, there is something of the strong, silent and authentic Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli statesman, about him. He's more of a listener than a talker. A recent poll gives Gantz's Blue and White party a six-seat margin over Likud. It's worth noting two of Likud's previous electoral losses have been to ex-chiefs of staff: Rabin in 1992 and Ehud Barak in 1999. Gantz has the security beat covered, perhaps to a fault. His tough bomb Gaza \"back to the Stone Age\" campaign videos either reflected Gantz's true hawkish nature or were designed to counter Netanyahu's campaign or paint the incumbent as a leftist. Maybe the cumulative effect of Netanyahu's indictments, the public's holding him responsible for forcing yet another election and his two consecutive failures to form governments have finally caught up with the politician the press has dubbed \"The Magician.\" There just may be no more rabbits in the hat, and likely none from Netanyahu's good friend President Trump, to save him. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman \u2014 considered kingmaker in recent elections \u2014 publicly declared last week he would support a pardon for Netanyahu if the leader left politics. Should Gantz best Netanyahu in March elections, no one should expect transformational magic in Israeli politics or a quick solution to the Palestinian situation. Gantz's views on peace issues are largely unknown, but one thing is clear: His first priority will likely be to try to heal the divisions among Israelis, not take on a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Surrounding himself with a coalition including several former generals, Gantz seems to represent the old right. It is a more statesman-like version of Likud, in the words of one Israeli journalist, pushing for civility, national unity, rule of law and a militant patriotism that puts security and defense first without foreclosing the possibilities of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Should Gantz prevail, it would be a major accomplishment if he could just restore a measure of civility, unity, good governance and respect for rule of law to Israeli political life. In doing so, he would begin to repair the damage of the roller-coaster that has been the Netanyahu years.",

Updated at 11:09 a.m. ET Sunday Defying a government ban, thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday and clashed with police throughout the night in one of the most dramatic and violent days of unrest since June, when the protests began. The worst violence occurred at around 10 p.m. as riot police rushed into a metro station and arrested 40 people. Riot police wielding batons pepper-sprayed bystanders and protesters inside Hong Kong's Prince Edward metro station before detaining incapacitated protesters. Video from inside the station showed metro passengers kneeling and begging for mercy as they were sprayed. On Sunday, protestors blocked all roads, buses and metro lines to Hong Kong's airport but did not manage to shut it down. Riot police arrived early in the afternoon, causing hundreds of protestors and travelers to flee the airport, with many walking for hours to return to the city. Tung Chung, a metro station close to the airport, was temporarily suspended as riot police checked identification documents of passengers. Events first took a violent turn on Saturday afternoon, when police fired tear gas and used water cannons laced with blue dye in their attempts to disperse protesters who were throwing objects and gasoline bombs at the main government headquarters. One of the most striking images from Saturday's protests was that of a large fire, blazing across a street in a major shopping district. Protesters created a barricade of stadium chairs stretching across Hong Kong's Hennessy Road, close to police headquarters, and set it ablaze in the early evening.

A reporter heard at least three explosions as protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the blaze. Protesters also tore up patches of sidewalks for bricks to hurl at police headquarters. Masked demonstrators waving color-coded flags warned onlookers to stay a safe distance from the blaze, and firefighters were at the scene in minutes. Riot police moved in quickly, causing protesters to move steadily eastward. Police began arresting protesters in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district shortly after, as jeering passersby and restaurant-goers shouted insults at law enforcement.

Throughout the afternoon, protesters alternated between chanting for democratic elections and also singing religious songs. They said they were praying for peace \u2014 and also for \"sinners.\" Marches then swelled into the tens of thousands throughout the afternoon as crowds moved peacefully west toward Beijing's government offices on Hong Kong island, which police began barricading that morning. \u201cHallelujah\u201d swelling up in Wan Chai, Hong Kong as people began rallying despite police ban pic.twitter.com/C0KPvRHGgu Saturday's demonstrations came on the fifth anniversary of Beijing's decision to continue vetting all candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive position. That decision sparked the 2014 \"Umbrella Revolution,\" which consisted of months of mass pro-democracy protests but ultimately failed to secure direct elections for Hong Kong. The past three months of protests in Hong Kong were triggered by legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong's government to extradite people to China for certain crimes \u2014 a proposal that critics feared could be used to target outspoken critics of China. Though Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, responded to protests by suspending the bill in mid-June, protesters continued to demonstrate because the bill has yet to be formally withdrawn. The activists have since expanded their list of demands to include calls for Lam's resignation, direct elections, an inquiry into police tactics and the unconditional release of all arrested protesters. Lam has refused or ignored the demands. On Tuesday, Lam said the government was looking into all \"legal means to stop violence and chaos\" in Hong Kong. This past week, China sent additional troops to Hong Kong. In a news conference Friday, Hong Kong police commander Kwok Pak Chung said unauthorized demonstrators could face jail sentences of up to five years. Demonstrators showed up despite that warning \u2014 furious at what they see as police brutality, and further galvanized by a wave of arrests of prominent activists and politicians. On Thursday and Friday, police arrested three prominent activists \u2014 most notably, 22-year-old Joshua Wong, who leads the youth activist group Demosisto. Wong was released on bail and attended Saturday's protests. Three pro-democracy lawmakers were also arrested on Friday, according multiple media reports. Police in Hong Kong have made over 900 arrests associated with this summer's protests, but some see these targeted detentions as a shift in strategy. Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, called the latest arrests and the ban on Saturday's rally \"scare tactics straight out of Beijing's playbook.\" Though police have targeted high-profile activists and pro-democracy thinkers, the protest movement in Hong Kong remains a leaderless movement. On Sunday, protesters plan to shut down transportation lines into the Hong Kong International Airport for the third time in three months. On Monday, a general strike is set to begin across universities and many other sectors. \"I think when the government go hard, we go hard,\" said Isaac Cheng, a vice chairman of Demosisto. \"We ask the government, please respond to the five demands as soon as possible. Otherwise, the people may be using some more radical ways or more hard ways to respond to the response of the government.\"",

            "article_content": "by Ibram X. Kendi Hardcover, 305 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The writer Ibram X. Kendi has made a name for himself by tackling one of the most important \u2014 and one of the most sensitive \u2014 topics in America today.  His 2017 book, Stamped From the Beginning, is a history of racist ideas in America, and his new book is called How to Be an Antiracist. It starts with a moment in Kendi's own life: He was a high school senior taking part in an oratorical contest honoring Martin Luther King Jr., delivering a speech that ultimately won him first place. Ibram X. Kendi\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Watts/Courtesy of American University\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ibram X. Kendi \"And in this speech, in which I thought I was being so progressive and so radical, in fact I was expressing a litany of anti-black ideas, particularly about black youth,\" he says. \"I talked about 'black youth don't value education' and I talked about 'black youth keep climbing the high tree of pregnancy,' that 'black youth are not trained well by their parents,' and this majority-black crowd of 3,000 largely clapped. And really, that was the moment in which I recognized just how many racist ideas, anti-black racist ideas, I had consumed over the course of the '90s \u2014 a time that many of these ideas were mainstream.\" On the definition of \"antiracist\" I define an antiracist \u2014 and I should say that the book, as you know, is sort of anchored on all of these definitions, because I think it's critical for us to define terms in order to have productive conversations about race. But I define an antiracist as someone who is expressing an antiracist idea or supporting ... an antiracist policy, policies that yield racial equity, while antiracist ideas talk about the equality of racial groups, and I'm very deliberate in arguing that we should be striving to be antiracist as opposed to self-identifying as not racist. On the difference between antiracist and not racist What we should remember \u2014 and I don't think many Americans realize this \u2014 is that eugenicists, when they were called racist in the 1930s and 1940s, their response was \"I'm not racist.\" When Jim Crow segregationists in the '50s and the '60s were called racist, their response was \"I'm not racist.\" Today, when white nationalists and white supremacists are charged with being racist, their response is \"I'm not racist.\" It has long been this sort of term of denial in which people refuse to recognize the way in which they're actually being racist. And so I don't think people realize when they say that, they are connecting, very deliberately, with white nationalists and, and Jim Crow segregationists and eugenicists. I define an antiracist as someone who is expressing an antiracist idea or supporting ... an antiracist policy, policies that yield racial equity. Ibram X. Kendi On the idea that the term \"racist\" isn't a pejorative So two years ago, Richard Spencer, a white supremacist, helped organize the Unite the Right rally, which ultimately led to all these violent clashes between white supremacists like him and antiracist protesters \u2014 one of whom was killed. Richard Spencer once said, \" 'Racist' is not a descriptive term \u2014 'racist' is a pejorative term,\" and in fact, many Americans, not realizing it, agree with Richard Spencer \u2014 when it is in fact a descriptive term. It describes when a person is saying something like, \"This is what's wrong with a racial group.\" It describes when a person is supporting a policy that is creating racial inequity. And what's interesting is people change. You know, \"racist\" is not a fixed term. It's not an identity, it's not a tattoo \u2014 it is describing what a person is doing in the moment, and people change from moment to moment. On pushback to using the word \"racist\" and whether it means you have to understand someone's intent I think that again, that is based on this definition that a racist has racist bones in their body, a racist has a racist heart \u2014 but I don't really define racist at all by intent. I define it based on what a person is saying. The idea \u2014 is this idea keynoting hierarchy or equality? And I define policy based on its effect, purely and simply. And so if the effect of a policy is an injustice or an inequity, it's racist. And I think journalists can do that. You know, if someone says, \"This is what's wrong with black people,\" they can say that idea is racist. If a policy is, is leading to inequity, they can call that policy racist. We no longer \u2014 the way we should be defining \"racist\" and \"antiracist\" \u2014 have to worry at all about intent. On the idea of President Obama's election ushering in a post-racial society This idea of a post-racial society was quite possibly the most sophisticated racist idea ever created, because unlike previous racist ideas that specifically told us how we should think about particular people of color or how we should think about this particular racial group, what post-racial ideas did was, it said to us, \"Racism doesn't exist \u2014 racist policy doesn't exist,\" in the face of all of these racial inequities. And so then it caused us to say, \"OK, this inequity, like the black unemployment rate being twice as high as the white unemployment rate, it can't exist because of racism. It must exist because there's something wrong with black workers.\" So then we created our own ideas to understand racial inequity all around us, and now we're seeing the effects of those ideas even when they're extremely lethal. On the claim by some Trump supporters that Obama's election made the nation more divided I actually think that it polarized Americans, because it allowed people to spread this false notion that, look, you have a black president. This black president is a representation of people of color taking over. And when people of color take over, they're going to ruin white lives, even though the evidence showed that he and others like him were actually creating equal opportunity, were actually making, in certain ways, the lives of white people better. But it allowed people to manipulate Americans into believing that the problem, that the reason why they were struggling, was because of black politicians or Latinx immigrants. And then it said to those very people, \"I will be your savior.\" On whether President Trump fits his definition of a racist \"Racist\" is not a fixed term. It's not an identity, it's not a tattoo \u2014 it is describing what a person is doing in the moment, and people change from moment to moment. Ibram X. Kendi Without question. And in many ways, he embodies nearly every aspect of a racist. He's someone who regularly expresses racist ideas, like Latinx immigrants are invading this country, that Mexicans are, are animals, that black people live in hell, that their communities are infested. But then he simultaneously is supporting policies that specifically target racial groups. We're seeing what's happening at the southern border, primarily targeted towards Latinx immigrants. We see the ways in which his policies \u2014 he's not seeking to protect black people being killed by police. We can see the Muslim ban. And then when you put that all together, when we charge him with being racist, what does he say? He says, \"No, no, I'm not racist. I'm actually the least racist person you've ever interviewed. I'm actually the least racist person in the world.\" And so his consistent denial of his racism is the heartbeat of racism. On where America is now I think in certain ways we are better off. Yes, we've had a march of racial progress, but we've also had a second march of racist progress in which policies that are racist and ideas that are racist have become more sophisticated over time, which means that they're harder to identify and challenge \u2014 which means they're having a huge effect on our society without even knowing it. And so obviously, black people, let's say, are doing things and are able to do things now that they were not able to do 50 years ago, let alone 150 years ago. But then simultaneously we have this emergence of white nationalist terror. We have people being mass incarcerated. We have people continuously being shot by police. We have the racial wealth gap, which is currently growing. On how working toward antiracism affects his own life and whether he calls out friends and family for racist actions Sometimes. And the reason I say sometimes is because I think what's critical for us is to build up the type of relationships in which we can call out people. And so with people in which I have those types of relationships with, that I've built that type of relationship with, I call them out. For those that I have not built that type of relationship, but I'm in the process of building that type of relationship, I do not \u2014 but I'm planning to do so when I feel as if I've gained their trust. But the way this happens personally is for us to define terms \u2014 you know, what is a racist idea? And then, when we express those ideas, for us to acknowledge, you know what? That idea, based on this simple definition, is a racist idea. I'm not going to say it anymore. I'm gonna think differently. I'm going to strive to be antiracist, and in striving to be antiracist, I am no longer going to think that there is something wrong with people of color and that is the cause of the disparities in our society or that's the cause of my own personal struggles. I'm going to look for and identify racist policies, and I'm going to join those policymakers and those organizations who are striving to eliminate those racist policies and put in antiracist policies that create equal opportunity for all.

A group of voting rights advocates and felons has filed a lawsuit after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis approved a law that could make it more difficult for felons to vote. The new law requires felons to pay any outstanding court fines or fees before they can cast their ballots \u2014 a requirement that the American Civil Liberties Union describes as creating \"two classes of returning citizens: a group wealthy enough to afford their voting rights and another group who cannot afford to vote.\" Last November, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment that would restore voting rights to more than 1 million felons. The amendment approved by voters said that \"voting rights shall be restored upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation.\" It excludes those who have been convicted of murder or felony sexual offense. Democrats have argued that requiring payment of all fines and fees \"goes against the spirit of the constitutional amendment voters passed in November,\" as The Associated Press reported. After signing the new bill into law on Friday, DeSantis said in an accompanying letter that it \"confirms that the amendment does not apply to a felon who has failed to complete all the terms of his sentence.\" \"Over a million Floridians were supposed to reclaim their place in the democratic process, but some politicians clearly feel threatened by greater voter participation,\" Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. \"They cannot legally affix a price tag to someone's right to vote.\" The lawsuit filed Friday accuses the election officials of being motivated by racial discrimination, because felons in Florida are disproportionately black. Ten felons are part of this lawsuit, saying they will not be able to vote because of the new law. The felons owe different amounts of money, ranging from a few hundred dollars to tens of millions. Among them is 61-year-old Betty Riddle, a former addict with multiple convictions, \"mostly for possession of controlled substances\" and related offenses. She now works for the public defender of Sarasota and has more than $1,000 in court fees that the complaint says she is unable to pay. Therefore, she \"fears that she might be removed from the voter registration rolls.\" The new law also says that a court may convert financial obligations to community service, in which case a felon may vote after completing those hours. In January, Okaloosa County Supervisor of Elections Paul Lux told NPR's Greg Allen that he saw trouble ahead because of outstanding questions about whether felons needed to pay outstanding costs and fines to vote. \"Clearly there are things we do not know and things that we cannot know until someone provides us with better definitions,\" Lux said. Before the vote last November, \"people who served their time could apply for clemency to a board headed by the governor,\" Allen reported. \"But the cumbersome process and a multiyear backlog meant that only a small percentage applied.\"",

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Tens of thousands of protesters are in the streets of Hong Kong again today, despite a police ban and at least nine arrests of prominent activists and local politicians earlier this week. It's the 13th straight week of marches and demonstrations against Hong Kong's Beijing-controlled government. NPR's Beijing correspondent Emily Feng is there in the streets of Hong Kong and joins us. Emily, thanks for being with us. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hi. SIMON: I gather police in Hong Kong told people to stay home. Why did so many defy those orders and come out today? FENG: Well, they're furious at what they see as police brutality, and they're further galvanized by a wave of arrests of prominent activists and politicians yesterday. So today, they held what they called a religious rally. It was an attempt to evade police restrictions. Police called it an illegal gathering, however. And then, after the rally, they marched west towards Beijing's government offices on the island. And throughout the afternoon, protesters alternated between chanting for democratic elections and also singing religious songs. Here's one of the songs that they sang. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Singing) Sing hallelujah to the Lord. Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah... FENG: So protesters say they chose to sing that song because they were praying for peace, and they were also praying for, quote, \"sinners.\" I spoke to Christine, who's a 59-year-old protester at the rally, early today. And she explained what she meant by that. CHRISTINE: The police are the violent ones. And Carrie Lam, the chief executive, are the sinners. FENG: They're also out to protest this weekend because they're commemorating an important anniversary. It's been exactly five years since Beijing decided they were going to maintain control over how Hong Kong elects its leader. And that decision set up this big democracy movement in 2014 called the Umbrella Movement. It ended, but their demand for direct elections for their leader are being repeated by protesters today. SIMON: Emily, what - what's the government there in Hong Kong done to try and contain the protests? FENG: Well, as you mentioned, they arrested at least nine activists and politicians yesterday. Those included Joshua Wong, who's probably the most famous Hong Kong activist out there. He was let go on bail, along with another demonstrator, yesterday. And he actually was able to join marches today. Unrelated to government efforts, early this morning, there was a massive cyberattack that took down the primary chat forum that Hong Kongers have been using to organize protests. And, again, people were out marching today. But people - police had already barricaded all of the roads and the metro station that was right next to Beijing's government offices and wheeled in water cannons in preparation. The marches were mostly peaceful today, the ones that I attended. But earlier today, police fired tear gas at protesters who had clustered outside the Hong Kong central government buildings. They also fired blue-colored water cannons at protesters, which dispersed them only temporarily. SIMON: And what's happening around you right now that it's evening? FENG: As you can hear, there is a lot still happening. There are thousands of people standing around me on just one street in Hong Kong. If you can hear clanging, it's because they're dragging these big metal fences across the street and building barricades that have stopped all traffic from entering this downtown area. People are pounding on drums. They're firing laser pointers at cameras and police. And people have their gas masks and goggles on, so I think there's the expectation that police are going to escalate. And keep in mind protests don't just end tonight. Tomorrow, more protests are planned that are going to shut down the transportation lines into Hong Kong's international airport. Protesters have already shut it down twice before in the last three months. And there are general strikes starting across the city and universities on Monday. SIMON: NPR's Emily Feng in the streets of Hong Kong. Thanks so much. FENG: Thanks, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah was granted a visa after two other senators were denied. Lee says his solo talks with Russian government officials will help the U.S. maintain an open dialogue with Russia.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: You might remember, a couple of weeks ago, the Kremlin refused to issue visas to two U.S. senators - Democrat Chris Murphy and Republican Ron Johnson. Well, a third U.S. senator was granted a visa, Republican Senator Mike Lee, and his visit to Moscow has stirred up its share of controversy. One Russian state-run media outlet reported that Senator Lee discussed the U.S. dropping sanctions on Russia. Senator Lee's visit is only the second official visit to Russia in the five years since Russia sent military forces into Ukraine. NPR's Lucian Kim tracked him down in Moscow. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: I staked out Senator Lee at a fair in Gorky Park, where Russian kids were showing off robots they'd built at the U.S. Embassy's Cultural Center. Coincidentally, I found the Republican senator testing a mechanical elephant made out of Legos. MIKE LEE: Oh, there we go. Wow. KIM: Lee was winding down a two-day visit to Moscow, which he had made even after two of his fellow senators, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, were barred from entering Russia. The last time a member of a congressional delegation was denied a Russian visa, in 2017, her colleagues canceled the entire trip. But Lee defends his decision. LEE: The fact that that has occurred in the past doesn't mean that no conversations like this will ever or should ever occur again. Quite to the contrary, I think it's more of a reason why we need to have more conversations like this. KIM: Lee maintains U.S.-Russian relations have cooled off, as he puts it, perhaps more than they necessarily need to. Some people might characterize the relationship as being in a deep freeze - following Russia's annexation of Crimea, U.S. accusations of election interference by the Kremlin and the Trump administration's withdrawal from one of the last major arms control treaties. Lee's visit came the same week that Russian authorities were cracking down on anti-government protesters, with one sentenced to four years just for attending unauthorized rallies. LEE: I get it. This is not a government that operates with the same values as the American government. This is not a government that has shown respect for the dignity of the immortal human soul. It's one of the reasons why I'm here. I'm concerned about that. KIM: Lee says Russia can do a lot to reduce the toxicity of the relationship, by refraining from election interference in the future, guaranteeing religious freedom or protecting LGBT rights. Lee's guide during his first visit to Moscow was his friend, U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman. Huntsman, who's leaving his post next month, is adamant the trip was worth it. JON HUNTSMAN: Having the Russians able to hear voices from our legislative branch is a really important thing. KIM: The ambassador rejects the notion this congressional delegation was mostly just a photo op for the Russian government. HUNTSMAN: There's always going to be propaganda and disinformation associated with this relationship to some degree. But what we're looking for is real dialogue - people looking at each other across the table, exchanging in frank and honest discussions. KIM: Lee spent his time in Moscow meeting with Russian lawmakers and the American business community here, two groups of people keen to have economic sanctions eased. Lee says it's time to review the multiple sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia. LEE: We need to assess from time to time how they're doing, what impact they're having. As with any policy, it's important for us to reassess whether our policies make sense - who they're helping, who they're harming. KIM: It will be a tough sell back in Washington. Last week, the chair and ranking Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a joint statement condemning what they called acts of aggression by the Russian government against its own people protesting in the streets.

The Senate intelligence committee has issued a subpoena for him to testify. Updated at 7:40 p.m. ET The Senate intelligence committee has issued a subpoena to Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, to testify again before the panel, according to a source familiar with the subpoena. He met with the committee in December 2017 about his participation in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russians offering \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., declined to comment on the matter, but a spokeswoman for the committee told NPR, \"We do not discuss the details of witness engagements with the committee. Throughout the investigation, the committee has reserved the right to recall witnesses for additional testimony as needed, as every witness and witness counsel has been made aware.\" Trump Jr. wouldn't be the first in the president's immediate family to return to Capitol Hill for questioning. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, met with the intelligence committee in July 2017 and again in late March 2019. But Axios, which first reported the news, reports this is the first time one of Trump's children has been directly subpoenaed \u2014 notably by a committee led by the GOP majority. Donald Trump Jr. doesn't work in the White House, unlike Kushner and  Ivanka Trump, Kushner's wife, but he is a visible surrogate, appearing at campaign rallies and vigorously defending his father on social media. His girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, is a senior adviser to Trump's reelection campaign. News of the subpoena comes as the administration spars with House Democrats over authority and access to information related to the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The White House is asserting executive privilege as the House Judiciary Committee seeks the full contents of Robert Mueller's report, which was released with redactions on April 18. The panel voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for withholding some of the material, sending the resolution to the full House. Barr refused to testify before the Democratic-controlled committee last week after a dispute over the hearing's format. The administration also \"directed\" former White House counsel Don McGahn not to comply with the committee's subpoena for documents on Tuesday. According to the Mueller report, special counsel investigators could not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia. The report was noncommittal on whether President Trump had obstructed justice, though Barr has concluded he did not. Democrats are seeking additional details from the report on how the Justice Department reached those conclusions.",

A tumultuous week in Washington has set the stage for an intense new congressional investigation into President Trump \u2014 and what could prove to be a historic clash between the White House and Congress. The outlines are now clear about conduct that no one, including Trump, disputes: The president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the family of Vice President Joe Biden, a potential political rival in the 2020 presidential election. If Trump was sanguine about confirming that story \u2014 which the White House did with the extraordinary release on Wednesday of its own records about the conversation \u2014 House Democrats want the answers to more questions before they decide how much further to travel down a road they've said could lead to impeachment. Some of these questions were raised by the release on Thursday of the previously secret complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that sparked the Ukraine affair. In that document, the complainant suggests that intermediaries told Ukrainian officials beforehand that a phone call or a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Trump would depend on \"whether Zelenskiy showed willingness to 'play ball' \" with Trump. \"I do not know who delivered this message to the Ukrainian leadership, or when,\" the whistleblower added. House Democrats want to learn the identities of those people and where their communications fit into the story. Although Trump and his supporters argue that the White House's account of Trump's call with Ukraine's president doesn't record a \"quid pro quo,\" the full picture has not been made clear. Did an aide or a diplomat tell Kyiv beforehand that U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was being suspended \u2014 as it was in the summer \u2014 as the prelude for a phone call in which Trump could expect Zelenskiy to ask for it to resume? Zelenskiy did just that, according to the White House's account. When he told Trump that Ukraine was \"ready to continue to cooperate\" to buy more weapons from the U.S., that prompted Trump to ask him for a \"favor\" that he hoped might lead to information about the Biden family. House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters on Thursday after a hearing about the whistleblower complaint that he wants to learn whom the intelligence community's inspector general has talked with about the Ukraine affair and then begin seeking witnesses of his own to fill out the story. Inside the family The complaint also describes a practice within the White House of compartmentalizing accounts of potentially politically sensitive Trump calls in a separate close-hold system that limits access even within the administration. The system includes records of other presidential transcripts too, the complaint says. People who've served in the White House in past administrations have said that's not a conventional practice. When did it begin and why? Does the secret system described in the complaint actually contain records about other presidential phone calls with foreign leaders that resemble Trump's talk with Zelenskiy? What did Trump say? Trump has vowed to be transparent about the Ukraine affair. He volunteered on Wednesday to release records about two other phone calls with Ukrainian leaders involving himself and Vice President Pence. Trump also has suggested that he might not object to his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, speaking with congressional committees about the central role he has played in the outreach to Ukraine. But if past is prologue, the White House may not be eager to cooperate much more with what Trump and his supporters call Democrats' new \"witch hunt.\" The administration has not given Congress documents or access to witnesses in response to many of its earlier requests involving the Russia investigation, Trump's business dealings and more. The president's supporters have dismissed the Ukraine flap as another \"information warfare operation\" against the president. Meanwhile, some of the disputes between the House and the administration are still playing out in court after committees filed suit for the relevant materials. What isn't clear is whether the theoretically greater stakes of the Ukraine matter \u2014 which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have made the focus of what they say is an impeachment inquiry \u2014 may prompt Trump to change his tune. The White House already has invoked executive privilege \u2014 the doctrine that permits an administration to shield some of its internal workings from public view \u2014 in keeping some witnesses and materials from Congress. The investigation that Schiff and his colleagues now want to pursue involves the internal workings of the White House, discussions of the National Security Council and other aides, diplomats and others all squarely within the executive branch. If Giuliani, who has been working for Trump but not the government, isn't covered by executive privilege, many of the other people involved may be. Executive privilege already has been the subject of internal debates involving the whistleblower case, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told Schiff's committee on Thursday. Are Pelosi and Schiff about to drive into a wall they'll be unable to breach? Or will the putative threat of impeachment prompt Trump to open the gates? The red wall Trump may remain confident that in the event of actual impeachment proceedings \u2014 which would involve the equivalent of an indictment in the House and then lead to his trial in the Senate \u2014 he'd continue to enjoy the support of enough Republicans to retain the presidency. That has been the assumption by Republicans thus far, and as Washingtonians headed to work on Friday morning, the red wall in the Senate still appeared robust. At times, the president and his supporters have appeared to want to dare Democrats to go ahead with impeachment with the knowledge that they would lose, betting that the fallout actually would wind up weakening Pelosi and her members and strengthening Trump and Republicans. Before this week, Pelosi seemed to read these politics in the same way and sought to rein in the most aggressive Democrats in the chamber. Then the accounts of Trump's conduct broke the dam for so many of her members that the speaker joined them on Tuesday under the aegis of the I-word. But Pelosi also hasn't spelled out what, precisely, she, Schiff and her other top lieutenants actually may do differently, nor has she made clear how far Democrats are prepared to go. That has put the speaker in an uncertain new standoff with the president, and the next phase in this melodrama may depend on who's the first one to blink.",

Updated at 5:14 p.m. ET Former White House communications director Hope Hicks declined to answer questions related to her time in the Trump administration during her closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday, frustrating Democrats and leading some to say they will go to court to compel her testimony. The session lasted eight hours and included a one-hour lunch break. Hicks, a close adviser to Trump during the campaign and in the White House, is the first person from the president's inner circle to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as it looks into issues stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Democrats are particularly interested in asking her about several episodes detailed in Mueller's report related to obstruction of justice. But they have struggled to get answers. White House lawyers, who accompanied Hicks to the interview along with her personal counsel, have objected to questions related to her work in the administration. \"There's a whole bunch of lawyers in there,\" Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said during a quick break from the meeting. \"She's staffed up with many lawyers \u2014 her own lawyers, White House counsel lawyers \u2014 all there to make sure that she follows White House directions to not share information, to prevent Congress from conducting its oversight.\" Hicks' appearance before the House Judiciary Committee comes after weeks of angling by Democrats who have wanted an inside look into allegations that the president obstructed justice in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Trump administration has cited executive privilege in blocking access to other testimony and documents. Hicks is the first senior administration official cited frequently in special counsel Robert Mueller's report to testify before the committee. Her name is peppered throughout Mueller's report. She was in Trump's inner circle at key moments, including the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey and Trump's statement on the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russians who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton. President Trump lamented Wednesday afternoon that \"the Democrats are putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell\" and again falsely claimed \"total exoneration\" by the Mueller report. \"They were unhappy with result so they want a Do Over. Very unfair & costly to her,\" Trump tweeted. Battle of the branches of government The White House has invoked executive privilege to block Congress from getting Mueller's complete, unredacted report. The White House also instructed former White House counsel Don McGahn not to appear before Congress and barred him from handing over documents. In keeping with that thinking, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said Tuesday that Hicks is \"absolutely immune\" from answering questions about her work for the president. In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Cipollone said, \"Because of this constitutional immunity, and in order to protect the prerogatives of the Office of the President, the President has directed Ms. Hicks not to answer questions before the Committee relating to the time of her service as a senior adviser to the President.\" Cipollone added that White House counsel would accompany Hicks as she testifies \"to preserve the President's ability to assert executive privilege\" concerning the presidential transition. Democrats say they have done that during questioning on Wednesday but reject the White House's reasoning. \"There's no such thing as absolute immunity,\" Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat, said. \"It's just an ongoing effort by the president of the United States to prevent the American people from knowing the full truth.\" Cicilline and other Democrats have said the next logical step is litigation to compel Hicks to answer questions. Republicans, on the other hand, view the Hicks interview as an effort by Democrats to keep the Russia investigation and Mueller's report in the news. \"They seem to be bound and determined to find something to keep the story alive about the president getting impeached and this is just kind of the latest thing to keep it out there in the press,\" Ohio Republican Steve Chabot said. \"I think this is a complete waste of time.\" Democrats' persistence Hicks was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee in May. The White House instructed her to defy the subpoena, but she turned over some documents relating to her work on the presidential campaign. After the Russia probe ended, Mueller did not conclude that Trump committed a crime, but neither did he exonerate him. He told Congress last month that if his office \"had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so.\" Nadler said a transcript of Hicks' Wednesday testimony will be made public. Democrats have also asked her about Trump's role in a hush money payment to a porn actress during the campaign. Wednesday's testimony is not the first time Hicks has appeared before Congress. In February 2018, she declined to answer questions about her time at the White House or during the transition. Longtime Trump ally Hicks had been Trump's longest serving aid when her resignation was announced by the White House a day after her appearance on Capitol Hill. At the time, the president described her as \"as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person.\" A former teen model, Hicks was brought into Trump's orbit after impressing Ivanka Trump by promoting her clothing line at a New York public relations firm. In October 2018, Hicks joined Fox as an executive vice president and chief communications officer.",

            "article_content": "House panel moves forward with contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr. A year has passed since the U.S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. And, South African voters head to the polls.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are the limits of executive power? It's a question at the heart of our democracy. NOEL KING, HOST: That's right. The Constitution suggests that Congress has the ultimate power; they can fire the president. But the president has enormous power to act or, in this case, to refuse. President Trump has told his former White House counsel not to follow a subpoena from Congress. Lawmakers want to see documents relating to the work of Don McGahn; he once resisted the president's effort to have the special counsel fired. Lawmakers also want to see the special counsel's full report, but so far Attorney General William Barr is refusing. Jerry Nadler is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JERRY NADLER: Yes, we will continue to negotiate for access to the full report for another couple of days, and yes, we will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith. INSKEEP: That was Nadler a few days ago, and now, according to Nadler, the time for that vote to hold the attorney general in contempt has arrived - as has NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's on the line. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Is this conflict normal? LIASSON: There have been conflicts many times before between Congress and the executive branch about testimony about documents. What's different and not normal about this is that this is an across-the-board refusal. The president said that he was going to fight all the subpoenas. It's Don McGahn's testimony. It's access to the full Mueller report - the underlying materials and the redactions. It's Attorney General Barr testifying before the House. It's the president's tax returns. The president has also tweeted he doesn't want Bob Mueller to testify. And the system of separation of powers with three coequal branches of government really only works if the executive branch and the legislative branch accept that the other one is coequal; in other words, they have to respect the limits of their branch and respect the role of the other branch. And that's what's being drawn into question here. INSKEEP: And as I understand it, that is essentially the argument the administration is making against Congress. You have no legitimate purpose to do any of these things, and therefore, we're not going to follow them. LIASSON: That's right. That... INSKEEP: It's the administration asserting whether Congress has has the right or not. LIASSON: Right. At one point, the president said, I don't want people testifying to a party. It's not a party; it's the House of Representatives. INSKEEP: OK. So what does it mean if in fact this vote goes ahead of schedule today, and this House committee votes to hold the attorney general of the United States, William Barr, in contempt of Congress? LIASSON: Well, then I think it goes to court. The big development yesterday was that the Department of Justice told the House Judiciary Committee to either cancel the contempt vote, or it will recommend asserting executive privilege over the entire Mueller report - of course, most of it's already public - and all the underlying documents. And what that means is that, if the White House does assert executive privilege, that can be litigated, that can go to court, and that would be the next step. Instead of just delaying things and continuing to negotiate, once executive privilege is asserted, then the two sides go to court. INSKEEP: I'm trying to understand what the ultimate power is that Congress would have here. I mean, if I was held in contempt of court by a judge, I could be jailed until I decide to follow the court's orders. I guess we're not talking about William Barr being dragged away by bailiffs or something like that. LIASSON: Well, no, and that's important because they can - Congress can issue fines, but they don't have a constabulary. They can't put somebody in jail. They can go to court, and most legal experts say that probably Congress will win because the Constitution, as you mentioned earlier, says that Congress has oversight responsibility of the executive branch. They could dock people's salaries. They could refuse to pass legislation or raise the debt limit. There are things Congress can do. But I think we're in for a protracted legal fight. INSKEEP: Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Needless to say, President Trump has never been a fan of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. KING: Exactly one year ago, Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement. It was an agreement that had largely succeeded in stopping Iran's path toward developing a nuclear weapon. Now, at the time, Iran said it would stay in the deal, but then today President Hassan Rouhani announced Iran will stop complying with some of its commitments. INSKEEP: What's going on here? NPR's Peter Kenyon has been following this story. He's covered Iran for years. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What is Iran saying they will do or, more precisely, stop doing? KENYON: Right. President Rouhani says if things haven't gotten better economically for Iran in 60 days, it's going to return to enriching uranium to a higher level. That's important because if you've got low enriched uranium, it's good for electricity, things like that, but highly enriched uranium could go into a nuclear warhead. And as you mentioned, President Trump has never been a fan of this deal. It doesn't last forever. It doesn't deal with all the other problems the U.S. has with Iran - missiles, support for terror groups, etc. There's a whole list. And Trump pulling the U.S. out of the deal a year ago, bringing back sanctions prompted hard-liners in Iran to argue, well, Tehran should pull out, too. Rouhani today says Iran's not prepared to do that. He says UN inspectors have confirmed it's still in compliance. But if, in a couple months, it does take these steps, the higher enrichment of fuel, that would move Tehran closer to being able to resume nuclear weapons work if it wants to, and that's a nonproliferation worry (ph). INSKEEP: A couple of important distinctions that I'm hearing in what you're saying, Peter - first, it sounds like Iran has not stopped complying; now they are threatening to do so. KENYON: Yes. INSKEEP: And second, you're saying that Iran wants economic improvement. That was the original deal, right? Iran would limit its nuclear program... KENYON: Yep. INSKEEP: ...In return for more normal economic relations with the rest of the world, which is what the U.S. is now trying to block, right? KENYON: Exactly. And there are five other countries in this deal who have been saying all along they're trying to find ways to keep trade with Iran going and protect companies who want to do business with Iran and the U.S. So far that's been less than impressive, not very effective. Basically, banks and big companies who do business with both countries or might do business with both countries don't want to lose the American market for a much smaller Iranian economy. INSKEEP: What do we watch for over the next 60 days, then? KENYON: Well, it's possible that this move will breathe new life into these efforts by Russia, China and European countries to keep the deal alive. Iran's foreign minister flew to Moscow this week to see what he could find out. Will we see new efforts to protect companies who want to do business with Iran? And if so, how might the Trump administration respond to that? What we've seen so far is not especially encouraging. Iran is going to start keeping more low enriched uranium, also heavy water - that could put it out of compliance - and then there's this higher enrichment in 60 days. So the bottom line is, this maximum pressure campaign from Washington, where's it going to lead? INSKEEP: Complicated story; Peter, thanks for making it clear for us. KENYON: Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Today South Africans are voting in parliamentary and provincial elections. KING: That's right - big elections. The governing African National Congress has been in charge in South Africa for the past 25 years, when Nelson Mandela became the first democratically elected president. But a lot of people there feel his ANC party, which has been mired in corruption, has just come up short, failing to fully deliver on promises like basic needs, services and jobs. INSKEEP: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is in South Africa in Johannesburg. Hi there, Ofeibea. Where are you exactly? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings. Greetings from Rosebank Primary School, where two little girls - one black, one white - were racing up and down the forecourt with Georgie (ph), a golden retriever, who's come with his owners to vote this morning. So there's - you know, it's a public holiday here. So people are cool, and people are lining up or waiting to vote. INSKEEP: OK. So what are you seeing there, and what are you hearing? KING: It depends who you speak to. Black, white, the different races here in South Africa - some say, we stay with the status quo, which is the governing ANC, despite the fact that the ANC is seen to have been corrupt, mired in influence peddling and so on. And that's the view of Nkosikhulule Nyembezi (ph). And he says, as long as people end up in court and on trial and in jail for cheating and looting, that's a good thing. But he says, you know, South Africa is a young republic after 25 years, and that's why we must give this country a chance. Have a listen. NKOSIKHULULE NYEMBEZI: It's like a human being, teenage democracy. You show adolescence. You want to show your identity and your personality. So 25 years after democracy, it's maturing. Here's an adult, a young adult, beginning to take decisions. Because the troubling thing is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots is widening. INSKEEP: Ofeibea, I want to ask about the African National Congress. We mentioned their history. We mentioned their background in the opening up of South Africa, in the ending of apartheid. It's given them so much credibility, which raises a question - even if people are dissatisfied with their government, is there a real, credible opposition? QUIST-ARCTON: Well, that's the problem. There is an official opposition, and it is controlling. It is in charge in a couple of key provinces here in South Africa. Now, the ANC's support has been sliding over the years for these very many reasons. Not only corruption, which dates back 10 years under disgraced President Jacob Zuma, but also because many feel that the ANC has not fully delivered on its pledges for a better life for all South Africans. And of course, that means jobs. Youth unemployment is so high. It also means housing, electricity and, of course, this very sensitive issue of land reform and land distribution because, of course, most of the land in South Africa is owned by white people and not the majority black. So those are the sorts of issues South Africans are dealing with. Some say the ANC is the party to continue with; others say no, give others a chance. They've had 25 years, and they've let us down. INSKEEP: Is this seen clearly as a referendum on the ANC, then? QUIST-ARCTON: Oh, definitely. People are saying this is a defining vote. A quarter of a century after Nelson Mandela was sworn in as the first democratically elected president here, the first black president, people say, yes, this is the record card of the ANC, and they have been found wanting. But, you know, we'll see when the results come out. I'm not in Congo. I'm not in Nigeria. The elections have happened - not postponed - and South Africa's results will be known pretty soon. INSKEEP: Ofeibea, it's always a pleasure to hear from you. Thanks so much. QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure. Thank you. Ciao. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton in South Africa.

            "article_content": "With the Rev. Al Sharpton looking on, Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks at the National Action Network's annual convention Friday in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption With the Rev. Al Sharpton looking on, Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks at the National Action Network's annual convention Friday in New York City. Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate and the mayor of a small, majority-white city, came to New York this week to appeal to black voters. \"I believe an agenda for black Americans needs to include five things that all of us care about: homeownership, entrepreneurship, education, health and justice,\" the mayor of South Bend, Ind., told the audience at the National Action Network's conference. The annual gathering, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, is a key stop for Democratic presidential candidates. Buttigieg also affirmed to Sharpton that as president, he would sign a bill that would start a study of reparations. Aside from the conference, Buttigieg has recently, like several other candidates, appeared on syndicated radio show The Breakfast Club, which has a majority-black audience, and been interviewed by Ebony magazine. Since the 2016 election, the Democratic Party has been wrestling with its demographic strategy \u2014 to what degree it should invest its resources in winning white, working-class voters who may have swung toward Trump or put those resources elsewhere, like outreach to more reliably Democratic groups (like black voters). For primary voters, supporting Buttigieg may symbolize an appeal to white, working-class voters, especially in the Midwest. The Indiana Democrat pushes back on the idea that it's an either-or proposition, emphasizing the need for a message of fairness around issues that affect people of all backgrounds. \"I think if we do that right, it helps get around this false choice that would imply that winning back working-class voters who are white somehow means we ought to walk away from our bedrock commitments on racial and social justice,\" he said in an interview with NPR. \"Which I think is the exact wrong way to go.\" In fact, many Democrats have pushed back on the idea that there's a choice involved, at least in terms of messaging if not resources. \"It's not just about white working class. I'm not saying you stop talking to white working class; I'm saying that we are a diverse party,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer at MoveOn, a progressive political action committee. \"I don't think the Democratic Party has been doing enough to talk to another segment of their base, which is African-American voters, and so I think there's been this push in particularly in the last two years to do that.\" Coming to the National Action Network was a chance for Buttigieg to try to stand out from a large 2020 field with an influential civil rights group, a challenge for any candidate. Kimberlyn Carter, a brand strategist from Macon, Ga., went into the conference already impressed by Buttigieg. \"I think that he represents a political exceptionality that we haven't seen ever. I'm saying ever,\" she said. Carter added, with some surprise, that one staunch Democratic voter she knows also is an early Buttigieg fan. \"She thinks his husband is cool! My mom \u2014 an 80-year-old Bible-belt African-American woman,\" Carter said. \"She says, 'He just gives me so much hope.' \" Support for same-sex marriage has tended to be lower among African-Americans than whites, according to the Pew Research Center. However, support in the black community has grown substantially in recent years, reaching 51 percent support in 2017 according to Pew. Buttigieg could face some hurdles on his record on race issues. For example, a 2015 instance surfaced this week of Buttigieg saying \"all lives matter,\" a statement often seen as diminishing the Black Lives Matter movement. Buttigieg made sure to emphasize a different message at the conference, using the phrase \"black lives matter\" in his speech. He also addressed the incident when speaking to reporters after his speech. \"What I did not understand at that time was that that phrase just early into mid- especially 2015 was coming to be viewed as a sort of counterslogan to Black Lives Matter,\" Buttigieg said. He later added, \"Since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I stopped using it in that context.\" In addition, Buttigieg's economic record in South Bend may give some voters pause. One 2017 report found substantial racial economic gaps in the city that mirror those nationwide \u2014 much lower black homeownership rates and annual incomes than there are for whites, for example. In an interview with NPR, Buttigieg said that he hopes to alleviate that via an array of initiatives, like boosting minority entrepreneurship. On top of that, Buttigieg is still new on the scene and, until recently, has lacked a national profile. Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, thinks that could hurt Buttigieg among African-Americans, who he says tend to be \"notoriously pragmatic.\" \"Voters that vote very practically \u2014 they're not moved by the latest poll numbers or a fad of the day or the latest hot thing, because you just can't risk it,\" he said. \"You can't afford to jump on the bandwagon because there's too much at stake. Your voting rights, police brutality in the criminal justice system, all of these things.\" And Buttigieg is one of the latest hot things in the Democratic field \u2014 Google searches of him have spiked over the last month, as FiveThirtyEight noted, and he announced a $7 million fundraising haul. His challenge now is to make that more than a short-term bump. It could mean winning over skeptical voters like Francis Byrd, a financial analyst from Brooklyn. To him, Buttigieg is too inexperienced to be running. \"He's leveraging his white male privilege. And I understand that he's an openly gay man, but white openly gay men have privilege, too,\" he said. \"The point is that it gives him something additional to leverage that many of the other candidates in the race who have announced don't have.\" Byrd sees a similar sort of privilege in former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who entered the 2020 race after losing a close contest to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. \"I think there are candidates who are way too far afield and who haven't won races, or who haven't won a statewide race,\" he said. \"Maybe they need to sort of prove that out in order to be able to gain further confidence.\" But if Buttigieg or O'Rourke or any other candidate whom Byrd isn't sold on does win the nomination, Byrd said he would vote for them, if begrudgingly. Like many Democratic voters, regardless of race, he just wants a win next year.",

Beto O'Rourke got lots of attention from his campaign kickoff in Keokuk, Iowa. And thanks to some of his comments, not all of that attention was good. At the start of his speech, O'Rourke referenced a call from his wife, Amy, \"who's back in El Paso, Texas, where she is raising, sometimes with my help, Ulysses, who's 12 years old, Molly, who's 10, and their little brother, Henry, who is 8 years old.\" To some Democratic voters, that seemed like a flip acknowledgment that he was handing off parenting duties to his wife while he pursued his political dreams. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper likewise drew criticism after he was asked at a CNN town hall whether he'd consider a woman running mate. He said yes, but then flipped the question. \"How come we're not asking more often the women, 'Would you be willing to put a man on the ticket?' \" he asked moderator Dana Bash. (Hickenlooper later said that it was a joke.) They're not alone \u2014 Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker are among the candidates also asked about how they would look beyond their male points of view. All of which is to say that the men running \u2014 and, in particular, the white men running \u2014 are having to grapple with gender in a way they've never quite had to before. \"Perhaps for the first time in presidential politics, white men are being asked about the degree to which their race and gender inform both their access to the presidency as well as their agendas and perspectives that they'll bring to presidential politics,\" said Kelly Dittmar, assistant professor at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \"It just has them answering the same questions that women and candidates of color have always been asked.\" And O'Rourke seems to be doing that. On the campaign trail, he has multiple times said that his gender \u2014 and race as well \u2014 both privilege him. \"As a white man in this country, there are a set of circumstances that are different than they are for women, than they are for people of color,\" he said after a recent New Hampshire campaign event. Gender is always a presidential campaign issue It may be more visible now, but gender has always been a factor in presidential campaigns \u2014 even when women weren't major-party candidates. But because presidential candidates have almost always been men, masculinity has been baked into presidential campaigns. One obvious way that this plays out is when candidates try to out-tough-guy each other. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush (left) shakes hands with candidate Michael Dukakis at the start of the presidential debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1988.\n                \n                    \n                    Dennis Cook/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush (left) shakes hands with candidate Michael Dukakis at the start of the presidential debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1988. \"I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks that a naval exercise is something you find in Jane Fonda's workout book,\" then-Vice President George H.W. Bush told a crowd, referring to his opponent, candidate Michael Dukakis, in 1988. The manliness contest has popped up in multiple other presidential campaigns as well. George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004 seemed so set on showing off their dude credentials \u2014 shooting guns, playing sports, going fishing \u2014 that USA Today observed, \"It's macho time in the presidential race.\" John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, windsurfs off the coast of Nantucket, Mass., in 2004.\n                \n                    \n                    Laura Rauch/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, windsurfs off the coast of Nantucket, Mass., in 2004. Even in 2016, the first time a major party nominated a woman for president, Trump's gender was often at center stage. In a Fox News debate, he memorably defended the size of his hands. \"He referred to my hands \u2014 if they're small, something else must be small,\" Trump said, countering an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. \"I guarantee there's no problem. I guarantee you.\" That was central to Trump's identity, according to Jackson Katz, author of Man Enough?: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and the Politics of Presidential Masculinity. \"Donald Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 in large part by attacking the masculinity of his fellow Republican candidates, by successfully feminizing and ridiculing his fellow Republican candidates,\" he said. But because men have been the main template for presidential candidates, it also affects how voters have seen themselves and the country, Katz said. \"To me it's really important to look at the ways in which men \u2014 and especially white men \u2014 their voting patterns and their political identity [are] influenced by their notions of what it means to be a man and how the Republicans versus the Democrats present themselves,\" he said. At least for now, the 2020 Democrats' rhetorical styles are still evolving. Lately, much of the attention has been on some candidates' willingness to acknowledge that manhood is not the default American point of view. But as the campaign goes on, the candidates' various styles of masculinity will become more apparent. Booker, for example, has been running on a message of \"love\" \u2014 a marked contrast to Trump's often angrier rhetoric. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has shown a pugilistic side that more closely mirrors Trump's, saying at one event, \"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\" (Biden, who has not announced whether he will run in 2020, later backpedaled, saying he \"shouldn't have said\" that.) A diverse field of men One reason men are grappling with gender more in 2020 is that more women are running, according to Dittmar. \"It helps to have more women candidates who can also offer distinct ways in which you might navigate gender in presidential politics \u2014 in ways that challenge the male or masculine norm,\" she said. And that is one big part of what makes 2020 so different. Because male candidates no longer dominate the field, those candidates can't simply perform masculinity the way they used to. Instead, they are being asked questions about what it means to be a man running for president. On top of that, voters are seeing a wide variety of men run. The current Democratic presidential field is composed of black, Latino and Asian-American men, in addition to a gay candidate, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. And then there are still other types of perhaps-less-obvious diversity. Buttigieg and Booker are childless, and Booker has also never been married \u2014 both of which are breaks from most presidents. All of which is to say that candidates' other identities make the question of how they present themselves as \"men\" more complex. Buttigieg's sexual orientation doesn't inherently complicate how he presents his masculinity, according to Sean Meloy, senior political director at the LGBTQ Victory Fund. However, he notes that stereotypes about gay men may play into how voters see him. \"When it comes to that machismo and gay men, I think that those stereotypes are at odds with that toxic masculinity,\" he said, contrasting Buttigieg with Trump. Race also plays a significant role here. President Obama contended with gender and race at the same time. Comedian Keegan-Michael Key said he created his character of Luther, Obama's anger translator, for this reason \u2014 to express the anger that Obama, as a black man, couldn't safely vent. Gender is inextricably tied together with race in American politics, and today, voters and candidates alike often talk about white and male privilege in the same breath. Democratic voters recognize that, says Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, which promotes women of color in politics. \"Can you be intersectional in your politics? If you can't, I think the electorate's done with you,\" she said. \"There is a very active movement for gender equality that demands its leaders speak authentically and credibly to intersectional issues of gender, race, sexuality and others.\" New questions, but not necessarily disadvantages To be abundantly clear, none of this is to say that in confronting gender, the men are at a disadvantage in this presidential race. Rather, it's that the men \u2014 and, again, white men in particular \u2014 are now experiencing their gender and their race in a new way. Patti Rutka, who recently went to see O'Rourke at a New Hampshire brewery, said that she still believes that women still face the heavier political obstacles. \"The fact that we have the person in the White House that we do \u2014 it is evidence that the country is not quite totally ready for a woman,\" she said. \"I want the country to be ready for a woman, but I'm not sure that it is.\" And it's two white men \u2014 Biden and Sanders \u2014 who are the most well known of the potential Democratic nominees, and at least for now they are leading in early polling.",

Updated at 3:25 p.m. ET The Justice Department is to begin providing documents to the House Judiciary Committee after a dispute over a subpoena \u2014 but members of Congress are reserving the ability to continue to pursue contempt litigation down the line. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., announced the agreement on Monday, but the committee's staffers said nothing had changed about plans for Tuesday to vote to authorize civil contempt lawsuits that could later target Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Nadler wants to keep the door open to a contempt action if Barr and the Justice Department don't continue to play ball. Nadler has demanded a trove of material from the office of former special counsel Robert Mueller. \"We have agreed to allow the department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement,\" he said in a statement. Continued Nadler: \"If the department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps.  If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies. It is critical that Congress is able to obtain the information we need to do our jobs, ensuring no one is above the law and bringing the American public the transparency they deserve,\" he said. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the department was pleased at the return to the \"traditional accommodation process\" and that it \"remains committed to appropriately accommodating Congress's legitimate interests related to the special counsel's investigation.\" Even so, Nadler explained at a hearing later on Monday afternoon that the agreement with the Justice Department didn't cover everything he wants. It wasn't immediately clear what Nadler continues to want that the Justice Department isn't providing. In the meantime, however, Nadler said he expected his staffers to visit Justice Department headquarters, just up Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol, to begin reviewing some Mueller documents on Monday afternoon. Nadler also said he continues to hope to hear testimony from Mueller himself. The former special counsel so far hasn't scheduled anything and has resisted the idea of appearing before Congress, but Nadler seems to be insisting and hasn't ruled out another subpoena \u2014 for Mueller. \"The '70s called\" Judiciary Committee ranking Republican Doug Collins of Georgia welcomed the agreement, which he said undercut charges by Democrats that the Trump administration is \"stonewalling\" Congress. But Collins asked why the Democratic majority would go ahead with a contempt vote in view of the concessions made by the Justice Department. \"In light of today's agreement from the Justice Department, it's logical to ask: Is the chairman prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to greenlight lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?\" Collins asked in statement. The ranking member said on Monday afternoon that Democrats have resorted to stunts and game-playing to try to sustain a Russia investigation that did not result in Trump's removal \u2014 as he said they'd hoped it would. Collins also mocked Nadler for convening a hearing about Trump that featured former White House counsel John Dean, a figure from Watergate. Collins pointed out that former President Barack Obama had derided GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney when Romney had warned about dangers from Russia. \"The '80s called and they want their foreign policy back,\" as Collins paraphrased Obama. Then for himself, he said of the hearing with Dean: \"This committee is now hearing from the '70s \u2014 and they want their star witness back.\" Nadler's contretemps with the Justice Department Nadler's dispute with Barr centers on underlying evidence developed during the Russia investigation by the office of former special counsel Mueller. Nadler wanted an unredacted copy of Mueller's final report and material collected by the special counsel's team that informed its findings. Barr and the Justice Department didn't agree to give it. Although Barr said he was willing to let some members of Congress see some portions of Mueller's work product that weren't public, the attorney general said he was prohibited from giving Nadler and Democrats everything they sought. The dispute escalated to the point of a subpoena, which Barr rejected with a recommendation that Trump invoke executive privilege \u2014 the doctrine that permits a presidential administration to shield some of its internal workings from public view. The White House also cited that privilege in directing McGahn not to appear before Congress or give members notes or other materials from his time in the White House. McGahn is the key player in a few central episodes described in Volume II of Mueller's report, including a request by Trump that McGahn remove Mueller and then later, a request by Trump that McGahn falsify evidence denying the earlier request took place. McGahn declined. Trump's critics call that evidence that he obstructed justice by trying to frustrate the Russia investigation. Democrats want to hear more, and that is what had set the stage for the vote expected Tuesday on contempt for Barr. With it, members of Congress could authorize House lawyers to file lawsuits in order to ask a judge to compel Barr and McGahn to hand over the material Nadler sought.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote Tuesday on a civil contempt resolution against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Here's what you need to know about what it means and how it came about: Democrats vs. DOJ Democrats, who control the majority in the House, want Barr to give them an unredacted copy of the report filed by former special counsel Robert Mueller on his Russia investigation. They also want the underlying evidence that Mueller's office developed. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena for the Mueller materials. Barr rejected it, recommending that President Trump withhold the documents under the doctrine of executive privilege, which lets a presidential administration conceal some of its internal workings. The McGahn materials The White House also invoked executive privilege to shield McGahn from talking to Congress or giving up documents. The former White House counsel is a key part of episodes uncovered by Mueller's investigators. In one, Trump asked McGahn to remove Mueller and then, later, the president asked McGahn to cover up the earlier request. Vote expected Tuesday Nadler's committee has voted on contempt and, on Tuesday, the matter goes before all the members of the House. If the measure passes, it will authorize a civil lawsuit on behalf of the House. Committee chairmen and women also would become empowered to file their own lawsuits in order to seek documents or testimony in investigations into Trump and administration officials. Democrats are expected to support it. Republicans, who are a minority in the House, will oppose it. In fact, some Republicans may walk out in protest. What is contempt? A committee can issue a subpoena that's supposed to force a witness to give information or appear to testify. If a subject still doesn't agree, then that committee, or the full chamber, can find them in contempt. But it isn't like a finding of contempt in court, in which a judge can order someone jailed if she or he won't cooperate. Capitol Police officers probably will not kick down Barr's door and haul him off to jail. Instead, the contempt vote means the House can file a lawsuit in which it asks a judge to order Barr to comply. Why aren't Barr and McGahn cooperating? Several reasons. The attorney general says the Justice Department has made as many accommodations as it can to permit members of Congress to see the parts of Mueller's report that were withheld from public view. Beyond that, the department says, Democrats are just picking a fight. Specifically, federal regulations require the DOJ to keep grand jury material secret, Barr argues \u2014 even from Congress. Politics also is at play, naturally: Barr is an ally of the president. And even before Trump came along, Barr spent his career as a champion for strong executive power. The Trump administration also says Mueller's report and resignation mean the Russia imbroglio is over and that America \u2014 and especially Democrats \u2014 must move on. McGahn, meanwhile, may have broken with Trump, but he remains a loyal Republican and he and his lawyers have taken the position that he retains a duty to the president. So he's standing fast. What do the members in the House say? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Nadler and others argue that Mueller's office uncovered not only questionable actions, but criminal activity by Trump \u2014 alleged obstruction of justice in his attempts to frustrate the special counsel investigation. The president's refusal to cooperate with investigations and subpoenas also could be an \"impeachable offense,\" Pelosi has said. Democrats' disagreements Democrats, however, are divided among themselves about what action to take. Some in the House support an inquiry that could lead to impeachment, the procedure by which Congress can remove a president from office. Presidents have been impeached before but never removed. Pelosi is trying to both placate her most liberal members and keep mindful that many mainstream voters do not support impeachment. The Senate, meanwhile, remains under the control of Republicans. In impeachment, the House serves as a grand jury that recommends whether a president should be tried in the Senate, in proceedings overseen by the chief justice of the United States. Trump enjoys support in the Senate Republicans in the Senate probably would not vote to remove Trump from office. Some of Trump's supporters, in fact, believe that any impeachment process that did not result in removing Trump would be perceived as a victory for him \u2014 and a rebuke of Democrats. So what Pelosi has chosen, in so many words, is a strategy in which Democrats try to inflict as much political punishment on Trump as they can short of impeachment, including with inquiries like the one that has brought the House to the brink of this week's contempt vote. Some critics of Trump and Pelosi argue that the president's actions have been so egregious that the Congress has a duty under the Constitution to hold him to account irrespective of the political consequences for either side. Has this ever happened before? Big disputes often flare up when one or both houses of Congress are controlled by the party opposite from the one that holds the White House. And Congress has resorted to lawsuits in the past to try to compel the release of documents or the appearance for testimony of people who figured in its inquiries. When will this case go to court? Probably soon. Democrats have said they're optimistic about their chances, given past recognition by judges about the need for legislators to get information and exercise their powers of oversight. Pelosi crowed in a news conference last week about the legal victories she said Democrats already have won in their attempts to get other information related to Trump, including bank and financial records. What isn't clear, however, is how long the Barr matter might take to resolve. In former Attorney General Eric Holder's case, the litigation continued in one way or another until May of this year. Going fast vs. going slow The timing is important for the political aspects of the inquiries that Congress has launched. Pelosi and the Democrats running for president next year would like to learn what they can about Trump's past practices as soon as possible to exploit everything they uncover ahead of Election Day. Trump and the White House are seeking to block the House from getting the materials it has sought \u2014 by declining to cooperate with Congress and, in some cases, suing to quash the requests by Congress of third parties, such as Trump's banks. The president and Republicans want to drag out these legal fights, to the degree they can, for as long as possible to keep whatever is in the records from becoming political fodder.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is threatening to block Don McGahn, his former White House counsel, from testifying on Capitol Hill. Could the White House assert executive privilege?  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report was released more than two weeks ago, but it's still defining much of what goes on in Washington and beyond. President Trump is at odds with congressional Democrats over their efforts to keep investigating him and his administration in the wake of the Mueller findings. Earlier today, Trump talked about the special counsel investigation with, of all people, Russian President Vladimir Putin. We're joined for more now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. And Tamara, to start, what did Trump have to say to Putin? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, what we know is what President Trump has said about it. He said that they spoke for about an hour about Venezuela, a possible nuclear arms treaty, trade and, yes, the Mueller report. This is how President Trump recounted that part of the conversation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We discussed it. He actually sort of smiled when he said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain, and it ended up being a mouse. But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. So pretty much that's what it was. KEITH: That appears to have been a reference to a fable about a lot of hype leading to not very much. Of course Putin denies that he interfered in the 2016 election, but numerous Russians and Russian entities were indicted as part of the special counsel investigation for hacking and releasing Clinton campaign emails and for a social media campaign to sow discord in the U.S. and help elect President Trump. Trump was also asked by reporters today if he told Putin not to meddle in 2020. And he said, no, they didn't discuss that. CORNISH: Meantime, the House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn. They want him to turn over documents early next week and to testify later in the month. Where is the president on this? KEITH: He clearly does not want McGahn to testify. He said today that he will be deciding in the next few days whether to invoke executive privilege. McGahn, as you might remember, gave 30 hours of interviews to the Office of Special Counsel and featured quite prominently in the obstruction of justice section of the Mueller report. And in President Trump's view, as he expressed today, that was more than enough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I let him interview the lawyer, the White House lawyer, for 30 hours. Think of that - 30 hours. I let him interview other people. I didn't have to let him interview anybody. I didn't have to give any documents. I was totally transparent because I knew I did nothing wrong. KEITH: And President Trump has made it pretty clear he isn't inclined to let McGahn or anyone else from his close orbit go before Congress. He said he's going to fight all the subpoenas. But to this point, he hasn't yet invoked executive privilege. CORNISH: I want to follow up on this idea of Don McGahn because he already sat for all of those hours of interviews, and the president didn't invoke privilege then. How can he do it now? KEITH: Well, the White House has this legal theory - and it's something they've been talking about for a while - that Mueller and his investigation were part of the Justice Department, which is part of the executive branch. So even though they cooperated with Mueller, they didn't really waive executive privilege because it was all in the same branch. But one law professor I spoke to today says that it's not an argument he expects to hold up particularly well because the cat is out of the bag. The Mueller report is a bestseller. He says it would have been a more compelling argument before the report was released. But it is certainly a fight that can and probably will happen in the coming weeks and months and maybe years between the executive branch and the legislative branch. CORNISH: Plus McGahn is a private citizen. Does that matter? KEITH: Right. I've reached out to McGahn's personal attorney. He hasn't responded yet. So we don't know exactly what McGahn is thinking. But it's not like he could get fired at this point for going against the president's wishes, but the White House could potentially sue to try to stop him from testifying. CORNISH: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 4:58 p.m. ET After nearly two years of waiting, special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election is finally done. And there's growing bipartisan pressure on Attorney General William Barr to make it public. Barr, who received Mueller's findings on Friday evening, told congressional leaders in a letter that he was \"reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" But a Justice Department official said Saturday afternoon that the information Barr is to provide Congress is \"not coming today.\" Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were at the Justice Department on Saturday, the official said. \"They're analyzing the report, working very closely together,\" the official added, to put together their submission to Congress. In a letter to her Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that House Democrats \"are insisting that any briefings to any Committees be unclassified so that Members can speak freely about every aspect of the report and not be confined to what DOJ chooses to release publicly.\" A Justice Department official said Friday that Mueller's report does not recommend any future indictments, although criminal charges against more than 30 individuals and entities, including onetime top aides and associates to President Trump, have already been filed. The Trump administration has said little publicly about the report's completion, by design, according to Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys on the Russia matter. \"I think we've said everything we can say,\" Giuliani told NPR Saturday. \"There's nothing more to be said until we see the report. I have the same sort of theory about it that everybody else has. If they're not going to indict anybody else, then they can't have any further evidence of collusion. Otherwise they would have brought some kind of conspiracy indictment.\" But that view is not shared by congressional Democrats. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NPR's All Things Considered on Friday that he believes the facts and evidence \"are likely to show collusion and a lot of wrongdoing that might not be indicted.\" He says that's because Justice Department policy is that a sitting president cannot be indicted and that the standard for indictment is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \"So Congress and the American people really need and deserve to know all findings and evidence of wrongdoing and criminality that may not have led to an indictment but should lead to holding people accountable and changes in the laws.\" Giuliani said the president's legal team may respond to the Mueller report with its own document. \"There's a draft report that we prepared, which is available if we need,\" he said. \"So if they don't say anything harmful or critical that's worth responding to, we won't respond. If they do say something, then we'll put out whatever is necessary to rebut it.\" Democrats have long been pushing Barr, who was confirmed to lead the Justice Department last month, to make Mueller's report public as a further glimpse into what the 2016 Trump campaign's Russia ties and contacts were. Saturday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told NPR he thought it would be appropriate to hold a hearing with both Barr and Mueller, depending on what is in the special counsel's report and how comprehensive the disclosures to the public wind up being. \"A hearing with the attorney general and the special counsel would certainly be a way for us to inform the general public about what we did and didn't get and why,\" Coons said. \"I think there's going to be a lot of folks with lingering questions.\" Earlier this month in a sweeping bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives said the report should be released; however, that vote is not legally binding. The Democratic chairmen of six major House committees issued a statement Friday demanding that Barr release the report to the public \"without delay given the profound public interest in the full disclosure of information learned by the Special Counsel.\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said Congress should get full access to the report. He also wants all documents related to Mueller's investigation to be preserved and made available to the appropriate committees on Capitol Hill. Finally, Warner said, the public should also have some access to Mueller's final work product after nearly two years of investigating. \"Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves,\" Warner said. \"The special counsel's report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the attorney general should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice.\" Blumenthal also said that the full report, not simply Mueller's conclusions, should be made public. \"No one should be satisfied with what we see unless it is full disclosure of the facts and evidence \u2014 not just the conclusions, but all of the findings that went into those conclusions,\" Blumenthal said. \"No scrubbing for executive privilege, no involvement by the White House in censoring or reviewing and no claims of executive privilege.\" House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told All Things Considered that he \"will subpoena people as necessary\" based on information in the report. \"We are determined that we protect the public and that we make this as transparent as possible.\" And on Friday, as the long-anticipated investigation was finally done, some top Republicans echoed their Democratic colleagues. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who is up for re-election in 2020, tweeted that \"Barr should release the report to the public as soon as possible, while accommodating national security considerations.\" I have always had confidence in Special Counsel Mueller and welcome the completion of his report. Attorney General Barr should release the report to the public as soon as possible, while accommodating national security considerations. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, who is the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, also said that Mueller's report should be given to the public to the \"maximum extent permitted by law.\" After 2 years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, & I look forward to reviewing AG Barr\u2019s report carefully, when it becomes available. I expect DOJ to release the special counsel\u2019s report to this committee & public w/o delay & to maximum extent permitted by law. pic.twitter.com/PG6WT0G9ZA Republicans were quick to interpret the news that no further charges were apparently forthcoming as full vindication of the president, who has long called the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt.\" \"We've seen no additional evidence whatsoever that the investigation is going to move forward. In fact, the opposite is 100 percent true,\" former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told All Things Considered. \"And this marks the final conclusion of the special counsel's investigation into the Russia investigation \u2014 uh, potential collusion narrative between the Trump campaign and the Russians. This is the end of it after 675 days.\" Even some top Republicans, though, backed making the report public to finally and fully quash any doubts about Trump and his 2016 campaign. \"Now that he's wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a past Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. \"Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries.\" Earlier this week, Trump seemed to be amenable to that as well. \"Let it come out. Let people see it \u2014 that's up to the attorney general,\" the president told reporters as he was departing for a trip to Ohio.

Ralph Northam outside of the governor's mansion in Richmond, Va., on Feb. 4. Nearly two weeks later, many young black community leaders are still calling for him to resign. After a calamitous few weeks, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is heading out on what he's calling a reconciliation tour. He is holding tight on to his office despite widespread calls to resign after a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page surfaced and he admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s. But has vowed to focus the rest of his term on racial inequality while also examining his own white privilege. The tour starts Thursday, Feb. 21 at historically black Virginia Union University. But some residents, especially young black community leaders, say Northam's tour is too little, too late. Francesca Leigh Davis lives about 30 minutes outside of Richmond, Va., in rural Henrico County. She's a florist who runs her business out of her dining room. The 32-year-old says the past few weeks have been busy, and some of her flowers are wilting. \"I've been trying to nurse them back to life. But it's a process,\" she says. Davis is up at 4 a.m. most days, dividing her time between her business and her activism in Richmond. \"I still have to be a mom and a wife too,\" she says. She's been especially busy since a racist photo on Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page surfaced on Feb. 1. After initially apologizing for appearing in the photo, the governor later held a televised press conference and said that he was neither the man in blackface nor the man in the Ku Klux Klan robe. Minutes later, he admitted to wearing blackface for a dance contest more than 30 years ago. Davis came away from that conference, like many others, with the feeling that Northam didn't seem to understand the severity of what he did. She's wanted his resignation from day one. In Richmond, Va., Davis helps run a group called RVA Dirt, which has a popular Twitter account and a radio show. The group has been focused on the scandal in the executive branch since it emerged. And many older African-American activists have softened their tone on the governor, especially since two women have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault and the attorney general, Mark Herring, also admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s. That's not the case for as many young black community leaders in Richmond who say Northam's apology is too little, too late. When it comes to those sexual allegations against Fairfax though, Davis thinks he is due an investigation. Before he was accused, Davis says she wanted him to be the next governor, \"and if these accusations are true, that's the last thing he should do.\" The idea being that while Fairfax will have to face legal consequences if he did what he's accused of, \"there is no system, except for the people, to hold Ralph Northam and Mark Herring accountable,\" and if the people don't, no one will, says Chelsea Higgs Wise, who is 34 and works at an anti-racism organization in Richmond, Va. Wise says her concerns with the governor go back before the scandal, to when she campaigned for him in 2017. She says it bothered her that Northam wouldn't use words like \"black people\" or \"race.\" \"Even in these spaces that were made for African-American people to come hear him talk, he would talk about those that were disenfranchised, those that were of poor means, but would not say our names.\" A spokesperson for Northam's office called that claim \"absurd.\" Wise says Northam wasn't a perfect candidate, but she felt like Democrats only had one choice, \"because we were so desperate after the 2016 election to make sure we kept the governor's mansion blue and the state blue, we weren't really looking at who we were about to put in there.\" Meanwhile, at Virginia Commonwealth University, Ravi Perry, the chair of the political science department, is talking to young Richmond Democrats about how they can move beyond the recent scandal. \"I have not met one person, under the age of 40, in the last two weeks who has said anything other than 'resign.' It's been clear. It's been across racial lines,\" he says. Young Democrats want leaders who are actively addressing race, he says. It's no longer good enough not to be racist. \"We have real issues. And we're not talking about those issues,\" Perry says. If Virginia residents and Northam weren't explicitly addressing race before, they are now.",

A few feet from the styling chair, Okafor's young daughter glides on a scooter through shelves of international foods and spices. Racks of African clothing \u2014 sewn by Okafor \u2014 line the wall. It's a busy place, she says, and one that the city's small immigrant population seeks out for food and connection. \"I have bikes here,\" Okafor says. \"I have jumping ropes. I have Play-Doh. People come here to shop with their kids. Kids are riding bikes. I mean, it's a community, so why not? Last month, Okafor made history in the larger community: The attorney and small-business owner became the first immigrant and first person of color elected as a councilor in the small, overwhelmingly white city. Okafor's election is part of a growing wave of women of color who are running for political office, and winning. Taking things into her own hands A shop like Okafor's didn't exist when she and her husband moved to Maine from Nigeria about a dozen years ago on a work visa. Like most of the state, Bangor is overwhelmingly white. And Okafor says the adjustment was hard, as people couldn't understand her and would often stop and stare. Despite holding a law degree from her home country and passing the New York bar exam, Okafor says it was nearly impossible to get any job in the legal field. Employers told her she was either overqualified or said she needed \"Maine experience.\" \"Being frustrated is beyond the description,\" Okafor recalls. \"I feel free to talk about this now because I am my own employer. But [I] imagine a lot of other people who go through that but cannot speak up.\" So three years ago, Okafor took things into her own hands and launched an immigration law practice, which she could operate with her out-of-state license because of its basis in federal law. She then opened her international food store and hair salon to provide needed services to Bangor's immigrant community.

She opened her international food store and hair salon to provide needed services to Bangor's immigrant community. But she wasn't done. This year, after seeing other immigrants bring their concerns to local leaders who were all white, Okafor realized that they needed representation. \"And, you know, who better to do that?\" Okafor says. \"I'm like, 'Someone needs to do that.' And at some point, I'm like, 'Why not me?' \" Okafor entered the race for City Council. And last month she won handily, becoming the first immigrant and first person of color elected in Bangor's history. Bangor City Council Chair Clare Davitt says that Okafor will bring a needed perspective to city leadership. \"To have her knowledge of law, and as a small-business owner, that representation matters so much, especially as we are losing workforce and trying to rebuild that,\" Davitt says. \"What else can I do?\" Okafor is one of dozens of women of color nationwide who have jumped into politics in recent years. Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a visiting practitioner at Rutgers University who co-founded Higher Heights, a national nonprofit to elect black women to office, says her organization identified about 90 black women running for federal and statewide executive office in the 2018 election cycle. Already, they've identified more than 90 who are running in the 2020 cycle, and with months left to go until the filing deadlines in several states, Peeler-Allen says those numbers could easily keep climbing. Peeler-Allen partially attributes the shift to the national prominence of candidates such as Kamala Harris, as well as dissatisfaction with current leaders, particularly at the federal level. \"So it is really propelling more women to say, 'What else can I do? And how can I engage at a deeper level? And I'm not happy with my current elected leadership. So I think I could do a better job.' And they're throwing their hat in the ring,\" she says. Okafor says she feels grateful for the newfound prominence in her city after years of overcoming barriers. \"For me, I grew up struggling. I struggled a lot growing up,\" she says. \"So right now I feel privileged. I'm very religious. I feel blessed.\" And while Okafor is still learning the ins and outs of her new role on the Bangor City Council, she wants to focus on improving public transportation, which she says has long affected families and small businesses. Now, Okafor says, she's in a position where she can make a difference.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are expanding their investigations of President Trump, while trying to walk a fine line politically. The president is lashing out against their efforts, saying it's all a \"hoax.\"  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: We're going to bring in now NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. She's at the White House where the president responded to the expanding House investigations today. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So first a little reaction to what you heard from Congressman Raskin. LIASSON: I think what you heard from Congressman Raskin and other Democrats is they want to very methodically investigate the president. They would like to lay out a damning case with lots of evidence but not hurdle all the way to impeachment, which could cause a backlash. Up until now, Democrats have been saying, we have to investigate the president; we have to wait for the Mueller report. I wouldn't be surprised if pretty soon they'll say it's too close to an election to talk about impeachment; we need to let the voters decide. I think what they're trying to do is avoid all of the perils of looking like you're doing a partisan investigation but lay out a case against the president with lots and lots of evidence. CORNISH: Now, when the president was asked today if he would cooperate with the expanding congressional investigations, here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I cooperate all the time with everybody. And you know the beautiful thing? No collusion - it's all a hoax. CORNISH: Should we expect this White House to cooperate? LIASSON: In the past, the president has said he'd cooperate with Bob Mueller, for instance, and then fought tooth and nail to turn over certain things to him. So I wouldn't be surprised if the White House does claim executive privilege for some of these requests. The other thing that's working against the White House is that Donald Trump ordered his own Justice Department to turn over documents and information to Republican investigators about the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails, about the spurious allegations he made that somehow Obama had wiretapped him. So he now is setting a precedent for his own Justice Department to turn things over to Democrats. But the other thing is despite what the president just said, these investigations are not just about collusion - possible collusion with the Russians. They're about possible financial crimes, obstruction of justice, violations of the Emoluments Clause. The facts on the ground have changed. And now you have Democrats with subpoenas. The president does not like being investigated. As a matter of fact, he tweeted, I am an innocent man being persecuted. And he also tweeted that somehow the Cohen hearings had something to do with the failure of the summit with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. So this is clearly on his mind 24 hours a day. CORNISH: Now, to follow up on that, last week, we saw House Republicans use the Michael Cohen hearing to cast doubt on Cohen and also to try and undermine what Democrats are interested in investigating. What can they do to defend the president in this process? What should we expect? LIASSON: Well, we haven't seen them really defend the president. They're mostly attacking his critics the way they went after Michael Cohen. And right now, the shoe is on the other foot. Remember; the Republicans investigated Benghazi for about five years, and they didn't consider that excessive. As a matter of fact, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, even admitted at one point that the great success of the Benghazi investigations was that it drove Hillary Clinton's poll numbers down. So we're seeing another chapter in our ongoing civics lesson. This is what it means to have two coequal branches of government. The president has a lot of powers to do what he wants, but, as Jamie Raskin just said, the Democrats have a constitutional responsibility to do oversight. And in divided government, that's what you get. They have subpoenas, and they can get information now. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson at the White House. Mara, thank you. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Federal judge rules an ex-White House counsel must testify in the impeachment probe. Also, the view from Moscow on that inquiry. And, Colombia is entering its sixth day of planned protests.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Faced with congressional subpoenas, the White House cannot just say no. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: That's the ruling of a federal judge. Congress wants to question the former White House counsel Don McGahn. President Trump's administration refused. This pitted Congress against the administration, which is to say, one branch of government pitted against another. So they asked the third branch, the courts, to referee. And Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson called the foul on the administration. Her order includes the line, no one is above the law. Her judgment has implications for other current and former White House officials. INSKEEP: NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is covering this story. Ryan, good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Why did the judge reject the White House claim of executive privilege, a claim to some privacy for the president and people around him? LUCAS: So Judge Jackson rejected the White House's claim that senior advisers to the president are absolutely immune from testifying before Congress. She says that as a matter of law, presidential aides must appear before lawmakers if compelled to do so. She says advisers to the president can't just blow off a congressional subpoena on the basis of absolute immunity even if the president demands that they do so. Put simply, she says - and this is a quote from the ruling. Quote, \"the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.\" INSKEEP: (Laughter) I'm sorry. That's pretty strong for a court ruling. Go on. LUCAS: It is strong language. And this ruling obviously is good news for Congress. But there is a bit of nuance here. The judge says that, yes, McGahn must appear. But Judge Jackson does not say that McGahn has to answer every question that the committee asks. In other words, the judge isn't saying that McGahn has to speak about matters covered by executive privilege. INSKEEP: Oh, this is interesting. So there is a doctrine called executive privilege. The courts may well recognize it in certain cases. The thing that the judge rejects is the idea that the White House can just say no to everything. That's... LUCAS: Exactly. Right. INSKEEP: OK. So what is it exactly that Congress - House Democrats, we should emphasize... LUCAS: Right INSKEEP: ...They're the people in control of the House here. What do they want to know from Don McGahn? LUCAS: So, remember, McGahn was White House counsel until about a year ago. So he was in Trump's inner circle during most of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. And he was a key witness for Mueller. McGahn provided investigators with his own firsthand knowledge about potential acts of obstruction by the president. So lawmakers really, really wanted to hear from McGahn. They subpoenaed him in the spring for testimony. The White House then blocked McGahn from appearing, citing this legal opinion about absolute immunity for top presidential adviser. INSKEEP: Well, could this court ruling in some way affect the impeachment proceedings that focus on Ukraine even though Don McGahn is not known to be part of that story? LUCAS: Right. The administration has blocked other senior administration officials from testifying in the Ukraine matter. That includes acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman. Those two were both subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry; both refused to appear. In theory, yes, this ruling could provide political cover for individuals like those two who want to come forward and testify. But there's no indication at this point that Mulvaney or Kupperman or former National Security Adviser John Bolton, for that matter, really do want to come forward and testify. The House wants Kupperman, for example, to abide by this ruling, has said so in court filings. But Kupperman's lawyer has said that his situation is different because it deals with national security. And therefore, he's not going to follow the McGahn ruling. INSKEEP: OK. So for now, what we have is a ruling on Don McGahn. Is it possible the public could hear soon whatever he has to say? LUCAS: Don't hold your breath, Steve. INSKEEP: OK. LUCAS: The Justice Department plans to appeal this. That will send this case to the D.C. Circuit. Any decision there's likely to be appealed as well. The stakes are high here. This is a separation powers question, as we said earlier. And while the Judiciary Committee has said that it wants to hear from McGahn, the House intelligence committee is leading the impeachment inquiry. It's going to start drawing up its report. So there is a constricted timeframe for all this to happen. INSKEEP: Yet another news story that's compelling on its face and also a kind of civics lesson. Ryan, thanks so much. LUCAS: My pleasure. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ryan Lucas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Now, how did the House impeachment hearings play in Moscow? MARTIN: It's a relevant question, here's why - President Trump faces scrutiny for his involvement in Ukraine, which is a country at war with Russia. Several impeachment witnesses made references to Russia in their testimony. The most notable was Fiona Hill, a former White House specialist on Eastern Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FIONA HILL: Right now, Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests. MARTIN: Among those falsehoods, she said, inflating Ukraine's role in the 2016 election in a way that obscures Russia's interference. INSKEEP: NPR's Lucian Kim is on the line from Moscow. Hey there, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: First, could you settle a question for us? Because there's been some debate here in the U.S. Fiona Hill testified that when President Trump's defenders play up Ukraine's role in the 2016 election, they're promoting a Kremlin narrative. Is that a Kremlin narrative? KIM: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, just recently, President Vladimir Putin said publicly that he was grateful the U.S. is no longer blaming Russia for election interference and looking instead at what Ukraine did. Basically, anything that deflects from what happened in 2016 is positive for the Kremlin. And even more than that, anything that puts Ukraine in a negative light is even better from the Kremlin's point of view. INSKEEP: Oh, because the Kremlin is leaning on Ukraine and is at war with Ukraine. How did the Kremlin respond, more broadly, to these impeachment hearings? KIM: Well, actually, the Kremlin has largely declined to make any official comments on the hearings themselves. It seems they're mostly sitting back and watching chaos and division in the United States. Fiona Hill warned about repeating Russian narratives. And what's interesting is you do hear them all the time on Russian state TV. State television refers to the impeachment hearings as a big political show and recently said everybody is too busy attacking President Trump to ask what the Bidens did in Ukraine. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. Going - actually picking up one of President Trump's narratives there. Well, what do Russian officials saying about the upcoming 2020 election, which is also part of the focus of this impeachment inquiry, of course? KIM: Sure. Well, first of all, the Kremlin has always denied it ever interfered in the 2016 election and says of course it doesn't plan to interfere in 2020. Recently, it seems, though, that Russian leaders have been trolling the U.S. a bit. President Putin has publicly joked about meddling in 2020 and so has his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Here he is speaking at a conference in Paris earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The presidential elections are coming up in 2020, so how is Russia getting ready for that? SERGEY LAVROV: We will resolve the problem. Don't worry. KIM: So as you can hear, not a lot of people thought his joke was that funny. INSKEEP: The U.S. did strike back at Russia in various ways for interfering in 2016. Does Moscow seem at all deterred? KIM: Exactly. The U.S. struck back with sanctions. But I wouldn't say Moscow is deterred. There's actually been a huge development here in Europe. During the impeachment hearings, president - French President Emmanuel Macron has been reaching out to Russia. He will be hosting a summit between Presidents Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Putin in a couple of weeks. And now Ukraine is going into that meeting without the American support it had been expecting. INSKEEP: Oh, a summit between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. Lucian, thanks so much. KIM: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Lucian Kim. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The latest of many countries facing public protests is Colombia. And its leaders say that today they will meet the people who've been marching since last week. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED DEMONSTRATORS: (Chanting in non-English language). MARTIN: That's the sound of demonstrators who are targeting the right-wing government of President Ivan Duque. Demonstrations have been mostly peaceful - mostly but not entirely. Last night, protests in the capital, Bogota, claimed the life of a student. A tear gas canister struck the 18-year-old. INSKEEP: Reporter John Otis joins us from Bogota. Hey there, John. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Hey. Good to be here, Steve. INSKEEP: I thought Colombia was the country that was prosperous and getting more peaceful and moving in the right direction even as others go in the wrong direction. Why are people protesting? OTIS: Well, you're right. You know, Colombia is doing better than a lot of other countries, at least economically. But there is high unemployment here, which is running at about 10%. Protesters are also concerned about labor reforms that would cut pensions and the minimum wage for young workers. There's been rising violence in the countryside, where hundreds of human rights workers have been killed. And people also think that President Duque just hasn't done very much to implement a 2016 peace treaty that ended a long guerrilla war here. Now, a lot of these protesters, rather than being opposition politicians or labor leaders or longtime activists, they're young people. They're first-time protesters who think President Duque has just lost touch with the country, I spoke with one of them, Alejandro Giraldo (ph). He's a 28-year-old lawyer. And this is what he said. ALEJANDRO GIRALDO: There is a change right now. And all the young people is gathering around some places. And they are connecting with each other to take this country to a better level or to a better quality of life. INSKEEP: You know, John, when I'm listening to that recording, I'm listening to the words but also the backdrop - the musical instruments or percussion instruments going on there. What's it like when you're out there in the streets with people? OTIS: Oh, what you're hearing, that's called a Cacerolazos - that's sort of a Latin American tradition of banging pots and pans during protests. They've also been singing the national anthem. And people are really enthusiastic. There's sort of a celebratory mood in some ways. But at the same time, there have been some outbreaks of looting and vandalism. And that's led to a police crackdown. And as you mentioned, this 18-year-old student named Dilan Cruz, he was peacefully protesting Saturday when he was hit in the face with a tear gas canister. He died last night. And this is sort of the disproportionate use of force that can actually lead to bigger and longer protests. INSKEEP: Well, now the government is getting involved - or at least saying it's willing to meet with the protesters. What can the government offer the people who are in the streets? OTIS: Well, you know, that's part of the problem, the whole government's response to this thing. They've been kind of late. They sort of dismissed the protests at first. They suggested - some government officials suggested that it was part of a left-wing conspiracy. But now, President Ivan Duque is calling for the protesters to meet with him. They're going to start to direct meetings for what he calls a national conversation. And those meetings are scheduled to start today. So we're going to see some dialogue between the two sides at last after six days of protests. INSKEEP: OK. We'll find out what they do have to talk about. John, thanks so much. OTIS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's reporter John Otis in Bogota, Colombia. (SOUNDBITE OF ERIC LAU'S \"STAR TREKKING\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Joseph Maguire, the acting director of National Intelligence, testifies about his handling of a whistleblower's complaint at the center of an of an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.  NOEL KING, HOST: The acting director of national intelligence is in the middle of testimony this morning about his handling of a whistleblower's complaint. Now, that complaint is at the center of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Tim Mak, NPR's congressional correspondent, is watching all of this unfold. He's on the line now. Hey, Tim. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Hey there. KING: OK. So this whistleblower complaint, made public this morning, what does it tell us that we didn't know seven or eight hours ago? MAK: So the complaint centers around a July phone call made by President Trump to the president of Ukraine. We knew a little bit about that because a memo kind of laying out what happened in that call had been previously released. But we kind of get what the whistleblower felt was so problematic about that call. During the call, the president asked the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation into his perspective 2020 election opponent, Joe Biden, and Joe Biden's son. The whistleblower also goes on to say that White House officials - there were some White House officials that were deeply disturbed by the Ukraine phone call because they had, quote, \"witnessed the president abuse his power for personal gain.\" That is - sorry - \"abuse his office for personal gain.\" After the call, the whistleblower said that White House officials had then gone out of their way to quote-unquote, \"lock down\" all records of the phone call and then put that transcript into a system used to handle especially sensitive classified information, and that this was not even the first time in this administration that a presidential transcript had been placed on this secret system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive information. KING: OK. So needless to say, there is a lot in this complaint that will be of interest in the coming days and weeks. The complaint was originally withheld by the director of national intelligence. He didn't turn it over to Congress. When Maguire was asked why, what did he say? MAK: So a lot of the questioning today surrounds this question. The law requires that whistleblower complaints shall - shall be transmitted to Congress if they fit the statutory definition of urgent concern. And the intelligence community inspector general did feel like it met that definition. Maguire is kind of defending himself. He's saying that the complaint involved items relating to the president's executive - the president and the White House's executive privilege, and he can't just waive that privilege. So he consulted with the Justice Department and the White House Office of Legal Counsel, and that is the process, he claims, that led to a delay in providing that complaint to Congress. Democrats have said and countered that there isn't an exception in the law for that scenario and that Maguire was obligated to turn over that complaint. Maguire also told the committee this morning that he does not know who the whistleblower is but has no reason to question his or her credibility. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSEPH MAGUIRE: I want to stress that I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law. KING: OK. Let me ask you about Republicans on this committee. How have they focused their questions to Maguire? Is there something that they're trying to get at with him? MAK: Well, Devin Nunes, he's the top Republican on the committee, and most of the other Republicans on the panel are focusing again on leaks. They're interested in how the information relating to the whistleblower's complaint made its way out into the press. And they're not as focused on the content of the president's actions or asking questions about what the president may or may not have done. But some Republicans are saying they find fault with the president's actions. Here is what Congressman Mike Turner, a Republican congressman from Ohio, had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE TURNER: Now, I've read the complaint. And I've read the transcript of the conversation with the president and the president of Ukraine. Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the president, this is not OK. It isn't - that conversation is not OK.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates addressed thousands of progressive activists and organizers at the Netroots Nation conference in Philadelphia Saturday.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Nearly 4,000 progressive activists were in Philadelphia this weekend for the annual Netroots Nation Convention. Most of the top 2020 candidates skipped out on the conference, citing scheduling conflicts. NPR's Asma Khalid reports that activists noticed who showed up and who didn't. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Progressive activists feel like this is their moment to take over the Democratic Party. Their ideas around healthcare and the economy are no longer seen as being totally on the fringe. But that's why some say they were a bit confused and even disappointed that more 2020 presidential candidates did not show up to talk to them here at Netroots. Only four candidates came to the annual progressive convention - New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro, governor of Washington state Jay Inslee and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. SABIHA BASRAI: I was most impressed with Elizabeth Warren because she's been so consistent. KHALID: That's Sabiha Basrai from Oakland, Calif. She likes Warren, but there's another candidate she really wishes would have been here. BASRAI: As someone who's been a Bernie supporter in the past, I would've really like to hear from Bernie Sanders in this landscape because the political landscape right now is so different than the landscape that he operated in during the last election cycle. KHALID: Sanders skipped the convention, but he had staff here who defended his decision. Here's his political director Analilia Mejia. ANALILIA MEJIA: Unfortunately, he wasn't able to participate in this particular space, but we've had countless of these conversations with many of the organizations that are present here. KHALID: Both Sanders and Warren have a natural base in the progressive movement, which is why Sanders' absence combined with Warren's presence was so noticeable. It gave the Massachusetts senator a chance to solidify her support in the progressive community at a key moment when her poll numbers have been rising, and she's been bringing in more money. This is the seventh time Warren has come to Netroots, and she's a familiar face. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We love you, Liz. ELIZABETH WARREN: I love you too. KHALID: She walked on stage as folks shouted out, we love you, Liz. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: The progressive agenda is America's agenda, and we need to get out there and fight for it. KHALID: And she got sustained applause for promising to hold federal officials accountable for mistreating immigrants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: On my first day, I will empower a commission in the Department of Justice to investigate crimes committed by the United States against immigrants. KHALID: The trouble for Sanders is not just Warren. It's that his once revolutionary ideas are now mainstream for 2020 candidates. Here's Inslee, Castro and Gillibrand at Netroots. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) JAY INSLEE: We must rebuild the union movement. They ought to be able to be benefiting by their productivity increases not just the millionaire class. JULIAN CASTRO: I believe that housing is a human right - that it's a human right. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: As president, I will guarantee \"Medicare for All.\" I will guarantee a single-payer system. And I know how to get it done. KHALID: One thing that's changed, though, since Sanders ran in 2016 is that the progressive movement has incorporated a stronger push for racial justice. The last time Sanders came to Netroots, he was interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters. Now you have white candidates, like Gillibrand, talking about white privilege. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GILLIBRAND: So if I don't understand that it is my responsibility to lift up the voices of black and brown Americans every day, then I'm not doing my job as a U.S. senator, and I'm not doing my job as a presidential candidate. KHALID: Activists say in the end, they could be happy with almost any of the Democrats running in 2020. But in a sign of how much they adore Warren, after she finished speaking, people started streaming out, even though the event was not over. Asma Khalid, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she and Democrats are moving forward with impeachment against President Trump. \"The president leaves us no choice but to act because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit,\" she said Thursday. We are expected to find out what exactly the articles of impeachment will be against the president next week with a vote potentially before Christmas. But what exactly will the articles of impeachment be? Democrats have given some clues this week. Let's take a look at the bread crumbs they left and the arguments for and against each article: Argument for: For Pelosi, what it boils down to is this: \"The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security, by withholding military aid and crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into his political rival,\" she said in announcing her recommendation that the House go forward with impeachment. Bribery is a word that Pelosi is now using more frequently instead of \"quid pro quo\" \u2014 and for good reason: It's in the Constitution when dealing with impeachment. But what bribery means is vague. It is a crime, and there is a statute, but that didn't come along until decades after the Constitution was written. Professors at a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week argued that bribery, as we know it in current law, is not what the framers had in mind when referring to impeachment. \"If you conclude that he [Trump] asked for the investigation of Vice President Biden and his son for political reasons, that is to aid his re-election, then, yes, you have bribery here,\" argued Stanford Law professor Pamela Karlan during a hearing this week. Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman said the framers of the Constitution believed bribery meant \"when the president, using the power of his office solicits or receives something of personal value from someone affected by his official powers.\" Karlan cited a 1792 definition of bribery from Samuel Johnson's dictionary. She said he defined it as a crime of giving or taking rewards for bad practices. \"So if you think it's a bad practice to deny military appropriations to an ally that have been given to them,\" Karlan said, \"if you think it's bad practice not to hold a meeting to buck up the legitimacy of a government that's on the front line, and you do that in return for the reward of getting help with your reelection, that's Samuel Johnson's definition of bribery.\" Argument against: George Washington University's Jonathan Turley, no stranger to impeachment testimony, was the Republicans' witness and argued that a \"bad practices\" standard would set a bad precedent. He said there were \"proven\" and \"accepted\" crimes committed by both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. (Nixon resigned before he could be impeached and Clinton was impeached but acquitted.) What's more, he took a narrower view of what should constitute bribery. Using an analogy about Louis XIV and a French mistress, he argued bribery was about an exchange of money. \"That wasn't some broad notion of bribery,\" Turley said. \"It was actually quite narrow.\" If the crime of bribery then hasn't been committed and there is no other obvious crime, like say burglary or perjury, then, Turley, argues someone could be impeached, but the evidence has to be clear. \"You have to stick the landing on the quid pro quo,\" Turley said. \"It might be out there. I don't see proof of a quid pro quo.\" (That's despite European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testifying under oath that there was a \"quid pro quo\" at least when it came to the holding up of a White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in exchange for a public announcement of investigations.) Sidebar: There is also a notable argument around solicitation. In other words, is it bribery if Ukraine, in the end, got the money? Republicans argue that makes this whole conversation moot. Democrats and three of the constitutional scholars disagree. \"Soliciting is enough,\" Karlan said, before giving the example of a traffic cop saying he would let a speeder off the hook for $20 but deciding to let him go when the driver didn't have the money. \"The attempt itself is the impeachable act,\" argued Feldman. Argument for: Democrats in Congress have issued multiple subpoenas to Trump administration officials. The administration has directed all the potential witnesses not to testify. Some have defied that direction. Other key witnesses, however, have not testified, namely acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was dubbed one of the \"three amigos\" pushing for Ukraine to open investigations into the 2016 election and into Joe and Hunter Biden; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; former national security adviser John Bolton; Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, who multiple witnesses said was running this channel that was going around State Department officials and National Security Council staff; and White House lawyers. The administration has also withheld reams of documents that Democrats say have thwarted their investigatory capabilities. \"Each of the branches has to be able to do its job,\" Feldman said. University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt noted, \"These subpoenas have the force of law.\" He said what Trump has done is worse than what Nixon did, because Nixon produced far more documents and far more witnesses were allowed to testify except \"in a small but significant set of materials.\" Argument against: Turley said the withholding of witnesses and documents is not obstruction because Trump has challenged those subpoenas in court for executive privilege reasons. Therefore, Turley argues, Congress should wait until the courts weigh in before accusing the president of obstruction. \"President Trump has gone to the courts,\" Turley said. \"He's allowed to do that. We have three branches, not two.\" He added, \"In Nixon, it did go to the courts, and Nixon lost. And that was the reason Nixon resigned. He resigned a few days after the Supreme Court ruled against him in that critical case.\" He continued: \"I can't emphasize this enough and I'll say it just one more time: If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power.\" Argument for: Interestingly, this potential charge seemed to hinge on special counsel Robert  Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Norm Eisen, a former Obama White House ethics lawyer, who handled much of the questioning for Democrats during the session with the law professors, focused particularly on five instances noted in the Mueller probe: \"Taken either individually or collectively, these instances are strong evidence of criminal obstruction of justice,\" Gerhardt said. Interestingly, the potential witness intimidation toward former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was not mentioned. That had been floated by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff when Trump tweeted about her while she was testifying before his committee. Argument against: Not all Democrats are sold on bringing the Russia investigation into this mix, given they didn't pursue impeachment immediately after that report was presented. That is a fissure to keep an eye on as the articles of impeachment are drafted. Of course, the members of Congress don't have to vote for all of the articles of impeachment. In 1974, when the Judiciary Committee voted on the impeachment articles for Nixon, two Democrats, Walter Flowers of Alabama and James Mann of South Carolina, voted against Article III, which happened to be obstruction of Congress. As for Republicans, there was just one who voted for all three articles of impeachment, Rep. Lawrence J. Hogan, father of none other than Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland \u2014 and no fan of President Trump.",

Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee. With Democrats in the House of Representatives formally moving to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump, the top Republican on the committee that will author those articles is saying the White House should participate in the impeachment inquiry. But participation should happen only, he says, \"when there is an actual opportunity in which it is a situation in which they can present, do the presentation that they need to.\" In a forceful critique of the impeachment inquiry, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, accused Democrats of making White House participation all but impossible by not allowing for \"a robust set of hearings.\" \"At the end of the day, if people don't believe what you're doing is fair, then it doesn't matter,\" Collins said in an interview Thursday with All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly. Speaking from his office on Capitol Hill, Collins said Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are not being given the opportunity to question the fact witnesses who have testified before the House Intelligence Committee since the start of the impeachment inquiry in September. Republican members of the Intelligence Committee were present for those testimonies and were allowed to question the witnesses. The White House has blocked key witnesses from testifying in the inquiry and declined to participate in this week's Judiciary Committee hearing but has left open the possibility of participating in future proceedings. Collins argued that Democrats are presuming guilt and creating a scenario for the president where \"you have to prove your innocence ... and that's just not the way our system works.\" Collins' remarks followed the announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., earlier Thursday that Democrats will begin the process of drafting articles of impeachment. Addressing reporters against a backdrop of American flags, Pelosi said the president had \"abused his power for his own personal political benefit\" by seeking to pressure a foreign nation into conducting politically motivated investigations to aid his reelection. \"His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice but to act because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit.\" Collins said the announcement was \"only breaking news if you've been in hibernation for the last year,\" adding, \"They've been wanting to do this.\" The Democratic case against Trump was detailed in a scathing 300-page report released by the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. In the report, Democrats allege that the president sought to coerce Ukraine into opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden by withholding $391 million in U.S. assistance for Ukraine, as well as a White House meeting long coveted by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The report's release was followed on Wednesday by the start of formal impeachment proceedings in the Judiciary Committee. Wednesday's hearing featured testimony from four constitutional scholars who were called to answer whether the president, in his dealings with Ukraine, engaged in \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the threshold for impeachment as spelled out in the Constitution. From his perch as the Judiciary Committee's top Republican, Collins has emerged as one of  Trump's chief defenders in the battle for public opinion. In his interview with NPR, the former attorney and military chaplain said he did not believe the president has done anything wrong and said he had no issue with the way Trump has conducted himself in regards to Ukraine. \"He did nothing wrong. The call did not show anything wrong,\" he said, referring to the White House's account of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy that helped spark the inquiry. \"At the end of the day, it's not about holding anything accountable,\" Collins said of the impeachment inquiry. \"It's about next year's election for them, to make sure that he is damaged going into an election cycle.\" Collins also pushed back against the charge among Democrats \u2014 and a potential article of impeachment \u2014 that the White House has obstructed the work of Congress through its decision, detailed in an Oct. 8 letter by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Democrats say that since that order, the administration has failed to produce a single document in response to 71 specific demands for information. They also say that at the president's direction, 12 current or former administration officials have refused to testify in the inquiry, including 10 officials who refused to in defiance of subpoenas. Collins said the remedy is not to rush forward with impeachment but to allow the process to play out in the courts. \"There is a precedent for the president himself, not just for himself, but for the presidency, to make sure that there are certain constitutional bounds that they're claiming and privileges that they're claiming,\" said Collins. Democrats, however, have said they are not willing to allow the White House to run out the clock on impeachment through a court fight, and they say the evidence they have already collected is enough to impeach the president. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold its second hearing in the impeachment inquiry on Monday, when counsel for Democrats and Republicans on the Intelligence Committee will discuss the evidence against the president. In a letter on Thursday to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Collins said Republicans on the committee should be allowed a hearing day before articles of impeachment can move forward. Meanwhile, the White House faces a Friday deadline to inform the committee on whether it will participate in future proceedings. A vote by the full House on whichever impeachment articles are adopted by the Judiciary Committee could come by the end of the month. The process would then move to the Senate, where 20 Republicans would need to break ranks and join Democrats to reach the 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, required to convict and remove the president from office. Given those numbers, Collins said there is nothing to indicate impeachment can pass the Senate. \"Many of us believe it's already been decided,\" he said. \"Why waste our time?\"",

Above, McGahn arrives for an event at the Justice Department in May. Updated at 9:33 a.m. ET Tuesday A federal judge in Washington has ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify to House impeachment investigators, despite orders from the Trump administration that he not cooperate with Congress. The decision by U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson clears the way for McGahn's testimony, sought by House Democrats in exploring Trump's possible obstruction of justice related to the Russia probe. Jackson declared in her 118-page ruling that \"presidents are not kings\" and that \"no one is above the law.\" She added: \"However busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.\" A lawyer for McGahn says that his client will obey the court's ruling to testify. \"Don McGahn will comply with Judge Jackson's decision unless it is stayed pending appeal,\" McGahn's attorney William Burck tells NPR in an email. The Trump administration expressed frustration with the order, saying it \"contradicts longstanding legal precedent established by administrations of both parties,\" according to a statement from White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. But Jackson said there is no legal basis of the so-called \"legal precedent\" the White House has been citing that presidential aides are immune from subpoenas. \"Absolute testimonial immunity for senior-level White House aides appears to be a fiction that has been fastidiously maintained over time through the force of sheer repetition,\" the judge wrote. The ruling could have implications for other key witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, who has refused to testify until a federal court weighs in on the conflict between Congress and the White House. On Tuesday, the Trump administration filed its notice of appeal and asked the court to pause the McGahn order until the appeal is decided. Democrats subpoenaed McGahn on May 21, months before the start of the impeachment inquiry. But he is now considered by impeachment investigators to be a central witness to possible instances of obstruction of justice. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., celebrated Jackson's decision. \"Now that the court has ruled, I expect him to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee,\" Nadler said in a statement. White House lawyers have said McGahn is among a small cadre of current and former senior administration officials who cannot be forced to testify about matters related to the president since doing so risks revealing information that is protected under executive privilege. At a hearing last month, a Justice Department attorney said McGahn and other former top White House aides are shielded by \"absolute immunity.\" Yet Jackson was deeply skeptical about this argument, citing the challenge of enforcing it in light of the high rate of turnover among Oval Office aides. She suggested at the hearing that the legislature would be impeded in carrying out its basic oversight power if lawmakers could not call witnesses as part of an investigation into the president. She called the Trump administration's position that top aides are immune from testifying before Congress \"peculiar.\" In her ruling on Monday, Jackson said Office of Legal Counsel opinion from the White House, which Trump administration lawyers cited in defense of its \"absolute immunity\" argument, are not legally binding. \"Thus\u2014to be crystal clear\u2014what is at issue in this case is solely whether senior level presidential aides, such as McGahn, are legally required to respond to a subpoena that a committee of Congress has issued, by appearing before the committee for testimony despite any presidential directive prohibiting such a response,\" Jackson wrote. \"McGahn 'must appear before the Committee to provide testimony, and invoke executive privilege where appropriate.' \" McGahn was seen as the star witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. He told Mueller's investigators that Trump had ordered him to fire Mueller. McGahn told investigators that a day after the revelation broke in the press, Trump asked him to write a letter denying that the president had wanted Mueller fired. \"Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President's effort to have the Special Counsel removed,\" according to Mueller's findings. McGahn said he would rather quit than fire Mueller. McGahn stepped down as White House counsel in October 2018. As court battles wage on over witnesses, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., says lawmakers are now writing a report that summarizes key findings about Trump's alleged pressure campaign on Ukraine. In a letter on Monday to House lawmakers, Schiff said the witnesses over the past six weeks have presented \"overwhelming, unchallenged, and damning\" evidence that Trump abused his office by using military assistance approved by Congress to push Ukrainian authorities to open up politically beneficial investigations. \"Over the course of our inquiry, we have uncovered a months-long effort in which President Trump again sought foreign interference in our elections for his personal and political benefit at the expense of our national interest,\" Schiff wrote. Schiff said he expects to deliver the report to the House Judiciary Committee shortly after Congress returns from Thanksgiving break. From there, the Judiciary Committee can draft articles of impeachment. Schiff said investigators are still open to additional hearings and witness questioning but said lawmakers would not allow what he called the White House's stonewalling of witnesses to slow down the process. Investigators hoped to hear from acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Bolton, but because the White House prevented them from appearing, House investigators will now consider the Trump administration's blocking of the witnesses a type of obstruction that \"demonstrates consciousness of guilt on the part of the President,\" Schiff said. Earlier on Monday, Trump tweeted, \"Support for Impeachment is dropping like a rock.\" The president has repeatedly slammed the impeachment inquiry as a \"phony\" and \"sham\" process that lacks evidence and is politically motivated.

            "article_content": "President Trump is on the defensive after congressional investigators released thousands of pages of transcripts of closed-door depositions as part of the Ukraine affair and impeachment inquiry.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump is on the defensive after congressional investigators released thousands of pages of transcripts of closed-door depositions as part of the Ukraine affair and impeachment inquiry. There was lots more detail in the transcripts released by congressional investigators this week that help color in the picture of what went down in the pressure campaign from the Trump administration to Ukraine. Some had been known already, based on reporting and previously released opening statements. But far more depth was given after seeing the questions and answers from what were hours-long depositions. And a lot of it will be aired publicly, beginning Wednesday with the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. What follows are eight things we've learned from reading every page from the deposition transcripts so you didn't have to: 1. All roads lead back to Rudy Giuliani In thousands of pages of testimony, the role of President Trump's personal attorney has become very clear. Democratic investigators wanted to know more about Giuliani's role, and every witness has pointed back at Giuliani as orchestrating the pressure campaign. Giuliani has said he won't cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, citing attorney-client privilege. Democrats would love to talk to him, but they don't want to be dragged into court. Instead, his lack of cooperation, and that of others, will likely be added to an obstruction of Congress article of impeachment. Remember, though, the Southern District of New York, an office Giuliani used to run as U.S. attorney, has already ensnared two Giuliani associates who were trying to leave the country. Does another shoe drop with Giuliani? Fiona Hill, a Russia specialist who was working on the National Security Council, said she questioned the legality of what Giuliani was doing. \"I was extremely concerned that whatever it was that Mr. Giuliani was doing might not be legal,\" she said. She also noted she faced \"death threats, calls at my home.\" Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor detailed how Giuliani was working in Trump's interest \u2014 not necessarily the country's \u2014 and said that Giuliani was trying to cast former Vice President Joe Biden \"in a bad light\" to benefit Trump's reelection campaign. \"He was representing whose interests?\" Taylor was asked, before replying with just two words: \"President Trump.\" 2. The whistleblower complaint has (mostly) been corroborated Even though Republicans want to hear from the whistleblower, much of what the whistleblower detailed has now been corroborated under oath by multiple witnesses. That includes Giuliani's role in the pressure campaign, the details for the recall of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, the withholding of military aid and the moving of the now-infamous July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine's president to a secure computer. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, testified that this use of a secure computer was a break from normal process. The only piece of it we haven't heard anything about is the allegation in the whistleblower report that \"Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\" The president mentioned Barr in his July 25 call, but that seems to be the extent of it, so far. Barr certainly has been involved in traveling abroad as part of the investigation into the origins of the Russian interference investigation, but that hasn't bled over to Ukraine \u2014 so far. 3. The three people testifying publicly next week were picked for good reason There was probably no more damning testimony than the accounts delivered by Taylor, Yovanovitch and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. We also got one of the most consequential released testimonies of the week from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a major Trump donor. Kent described Sondland and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker as two of the \"three amigos\" brought in to be more reliable players in pursuing the pressure campaign that Trump and Giuliani were pursuing. The other amigo was Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who has declined to be interviewed by congressional investigators. Taylor and Kent are scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Yovanovitch is scheduled to appear Friday. 4. There was acknowledgement of a quid pro quo Facing the potential threat of perjury after multiple witnesses contradicted his testimony, Sondland amended his testimony. He admitted that he told an aide to Ukraine's president that nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid likely wasn't coming unless Ukraine put out a statement from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy committing to investigating Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. \"I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland said in the amendment. 5. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's role has become clearer When it came to the withholding of \"all security assistance to the Ukraine,\" Kent pointed the finger at Mick Mulvaney, who he said was acting at President Trump's direction. In her testimony, Hill noted that at a July 10 meeting, Ukrainians wanted assurances of a White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy. Then-national security adviser John Bolton \u2014 who told Hill that Giuliani \"is a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up\" and that he didn't want any part of this \"drug deal\" \u2014 tried to remain noncommittal. At that point, according to Hill, \"Sondland blurted out: 'Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff [Mulvaney] for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start.' \" 6. Witnesses detailed a concerted effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens Volker noted that Giuliani, who was seen as speaking for the president, insisted on the public statement from Zelenskiy. Giuliani and company were even vetting the language the Ukrainian president would use. The Ukrainians, not wanting to get involved in U.S. domestic politics, did not want to mention Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company Hunter Biden formerly served on the board of. When Giuliani saw a version of the statement that didn't include Burisma, he dismissed it. \"Well, if it doesn't say Burisma, and if it doesn't say 2016, what does it mean?\" Giuliani said, according to Volker. \"You know, it's not credible.\" Sondland, who was once allied with Giuliani in the pressure campaign, turned on him while testifying. He noted that Giuliani's efforts \"kept getting more insidious as timeline went on.\" Yovanovitch testified of the attempts to hurt Biden. There was an effort aimed at \"finding things that could be possibly damaging to a Presidential run,\" she said. Asked if she meant a presidential run by Joe Biden, she answered: \"Uh-huh.\" 7. A sitting U.S. ambassador was told to watch her back \u2014 and was given the heads-up by Ukrainians Yovanovitch testified that she was alerted by Ukrainian officials to a concerted effort to oust her. The official told her she needed to \"watch my back,\" because it was known that the two Giuliani associates who were arrested in October wanted her out. She said she believes they wanted her gone because of possible corrupt business dealings. \"[I]f legitimate business comes to us,\" Yovanovitch said, \"you know, that's what we do \u2014 we promote U.S. business.\" Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a career foreign service officer, said Yovanovitch's treatment raised alarm bells. He noted that it \"had a very significant effect on morale\" at the State Department and described \"bullying tactics.\" Kent said Giuliani was running a \"campaign of slander\" against Yovanovitch. 8. People voiced their disapproval, but were ignored It's still stunning that multiple U.S. government Ukraine experts said they believed a former Ukrainian prosecutor was making up allegations for his own benefit in order to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration \u2014 and that Trump and Giuliani, instead of believing their own government's experts, believed the prosecutor. That prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, was widely believed to be corrupt, as Yovanovitch explained. Those experts spoke up. Taylor, who was ambassador to Ukraine appointed by Republican George W. Bush, told Sondland it was \"crazy\" to withhold funding to benefit a political campaign. Vindman said he raised concerns about Trump's request to Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens and told White House counsel John Eisenberg about it. Kent detailed his own disagreement with the pressure campaign and likened it to what other corrupt countries do. \"Politically related prosecutions are not the way of promoting the rule of law,\" Kent said. \"They undermine the rule of law.\"",

The White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team in the spring and replaced it with \"three amigos\" considered more reliable for the plan to pressure Kyiv, a senior U.S. diplomat was described as telling House investigators on Tuesday. That's according to the account Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., gave to reporters about the closed-door deposition by George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's European and Eurasian Bureau. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized the May 23 meeting at which the personnel moves were decided, according to Connolly's description. That conference yielded the crew described as the new \"three amigos\" assigned the Ukraine portfolio: Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union; Kurt Volker, then an envoy to Ukraine for its peace negotiations; and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. In other words, Mulvaney removed career specialists who the White House believed wouldn't go along with a plan to lean on Ukraine's leaders in an attempt to get them to launch investigations that might help Trump in the 2020 election, according to this account of Kent's testimony. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the account on Tuesday evening. Connolly, who described the deposition, called Kent's account of events \"very powerful\" and \"deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani\" \u2014 the personal attorney for Trump who drove much of the Ukraine plan on his own as well as in concert with the State Department. Members of Congress already have heard from Volker; Sondland is expected to appear behind closed doors on Thursday. Perry has been subpoenaed in the House inquiry. Other directions for investigators Connolly said Kent's remarks also made him want to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton, whom other witnesses also are said to have described to investigators as concerned about Trump's Ukraine pressure plan and the role Giuliani played in it. It isn't clear whether investigators might call Bolton to appear; Connolly said that will be up to the chairmen of the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry: Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight. One of those chairmen, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the Intelligence Committee, suggested elsewhere in the Capitol on Tuesday that his next priority might be to try to obtain documents about the Ukraine pressure plan, which he said exists somewhere within officialdom. \"There is a paper record of efforts to condition this meeting ... and perhaps condition military support itself,\" Schiff said. More broadly, the chairman said, Democrats intend to keep up a \"furious pace\" of depositions and that there will be \"a busy few days and weeks ahead.\" No vote for now What Democrats do not intend to do, for now, is convene a vote by the full chamber on whether to authorize their impeachment inquiry, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. President Trump and Republicans have faulted the inquiry as illegitimate because it hasn't been put before all of the members in the chamber. That's one reason the White House has said it won't cooperate with requests for witnesses or documents \u2014 although it isn't clear whether the administration would change its tune if there were a vote. Pelosi was asked at her news conference on Tuesday why, if she believed the inquiry was right and she was on solid political ground, she wouldn't \"call the president's bluff\" and convene a vote. Congress isn't in the business of calling bluffs, Pelosi said \u2014 \"this is not a game for us.\" The Constitution gives the House broad discretion about conducting impeachment, putting the speaker and her lieutenants in charge of when it's taking place and what rules will govern the process. Trump and Republicans call what the Democrats are doing a \"fake impeachment\" because it breaks with past practices, including a vote to launch the inquiry \u2014 which took place when President Bill Clinton was impeached \u2014 and some privileges for the minority to issue subpoenas or call witnesses. White House counsel Pat Cipollone argued in a letter rejecting the impeachment inquiry that Trump deserves the ability to confront his accuser, enjoy due process and have a vigorous defense. But impeachment in the House is, effectively, an indictment for which lawmakers are a grand jury. If members vote to impeach, that triggers a trial for Trump in the Senate in which his allies can defend him there.

            "article_content": "Who is responsible for the attack on a Saudi oil facility? President Trump's ex-campaign manager will appear before a House panel. Israelis go to the polls for a second election in less than 6 months.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right. Satellite images are now emerging of the damage caused to the Abqaiq oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. NOEL KING, HOST: Yeah. The images show that the facility was hit by what is thought to be some combination of drones and missiles. What's unclear is who did it. Washington and Riyadh say they suspect Iran. Here's U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: Make no mistake about it, this was a deliberate attack on the global economy and the global energy market. KING: But the Iranian government denies it. GREENE: All right. Let's bring in NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre, who's been following this. Hi there, Greg. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: OK. So at this point, what is the state of the investigation into who carried this out in Saudi Arabia? MYRE: So the Saudis are saying that Iranian weapons were used. But they're not saying who actually fired these weapons or what the location was when they were fired. President Trump says it looks like Iran, but he'd like to avoid war. And that's sort of a bit of a step back from his initial reaction, when he was talking about being locked and loaded for a confrontation. And so I think all this reflects two things. One, there still is an investigation going on to determine the specifics of who fired these weapons and where. And there seems to be a hesitancy to make a big, escalatory rhetoric out of it and indicate that there's going to be some sort of retaliatory strike. GREENE: Well, let's just suppose Iran was responsible here. Is there a reason that they would want to organize an attack like this? Would this makes sense? MYRE: Well, if you look historically, Iran has always been very good at punching back. It doesn't sit there and just take blows. So it often approaches this line of hitting at an adversary, but it doesn't cross the line. But right now, the oil sanctions are really biting. Its economy is really suffering. And Iran seems to be taking the position that it's not going to just sit there and not export its oil. It feels like it has to punch back in some way. And we've seen this sort of series of attacks or these drone attacks on tankers - Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June - and now this. This would represent a real break in the rules of the game. GREENE: Well, and it's an attack that a lot of people are talking about could really affect the oil market. And we're seeing prices go up already. But there is still a lot of oil on the market. The price has been low for years. Is this attack going to fundamentally change energy supplies in the world? MYRE: So far? No. If it's just a one-off attack, the Saudis can recover. I mean, their production has gone down by about half. But there's the expectation that it shouldn't take too long. You may be looking at weeks or perhaps a little longer than that. Nobody knows for sure. But if it's just a one-off attack, it can recover. We've seen oil - Brent crude oil, sort of the international standard - go from about 60 to about $70 a barrel. So that's a hit, but not a huge one. The real risk would be if there's some sort of shipping war in the Gulf, if the tankers - if it would be a concerted attack on tankers in the Gulf. GREENE: And then all eyes now on President Trump, I mean, who, as you said, seems to be backing off some of the tough rhetoric. But how might the administration respond here? MYRE: Well, President Trump has always had two approaches. He talks tough on Iran, but he doesn't want another conflict in the region. So he's going to have to reconcile that. And I think we're going to see Iran also take a tough position. GREENE: All right. We'll be watching. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre. Greg, thanks. MYRE: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. So Congress is back in session, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi seems to be growing a little tired of an issue reporters keep pushing her on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Are you uncomfortable with the term impeachment inquiry? Is there another term we should be using? NANCY PELOSI: I'm not - thank you all very much. Let me see. We are on our path. Where it takes us is where the - we will follow the facts. KING: That fact-finding mission continues today. President Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will appear before the House Judiciary Committee. GREENE: And let's preview that with NPR congressional correspondent Sue Davis, who's here. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: OK. So what exactly do lawmakers want to know from Lewandowski? What are they going to be asking him? DAVIS: So he's the first fact witness from special counsel Mueller's investigation to come before the Judiciary Committee. And the questioning is expected to focus on Lewandowski's role in one of the most damning accounts that was included in the Mueller report about the president's ultimately unsuccessful efforts to curb the Russia investigation. And that was in the summer of 2017, the president met with Lewandowski and dictated a message to him that he wanted to deliver to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, telling him to restrain the Mueller investigation or risk getting fired. Lewandowski did try to meet with Sessions to deliver that message, but the meeting was canceled. He didn't follow through with it. About a month later in that summer, the president again asked him about it. Lewandowski instead shared the directive with a White House aide named Rick Dearborn, asked him to deliver the message. Ultimately, neither Lewandowski nor Dearborn ever delivered any message to Sessions. And the investigation, of course, continued unimpeded. GREENE: All right. But still, as you said, a damning account. And it could be even more damning if Lewandowski is actually detailing it to Congress. But we should say, he's - was a loyalist to President Trump and has remained so, right? DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, there's expectations that it could be a pretty contentious hearing today. I did speak to a spokeswoman for Lewandowski. She told me he's very much looking forward to his appearance before lawmakers. Lewandowski is not Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen, of course, was the former lawyer for President Trump who is now serving in prison who provided damning testimony about the president back in February before the Oversight Committee. Lewandowski's a Trump ally. He is not expected to go before the committee and criticize the president today. He's also considering a run for the Senate in New Hampshire to challenge the incumbent senator, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. The president has all but endorsed him. This is important to understand the context of him appearing before this committee. As a result, Democrats have been strategizing here. They want to maximize the impact. They've been coordinating lines of questioning. It's also the first committee hearing under recently changed rules that will allow staff lawyers to question Lewandowski. Also expect him to have some backup from Republicans on the committee, who have called this hearing a waste of time, saying the committee already knows all of this information. GREENE: Well, it's been - how long now? - five months since the Muller report was... DAVIS: Right. GREENE: ...Released. And this committee is just now turning to its first major witness. Is this just the beginning? Are we going to see more people coming? DAVIS: Well, that's what Democrats would like to see. Lewandowski's unique because he's never worked in the White House. So he was a campaign aide. He is not affected by the terms of executive privilege for White House employees. Should note... GREENE: Oh, important to realize that. Yeah. DAVIS: ...Important distinction. However, the White House is claiming he is bound by some executive privilege. And they're going to send a lawyer for the White House today to advise him at the hearing on that. The Judiciary Committee has filed suit to compel testimony from other witnesses, namely former White House Counsel Don McGahn. How the courts rule in that suit will provide a roadmap for how much information Democrats will ultimately be able to get from White House employees. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Sue Davis for us this morning. Thank you, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. Israelis are heading to the polls today - again. KING: Again. Israel had elections less than six months ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed for this redo after he failed to form a coalition government. Netanyahu is now the longest-serving prime minister that Israel has ever had. But at the moment, he is also politically very weak. GREENE: All right. For more on this, let's turn to NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Bat Yam, just south of Tel Aviv. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what is happening so far? And what are voters telling you today? ESTRIN: Well, I'm right outside a polling place. And it's a lot of people coming in and out voting this morning. And most of the voters we've met here have been upset that they have to go to repeat elections because they didn't change their mind between the last elections in April and today's elections. They're voting for the candidate they elect before... GREENE: So voters are unified around not wanting to vote again (laughter)? ESTRIN: Yes, they are. And - although, they're divided on the question of Bibi or no Bibi. Bibi's Benjamin Netanyahu's nickname. So take a listen to this voter, Yossi (ph). YOSSI: It's a horror. It's really bad. It's - you know, it's like nightmare. ESTRIN: OK. YOSSI: I didn't believe that Bibi Netanyahu take all the country to another election just because he afraid what the police get against him will take him to the jail. So he take all the country as a - kidnapped. ESTRIN: And what he's talking about there is that Netanyahu pushed for these second elections - and he's facing corruption allegations - because he could face a criminal indictment by the end of the year. And if he wins these new elections and forms a right-wing government, his partners could help him with - get immunity from prosecution. Those corruption allegations, however, don't bother Netanyahu's supporters. And listen to one of them, Sandra Ozkur (ph). SANDRA OZKUR: I think just Bibi. There is no one else. Everybody like us all over the world. And everybody has jobs. And I don't think someone else will be good as him. ESTRIN: So she's saying the economy's improved in the last decade since Bibi came to office. And Israel has more and more friends around the world than it had before, friends like Trump and Putin. GREENE: Well, Daniel, remind me - for voters like Yossi who don't like Netanyahu, who is the alternative? Who's running against him? ESTRIN: Benny Gantz is Netanyahu's main contender. He's a former army chief of staff. He's a centrist. And he's presenting himself as the non-Netanyahu. He says he'll be a unifier. Where Netanyahu plays on rifts in Israeli society, like Jews against Arabs and left versus right, Gantz says he'll be a unifier. And he says he wants to change the way that things have been here for the last decade. And he doesn't want any Orthodox Jewish parties in the government. There's been a lot of resentment over Orthodox politicians' power. GREENE: Are people really giving him a chance? I mean, is there a real sense that Netanyahu could actually lose this race? ESTRIN: Too close to say right now because the polls have been really close. Netanyahu seems to have a slight advantage. But it could result in what happened last time, a deadlock, and maybe even third elections. GREENE: Oh, wow. So all the voters who don't want to vote again could actually have to vote yet again if there's another deadlock. That's a possibility here. ESTRIN: It's a possibility that people don't want, but it's a possibility. GREENE: All right. NPR's Daniel Estrin covering the Israeli elections. He is just south of Tel Aviv for us this morning. Daniel, thanks a lot. ESTRIN: You got it. (SOUNDBITE OF PANTHA DU PRINCE'S \"WELT AM DRAHT\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 4:53 p.m. ET President Trump's former campaign manager jousted with House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee Tuesday in a combative hearing that each side hoped might strengthen its narrative about the legacy of the Russia imbroglio. Corey Lewandowski became the rare Trump world insider to meet Democrats in Congress eye to eye \u2014 and he went on offense over the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election. \"Interest in the fake Russia collusion narrative has fallen apart,\" Lewandowski said. \"It's now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda.\" Then-President Barack Obama's national security leaders, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, failed to defend the U.S. in 2016 against the Russian interference, Lewandowski alleged. He also declined to respond to the substance of many questions by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats who asked about the role Lewandowski was described as playing in the Mueller report. That led to calls for Lewandowski to be held in contempt, which Nadler said he would take \"under advisement.\" In other cases, Lewandowski did answer \u2014 within the rules of engagement he said had been set down by the White House counsel's office, which he said forbade him from talking about conversations with Trump. Lewandowski said he's never read Mueller's report, took opportunities to mock or snap back at Democrats \u2014 at one point, he addressed Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who bowed out of a brief 2020 campaign earlier this year, as \"President Swalwell\" \u2014 and acknowledged, in at least one case, that things might have gone differently in 2016. Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., asked Lewandowski why he or others, including a deputy, Sam Clovis, hadn't talked with authorities about the contacts they knew were being made with campaign aides by Russians in 2016. \"In hindsight, it's something Mr. Clovis probably should have done,\" Lewandowski said. He also used his time in the spotlight on Tuesday, which included a few break-ins on cable news, to tease a prospective congressional campaign in New Hampshire. During a break in the hearing, Lewandowski's account on Twitter posted a message soliciting help for his \"potential\" Senate run. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., cited the allusions as a reason not to take Lewandowski's testimony seriously. \"That says an awful lot about the witness' motivation to appear here today and I've heard enough,\" she said. What it's all about For Democrats, the report and its lingering importance have to do with whether Congress impeaches Trump \u2014 ostensibly over the allegations that he obstructed justice in trying to frustrate the Mueller investigation. Nadler sought to make clear before the fact that Congress is pursuing what he says is impeachment in a meaningful way, including in a recent interview with NPR member station WNYC. In today's interview, @RepJerryNadler expressed frustration at the misconception that impeachment proceedings aren't underway. The committee is holding impeachment hearings this week, and investigations are active.  LISTEN: https://t.co/Yc9APnDAFX The Judiciary Committee's minority Republicans, meanwhile, scoff at Democrats' free repetition of \"impeachment,\" which ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., and others call a scam. Nadler is pretending there's an impeachment process underway, Collins says, when in fact the full House hasn't agreed to undertake one \u2014 and the Democrats' own leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opposes it. Collins argues that Democrats are putting on a show to placate their most liberal supporters and create the illusion that impeachment is real. It's a \"faux-impeachment charade,\" he said on Tuesday. \"They don't have the votes,\" Collins said. \"The majority made a promise and they couldn't keep it.\" Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz called the hearing a \"joke\" and complained about how poorly executed a joke it has proved. \"The path the majority has taken us on has rambled from disorganized to just downright dizzying,\" he said. The Republicans despaired about ever moving on from the Mueller era in the House when the majority remains controlled by what Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas., described as \"the party of impeachment.\" \"They're going to find something \u2014 anything \u2014 to keep this impeachment hoax alive,\" he said. For Lewandowski and other supporters of Trump, the Mueller legacy is about a cabal of insiders who conspired to frame Trump for conspiring with Russia's interference and the Democrats who colluded to perpetuate those charges. Mueller's investigation established a number of links between Trump's camp and the Russians in 2016 but not a criminal conspiracy to throw the election. Mueller's office also documented what some outside it have called obstruction by Trump \u2014 but the Justice Department did not seek an indictment in part because of the privilege that Trump enjoys as president protecting him from prosecution. Alleged obstruction In the case of Lewandowski, the report describes him playing a central role in a bid by Trump to constrain the scope of Mueller's inquiry. Trump dictated a speech that he wanted Lewandowski to give to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one in which Sessions would have said he wanted Mueller to confine his investigation to preventing interference in future elections \u2014 not looking into what took place in 2016. Ultimately Lewandowski tasked someone else, then-deputy White House chief of staff Rick Dearborn, with delivering that message to Sessions. Dearborn balked and never conveyed it to the Justice Department. Nadler and Democrats wanted Dearborn and another former White House official, Rob Porter, to appear with Lewandowski on Tuesday, but the Trump administration barred them from taking part. The White House said their testimony was shielded by executive privilege \u2014 the doctrine that permits an administration to shield some of its workings from the public. Lewandowski also said that was the basis for his reticence, even though he never worked for the Trump administration. Lewandowski said he recognized that it wasn't his privilege to invoke but he argued that he had a duty to protect the president's ability to meet and take counsel in confidence. Nadler called that yet another example of what he said was Trump's attempt to obstruct discovery of facts about his administration. \"This is a shocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity,\" Nadler said. \"If he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders.\"",

Pelosi is dealing with rising calls for impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks during a weekly news conference on May 16 on Capitol Hill. Pelosi is dealing with rising calls for impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Updated at 4:19 p.m. ET House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will convene a meeting Wednesday morning to hear from Democrats on whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Pelosi, a public skeptic of impeachment, is confronting a rising tide of support for it among rank-and-file House Democrats and members of her own leadership team. Democrats are outraged by the Trump administration's ongoing effort to stymie congressional oversight into the president, his administration, and the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. \"She's hearing the views of the caucus, and listening to different perspectives and we're having that debate,\" said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is running for president. Moulton supports opening an impeachment inquiry based on the argument being made by a number of Democrats that it gives the House a stronger legal hand in securing documents, testimony and cooperation from the Trump administration. \"I don't think there's any question but there's a growing realization in the caucus that impeachment is inevitable. It's not a question of if but when,\" said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., a member of the leadership's whip team. Yarmuth said the administration's \"blanket resistance\" to their oversight efforts is changing the calculation. \"I think the speaker is right that these investigations need to go on. I don't think they should go on interminably,\" he said, adding that he expected a decision on impeachment to be made by the end of the summer. Yarmuth and other top leaders have characterized those pushing for impeachment as a small but growing minority dissatisfied with Pelosi's focus on traditional committee investigations. The group largely confined their frustrations to closed-door sessions until recently. \"I think what is happening is that the initial aim was to investigate and then see what we had. The problem is we can't get any information. The president is blocking us,\" House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said. \"I think we're in a position where we're moving more and more towards [impeachment] because he's not leaving us with any choices. You don't have any choices.\" Cummings maintained that moving ahead with impeachment could assist their efforts. \"Once you file for impeachment you're under a whole new different set of rules. And you have a much broader opportunity to get things.\" Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the Judiciary Committee and party leadership who supports moving forward with impeachment, said \"the principal reason\" to do so was to send a message to the administration and the public. \"There's no question that opening impeachment conveys to all the relevant parties the seriousness of the inquiry. I think we still have the ability to get all the documents and the witnesses that we need under our traditional oversight responsibilities,\" he said, adding, \"It's important to communicate a very strong message to the administration, and opening a formal inquiry is a good way to communicate that message.\" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., downplayed the internal turmoil, telling reporters Tuesday: \"I disagree with the notion that a growing number of the House Democratic Caucus want to jump straight to impeachment,\" he said. However, he said, Democrats have a \"responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch.\" Trump's latest efforts to block former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, and McGahn's refusal to appear, are the latest affront to Congress prompting Democrats to reconsider their strategy. \"We will hold this president accountable, one way or the other,\" Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said at the hearing. Citing executive privilege, the administration has also blocked congressional demands for an unredacted copy of Mueller's report, which Attorney General William Barr declined to deliver to the Judiciary Committee. Barr was held in contempt by the committee, but a full House vote is not yet scheduled. On another front, the administration is refusing to comply with Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal's request for six years of the president's tax returns, which tax law gives the chairman legal authority to access. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of the first House Democrats to call for Trump's impeachment, said those tactics from the administration are accelerating the impeachment push. \"I think many members are a little bit shocked and surprised that the president would be this blatant in instructing those in the administration and outside the administration not to come and testify,\" Waters said. \"I think what he's trying to do and I think what they think he's trying to do is render us toothless and say we're not that important.\" While Democrats are waging the battle against the administration in the courts \u2014 and the courts have historically favored Congress in these cases \u2014 it can take months or years to reach final legal conclusions, and Democrats believe Trump is using these court fights as a delaying tactic to get past the 2020 elections. House Democrats did score a significant legal victory on Monday when federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that an accounting company, Mazars, must comply with a subpoena issued by Cummings. Trump said hours later that there would be an appeal, and on Tuesday morning papers were filed to continue that fight. Waters said she was pleased that the judge agreed with the Democrats' argument in that case, but that process would be lengthy and does not absolve Congress from its responsibility to act. Politically, Democrats remain in the same bind. Pelosi's stated threshold for \"overwhelming and bipartisan\" support to move forward with impeachment hasn't budged. While most Democrats want impeachment hearings to begin, the idea is still unpopular overall, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. \"What about just doing the right thing?\" Moulton said, when asked about the political calculus for Democrats. That question is causing anxiety among some members ahead of the coming Memorial Day break. Some worry they will face angry constituents who want proof that Democrats are holding Trump accountable while still delivering on promises to create jobs and improve health care. The tension has created a political headache for people like Cicilline, the head of the Democrats' messaging team. \"I think delivering on those promises to improve the economic lives of the American people is our first priority,\" Cicilline said. \"I think Democrats are also united that we need to hold this administration accountable and that we need to demonstrate that no one in this country, including the president, is above the law. While there might be some different ideas about what's the best vehicle to do that, we are united on those principles.\"",

McGahn is now barred from talking to Congress, the White House says. Updated at 7:09 p.m. ET A federal judge ruled against President Trump on Monday in a subpoena dispute not long after the White House said it is seeking to block its former top lawyer from talking to Congress. The events amounted to a win \u2014 and a loss \u2014 apiece for Republicans and Democrats in their ongoing high-stakes legal and political war over separation of powers and oversight in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The McGahn matter First, the White House said on Monday that the law and precedent give former White House counsel Don McGahn immunity from appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, which Democrats wanted. Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and his majority issued a subpoena that sought to compel McGahn to appear and hand over documents. No, the administration says \u2014 advisers of McGahn's stature have the privilege not to comply given their closeness to the president. Ordering them to appear is almost like ordering the president himself to appear, and members of Congress couldn't force Trump himself to testify any more than Trump could command a lawmaker to show up at the White House, the Justice Department argued. Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel sent the current White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, a 15-page legal memo on Monday detailing what Engel called the reasons that the White House can keep McGahn and his documents out of the hands of lawmakers. He cited the work of boldfaced names of Washington history from then-Attorney General Janet Reno to then-Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist. \"We believe that these established principles apply to bar the committee from compelling Mr. McGahn to testify,\" Engel wrote. \"The counsel to the president clearly qualifies as a senior adviser to testimonial immunity. ... We have also recognized that the immunity continues to apply after the counsel leaves the White House.\" Meanwhile, White House counsel Cipollone wrote to Nadler to affirm that McGahn would not appear at any hearing on Tuesday as Democrats had hoped. McGahn's attorneys have said he is going to stand fast and take no action until the questions are resolved between the branches of government. Nadler faulted the White House's position as \"the latest act of obstruction from the White House\" and \"the latest example of this administration's disdain for law.\" The House Judiciary Committee is going to convene on Tuesday as planned, Nadler said, with the expectation that McGahn will be there. If that happens, but McGahn doesn't show, it would be the second recent time that Nadler has held a hearing with an empty witness chair. The financial records subpoena Not long after Engel's letter appeared on Monday, a federal judge in Washington handed a victory to Democrats in a parallel dispute over access to some of Trump's financial records. Federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that an accounting company, Mazars, must comply with a subpoena issued by House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Trump had sued to quash that subpoena, arguing that members of Congress had no legitimate legislative purposes that supported their desire to get the documents. Yes they do, Mehta wrote. His 41-page opinion traced the history of tension between the separate branches of government \u2014 but concluded Congress in this case is within its power and that the reasons cited by lawmakers to compel the release of the records are \"facially valid legislative purposes.\" Members of Congress say they want to confirm whether Trump is in compliance with foreign emoluments clauses, and his accounting records would help establish that. Questions have swirled \u2014 and been denied by Trump \u2014 about whether he might be subject to some kind of financial coercion by lenders overseas. Cummings hailed the ruling. \"Today's decision is a resounding victory for the rule of law and our constitutional system of checks and balances,\" he said. \"The court recognized the basic, but crucial fact that Congress has authority to conduct investigations as part of our core function under the Constitution.\" Trump, meanwhile, vowed to appeal. The president told reporters on his way to a rally in Pennsylvania it was \"totally the wrong decision by an Obama-appointed judge.\" Constitutional showdown Trump and House Democrats are in a trench war over the rival powers of Congress and the executive branch as lawmakers seek to learn more following the Mueller investigation. Nadler, Cummings and their colleagues argue there are big unanswered questions about Trump's business operations and his finances. Trump and the White House say Democrats are simply trying to drag out the Russia investigation following Mueller's conclusion that Trump's campaign didn't conspire with Russia's attack on the election in 2016. The conflict has been building over several months. Attorney General William Barr did not show up at a hearing of Nadler's committee after a dispute with the majority over the process for questions \u2014 the last time the panel met across the witness table from an empty seat. Barr also isn't giving the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of Mueller's report and its underlying evidence, as Nadler demanded with a subpoena. So the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. Nadler and his committee may vote soon to hold McGahn or others in contempt of Congress, as well. That would set the stage for a vote by the full House of Representatives, possibly later in the summer, to hold Barr, McGahn and possibly others in contempt, too. Members of Congress may use lawsuits to challenge the denials they have encountered from the administration in accessing witnesses and documents, but those cases could take months or years to resolve. In the short term, the effect of Trump's and Barr's decisions is to stop House Democrats from getting more grist for investigations built to follow up on or build upon that completed by Mueller.",

More than a decade ago, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared victory over the Bush administration in a clash between Congress and the president's assertion of executive privilege to try to block members of his administration from testifying as part of a congressional oversight investigation. \"It's a triumph for the balance of power, checks and balances, the Constitution of the United States,\" Pelosi said in March 2009. It's also a road map for Democrats in 2019, as they wage a similar fight now against President Trump and his exertion of executive privilege to block congressional oversight into the conclusions in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., was there for both fights. \"We knew the argument wouldn't carry the day\" [in court] Sanchez told NPR. She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 2007, which at the time was trying to conduct oversight into a Bush-era scandal over how a number of U.S. attorneys were fired. Congress wanted to hear from White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and White House counsel Harriet Miers, but President George W. Bush exerted executive privilege to circumvent their testimony. The Judiciary Committee, and eventually the House, passed resolutions holding them in contempt and pursued their testimony in civil court challenges. In July 2008, the D.C. District Court issued a lengthy opinion in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers that largely rejected the Bush administration's arguments for blanket executive privilege protections and sided decisively with Congress on its authority to conduct oversight. \"Congress's power of inquiry is as broad as its power to legislate and lies at the very heart of Congress's constitutional role,\" the court responded. \"Presidential autonomy, such as it is, cannot mean that the Executive's actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by Congress. That would eviscerate the Congress's oversight functions.\" Ultimately, Congress got what it wanted: Miers testified, and lawmakers got most of the requested documents. It also happened nearly two years after the start of the legal battle, which presents an increasingly difficult situation for Democrats politically: They might win in court, but it could be years from now. \"It is a little bit disappointing that it takes time to litigate these things in the court,\" Sanchez said. \"My sense is if they want to try to overturn precedent and if takes time, that hopefully the judicial branch will come down very strongly and very clearly so that if you ever find yourself at that crossroads again, people will be forewarned that this is not a good venture to try to disobey what Congress is asking, and the penalty will be swifter and stronger with each case.\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., downplayed the political stakes of having to wait for the courts to weigh in on Trump's privilege claims. \"This is a very fundamental issue, so if it takes a year and a half it's a relatively short period of time in the course of the history of our country,\" he said. \"This issue is beyond politics in the Democratic/Republican partisan sense. It is the politics with a small 'p' of how our democracy effectively represents the American people and prevents a dictator or authoritarian figure to impose his or her will individually on the rest of us. So this is a big issue.\" A year and a half would be timely, compared to another recent precedent. House Republicans held former Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012 and fought him in civil court for documents related to the \"Fast and Furious\" operation, which involved illegal gun-running in Mexico involving the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Holder declined to do so after President Barack Obama exerted executive privilege over them. In 2013, D.C.. District Court again appeared to side with Congress, echoing the Judiciary v. Miers precedent, but the case was finally settled only last week \u2014 with a legally murky conclusion \u2014 and more than two years after Obama left office. The lengthy legal reality is changing the calculus in the House Democratic Caucus about how best to confront the Trump administration, not just over the Mueller report but in all other administration efforts to block congressional oversight, such as the Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal's request for copies of six years of the president's tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to comply with the request and is now facing a subpoena from the chairman. Increasingly, rank-and-file Democrats are talking about beginning an impeachment inquiry since impeachment is a legal proceeding that could give the House a stronger hand in court to get the administration to comply with requests for testimony and documents faster. There is also ongoing talk of invoking long-dormant inherent contempt powers that authorize Congress to detain and arrest people who do not comply with congressional subpoenas, although that may be politically unfeasible. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is making the case instead for imposing fines of up to $25,000 per day for people who don't comply with subpoenas. \"That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it, and we may have to,\" Schiff told MSNBC.",

The House is expected to vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress. The executive branch and the legislative branch are deadlocked. The House could vote soon about whether to hold the attorney general \u2014 and maybe others \u2014 in contempt of Congress. What does that mean? How did this happen? What could happen next? Here's what you need to know: What's behind it all? Information. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, want it. The Republican administration of President Trump doesn't want to give it up. What do members of Congress want? The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., wants the full, unredacted report of special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the Trump campaign. The Justice Department says it can't comply because of federal regulations. Nadler also wants Mueller to testify and is seeking documents from former White House counsel Don McGahn \u2014 and, potentially for McGahn or others to testify, too. The White House says McGahn cannot give up the documents that the Judiciary Committee has requested, and McGahn's lawyer says he's not going to do anything until this dispute is resolved. Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, D-Mass., wants Trump's tax returns. The Treasury Department won't provide them. So Neal issued subpoenas on Friday to try to compel their release. The leaders of the House intelligence and the House Financial Services committees want financial records about Trump's business dealings from some of his creditors, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump and his family are suing those banks, seeking to block them from complying. There could be other requests for documents or testimony \u2014 and Trump has made clear they'll likely be challenged by the administration. President Trump: \"We're fighting all the subpoenas.\" pic.twitter.com/bATW8yjL2z Why does Congress want all this? Lawmakers say they have a duty under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the administration, and there are many lingering questions about the president, even after the conclusion of the Mueller investigation. What is contained in the redacted portions of Mueller's report? Is Trump subject to coercion based on his finances? Did Trump and his family break any laws in the conduct of their business? The president's decision not to release his tax returns, as all his recent predecessors have done, suggests to critics that he may be hiding something. The account of his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, also led opponents to believe there may be evidence of wrongdoing. Cohen told members of Congress earlier this year that Trump routinely inflated the real value of his assets in order to qualify for bank loans or misrepresent his apparent wealth \u2014 and also that Trump deflated the value of property he reported to authorities in order to pay less taxes. Financial records from Trump's creditors, evidence from his tax records or now-secret findings by Mueller all could reveal more \u2014 and Democrats are eager for as much political ammunition as they can fire. Why won't the administration comply? Trump calls all this \"presidential harassment.\" Democrats didn't get what they wanted from Mueller's investigation, he argues, and so they're desperate to scrape together whatever else they can. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the House leaders want to distract from the good news Trump continues to deliver about the economy and to drag out the Russia investigation. Statement on Executive Privilege pic.twitter.com/6ujCZDnMC0 Administration officials say they have the law on their side. Attorney General William Barr argues that he's prohibited from revealing the grand jury material in the Mueller report to anyone, including members of Congress, because of the vital principle that the workings of a grand jury must be secret. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others argue that Congress' power of oversight under the Constitution doesn't amount to a license to snoop into the affairs of private Americans for no reason \u2014 as he says lawmakers are doing with Trump's taxes. The request, he said, does not have a \"legitimate legislative purpose.\" Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s response to Chairman Neal\u2019s letter requesting President Trump\u2019s tax returns: pic.twitter.com/X2VsDYKpYh Also, there is a longstanding practice that enables an administration to shield some of its workings from the public under \"executive privilege,\" the doctrine that emphasizes the importance of those within government being able to confer among themselves confidentially. Barr argued that privilege is what protects the underlying material from the Mueller report and White House counsel Pat Cipollone argued it means McGahn's notes are beyond the reach of the Judiciary Committee. Mueller's report describes Trump asking McGahn to fire Mueller \u2014 which McGahn didn't agree to do \u2014 and then Trump asking McGahn later to lie about the earlier request. Democrats want to reveal more about those incidents. What's going to happen next? The Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend that the full House find Barr in contempt. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hasn't said when the chamber may take that vote, but it could happen later this month \u2014 and it could include more subjects than just the attorney general. Mnuchin, McGahn or others also could find themselves in contempt of Congress, depending on the way this dispute runs. The Justice Department argues that Barr can't be in contempt because he continued negotiating with Nadler's committee to try to reach an accommodation about Mueller's material. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee made the same point \u2014 and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia also observed how much more time had elapsed before Congress held then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012. Democrats are just speeding ahead for the sake of a rabble-rousing political scrap, he said \u2014 not with any real interest in negotiating. When these cases go to court, a judge could decide as much, Collins said, and rule against the Congress. Will there be court battles? Oh yes \u2014 and they likely will be where these disputes ultimately are resolved. Members of Congress could ask a judge to order the administration to comply with their wishes; administration lawyers would ask to stand by their earlier positions. It'll take a while, though. Holder's case was still active until a settlement last week. The time issue is part of the political strategy for both sides. Democrats want to strike while the iron is hot and to keep their investigations into Trump in the headlines ahead of next year's election. Trump and Republicans know that a court fight will take years, especially one involving big constitutional questions about the powers of co-equal branches of government. Meanwhile, much of the material in question likely will remain under wraps. At least one dispute could be resolved before next year's election \u2014 a federal judge in Washington, D.C., said Thursday that he wanted to expedite the dispute over Trump's records from an accounting firm. Is this a \"constitutional crisis\"? Some Democrats are calling it that; other people call it a \"constitutional confrontation.\" \"It's a constitutional confrontation. I don't think it's yet a crisis,\" says journalist Bob Woodward on the showdown between House Democrats and the White House over the release of the full version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. https://t.co/effKdakPLX pic.twitter.com/PeA9eEckqQ A truly unprecedented impasse might open if a judge were to order the administration to give Congress material under dispute and it refused. In past showdowns like this one, court have usually resolved them. There is always tension between Congress and the executive branch, even when the sides belong to the same party. That push-and-pull relationship is built into the Constitution, and it often becomes exacerbated when one party controls the White House and another controls one or both chambers of Congress, as it is now. Democrats battled the administration of President George W. Bush when Pelosi was last the speaker. Republicans in Congress voted Holder in contempt over a gun investigation scandal and spent months pursuing the administration of President Barack Obama over the deadly 2012 Benghazi attack. Each time, each side accused the other of doing what Republicans and Democrats are accusing the others of doing now: disregarding the other's powers and responsibilities under the Constitution in an attempt to win in the political arena.",

Updated at 8:15 p.m. ET The Trump administration says it is blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from turning over documents requested by the House Judiciary Committee, escalating the standoff between the president and congressional Democrats. In a letter to committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., current White House counsel Pat Cipollone says the documents sought by the committee \"remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.\" Cipollone writes further that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \"has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records in response to the Committee's April 22 subpoena.\" He says the committee should instead direct its requests for such records to the White House. The documents in question were provided by McGahn to special counsel Robert Mueller, as part of Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. They outline Trump's efforts to get McGahn to fire Mueller, along with subsequent conversations in which Trump tells McGahn to deny the earlier exchanges. Cipollone's letter stops short of invoking executive privilege on behalf of the president, a point the White House may be hard-pressed to make as it already made the documents available to Mueller's team. The papers in question are believed to include contemporaneous notes taken by McGahn's secretary. The House Judiciary Committee wants McGahn to appear before it May 21. McGahn's attorney William Burck wrote to the committee that McGahn, as a former attorney for the president, \"continues to owe certain duties and obligations to the President which he is not free to disregard.\" Burck added, \"Where co-equal branches of government are making contradictory demands on Mr. McGahn concerning the same set of documents, the appropriate response for Mr. McGahn is to maintain the status quo unless and until the Committee and Executive Branch can reach an accommodation.\" House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, rejected the argument that the White House could keep McGahn from turning over documents or testifying on Capitol Hill under a claim of executive privilege. In a letter to Burck, Nadler threatened to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress if he didn't show up to testify \"absent a court order authorizing non-compliance.\" NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward by Valerie Jarrett Hardcover, 305 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Valerie Jarrett, longtime personal adviser to the Obamas, said in an interview with NPR's Audie Cornish airing Tuesday that former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 who is considering a run for president \u2014 \"got it right over the weekend when he said it's important that men listen\" in response to a recent allegation against him of inappropriate contact. \"I had the honor of working with Joe Biden every single day for eight years. And I have an enormous amount of respect for him,\" Jarrett said. \"And I saw him be extraordinarily demonstrative to both men and women alike \u2014 and never did I take it as a sexual advance in any way.\" Jarrett made the comments during a conversation about her new memoir Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward. In addition to weighing in on the #MeToo movement, Jarrett discusses the legacy of the Obama administration amid today's politics \u2014 and also recounts meeting Michelle and Barack Obama and working as a single mother. She reflects on how her early childhood in Iran shaped her: Her parents moved there in 1954, before she was born, so her father could pursue a better job opportunity, and avoid the discrimination he had encountered in the U.S. There, she says, he \"ceases becoming just a black physician ... he really became an American physician.\" On living in Iran as a child For me, spending my formative years in a very cosmopolitan hospital compound with physicians from all over the world, and children from all over the world, taught me so much in terms of my ability to walk in a room and communicate and find something in common with just about anybody. I played with children where we didn't even speak the same language \u2014 and that's part of how I learned to speak Farsi and French and English ... that's what my classmates and my childhood friends were doing. And it also gave me a perspective on the United States. Sometimes those of us who've never left take the privileges that we have for granted here \u2014 and it's everything from clean water and food to civil liberties. And I also think it taught me that the United States may be the greatest country on Earth but it's not the only country on Earth \u2014 and we can learn a great deal outside of our shores. So those early formative years were very important to me and in a sense my parents took me over the color line, because those first five years in Iran I didn't really have any experience of discrimination or racism or anything like that. And so coming back to United States was a bit of a culture shock for me.... I think part of what struck me the first time I met President Obama and we had dinner, he started asking me, 'Well where are you from?' I said Chicago. 'Where were you born?' I was born in Shiraz. And I braced myself for kind of a big old conversation and he said 'Well, that's interesting.' And he leaned in and he started to tell me about his life in Indonesia and what he learned from that experience. And then I opened up more about Iran. And I think the lesson I learned in that is that our stories are important. They reflect who we are. And I spent so much time trying to pretend like I was like everyone else, when where I was different is my uniqueness. On #MeToo I think the culture of our country has changed and politics is a piece of that. But, more importantly, and I think we have an enormous debt of gratitude to the brave women in the #MeToo moment who came forward with their voices. And there is safety in numbers. And I think what men are recognizing is, it isn't just a matter of what their intent was. It's a matter of how was it perceived by the person. And if people feel that behavior is inappropriate, that is important to hear. And that the way our society and our culture will change is if we are listening to one another better \u2014 and if we are recognizing the impact of our actions on others. And so, I was heartened to see [former Vice President Biden] acknowledge that over the weekend and say we have to begin listening. And I agree. Time is up. On Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores' accusations against Biden \u2014 and whether the alleged behavior should disqualify him from running for president The great part about our democracy is every voter gets to decide that for themselves. She gets to decide. I get to decide. You get to decide. We all get to look at the facts and see them through the lens that is valuable to us and then make decisions accordingly. And all of the candidates who are running run on the record and they run on their vision for their country. And one of the things that President Obama used to say, I remember in the early days of Iowa, is that \"Look, you have to earn it.\" You have to be willing to let people come in and see you, your faults, your weaknesses, your strengths, your vision, your track record, and then they get to make the decision \u2014 and we have to put our trust and confidence in them. And the piece that I'm interested in, right now, which I want to return to is making sure that every American appreciates the importance of that voice and votes. And that's the minimum responsibility of our democracy is to vote. Then, how about get involved in your community? How about figure out how you can give back? How about considering public service? There's so many ways that we could all make our country stronger and make our country better. And exciting that passion particularly in our young people is something I care a lot about. Valerie Jarrett, a former Obama administration staffer, has a new book titled, Finding My Voice. \n\n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR/Claire Harbage\n                    \n                \nhide caption Valerie Jarrett, a former Obama administration staffer, has a new book titled, Finding My Voice. On being the target of a racist tweet by Roseanne Barr Well, I said at the time that, look, I am fine. I'm not worried about Valerie Jarrett. I think that that was symptomatic of a much bigger problem. And I'm worried about the people who aren't able to defend themselves. And the question is, when are we going to get to the point in our country ... where we're not talking at each other, we're not seeing each other through historic lenses of racism or discrimination, but we're taking the chance to actually listen and get to know one another, to put ourselves in the shoes of the stranger, to feel a sense of empathy and responsibility? That's where the racial healing comes from. On the narrative that White House advisers have more influence than they should I think I came into the White House enjoying a very close relationship with both of the Obamas and that probably made some people uncomfortable. I think there had never been a woman or an African-American in that role before. And I think it took a while for people to appreciate that what was most important to me was to be a part of the team.... I think that's historically quite true and I think what President Obama did was to demonstrate through his actions that he was as interested in what the most junior staff person in the room had to say, who had a good idea, as he was in anything I had to say. And he had a management style that was devoted to bringing out what everyone thought, knowing he would make the most informed decisions if he listened to people who had different perspectives. If someone disagreed with him they got the full Obama body language, leaning in and saying \"tell me why.\" And making them feel comfortable and giving permission and one of the management strategies that I learned early in my career that I certainly saw him put into place in the White House is that to get the best out of people, people can't think that the deck is stacked and that one person has greater weight than someone else. And I think he made it very clear early on, and it helped my relationship, frankly, for him to show that he cared what all of us had to say and that merit was his interest, not a pre-existing relationship. On the challenges of being a young mom and charting a career as a woman of color I simply went into [the White House] job as I have all my jobs since I was a young working mom from the perspective of what would have been helpful to me. When I was a young single mom, I thought, well, if I just worked harder, if I were smarter, if I were better organized, more efficient, slept fewer hours, maybe it wouldn't be so hard. And, I think, what I began to appreciate was \u2014 no, it's just hard. And so I tried to mentor the women in the White House and some of the men, as well, from the perspective of knowing what they were going through, as people considered having children. It was important to us, and starting with the Obamas, that we had paid maternity and paternity leave, equal, three months...to set the tone that we recognize the fact that, even in one of the most challenging places in the world, you are a whole person, you have children, you have spouses, you have senior-citizen parents who need to be taken care of... We're the only developed country in the world that doesn't have a paid leave policy. That's outrageous if we want to compete globally for talent. Sick days. Workplace flexibility. I remember when I was a young working mom, if I didn't show up at my daughter's Halloween parade nobody would show up [for her]. And so giving people the ability to adjust their work schedule to those needs is important. Affordable childcare is also a very important factor. And we held summits to focus on the policies and the practices that allow working families to thrive. And it's some of the proudest work that I worked on while we were in the White House. On what it's like to see signature items of the Obama legacy get rolled back Well, I think about it from the perspective of the lives of the American people who will be affected by those changes. ... I am hopeful that the American people speak up the way they did when two years ago there was an effort by the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and their voices were heard and it was not repealed. Right now the Republicans in Congress are saying why are we talking about the Affordable Care Act again. You could say, in part, why they lost the midterm elections is that they were threatening to take away this very valuable benefit from the American people. But the point I'm making to you is: I don't look at it from the perspective of our work being undone. ... I look at it from the perspective of what impact that is going have on the people who were benefiting from those programs. On advice for 2020 presidential candidates I think what President Obama did, which I encourage all the candidates to do, is to take a view of our country that's inclusive \u2014 where you reach out to everyone, where you are honest, and open, and authentic with everyone \u2014 and that you appeal to what's good in each other and focus on what we have in common, and not polarize our differences. I think that still resonates with people across the country. And I spend a lot of time now outside of Washington in communities all over this great land and I see the ability of ordinary people to still do extraordinary things \u2014 and that they are counting on their elected representatives to appeal to them and focus on their lives. Politics should not be about the politician. Politics should be about service. And people recognize and they can see through, in many instances, where people are not authentic.",

Updated at 7:46 p.m. ET Attorney General William Barr received a report on Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller about the findings from Mueller's investigation into the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election. Barr notified congressional leaders in a letter that said he is \"reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" Mueller is not recommending any more indictments, a senior Justice Department official told reporters. The investigations by Congress and other federal and state authorities into other aspects of Trump's 2016 campaign and business will continue. So it isn't clear whether they may lead to criminal charges separate from the work by Mueller that has ended. As to Friday's report, Barr wrote to congressional leaders that he intends to consult with Mueller and with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \"to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\" A message from Mueller was delivered early in the afternoon to Rosenstein and given \"within minutes\" to Barr, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. Officials would not characterize the length of Mueller's report but would say it is \"comprehensive.\" The White House learned about the completion of the report at 4:45 p.m., when attorney Emmet Flood in the White House counsel's office received the notification. Barr has previously committed generally to airing publicly what he gets from Mueller \u2014 as much as permitted by the law and regulations. He may opt to uphold that pledge by releasing a redacted version of what Mueller has prepared, or Barr may write his own report to summarize the confidential findings for public consumption. The precise next steps weren't immediately clear. One thing that has become clear is that the leadership of the Justice Department did not reject any proposed action by Mueller. Regulations require the attorney general to notify Congress if the attorney general says no to some request. Barr wrote that he had no such notifications to make. Rosenstein phoned Mueller at 4:30 on Friday afternoon to thank him for his service. The deputy attorney general has been expected to leave the Justice Department following the nomination of his replacement but no date has yet been set for Rosenstein's departure. Calls start for Mueller report to be public Members of Congress in both parties, including the leaders of the House and Senate, called for the report to be released. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also said Congress must get access to the report's underlying documents and other materials. \"Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves,\" Warner said. \"The special counsel's report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the attorney general should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice.\" Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that he agreed. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called it significant that Barr had told Congress that the leadership of the Justice Department hadn't rejected any requests for authority by Mueller. \"Importantly, the notification also indicates that there were no areas of disagreement between the attorney general or the acting attorney general and special counsel Mueller regarding courses of action,\" Graham said. \"I have always believed it was important that Mr. Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference, and that has been accomplished,\" Graham said Other members of Congress said they want to hear from the principals themselves. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she wanted Barr to testify in public on Capitol Hill. And Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who sits on the House intelligence committee, told NPR on Friday afternoon that he wants to hear from Mueller himself. \"We ultimately will have to hear from special counsel Mueller in order to verify,\" he said. \"I don't think the American people will accept anything less than his word.\" White House: Next moves are up to Barr It wasn't immediately clear whether the White House might object to the public release of the report, for example on the ground that it can shield its own workings under executive privilege. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said administration officials have not yet been briefed about it. The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel\u2019s report. What happens next is up to Barr, Sanders said. Inflection point The report is expected to provide the most comprehensive accounting so far about what the special counsel and his office have uncovered since his appointment following the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Mueller's office took over an FBI counterintelligence investigation that had been underway at that point for nearly a year. President Trump goes back and forth regarding what he accepts about the Russian interference; he even briefly absolved Russian President Vladimir Putin in person at a 2018 summit in Finland. But all along, Trump has maintained that the notion that his campaign had conspired with the Russians was a \"hoax,\" one he said was perpetuated by what he called biased conspirators and Democrats desperate for an excuse about why they lost the 2016 election. The president also frequently referred to the investigation led by Mueller as a \"witch hunt\" begun by Democrats based on unproven claims. In fact, suggestions about Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. appeared as early as 2015, when Britain's signals intelligence agency detected Russian activity aimed at political targets in the United States. Then in the summer of 2016, an Australian diplomat told American officials that a Trump campaign aide he had met in London \u2014 junior foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos \u2014 said Russians or their agents had been offering him dirt on Hillary Clinton. The FBI began to investigate Papadopoulos and others, including another campaign adviser, Carter Page; onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and national security adviser Michael Flynn. Papadopoulos, Manafort and Flynn all were eventually charged, along with several others. Long-burning fuse The existence of the investigation remained an official secret through the election in 2016 and until the early spring of 2017, when Comey revealed at a public hearing of the House intelligence committee that it not only had taken place \u2014 it was ongoing. Trump fired Comey that May. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then commissioned Mueller to take over the inquiry as a special counsel within the Justice Department. Mueller appointed attorneys, investigators and other specialists to join the effort. Mueller's office has negotiated a number of guilty pleas and brought criminal indictments involving both onetime Trump aides and a coterie of Russian military and other operatives charged with attacking the election. In legal documents, the special counsel's office has painted a detailed picture of the vast information warfare campaign that was conceived by Russian leaders as early as 2014 and then shifted into high gear for the 2016 presidential election. Russian government operatives traveled to the United States for a reconnaissance trip and then followed up with a multipronged suite of \"active measures\": \u2014 They waged cyberattacks against hundreds of targets, including top political figures; stole internal emails and documents; and then released them to wreak havoc. \u2014 They probed state-level election systems to look for weakness and to explore what data were included in voter databases, although officials have said no votes were changed. \u2014 They wreaked chaos within the political conversation taking place between Americans both online and in the real world. Not only did online operatives flood social networks with false stories and extreme posts to inflame disagreement, but they also plotted real-life disturbances and demonstrations in the real world during the 2016 campaign. First, the focus of the activity was to benefit the candidates whom the Russians considered the most extreme in 2016 \u2014 including Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Eventually, it sharpened into a full-scale program in support of Trump. That realization, combined with Trump's sympathetic messaging about Russia and the contacts discovered between his 2016 campaign and Russians, raised the question of whether Trump's camp might have conspired with the interference.

Bernie Sanders, an independent who became an ideological leader in the Democratic Party after his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton, faces a far more crowded and liberal field this time.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who became an ideological leader in the Democratic Party after his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton, faces a far more crowded and liberal field this time. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is giving it another go, launching a second campaign for the White House four years after surprising Democrats with a strong bid for the party's 2016 nomination. \"We began the political revolution in the 2016 campaign, and now it's time to move that revolution forward,\" the independent senator told Vermont Public Radio in an interview airing Tuesday morning. But this 2020 bid will undoubtedly be a very different presidential campaign than his quest for the Democratic nomination as an underdog in 2016. Sanders enters the race as a top contender who, along with former Vice President Joe Biden, tops most early polls, far outpacing other Democratic candidates in support and name identification. It's a sharp contrast from when Sanders seemingly came out of nowhere to surprise the political class \u2014 and at times himself \u2014 by winning several key primaries against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Buoyed by a big early win in New Hampshire, Sanders fought Clinton for the Democratic nomination through the final June contests, drawing tens of thousands of supporters to rallies in the process. In the years since his loss to Clinton, Sanders has remained a national leader of the Democratic Party, though he still refuses to join. \"I think we have had real success in moving the ideology of the Democratic Party to be a pro-worker party, to stand up to the billionaire class,\" Sanders told NPR during the 2018 midterms. \"We've got a long way to go.\" Many of the issues he has promoted for years \u2014 most notably a Medicare-for-all national health care plan and a $15 an hour minimum wage \u2014 have shifted from the party's fringe to its mainstream, and are now seen as effective litmus tests for presidential candidates. Indeed, Sanders' most recent Medicare-for-all bill was cosponsored by fellow presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. The Senate's other presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, co-sponsored Sanders' most recent $15 minimum wage bill, in addition to the other four. Sanders pointed to the Democratic Party's leftward shift as a reason for a second run. \"It turns out that many of the ideas that I talked about \u2014 that health care is a right, not a privilege, and that we've got to move toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system: very, very popular. The idea that we have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,\" he told Vermont Public Radio. \"When I talked about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and lowering student debt, that was another issue that people said was too radical. Well, that's also happening around the country.\" But running in 2020, Sanders could be a victim of his own success. While Sanders provided liberal Democratic primary voters with a sharp contrast to Clinton's political pragmatism in 2016, progressives will have no shortage of candidates to choose from in the increasingly broad and diverse 2020 field. Most declared Democrats support Sanders' vision of nationalized health care, and more robust federal programs and policies, all funded by higher taxes on top income earners. And in a party that has placed an increasing premium on being more representative of the broader electorate and country in recent years, many other candidates will offer voters the 77-year-old's platform \u2014 with the added benefit of youth and diversity. \"My question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages? Does it have to be him? I don't think it does, and I admire him,\" New Hampshire radio host Arnie Arnesen, a 2016 Sanders supporter, recently told NPR. \"I think it's time for us to start creating a new bench. And the new bench isn't old, it shouldn't be white and it probably shouldn't be male.\" Asked by Vermont Public Radio how he will pitch his candidacy in such a diverse and progressive field, Sanders argued, \"We have got to look at candidates not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or gender and not by their age. I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society that looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\" There have been hurdles as Sanders prepared to run again in 2020. His campaign has had to answer to charges of sexism and harassment by staffers in 2016, with his former campaign manager acknowledging \"a failure.\" Sanders also had to clarify comments about the role of racism in the 2018 campaign, addressing the losses of gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia. Sanders took several steps to maintain his national political profile and strengthen his presidential prospects in recent years, including his support for Democratic candidates in 2018. Frequently criticized by the Clinton campaign during 2016 for ignoring foreign policy, he delivered several high-profile speeches laying out a progressive worldview that attempts to thread the needle between a broad, America-As-World-Police approach to international politics, and President Trump's isolationist views. Sanders also played a lead role opposing Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and engaged with the Democratic National Committee that famously opposed his 2016 campaign, as revealed in internal emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted to Wikileaks. In the wake of the 2016 campaign, the DNC changed its presidential nominating process, in part by largely removing party leaders known as \"superdelegates\" from influencing the selection, a move Sanders supported.",

Kirsten Gillibrand says she is running for president, joining a growing number of Democrats who are seeking to challenge President Trump in 2020. Gillbrand announced her decision on CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, saying she is filing her exploratory committee for the White House on Tuesday evening. TONIGHT: @SenGillibrand stops by @colbertlateshow to announce that she is forming an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States! #LSSC pic.twitter.com/vPUpF1gs8z \"I'm going to run for president of the United States, because as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own,\" Gillibrand told Colbert. \"Which is why I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege. It's why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. And I believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.\" \"But you are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don't take on the systems of power that make all of that impossible \u2014 which is taking on institutional racism, it's taking on the corruption and greed in Washington, taking on the special interests that write legislation in the dead of night,\" Gillibrand continued. \"And I know that I have the compassion, the courage and fearless determination to get that done.\" She is the second senator to enter the Democratic primary, after Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren announced an exploratory committee on Dec. 31. Several other Democratic senators are also eyeing bids, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro is also running, as is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in 2009, succeeding Hillary Clinton when she became secretary of state. Before that, Gillibrand served one term in the House representing the Albany area. She won a special election in 2010 to finish out Clinton's term and was re-elected in 2012 and 2018. In a debate last fall, Gillibrand said she would serve out her six-year term, which if she were to win the race for president, she would not do. In a campaign video published shortly after she announced her exploratory committee, Gillibrand detailed many issues she has worked on, including transparency in government, not accepting corporate PAC money and helping push through the Sept. 11 health bill. The 52-year-old Gillibrand has long been seen as a possible presidential candidate. In the Senate, she has worked on legislation to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, championed federal family leave and worked to elect more women to office. \"Sometimes people say, 'Well, why do you just focus on women's issues?' \" Gillibrand told NPR in 2013. \"Well, why do you focus on issues that pertain to 52 percent of the population? It's pretty important. And women are such the untapped potential in this economy.\" Gillibrand's previous work on sexual assault and gender equality led to her becoming a leading voice in the #MeToo movement on Capitol Hill. In 2017, she was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct. That provoked the ire of some Democrats, who saw Franken as a progressive hero standing up to Trump and said that Gillibrand had rushed to judgment before the accusations against Franken had been vetted. Politico reported that could hurt her with some potential donors in a presidential campaign. \"It was very difficult because this is somebody I really do care about and think has done great work in the Senate,\" she told NPR in 2017 after Franken resigned. \"But the truth is, if we are defending this behavior but not that behavior, and talking about this, the gradations between sexual assault versus harassment versus groping, and then where on the body you're groping \u2014 I just don't think that's the right conversation to be having.\" Having represented a more conservative area in upstate New York, one issue where Gillibrand could come under scrutiny in the eyes of many Democrats is gun control. When she was appointed to the Senate in 2009, Gillibrand said, \"It's an important part of upstate New York. So I'm going to be an advocate for hunters' rights. But there is so much area where there's common ground, where I can work together with anti-gun \u2014 with really solving the problem of gun violence.\" She told CBS's 60 Minutes last year that she was \"wrong\" about her previous stances on gun control and was \"embarrassed\" by them. \"What it's about is the power of the NRA and the greed of that industry. Let's be clear. It is not about hunters' rights, it's about money,\" Gillibrand said.",

Pat Roberts, R-Kan., speaks on the first day of the 2016 Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Updated at 1:20 p.m. ET Longtime Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts announced Friday he won't run for re-election in 2020, opening up a potentially competitive seat in a state where Democrats recently had several unlikely electoral successes. \"I have had the honor and privilege of representing Kansans for 16 years in the House and 22 years so far in the Senate. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become the longest-serving member of Congress in our state's history,\" Roberts said, making the announcement in Manhattan, Kan., with his wife by his side. Roberts fended off a tough primary challenge in 2014, as well as a self-funded independent challenger in the general election, with the help of national Republicans. Questions about his residency hung over his campaign, after he had rented out his Kansas home and later said he had \"full access to the recliner\" at a friend's house when he returned to the state. The 82-year-old would very likely have faced another challenge from the right if he had sought re-election. His decision makes him the second Senate Republican to say he will bow out next year. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander announced his retirement last month. But unlike the Tennessee contest, the open Kansas seat could be a potential pickup opportunity for Democrats, albeit a tough one. Democrats won the governor's race there last November and flipped a House seat in suburban Kansas City. National Republicans are already pushing for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas representative, to take a look at the race. His clout could potentially clear the field, but he may be reluctant to leave such a high-profile post. There are several other Republicans who could be eyeing the race. According to the Kansas City Star, potential candidates include outgoing Gov. Jeff Colyer; outgoing Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who narrowly beat Colyer in the gubernatorial primary but lost the general election; former Rep. Kevin Yoder, who lost his re-election bid last fall; state Attorney General Derek Schmidt; Rep. Roger Marshall; and Kansas Chamber of Commerce President Alan Cobb. Another possible candidate could be American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, a Kansas native who is also weighing a potential bid, per the Washington Examiner. The organizer of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Schlapp is a close ally of President Trump's, and his wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a communications adviser in the White House. The Star also reports that former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, has already been considering a 2020 campaign, buoyed by the Democrats' successes in 2018. Roberts was first elected to the House in 1980, having worked as a congressional aide for more than a decade prior. He won his first Senate race in 1996, and during nearly four decades in Congress, became the first person in history to chair both the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, where he helped shepherd several farm bills. Roberts has also chaired the Senate Ethics Committee, as well as the Senate intelligence committee, where he was criticized by Democrats in the aftermath of the intelligence failures that led to the Iraq War. \"Certainly leading farm bills in the House and Senate touch many lives, and I've always been mindful of what farm families do for our nation in a troubled and hungry world as we crafted each bill,\" Roberts said, reflecting on his tenure. \"As the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman for four years during the Iraq War, I led the Committee's investigation that exposed worldwide intelligence failures leading to building a better Intelligence Community that today keeps our country safer.\"",

New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner is expected to officially announce Monday that the state's 2020 presidential primary will be held on February 11th. If all goes as expected, the date will be in line with a long-established tradition that puts the state's first in the nation primary a week and a day after the Iowa caucuses. But in New Hampshire, the date isn't official until Gardner says it is. For decades, picking that date has been central part of New Hampshire's strategy for keeping its grip on its first-in-the-nation spot. State law requires that the secretary of state not only picks a date, but that date must be a week ahead of any \"similar election.\" That power has helped Gardner, the nation's longest-serving top election official, build a legendary reputation as guardian of the New Hampshire primary. But a changing political landscape has put the relevance of New Hampshire's primary at risk like never before. \"Maybe it's not fair ... \" In Gardner's more than four decades on the job, he has faced down other states that tried to usurp the power and attention that comes from being first, not to mention the national political parties, most often the Democrats, which have also tried to take control of the election calendar.

But each time, Gardner came out of those battles looking like a hero. As Gardner put it in 2000, \"We understand the concerns in other states, you might think it's not fair that one state goes first all these times. Well, maybe it's not fair that A is the first letter of the alphabet or Sunday's the first day of the week or January is the first month.\" A legendary battle 1999 was one of those years that people in New Hampshire truly believed could be the end of the New Hampshire primary as they knew it. Gardner heard that Delaware wanted to move up their primary (you can hear that story in episode 4 of Stranglehold, the NHPR podcast about the NH primary), so he decided to announce that New Hampshire's primary date would be a week earlier than the political world was expecting. It also conflicted with Iowa's plans for its first-in-the-nation caucus. Iowa had already announced their caucus date, but Gardner's date would ruin the traditional 8-day span in between the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. Iowa would be forced to move their date back, which put them right in the middle of an annual pork convention. \"Holy buckets, it was interesting,\" Rob Tully recalled in a recent phone interview. He was the head of the Iowa Democratic party at the time. \"Basically it came down to this. I'm just going to cut to the chase. 'This is bulls***. We're New Hampshire. And God damn it, you should move.'\" In essence, Iowa party leaders were faced with a logistical nightmare \u2014 they'd have to redo all their plans for the caucus and holding it near this pork convention would be an additional headache. \"People come from all over the world to this convention here in Iowa. This isn't like you know hey we're having a stand and we're going to have some barbecue pork ribs out at the fairgrounds. I mean this thing is huge,\" Tully said. But Gardner wasn't budging, and Iowa wasn't either. Campaigns and reporters weren't sure when or where to book hotels. Iowa party leaders flew to New Hampshire to try and negotiate in person (more about this meeting, and other stories from primary history, in episode 1 of the Stranglehold podcast). The meeting was apparently so tense that the Iowa secretary of state had to be physically restrained from starting a fist fight. But Secretary Gardner wouldn't budge. And in the end Iowa was forced to move their caucus. \"There was a lot of pressure on Bill, and he didn't, he really didn't even blink,\" said Steve Duprey, then head of the New Hampshire GOP. \"Some will say he's a curmudgeon, he's inflexible. He was doing what he thought was right to defend the supremacy of the primary.\" Existential threats These are the kinds of stories that have built the legend of New Hampshire as this small but powerful state that's gripping tightly to its privileged spot. That level of drama is not expected to accompany this year's announcement, but New Hampshire continues to face threats, only these days they're more existential. And sometimes its candidates picking the fight. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro has been openly criticizing both New Hampshire and Iowa for its lack of diversity. \"Demographically, it's not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the democratic party, and I believe other states should have their chance,\" Castro said on MSNBC. New Hampshire and Iowa have long faced criticism, often from Democrats, about the demographics of their populations, but 2020 marks the first time candidates are making the case while actively seeking the White House. Another perceived threat: the Democratic National Committee's high thresholds for making the national debate stage. Some in New Hampshire worry that this process is becoming more nationalized, which takes away some of the first primary state's power to impact the race. Some candidates, including New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, have even cited those thresholds as reasons for dropping out before testing their candidacy in Iowa and New Hampshire. It remains to be seen if these things will lead to actual change in the 2024 election calendar, but if past is any indication, New Hampshire would likely fight back.",

RODOLICO: Like former Housing Secretary Julian Castro. Here he is on MSNBC last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JULIAN CASTRO: Demographically it's not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party. And I believe that other states should have their chance. RODOLICO: 2020 marks the first time candidates are openly criticizing the lack of diversity in New Hampshire and Iowa. CHOOLJIAN: And then there's the Democratic National Committee's thresholds for making it to the debate stage. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Breaking news right now. Another shakeup in the 2020 Democratic race. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pulled the plug on his White House bid today. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton has just dropped out after struggling to gain traction and unable to meet the criteria to get on the debate stage next month. RODOLICO: So some people in New Hampshire worry that this process is becoming more nationalized, taking away some of the first primary states' power to impact how this country picks presidents. CHOOLJIAN: Now it remains to be seen if the 2024 election could be a year of historic change in the election calendar. But we do know that New Hampshire would likely fight back.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized after photos surfaced showing him wearing brownface and blackface as a young man, saying he has no plans to resign and vowing to continue his campaign for re-election in October. \"Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of black face,\" Trudeau said at a news conference Thursday in a public park in Winnipeg. \"I should have understood that then and I never should have done it.\" His remarks came as a third image surfaced, video apparently showing him wearing dark makeup and a white T-shirt, laughing with his hands in the air. News of that incident, reported to have occurred in the late 1990s, was first reported by Global News. Trudeau, 47, sidestepped questions Thursday about how many times he has worn blackface or brownface. \"Obviously, this is deeply regrettable,\" Trudeau said. \"I'm wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered. And I think the question is, how could you not remember that?\" Pausing, he added, \"I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.\" The prime minister said that with his privileged upbringing came \"a massive blind spot.\" The first controversial image surfaced late Wednesday, when Time magazine published a photo of a 29-year-old Trudeau wearing a feathered turban and with a darkened face, neck and hands at an \"Arabian Nights\" costume party in 2001. In his initial comments Wednesday, Trudeau also admitted that he had worn blackface at a high school talent show. Trudeau's main political opponent, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, said Thursday that he was \"extremely shocked and disappointed\" in the prime minister, calling Trudeau \"unfit\" to lead the country. Reactions from the ranks of Trudeau's Liberal Party seemed to be mixed. Greg Fergus, a black member of Parliament and fellow Liberal, said told the CBC that black Canadians were confused, offended and hurt, but that he still had confidence in Trudeau. Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan, who is Sikh, told the broadcaster that the prime minister's actions were wrong, but that Trudeau has a record of promoting diversity. Other Liberals said they, too, were disappointed and called on Trudeau to own up to his mistakes.",

Justin Krebs, a campaign director with MoveOn, isn't interested in hearing pundits debate which 2020 Democratic candidate is the most \"electable.\" \"Because exactly four years ago right now there was a messy, crowded primary, with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable, and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning,\" he pointed out. And in the same vein, many Democrats thought Barack Obama was unelectable until he started winning primaries in 2008. Progressives say this word \"electability\" is being used as a fear tactic to intimidate voters into choosing a moderate, centrist nominee, specifically, former Vice President Joe Biden. But many of the activists who gathered over the weekend at the Netroots Nation conference insisted that's a foolish strategy. Biden, who has consistently led in early polling, is potentially the worst option for the party, they say, warning that Democrats could repeat the mistakes of 2016. Their main criticism of Biden is two-fold: He's too moderate on economic policy and has a complicated record on criminal justice and race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum. There isn't unanimous agreement among progressive activists about who they want as a nominee. Some remain deeply loyal to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his role in pushing the party leftward. Others say they like the policy plans that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been rolling out. And yet others say they like what California Sen. Kamala Harris represents \u2014 a black woman who could take on President Trump. But where activists agree is on Biden \u2014 they would prefer almost any other 2020 Democrat over him. While they are purists in many ways, if Biden were to become the nominee, activists at Netroots said, they would vote for him, perhaps begrudgingly. Their fear is that others will not. Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration. \"We need to be able to build a coalition of voters that are excited, that are gonna turn out at historic levels, and we can't rely on it just being based on Trump being on the ballot; that won't be enough,\" said Maria Urbina, national political director for Indivisible. She didn't single Biden out by name, but she said whoever the nominee is, he or she has to energize the Democratic base, specifically young voters and minorities. Activists also point out that Republicans under a Trump administration have not toned down their rhetoric; why, they ask, should Democrats moderate their message? Many say that Hillary Clinton tried that strategy in 2016, and it clearly failed. They still ponder \u2014 maybe, if Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had been the nominee, the Democrats could have won the White House. Allegra Dengler, a Democratic activist from Westchester County, N.Y., one of nearly 4,000 activists who attended Netroots Nation, says people including her own son didn't like Clinton. They were looking for a change-maker.

Her son voted for Trump in the 2016 election, but she says he would have voted for Sanders, if he had been the Democratic nominee. Biden doesn't seem like a change-maker to her, either. \"We need to go to the future,\" she says. \"Why is he so popular? I have no idea. He's like a corporate Democrat from Delaware, which is like the corporate headquarters of everything.\" Activists say the party needs an inspirational candidate, and moderation doesn't inspire people. Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America, spoke on a pop-up panel at Netroots Nation about \"Why Joe Biden is the least electable major Democrat for president in 2020.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America, spoke on a pop-up panel at Netroots Nation about \"Why Joe Biden is the least electable major Democrat for president in 2020.\" \"If you can afford for the world not to change, you take the slow approach,\" said Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America. \"If you're a privileged few that can wait for 'Medicarefor All,' then maybe you can be a moderate, but we don't have time for that.\" Several major presidential candidates have adopted progressive ideas that were previously on the fringe of the Democratic Party, such as Medicare for All. But one candidate who has not is Joe Biden. On Monday, he unveiled a health care plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid and creating a more robust public option. It was a clear contrast to the more progressive alternative. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that,\" Biden said in a video. He warned that overhauling the system would be too risky. The fight over health care is a proxy for the broader ideological battle in the Democratic Party with Sanders on one end and Biden on the other.

Sanders has long championed a Medicare for All system. And he plans to deliver a speech on Wednesday to \"confront the opponents of Medicare for All.\" Sanders' supporters feel that Biden's approach is too incremental and antiquated. The goal, progressives say, is not merely to maintain the ACA, but to establish universal health care. But that's not the goal of most voters, who are more concerned about the cost of health care than the system itself, says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president of social policy and politics at the centrist think tank Third Way. \"It gives a huge window for Donald Trump and Republicans to label Democrats as socialists and have that label stick,\" said Erickson, who's skeptical of how progressives are framing the debate. Democrats, she says, have a clear road map to the White House in 2020 \u2014 they need to follow what they did in the 2018 midterms. \"The margin for taking back the House came from people who switched their votes, not people who stayed home, so if we are going to win again and beat Donald Trump, we absolutely need to win some folks who are coming over from the other side,\" Erickson said.",

To young Western doctors working in poor communities, no more important words could be heard. Today, the field of \"global health\" strives to create equitable and just relationships between wealthy and impoverished regions, places and peoples. But it is still a field with markedly unequal power dynamics: racism, classism and many of the residual exploitations of a terrible colonial past. I fear that this point often goes missed or ignored, possibly because we are subconsciously or consciously engaged in a neocolonial narrative in which wealthy people are \"saving\" poor people even as they build their own careers. It is not a relationship in which Western visitors and local people are collaborating equally \u2014 or perhaps even more appropriately, where local leaders take the dominant role. I recently completed a global health course. There were lectures on AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis treatment and on noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension in Africa. But not one of these discussions addressed the remnants of colonial mentality. If anything, that mentality was pervasive in  the academic framework. Most of the lecturers were from high-income countries as were most of the students, including myself. Yet our discussions were largely about other people in other countries, most of which had been colonies in the past. I could not help but think that there should have been more people from the countries we were talking about both on the stage and in the seats. First, do no harm If you are from a high-income country working in a low-income setting, and you don't think and rethink about this topic often, there is a good chance you are contributing to the problem. Admittedly, I know that I have contributed to it. As a college student, I participated in a volunteer trip to the Dominican Republic in 2008 \u2014 my first experience with international health. I was a Spanish translator for American doctors seeking to create a program with the local community. This was meant to become a long-standing annual trip for medical and public health work \u2014 including potentially creating a permanent clinic where alumni could come to work. But this project was not continued after our two-week \"parachute-trip.\" Logistical issues precluded us from forming a longer, more meaningful connection.  But now as I look back, I recognize that this project certainly connected to themes from the colonial era: Western doctors traveling to unknown territories to help less-educated locals. That experience made me realize how problematic short-term trips could be and steered me into a career in global health as a way to make a sustained contribution to the field rather than just dropping in for quick missions. Back in 2008, on one of our many evening drives home in the back of flatbed trucks through the Dominican countryside, I remember a candid discussion with one of the doctors. We lamented that even though we were working to treat coughs, colds, diarrhea and fevers, we were doing nothing to treat all of the reasons contributing to these diseases: poverty, the lack of paved roads and latrines, food insecurity, insufficient education and even political disenfranchisement \u2014 if you're not able to vote in fair elections, how can you hope to have any impact on government health care decisions? A drop-in medical mission trip certainly was not the way to solve these problems. While the local people had a continual struggle against poverty, we as the Western visitors had the luxury of leaving whenever we wanted. They also had no recourse against us if we were to behave inappropriately \u2014 no way to hold us accountable. There was nothing they could do about the group of foreigners who came, saw and ultimately did not stay or return. Certainly those of us working on the program were better than brutal colonizers. But were we that different in the very basic power dynamics between light and dark skin? Between wealthy and poor? Moreover, the nature of our mission perhaps confirmed the worst fears of the local community: We would not be coming back there. Many times, we were asked when we would return, but most of us knew that the answer was at best uncertain. So we only vaguely could respond with \"en el futuro\" \u2014 in the future. And admittedly, I benefited: In 2008, having a global health experience on your CV was a big deal. Today, I feel guilt that I benefited because of it, even if that was not my primary reason for being there. At that time, I really did not know what I wanted to do with my career, and this was an opportunity to see if it might be global health care. Dismantling our own power Having reflected on the harm that we from the West have caused, I'm now asking the obvious question: What can we do about it? Even if you have never worked in global health, the color of your skin and the accent of your voice may unduly confer upon you a level of authority in poor communities that you likely do not deserve and should not have. This is a symptom of inequity that calls upon all of us in this seat of privilege to dismantle our own power \u2014 to push back against colonial legacy with humility; to say to yourself, your colleagues, and the people you are working with: \"We are not experts here; we are the students.\" Furthermore, the relationships within global health are still heavily (and falsely) dominated by the idea that the Global North is \"helping\" the Global South. The opposite is rarely acknowledged or encouraged in any meaningful way. Even when doctors from impoverished countries are brought to wealthy countries as part of exchange programs, it is under the assumption that they are coming to learn from us. This is, of course, not true. Much of what I have learned has been from the wisdom, ingenuity and perseverance of doctors and other health care staff who live and work in low-income settings. From them, I have learned how to rely on a physical exam rather than expensive and overutilized technology. I've also become more sensitive and aware of the challenges suffered by my underserved patients in the U.S. For instance, the same challenges that my patients in sub-Saharan Africa faced are commonly shared by patients I see in my predominantly Latin American clinic in Boston. They cannot afford or find healthy foods, they lack disposable income  for convenient transportation to a medical center, and for many, English is not a first language, if they can speak it at all. When a patient of mine misses an appointment, I call to figure out why. I do not write this to say that there is no role for doctors from high-income places to work in global health. There certainly is, and in fact, it is more than a role. It is a responsibility. Part of the legacy and inequity of colonialism is that we in the Global North benefit from access to new technologies, drugs, equipment and money as well as sanitation, electricity, transportation. The list goes on. But that is not because we are any better than doctors in poor countries. It is because our leaders have collectively and systematically done everything possible to make sure those countries stayed less economically empowered than our own for centuries. Our role in global health as practitioners from wealthy countries is then not a practice in which we are \"helping\" poor countries; it is one in which we are hoping they can forgive us for having decimated them in the first place. In the 1899 poem, The White Man's Burden, the English poet Rudyard Kipling talks about what he sees as the responsibility of wealthy countries to help poor countries as the burden placed upon the white man. In response, a black clergyman, H.T. Johnson, wrote a piece, The Black Man's Burden just a few months later. He rightly points out that the burden is the other way around \u2014 that actually, black and brown people have suffered the burden of white colonialism and imperialism, forces that have not helped them but exploited and killed them. Today, the same holds true, just repackaged. The burden is carried by black and brown people (as well as poor white people from disenfranchised groups) because of the ills of a still-thriving imperialist white dominance. We see this burden in global health research, which is still largely dominated by Western researchers building their careers off studies of vulnerable, marginalized groups who often don't understand their roles or participation. We see this in pandemic disease response, which has been disruptive to local cultural and health systems (Ebola, for instance, pulled many financial and operational resources away from other health and human rights maladies in the Congo that are killing even more Congolese). We see this in short-term global health trips, which help students from Western institutions gain \"experience\" at the expense of poor people in faraway places. Certainly not all is bad in global health, but the bad seems to be far less talked about than the good. At its worst, global health today is a self-congratulatory neocolonial machine in which doctors, professors, researchers and others from wealthy places with abounding privilege are further exalted because they are doing work that their Global South counterparts do as part of their everyday lives with little to no recognition. At its best, it is a humble attempt to equal the playing field of life between North and South by trying to unravel the tightly bound chains of colonialism. I'm now a physician at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital with a strong record of long-term global health partnerships. Our programs have a particular emphasis on establishing human relationships and building, empowering and supporting local health leaders as central tenets of the work. One example of this is the University of Global Health Equity, a medical and public health school in Rwanda with a focus on training African students to become leaders in global health and to lead health care efforts in their home countries. From many of the impoverished patients I have worked with, I have learned that the challenges that help a Western doctor build a career or feel altruistic are the harsh never-ending realities of their life \u2014 every day, every year, from birth until death. When we fail to recognize this harsh truth, we end up taking our power for granted. There is nothing more dangerous than that.

            "article_content": "by Kiley Reid Hardcover, 310 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The title of Kiley Reid's debut, Such a Fun Age, works on so many levels it makes me giddy \u2014 and, what's better, the title's plurality of meaning is echoed all over the place within the novel, where both plot and dialogue are layered with history, prejudice, expectations, and assumptions. The title's \"fun age\" might refer to one of the two main characters, Emira Tucker, a 25-year-old black woman who keenly feels that working part-time as a babysitter and part-time as a typist doesn't count as true adulting. It might refer to her charge, Briar, a white three-year-old whose imagination and speech patterns are so charmingly true to a particular kind of kid that she's both instantly recognizable and entirely her own person. More broadly, the \"fun age\" might be our own, prior to the 2016 election \u2014 an age that was considered by some to be magically post-racist and post-sexist because it was impolite to be these things in public; an age of performative white feminism; an age of social media and virality and armchair activism and online virtue-signaling that ironically requires certain people \u2014 often, those already more vulnerable \u2014 to exist in specific politically correct ways while letting others \u2014 usually, those with power and privilege \u2014 off the hook. Don't let all these layers put you off \u2014 the wonder of Such a Fun Age is that it is also a page-turner with beautifully drawn characters and a riveting plot. In the book's opening chapter, Emira is called away from a friend's birthday party by Alix (\"uh-leeks\") Chamberlain, whose two daughters, Briar and infant Catherine, she babysits for several times a week. Someone has thrown an egg at the Chamberlain house, hard enough to shatter a window, and Alix wants Briar out of the house when the police arrive. Emira, both somewhat tired of the party and in need of the extra cash, takes Briar to a grocery store in the Chamberlains' neighborhood, her friend Zara tagging along. She, Emira, and Briar have an impromptu dance party in the frozen foods aisle, as one occasionally will when a toddler is around, before Zara heads off for a hookup. The lovely, upbeat scene collapses when a security guard approaches and starts interrogating Emira because a white woman, who only moments before was congenially laughing at the dancing trio, was concerned to see a black woman with a white child out so late. \"We just came here to look at nuts. Well, we don't touch them or anything. We're just... we're really into nuts right now, so... yeah,\" Emira tells the guard, but the situation escalates to the point where a white man starts capturing the verbal altercation with his phone (\"Can you step off?\" Emira asks him; \"I think you're gonna want this filmed,\" he says.) and Emira has to call Peter Chamberlain to come and reassure the guard. \"He's an old white guy,\" she says, \"so I'm sure everyone will feel better.\" She's right; they do. Over the course of the following months, the tensions between Emira and the Chamberlains rise due to several factors that have very little to do with Emira herself. Alix, the novel's other main character \u2014 and foil, and sometimes antagonist \u2014 is a semi-successful businesswoman who has made a career out of writing letters requesting free stuff from companies and getting what she asks for. She also breastfed Briar while speaking at a panel once, an act of have-it-all-feminism that garnered lots of attention. What happened to Emira at the store has Alix consumed with (white) guilt, especially since the egg thrown through the window came with a cry of \"racist,\" aimed at Peter, a news anchor, who said, during a feel-good human interest segment earlier that night, that he hoped a black boy taking a white girl to Homecoming had \"asked her father first.\" This is a book that will read, I suspect, quite differently to various audiences \u2014 funny to some, deeply uncomfortable and shamefully recognizable to others. Emira and Alix have as much distance between them in terms of class as race. Emira comes from a working class family of driven, creative people, which is part of why she feels especially weird that she isn't ambitious in a particular direction. Alix's parents became very suddenly wealthy when she was a teenager, inducting her into a nouveau riche lifestyle she had no idea how to handle and which she is still uncomfortable with, despite having leaned further and further into upper-middle class affluence over the years. But what the two women do share \u2014 not in the way you'd expect \u2014 is Kelley Copeland, the tall, handsome, and seemingly woke white guy who thought Emira would want her encounter filmed. To share more of the plot would be to spoil the fun, as it were. This is a book that will read, I suspect, quite differently to various audiences \u2014 funny to some, deeply uncomfortable and shamefully recognizable to others \u2014 but whatever the experience, I urge you to read Such a Fun Age. Let its empathic approach to even the ickiest characters stir you, allow yourself to share Emira's millennial anxieties about adulting, take joy in the innocence of Briar's still-unmarred personhood, and rejoice that Kiley Reid is only just getting started.

It wasn't that long ago that House Democrats didn't know who would lead them. They were warring over the speaker's post just days after the 2018 midterm elections handed them back the majority. But Nancy Pelosi was certain of her fate. \"I intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\" Pelosi told reporters soon after the November elections. \"I happen to think at this point, I'm the best person for that.\" Pelosi became the first female House speaker in 2007 when Democrats last had control of the lower chamber. But many in her own party weren't so sure she could do it again: Pelosi was facing a Democratic rebellion in her ranks. Among the newly elected liberal wing of the freshman class, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the so-called \"squad\" withheld their support for Pelosi weeks ahead of the election. Some new, moderate members campaigned on ousting Pelosi from leadership. And along the way, some incumbent Democratic members joined their cause. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips was one of those freshman moderates looking for a new name at the top of the House chamber. And he told Pelosi that plan directly. \"I thought it was time for new leadership,\" Phillips said after a recent caucus meeting. But he changed gears after he got to Capitol Hill, saying these times called for someone who understood \"how the levers in this place operate.\" Now, Phillips says choosing Pelosi as speaker marks one of the most meaningful decisions in his political career. \"Thank goodness, thank goodness that we have Nancy Pelosi speaking for the House of Representatives,\" Phillips said, \"because I don't think there is a better, more qualified, more principled and more effective person for these times and these circumstances than she.\" Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton was one of the more public figures leading the rebellion against Pelosi. The third-term House Democrat was a key figure in a November 2018 letter signed by more than a dozen Democrats \u2014 including other incumbents \u2014 vowing new leadership. But Moulton's effort also faltered as Pelosi calmed the rebellion from the left and moderates and no heir apparent rose to challenge her. By the time of a closed-door, secret Nov. 28, 2018, caucus vote, Pelosi emerged claiming the nomination to ascend to her second term as speaker, this time under President Trump. \"It was inspiring to hear my colleagues place my name in nomination once again as speaker of the House,\" Pelosi said following the meeting. \"It has been my privilege to listen to new members ... members who have been here for a while, hear their views of how we go forward.\" During the public vote on the House floor in January, 220 Democrats voted for Pelosi. Only 12 Democrats \u2014 not enough to jeopardize the vote \u2014 voted against her. Now, Moulton joins others to rave about Pelosi's time at the helm this past year. \"She kept the party together through an incredibly contentious and difficult time,\" Moulton said from his office recently. \"The way I look at this, there's a time to vote for captain and there's a time to play on the same team, and right now, I'm very proud be on the same team as Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic party.\" A year like no other President Trump shakes hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as he arrives in the House chamber before giving his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in February.\n                \n                    \n                    Doug Mills/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump shakes hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as he arrives in the House chamber before giving his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in February. Pelosi began her new term as speaker in the midst of the longest government shutdown in history, which was triggered by a fight with Trump over border wall money. Quickly, Trump and Pelosi tangled over this and whether he could still deliver a Jan. 29 State of the Union address to Congress in the midst of a government shutdown. Pelosi didn't think so. \"She's afraid of the truth,\" Trump said in one of his classic barbs against Pelosi. The standoff ended with Trump calling for an executive order to fund the border wall through emergency funding. And the State of the Union was rescheduled for February. \"She runs circles as a strategist around pretty much everybody,\" said Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Pelosi ally. \"I think there were, for a while, some naysayers, and I think they're all probably denying it now that they ever were \u2014 because she is so universally recognized as so incredibly competent and smart and courageous.\" Under this new chapter, Democrats had a seat at the negotiation table in what had been a Republican-dominated administration, giving them new leverage in budget talks and oversight of President Trump. And from the earliest months of Pelosi's new term as speaker, she was dogged by questions about Trump and impeachment. In April, special counsel Robert Mueller released findings that the president obstructed an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. And the drumbeat in her caucus calling for impeachment grew. But Pelosi resisted, saying impeachment needed to have support from Republicans and the public. \"I don't think there's anything more divisive we can do than to impeach a president of the United States, and so you have to handle it with great care,\" she said during an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at the Council for Foreign Relations. \"It has to be about the truth and the facts to take you to whatever decision has to be there. It should by no means be done politically.\" But all of that changed when a whistleblower came forward to claim that the president was pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival in exchange for U.S. military aid. \"This case has a national security piece to it that is very alarming,\" Pelosi told NPR days ahead of her Sept. 24 announcement to trigger a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump. She later added, a \"president should be indicted, if he's committed a wrongdoing \u2014 any president. There is nothing, anyplace, that says the president should not be indicted.\" Once Pelosi was on board, she led her party through a contentious process that ended with the impeachment of the third sitting president in history. A fight with the president Over the year, Pelosi proved to be Trump's most formidable challenger in Washington, D.C., her supporters say. That moment was captured visually during an October White House meeting where Pelosi was pictured standing up to Trump and pointing. Trump shared the photo in an angry tweet, but Pelosi's team quickly used it as a cover photo for her social media accounts. Later, Pelosi explained she was telling the president that \"all roads lead to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\" Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown! pic.twitter.com/RDeUI7sfe7 Schakowsky, the Pelosi ally, says that moment showed her grit. And it wasn't a surprise, either. She's \"the one person \u2014 of course, the only woman, too \u2014 to stand up to him in the [White House] and point to the president of the United States and take him to task,\" Schakowsky added. Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, another Pelosi ally, said she's grateful for Pelosi's support after the loss of her husband. The late Michigan Rep. John Dingell died earlier this year after complications from prostate cancer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to Rep.

Debbie Dingell in the Capitol on Dec. 19. \"When they told me it would probably be a matter of a few days, she was supportive and emotionally, just a friend,\" Dingell recently said, her voice shaking as she recalled the memory. \"And yet, when he died and I was feeling overwhelmed, she put that backbone in me and helped me focus and make the decisions.\" Dingell said that's classic Pelosi. \"She knows what's she got to be, what she's got to do and when she's got to tell you 'got to stand up tall and do what you've got to do,' \" she said. \"She's a very effective woman.\" Pelosi came to Dingell's defense recently after Trump attacked her late husband at a Dec. 18 political rally just after he had been impeached. That night, Trump implied John Dingell might be \"looking up\" from hell. \"The president clearly is insecure when it comes to statespersons, whether it was [the late Arizona Republican Sen.] John McCain,\" Pelosi told reporters, and \"now John Dingell.\" The comments came in the midst of a historic week for Pelosi and House Democrats. They also reached agreements for a major trade deal and a massive bipartisan spending package. Both were approved in the last legislative week of 2019 as the impeachment articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Trump. The moves are a testament to Pelosi's leadership, Dingell notes. \"She took one of the most diverse caucuses in the history of this country \u2014 people with lots of intense, strong, emotional passions, different thoughts \u2014 and brought us together,\" she said. Even though impeachment helped bring her caucus together, Pelosi has rejected that will be her legacy. At a Dec. 6 CNN town hall, Pelosi stressed that she hopes she'll be remembered for how she got a major health care bill passed. \"I want to be remembered as part of the Affordable Care Act,\" she said.

But even in the midst of this year's accomplishments, partisan battles remain. Pelosi has said she won't name House managers to transmit the articles of impeachment to trigger a Senate trial. She was defending arguments in her caucus that by immediately moving the articles it would aid Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in their plans to exonerate Trump in a quick trial. It's a new stalemate, but this time, Pelosi has already extended an invitation so Trump can deliver the State of the Union Feb. 4. \"In their great wisdom, our Founders crafted a Constitution based on a system of separation of powers: three co-equal branches acting as checks on each other,\" Pelosi wrote to Trump. \"To ensure that balance of powers, the Constitution calls for the President to 'from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.' \" In the coming year, Pelosi will have her hands full keeping her caucus together. They'll head into another round of fights with Trump and his Republican allies in the midst of a partisan national election in 2020. How that plays out could determine whether she'll remain speaker.",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, listens during an impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (right), speaks as Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, listens during an impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 21. Updated at 7:02 p.m. ET The White House pursued a \"months-long effort\" involving top officials to extract concessions from Ukraine's government aimed at helping President Trump's reelection in 2020, House Democrats charged in a new report. The final report from their impeachment inquiry summarized their view of the Ukraine affair on Tuesday after Republicans opened the bidding with a salvo of their own on Monday defending Trump. Read the Democrats' impeachment report here. Tuesday's document completes what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the fact-finding phase of the impeachment inquiry and now could clear the way for the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment \u2014 if that's what Democrats decide. As expected, the committee voted to adopt the report on a party-line vote Tuesday evening. The committee has two days to incorporate any \"minority views\" submitted by the Republicans on the panel and then it will transmit the report to the House Judiciary Committee. Schiff restated complaints that Trump has frustrated his efforts to find out all the facts about the Ukraine affair, including by withholding documents and witnesses, but Schiff told NPR on Tuesday the \"grave risk to the country\" posed by Trump's presidency means the House can't wait for every last fact. Democrats' report also includes new details about the way Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee and a key ally of Trump, may have been involved at an early stage in the saga. Investigators uncovered records showing phone calls from Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Nunes at a time when Giuliani was trying to spread a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Records also showed phone calls from Giuliani to the White House and with Lev Parnas, a business associate facing federal charges in connection with alleged campaign finance violations in New York City. Schiff didn't address a question from NPR on Tuesday about whether he thought Nunes should have recused himself from the Ukraine matter but said he thought the discoveries about Nunes' contacts with Giuliani were troubling. \"It is deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there may be members of Congress complicit in that activity,\" Schiff said. The report Democrats' report is divided into two sections \u2014 one on what the report calls the \"scheme\" of the Ukraine affair and one on obstruction. The report argues that the \"scheme\" was conducted with the \"knowledge and approval\" of senior administration figures including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. No specific articles of impeachment or impeachable offenses are named in the report; responsibility for the legislation of impeachment rests with the House Judiciary Committee. Its chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., has convened an open hearing on Wednesday. Democrats' report describes how Trump set into motion a plan to squeeze President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conditioning engagement with him and about $391 million in U.S. assistance on commitments by Zelenskiy to launch investigations that Trump wanted. The White House froze the assistance for a time this year but ultimately released it; Zelenskiy didn't commit to the investigations that he had discussed with Trump and intermediaries. Democrats say the story is an abuse of power that should put Trump in peril of losing his office. The White House mocked the report and Democrats. \"Chairman Schiff's report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing,\" said press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Republican defenders argue that the full picture shows there was no improper exchange in the Ukraine matter and the president shouldn't be impeached. The minority report Nunes detailed that case in a minority report released on Monday evening \u2014 the latest example of dueling documents between Republicans and Democrats on the intelligence panel. Nunes' new report summarized Republicans' arguments that Trump was within his authority to act in the way he did; that Democrats haven't proved that Trump committed \"bribery\" or any other impeachable crime, as charged; and that Democrats are simply acting out of partisan animus. \"The fundamental disagreement apparent in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry is a difference of world views and a discomfort with President Trump's policy decisions,\" Nunes' report said. Nunes and his colleagues also underscored during Schiff's open impeachment hearings that aid for Ukraine, although frozen, was never cut off and Zelenskiy never committed to any investigations. Uneasiness in Kyiv Zelenskiy explained to interviewers this week the difficult position in which he found himself. The Ukrainian president said he wanted to accommodate Trump, but do so appropriately, while continuing the military and other assistance Ukraine needs to continue to fight Russian and Russian-backed forces after their invasion of 2014. \"Look, I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,\" Zelenskiy told Time magazine and other news organizations. He continued: \"That's not my thing. ... I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\" Trump called Zelenskiy's remarks a vindication, and Republicans also have cited Zelenskiy's earlier comments \u2014 including that he never felt \"pressured\" by Trump \u2014 because they say it's evidence that nothing improper occurred. Impeachment train keeps rolling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and majority Democrats in the House say Trump was, in effect, caught in the act of using his official powers to benefit himself politically. That's inappropriate, they argue, and Congress had no recourse but to launch the impeachment inquiry given the gravity of the acts. Nadler announced a panel of law school witnesses that he said will help lawmakers understand the historic and constitutional grounds for impeachment. Democrats invited Trump to participate, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone made clear that the administration still considers the process baseless and unfair. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., also faulted Nadler on Monday for how late Democrats had announced their witnesses and how recklessly Collins said the majority was moving \u2014 at once speeding along but also not affording fairness or clarity to Republicans. Republicans and the public get only about one day to review Schiff's report before the Nadler hearing is scheduled to convene on Wednesday. \"For the first time in history, this committee will weigh impeachment without any evidence for us to review. Any discussion with the yet-to-be identified witnesses will, therefore, be in the abstract,\" Collins wrote to Nadler. Republicans continued to plan their defense on Tuesday. A coterie of top Trump Republican allies in the House \u2014 including Collins, Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, John Ratcliffe of Texas and others \u2014 met with Vice President Pence at Pence's office in the Senate. The White House is pleased with what it has seen and it wants more, Ratcliffe said. \"Just going to keep doing the things we have been doing,\" he said of Pence's message. Democrats at another crossroads Pelosi and her lieutenants have said impeachment isn't a foregone conclusion but must be the result of the ongoing process in Congress. That's one reason they have declined to give a timetable by which they hope their work would be complete, because they argue that although they want to work as quickly as possible, the job must be done right. Impeachment is the equivalent of a grand jury indictment \u2014 a statement by the House that it believes there's sufficient evidence for a trial in the Senate over whether Trump keeps his office. Republicans control the Senate, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said he thinks it is \"inconceivable\" that the sufficient 20 Republicans would side with Democrats to remove the president. Schiff and others have argued that all they can do is what's within their power in the House and that if impeachment serves to deter a future president from the kind of activity in which Trump has engaged, it was worth doing. Nadler also asked \u2014 in response to Cipollone's letter \u2014 why an administration that says it has done nothing wrong isn't taking part or cooperating with lawmakers' requests for information about the Ukraine affair. \"The American people deserve transparency,\" Nadler said. The chairman continued: \"If the president thinks [his call with Zelenskiy] was 'perfect' and there is nothing to hide, then he would turn over the thousands of pages of documents requested by Congress, allow witnesses to testify instead of blocking testimony with baseless privilege claims, and provide any exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.\" NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales and Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep contributed to this report.",

House Democrats crossed the Rubicon this week and committed, for the record, to their impeachment inquiry. Although they said impeachment isn't a foregone conclusion, they tried to underscore again that this is serious. Meanwhile, more confirmations of the facts of the Ukraine affair meant the end of the investigation process may now be in view \u2014 and public hearings could be coming next. Here's what you need to know about the events of a historic week in Washington and what may be around the corner. Lt. Col. Vindman and Mr. Morrison House investigators heard from two more witnesses who confirmed the underlying facts of the Ukraine story: President Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that he believed would help him in the 2020 election. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and, later, Timothy Morrison \u2014 two top White House policy officials \u2014 are believed to have told investigators about the parallel foreign policy being run by Rudy Giuliani; the use of hand-picked diplomats, including the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland; and the discomfiture of career professionals about what was taking place. Both men listened to Trump's now-famous July 25 phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Their subjective impressions about what they observed, however, were different. Vindman said he thought almost immediately that what he had heard was problematic. He pushed for Trump to reinstate the military assistance to Ukraine during the time it was frozen and also for the White House to restore terms that Vindman remembered Trump using, including references to the investigation that Trump wanted into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. Morrison told House investigators he didn't think Trump had done anything illegal, but he opposed the Ukraine pressure strategy on its merits because it helped Russia \u2014 and he also realized that there would be political blowback both in Kyiv and Washington if details of the call were revealed. The vote Meanwhile, the House voted on Thursday to make its impeachment inquiry formal. The measure passed 232 to 196 with no Republican support. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the impeachment inquiry. Trump and Republicans had complained that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement about an inquiry didn't carry the same legal weight as an actual vote and, accordingly, it was illegitimate. That was one reason why White House counsel Pat Cipollone vowed that the administration would not cooperate with witnesses or evidence. But that firewall hasn't stopped several current administration witnesses. The House vote also didn't change the minds of Republicans either. They rejected the framework set out in the legislation as still too unfair to them and the due process they say they and Trump are owed. 'Legitimate actions' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also offered a substantive defense of Trump. In a floor speech opposing the impeachment inquiry, McCarthy said that Democrats were abusing \"secret process and selective leaks to portray the president's legitimate actions as an impeachable offense.\" Translation: Trump had the power and was within his rights to expect concessions from Ukraine in the way he did and should not be impeached, for McCarthy. Other supporters, including Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, have reached that conclusion by traveling a different route, arguing that although they believe Trump's actions weren't appropriate, the president shouldn't be impeached. Pelosi, who arrived late to Democrats' impeachment bandwagon, was unfazed. \"This is a solemn occasion,\" she said. \"The times have found every one of us in this room.\" Trump, in her telling, has abused his powers so badly and rejected Congress so flagrantly that, for Pelosi, the House has no alternative but to consider impeachment. Then she said something important: \"That decision has not been made ... that is what this inquiry will determine.\" Collision course Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate appear to expect an old-fashioned impeachment; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has circulated plans for how an eventual trial might run later this year, as NPR's Susan Davis and Claudia Grisales reported. The concession by Pelosi this week, however, holds open the possibility that she and Democrats might wave off before they got there. Impeachment is an indictment by the House that would spark a trial in the Senate. The upper chamber is controlled by McConnell and the president's allies, and unless there's a major change in the political atmosphere, Trump seems likely to be acquitted and keep his office. That's why Trump and supporters have long calculated that impeachment might wind up being a political asset for them. The Trump campaign says impeachment is already helping its fundraising. Democrats can see this situation as clearly as anyone else. That's why it was telling that Pelosi said Thursday that impeachment isn't necessarily automatic. All she has done is commit the chamber to an inquiry. If the political headwinds pick up, it raises the possibility that Democrats might try to find some other outcome besides a Senate trial in which Trump prevails. Going active If Pelosi and her lieutenants have been encouraged by public polls that suggest support from many Americans \u2014 albeit almost no Republicans \u2014 the final test may come after the next phase in the inquiry. Democrats have invited another slate of White House witnesses for closed-door depositions next week, including former national security adviser John Bolton. They may not appear, citing Cipollone's instructions not to cooperate. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has also been invited, but his department says he will not participate. There may not be many more closed-door sessions, and instead, Democrats may prepare to shift from the inside game to the outside game. For one thing, investigators are expected to release hundreds of pages worth of depositions, like those from Vindman, Morrison and many others. Democrats also are expected to convene open hearings in which some witnesses who've already testified, including, potentially, Ambassador William Taylor, could tell their stories in the open. Republicans would have some privileges in these proceedings, including the ability to call witnesses of their own with the assent of the committee chairman. The impeachment inquiry resolution also directs the publication of a final report about the committees' findings, which likely would form the basis for any eventual articles of impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over that legislation and that process, as NPR's Deirdre Walsh wrote, and it would be under the aegis of its chairman, Jerry Nadler of New York, that impeachment could move to the House floor and a final vote. McConnell has said that if he receives impeachment articles from the House, the Senate will convene a trial as designated under the Constitution. The trial The 100 members of the Senate would be the jury; they would be expected to sit in their seats without speaking \u2014 a spectacle rarely glimpsed \u2014 while impeachment managers from the House made the case for and against removing Trump. John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, would preside and manage the byplay on the Senate floor as his predecessor, William Rehnquist, did when President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. So far, so familiar. And if present dynamics hold, Trump, like Clinton, would be acquitted and preserve his office. If the Senate were to vote to remove Trump, however, Washington would go from an already seldom-seen practice in impeachment and truly sail off the map completely.",

Lawyers for McGahn appeared in federal court on Thursday in a dispute over whether he will have to sit for questions from House investigators conducting the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption White House counsel Don McGahn in September. Lawyers for McGahn appeared in federal court on Thursday in a dispute over whether he will have to sit for questions from House investigators conducting the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. A federal judge on Thursday fired skeptical questions at lawyers for the Trump administration who argued that current and former senior White House aides have \"absolute immunity\" from being questioned by House impeachment investigators. The hearing, before U.S. District Judge Ketanji Jackson in Washington, was the first time Trump lawyers tested in open court their attempt to block White House aides from cooperating with the impeachment inquiry into the president. Jackson at times struggled with the Trump administration's argument that former White House counsel Don McGahn does not have to comply with a subpoena filed by House Democrats for him to sit for testimony related to conversations he was party to that could implicate Trump in possible articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice. \"So what does the separation of powers mean to you then?\" Jackson asked Trump administration lawyers. \"How can the legislature actively exert its oversight power unless it has the ability to exercise its investigative powers?\" James Burnham, a lawyer with the Justice Department, responded that applying \"absolute immunity\" to current and former aides close to the Oval Office is \"not an exotic thing that we just cooked up.\" Burnham said it has been the legal position of the White House for decades so that information covered by executive privilege will not be exposed. Jackson sounded incredulous at this line of argument, noting the difficulty in enforcing it given the number of White House aides who have cycled through the Trump administration. The judge said Trump does not invoke that concern when former White House staff appear on cable news. \"For some reason, the president doesn't own it when former officials appear on MSNBC,\" Jackson said. House attorney Doug Letter, who previously spent decades working in the Department of Justice, said the Trump administration \"made up\" the concept that all senior Trump aides have an absolute shield from any kind of testimony. \"This is what they wish the law were. It is not what the law is,\" Letter said. He said it may be the current position of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, but those opinions change with administrations and sometimes conflicting opinions exist at once. More importantly, Letter said, a Justice Department legal opinion should not persuade a federal court. \"It's interesting like a law review article is interesting, but it's not binding on you or Congress,\" Letter said to the judge. In August, months before the current impeachment inquiry was officially launched, McGahn was subpoenaed to sit for questions related to his role in the Mueller report on interference in the 2016 election. McGahn told Mueller investigators that Trump had pushed him to fire Mueller and then create a paper trail to cover it up. McGahn never acted on Trump's wishes, but the House saw the interactions as possible acts of obstruction of justice. Even now, though, with the impeachment inquiry focused on a July 25 call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, House leadership says findings in the Mueller report, including McGahn's possible testimony of Trump obstruction, could cause additional articles of impeachment. Democrats filed a lawsuit to force McGahn to comply with the subpoena. Justice Department lawyers said the dispute does not belong in the courts at all. Burnham said that when the judiciary gets in the middle of a fight between two political branches of government, faith in the courts is undermined. Jackson balked. \"How will they resolve it on their own then, sending the sergeant-at-arms to arrest Mr. McGahn?\" she asked. \"I thought that is what the court's role was,\" Jackson said. \"To decide what the law is.\" The outcome of the McGahn lawsuit has implication for other potential witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, which is now probing whether Trump abused his office by making hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance contingent on Ukraine opening an investigation that would help Trump's 2020 reelection bid. On Thursday, the House formally passed a measure approving the inquiry. Jackson said she plans to rule in the coming weeks. Another former top White House aide, Charles Kupperman, had a hearing on Thursday centered on a nearly identical issue just down the hall from the courtroom drama in the McGahn case. Kupperman, once the deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, is also being summoned by House impeachment investigators but has not appeared. Lawyers for Kupperman filed a lawsuit seeking to clarify whether he must show up for questioning. Charles Cooper, a Kupperman lawyer, said the House subpoena and order from the White House to ignore it places his client in a difficult position. \"It's a classic Catch-22 here,\" Cooper said. \"And my guy is caught in the middle of it.\" But Todd Tatelman, a lawyer for the House of Representatives, was not buying Kupperman's supposed plight, saying the suit \"serves no other purpose than to attempt to delay the impeachment inquiry,\" adding that it is tantamount to \"a miscarriage of justice.\" U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon set Dec. 10 as the date for oral arguments in the Kupperman case. He rejected a request from the Justice Department to allow more time to prepare, mentioning that the issues involved are urgent and need to be resolved quickly. \"Roll your sleeves up,\" Leon told the Justice Department lawyers. \"And get the job done.\"",

He served in Kyiv from 2014-2017 and then as special adviser for Ukraine negotiations through July 12, 2019. In his prepared opening statement obtained by NPR, Anderson says senior officials at the White House blocked State Department officials from releasing a statement that would have condemned Russia's action in Ukraine in November 2018. Anderson also describes a June 13 meeting in which national security adviser John Bolton \"cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.\" Read the statement below: Opening Statement of Christopher J. Anderson to the House of Representatives  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on Oversight and Reform October 30, 2019 Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide this statement today.  I have served as a Foreign Service Officer in the State Department since 2005.  I have spent most of my career serving in countries on the periphery of the Russian Federation including Mongolia, Armenia, and, most recently, Ukraine.  For the last five years, I have worked in Kyiv and Washington to advance our national security interests by promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, countering Russian aggression, and defending the principles that international borders should not be changed by force.  It has been a privilege to serve our country and promote our national interests on such an important foreign policy issue while working alongside dedicated and talented public servants.  These efforts have benefited from strong bipartisan support. My work in Ukraine began with a three-week temporary duty to Kyiv in  March 2014 just after Russia invaded and occupied Crimea.  I returned to Kyiv in  September 2014 to serve as the External Unit Chief in the Political Section of our Embassy.  I served in Kyiv from 2014\u20132017 and worked closely with Ambassador Yovanovitch from 2015\u20132017. In August 2017 Ambassador Volker asked me to serve as Special Advisor for Ukraine Negotiations.  I served in this position from late August 2017 until July 12, 2019.  In this role, I helped develop negotiating positions, analyzed Russian and Ukrainian ceasefire proposals, and provided context on the history of the conflict and past negotiations.  I also traveled with Ambassador Volker to the front lines of the conflict, to negotiate with the Russians, and to meet with European counterparts. On November 25, 2018, Russia escalated the conflict further when its forces openly attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels heading to a Ukrainian port in the Sea of Azov.  While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued.  Ambassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia's actions, which I posted to his account. In December 2018, Ambassador Volker and I traveled to Brussels to meet with EU officials and key NATO Allies to push for a more assertive European response to Russia's escalation.  During this visit, we met with Ambassador Sondland, who hosted a lunch bringing together key EU officials for a discussion on coordinating our response to Russia's escalation. When Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected president in April, Ambassador Volker and I were hopeful that a newly empowered Ukrainian president could reinitiate high-level U.S. engagement.  Before the inauguration in May, my colleagues and I saw a tweet by Rudolph Giuliani alleging that President-elect Zelenskyy was surrounded by enemies of President Trump.  In an effort to counter the negative narrative sparked by Ambassador Yovanovitch's withdrawal and Giuliani's statements, we pushed for a high-level delegation to attend Zelenskyy's inauguration.  Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, NSC Director Alexander Vindman, and Senator Ron Johnson, traveled to Kyiv as part of a Presidential delegation for the inauguration. After the delegation returned, the participants wanted to brief the President on the trip.  Ambassador Sondland was able to quickly arrange a meeting with the President for May 23.  I participated in the preparatory meeting at the White House in which we discussed key deliverables that would demonstrate President Zelenskyy's commitment to reform.  We focused on three key areas: 1) demonstrating Zelenskyy's independence from powerful vested interests and pursuing anticorruption reform as well as antitrust reform; 2) strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian energy cooperation; and 3) improving our bilateral security relationship which included Ukraine increasing its purchases of key U.S. military equipment. Ambassador Volker told me after the meeting that the President had agreed to invite President Zelenskyy to the White House for a meeting and would issue a letter shortly.  The President signed a letter on May 29 that included an invitation for President Zelenskyy, but the letter did not include a specific date for the visit. On June 13, I accompanied Ambassador Volker to a meeting with National Security Advisor John Bolton.  In that meeting, Bolton stated that he agreed with our three lines of effort and that he also supported increased senior White House engagement.  However, he cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.  He did suggest that perhaps the Vice President would be available to travel to Toronto to meet with President Zelenskyy in early July at the Ukraine Reform Conference that the Canadian government was hosting.  We later learned that the Vice President would not attend the conference.  The morning after the meeting, I sent a brief message to Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent summarizing the meeting and relaying NSA Bolton's message about Mr. Giuliani.  I sent around a more formal summary later that day to my State Department colleagues. On June 18, Secretary Perry hosted a follow-up meeting at the Department of Energy to discuss how to move forward on these three key areas.  In preparation for that meeting, colleagues in different offices in the State Department, the Department of Energy, and our missions in Kyiv and Brussels worked to develop a joint list of policy outcomes that would demonstrate Zelenskyy's commitment to reform and improve the bilateral U.S.-Ukraine relationship. In the meeting at the Department of Energy on June 18, there was broad agreement on the interagency framework regarding policy deliverables.  There were some initial discussions about how to delineate the lines of effort among the Department of Energy, the State Department, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Taylor (who joined by phone from Kyiv).  There was also general agreement that it would be important to schedule a White House visit quickly, even if the actual date of the visit was after the Ukrainian parliamentary elections.  There were some vague discussions in the meeting about how to address Mr. Giuliani's continued calls for a corruption investigation.  After the meeting I spoke with Ambassador Taylor in a phone call to discuss the atmospherics of the meeting and next steps.  We agreed on the importance of not calling for any specific investigations, but otherwise agreed the three lines of effort were useful. Ambassador Volker then led a delegation to the Ukraine Reform Conference in Toronto July 1\u20132.  We met with several Ukrainian officials including President Zelenskyy.  In the meeting, President Zelenskyy highlighted progress in some of the key areas we had identified and pushed for a date for a White House visit.  Volker urged him to schedule a call with President Trump in order to start building a relationship and thereby increase the chance of securing a date for the White House visit. I was scheduled to complete my assignment as Special Advisor for Ukraine Negotiations on July 12, 2019.  In the few remaining days of my assignment, I continued to push my Ukrainian counterparts for concrete progress in key reform areas.  The Ukrainians remained focused on scheduling a White House visit\u2014seeing such a visit as a critical step in empowering Zelenskyy in his negotiations with the Russians.  My last day with Ambassador Volker was July 12.  Catherine Croft was my successor. In closing, I want to reiterate that my colleagues and I in the Foreign Service are non-partisan and advance the foreign policy set by our duly elected leaders.  I take that commitment as well as my oath to defend the Constitution seriously.  Working abroad to advance the interest of the United States has at times led to harassment and intimidation by hostile intelligence services, death threats, and other significant challenges for my family and I.  I have accepted these burdens because I believe we are advancing a cause greater than ourselves and are working to promote the general welfare.

Croft to the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on Oversight and ReformOctober 30, 2019 Thank you for the opportunity to provide my statement today. For the last nine years, it has been my honor to serve my country as aForeign Service Officer. In that capacity, it has been a privilege to serve alongside colleagues of intelligence, integrity, and determination to advance U.S. interests, some of whom have already spoken to this committee. I am not sure that I have anything to add to the testimony of those who have come before me, but I will answer your questions to the best of my ability. My work on Ukraine started in 2013, when I was posted to the U.S. Mission to NATO. My portfolio included NATO-Ukraine relations when the citizens of Ukraine took to the streets to demand a European future and an end to corruption. When Russian tanks rolled into Crimea, I was assigned to NATO headquarters in Brussels. At the time, we did not know where those tanks would stop. Russia's aggression in Ukraine posed, and continues to pose, a real and immediate threat to our national interest in a Europe free, whole, and at peace. My firm belief in the importance of Ukraine's future to U.S. national interests led me to the Ukraine Desk. From August 2015 to July 2017, I was one of several Ukraine Desk Officers at State Department headquarters. In my portfolio, I focused on security assistance, arms sales, and defense reform. But like all desk officers, my work also included supporting efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine and holding leadership accountable for a lack of high-level prosecutions. In July 2017, as the Trump Administration was considering overturning the ban on providing Ukraine defensive weapons, I was asked to join the National Security Council Staff at the White House. As the Director covering Ukraine, I staffed the President's December 2017 decision to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missile systems. I also staffed his September 2017 meeting with then- President Poroshenko on the margins of the UN General Assembly. Throughout both, I heard \u2014 directly and indirectly \u2014 President Trump describe Ukraine as a corrupt country. During my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired. He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \"Obama holdover\" and associated with George Soros. It was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch. I documented these calls and told my boss, Fiona Hill, and George Kent, who was in Kyiv at the time. I am not aware of any action that was taken in response. I left the NSC in July 2018 and started studying Arabic at the Foreign Service Institute in preparation for a tour in Baghdad. That plan was cut short in May 2019, when I was asked to take over as Ambassador Volker's Advisor. I spent the month of June embedded in our Embassy in Kyiv to prepare and then spent the week of July 8 overlapping with my predecessor, Christopher Anderson. That week was the first time I became aware that Ambassador Volker was in touch with Rudolph Giuliani. However, Ambassador Volker's conversations with Giuliani were separate from my work, and I was generally unaware of when they spoke or what they spoke about. I have never had contact with Rudolph Giuliani. On July 18, I participated in a sub-Policy Coordination Committee video conference where an OMB representative reported that the White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine. The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the President. I had heard about the hold before that date, but do not remember the specific date. During the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy, I was traveling with Ambassador Volker in Kyiv. I did not listen in on the call. I accompanied Ambassador Volker in meetings with Ukrainian officials and to the Line of Contact between Ukrainian armed forces and the Russia-led forces in eastern Ukraine. The only readout I got of July 25 call was based on what President Zelenskyy told Ambassadors Volker, Taylor, and Sondland about the call at a meeting on July 26. The focus of the call, as I understood it, was to schedule a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. We hoped that such a meeting would help undo President Trump's long-held view of Ukraine as a corrupt country. Since July, my sole focus has been supporting efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy's election and his mandate to tackle corruption ignited new energy into stalled talks. Right now, even as Ukrainians face casualties nearly every day in defense of their own territory against Russian aggression, the sides are making progress disengaging at key crossing points.Zelenskyy has shown a willingness to take political risk to bring Russia back to the table. His best chance at success is with our support along with our European partners. It is my hope that even as this Committee's process plays out, we do not lose sight of what is happening in Ukraine and its great promise as a prosperous and democratic member of the European community.

Background I have dedicated my entire professional life to the United States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army. As an infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and a deployment to Iraq for combat operations. In Iraq, I was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. Since 2008, I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in Eurasia. In this role, I have served in the United States' embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., I was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs where I authored the principle strategy for managing competition with Russia. In July 2018, I was asked to serve at the National Security Council. The privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit here, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant. My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream. I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics. For over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations. Introduction Before recounting my recollection of various events under investigation, I want to clarify a few issues. I am appearing today voluntarily pursuant to a subpoena and will answer all questions to the best of my recollection. I want the Committees to know I am not the whistleblower who brought this issue to the CIA and the Committees' attention. I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower. Also, as I will detail herein, I did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command. As an active duty military officer, the command structure is extremely important to me. On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities. I believe that any good military officer should and would do the same, thus providing his or her best advice to leadership. Furthermore, in performing my coordination role as a Director on the National Security Council, I provided readouts of relevant meetings and communications to a very small group of properly cleared national security counterparts with a relevant need-to-know. My Service on the National Security Council When I joined the White House's National Security Council (\"NSC\"), I reported to Dr. Fiona Hill, who in turn reported to John Bolton, the National Security Advisor. My role at the NSC includes developing, coordinating, and executing plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic national security issues for the countries in my portfolio, which includes Ukraine. In my position, I coordinate with a superb cohort of inter-agency partners. I regularly prepare internal memoranda, talking points, and other materials for the National Security Advisor and senior staff. Most of my interactions relate to national security issues and are therefore especially sensitive. I would urge the Committees to carefully balance the need for information against the impact that disclosure would have on our foreign policy and national security. I have never had direct contact or communications with the President. The Geopolitical Importance of Ukraine Since 2008, Russia has manifested an overtly aggressive foreign policy, leveraging military power and employing hybrid warfare to achieve its objectives of regional hegemony and global influence. Absent a deterrent to dissuade Russia from such aggression, there is an increased risk of further confrontations with the West. In this situation, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a frontline state and a bulwark against Russian aggression. In spite of being under assault from Russia for more than five years, Ukraine has taken major steps towards integrating with the West. The U.S. government policy community's view is that the election of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the promise of reforms to eliminate corruption will lock in Ukraine's Western-leaning trajectory, and allow Ukraine to realize its dream of a vibrant democracy and economic prosperity. Given this perspective and my commitment to advancing our government's strategic interests, I will now recount several events that occurred. Relevant Events When I joined the NSC in July 2018, I began implementing the administration's policy on Ukraine. In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency. This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy. While my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine's prospects, this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine. April 21, 2019: President Trump Calls Ukraine President Zelenskyy On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected President of Ukraine in a landslide victory. President Zelenskyy was seen as a unifying figure within the country. He was the first candidate to win a majority in every region of the country, breaking the claims that Ukraine would be subject to a perpetual divide between the Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking populations. President Zelenskyy ran on a platform of unity, reform, and anti-corruption, which resonated with the entire country. In support of U.S. policy objectives to support Ukrainian sovereignty, President Trump called President Zelenskyy on April 21, 2019. I was one of several staff and officers who listened to the call. The call was positive, and President Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelenskyy and extended an invitation to visit the White House. May 21, 2019: Inauguration Delegation Goes to Ukraine On May 21, 2019, I was directed by Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill to join the delegation attending President Zelenkskyy's inauguration. When the delegation returned, they provided a debriefing to President Trump and explained their positive assessment of President Zelenskyy and his team. I did not participate in the debriefing. Oleksandr Danylyuk Visit \u2013 July 10, 2019 On July 10, 2019, Oleksandr Danylyuk, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council for Ukraine, visited Washington, D.C. for a meeting with National Security Advisor Bolton. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland also attended, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The meeting proceeded well until the Ukrainians broached the subject of a meeting between the two presidents. The Ukrainians saw this meeting as critically important in order to solidify the support of their most important international partner. Amb. Sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short. Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma. I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push. Dr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate. Following the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC's lead counsel. Dr. Hill also reported the incident to the NSC's lead counsel. Election Call \u2013 July 25, 2019 On July 21, 2019, President Zelenskyy's party won Parliamentary elections in a landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelenskyy to congratulate him. On July 25, 2019, the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President. As the transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what was said. I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC's lead counsel. Conclusion The United States and Ukraine are and must remain strategic partners, working together to realize the shared vision of a stable, prosperous, and democratic Ukraine that is integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Our partnership is rooted in the idea that free citizens should be able to exercise their democratic rights, choose their own destiny, and live in peace. It has been a great honor to serve the American people and a privilege to work in the White House and on the National Security Council. I hope to continue to serve and advance America's national security interests. Thank you again for your consideration, and now I would be happy to answer your questions.",

            "article_content": "Some House Republicans spoke at a press conference Wednesday to oppose the impeachment inquiry before barging into a secure conference room and interrupting the testimony of a Pentagon official.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Some House Republicans spoke at a press conference Wednesday to oppose the impeachment inquiry before barging into a secure conference room and interrupting the testimony of a Pentagon official. President Trump outlined his Ukrainian pressure strategy directly to a top diplomat who was described as being charged with helping to execute it, another key diplomat told House investigators this week. Meanwhile, sources in the Ukrainian capital told two U.S. news agencies that Kyiv had been pressured directly about American assistance in the spring. So it was another big week in House Democrats' impeachment investigation of Trump and the Ukraine affair \u2014 and for Republicans' increasingly aggressive defense of the president. Here's what you need to know. Mr. Ambassador William Taylor, the acting boss of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Kyiv, told House investigators on Monday that he'd been told that Trump wanted to put Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \"in a public box.\" The testimony was closed-door, but his opening statement was obtained by some media outlets and confirmed by NPR. If Zelenskiy committed openly that he'd launch the investigations Trump wanted, in support of Trump's aims for the 2020 election, that would secure military assistance and engagement with Washington, Taylor said he'd learned. Taylor, a career foreign policy expert, did not want to go along \u2014 and said so, he told House investigators. Taylor protested to his compatriots, to then-national security adviser John Bolton and in writing in a cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Taylor's threat to quit, as revealed in text messages released in an earlier chapter of the Ukraine affair, was and remains real, he said. That account strengthened the public understanding that has already formed about the Trump pressure scheme for Ukraine, with a few important caveats. One was that Taylor said the way he learned about Trump's statements and intentions was from the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland \u2014 but Sondland had earlier told Congress that he didn't realize until later what he and other diplomats were doing. Per Taylor, Sondland wasn't on the outside helping with a scheme he didn't appreciate in real time. He was part of it, Taylor said. The discrepancies between Sondland's and Taylor's versions of events have prompted some Democrats to air the possibility of calling Sondland back, although it isn't clear yet whether he has formally been asked to return to the Capitol. New take from Kyiv Another discrepancy opened up this week between the existing public accounts of the U.S. pressure on Ukraine and what may have been taking place behind the scenes. The New York Times and The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that government sources in the Ukrainian capital said Washington pulsed Zelenskiy's camp directly about the need to accommodate Trump's desires or face a freeze-out. One meeting about this was convened as early as May, according to the AP report, well ahead of the now-famous July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a \"favor\" on the investigations. That AP report also would substantiate accounts given by an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint about the Ukraine affair helped animate the impeachment inquiry. In that report, the whistleblower describes learning that Zelenskiy and his camp had been primed before that call about the need to \"play ball\" with Trump, while acknowledging being unclear about who primed him and how. Compare these accounts to public statements by Zelenskiy that he never felt \"pressured,\" in the phrase of reporters' questions, and that he never was told that the U.S. was freezing military assistance for Ukraine in the expectation that he might reciprocate in the way Trump wanted. Zelenskiy's comments strengthened, for a time, the defense offered by the White House and its supporters that there was never any explicit tie between what was flowing from Washington and expected in return from Kyiv. But this week's testimony and press reports eroded that narrative, and if there are documents \u2014 Ukrainian or American \u2014 that verify that some American made a more or less direct statement to some Ukrainian about these matters, that would be key evidence for Democrats. The president's power Trump and his supporters also have responded to the criticism about the merits of the Ukraine policy being improper. The conduct of foreign policy is always and necessarily political, as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said, and all U.S. diplomats \u2014 like Sondland and Taylor \u2014 work for Trump. In short, this is how business is done, the argument goes; \"Get over it,\" Mulvaney said. Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker aired a different defense: Even conceding the possibility that Trump had overstepped his authority, there's no law or provision in the Constitution that has been violated. \"Abuse of power is not a crime,\" Whitaker said \u2014 and accordingly, impeachment is uncalled for. Foot soldiers and the ineptitude defense The defense of Trump wasn't limited to public statements. On Wednesday, after a press conference filled with condemnations of Democrats, a group of GOP lawmakers walked into the secure conference room where that day's deposition was taking place. That brought the proceedings to a halt for several hours; some of the members weren't authorized to be there and some of them were carrying their mobile phones, which are strictly forbidden in a sensitive compartmented information facility. That delayed the depositions with Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper \u2014 who handles Ukraine, Russia and Eastern European policy for the Pentagon \u2014 but her testimony eventually went ahead. So did Republicans' amplified advocacy for Trump, which included a new emphasis on Ukraine's failure to take the actions that Washington was requesting. U.S. military assistance was restored in early September without any public statement by Zelenskiy about investigations then or since. That means, as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters including NPR's Lexie Schapitl, there was no quo in exchange for the ostensible quid. Ukraine's government has said that it is \"auditing\" cases involving a gas company connected to the Trump pressure strategy, but that commitment appeared to stop short of the investigations that Trump requested. The Wall Street Journal picked up McCarthy's thread on Thursday with an editorial that echoed earlier defenses of the Russia imbroglio: Even if Trump and aides wanted a certain outcome, they might have bumbled in trying to achieve it \u2014 failing to commit a crime means there was no crime and, accordingly, no case for impeachment or removal. \"This matters because it may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it,\" as the Journal editorial board argued. \"Impeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most presidents at some point or another in office.\" Witness list House investigators' depositions are expected to resume on Saturday behind closed doors with another State Department diplomat, Philip Reeker. Next week, investigators have asked to hear from two officials on the national security council: Charles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser; and Tim Morrison, a top Russia and Eastern Europe policy specialist. One immediate next question about the impeachment inquiry is \"will they appear?\" Kupperman is no longer in the administration, and so it would be tougher for the White House to assert that his testimony might be shielded by executive privilege, the doctrine that allows an administration to conceal some of its internal workings. Then again, as a lifer within the Republican national security world, Kupperman might try to resist testifying out of solidarity and in view of the White House's objections to Democrats' inquiry. Morrison faces the same calculation and remains an active administration employee. White House counsel Pat Cipollone has declared that Democrats' impeachment inquiry is invalid and therefore the administration needn't cooperate with witnesses or documents. That has held with respect to Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, including two officials from the Office of Management and Budget who spurned Democrats' invitations. The next tests likely will be Kupperman and Morrison.",

Read his full opening statement below (bolding is in the original document). Opening Statement before the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform The Honorable Gordon D. SondlandU.S. Ambassador to the European UnionOctober 17, 2019 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. I was disappointed that the State Department prevented me, at the last minute, from testifying earlier on October 8, 2019. But your issuance of a subpoena has supported my appearance here today. I am pleased to provide the following testimony: First, let me say that it is an honor to serve the people of the United States as their Ambassador to the European Union. The U.S. Mission to the EU is the direct link between the United States and the 28 member EU countries, America's longest standing allies and one of the largest economic blocks in the world. A strong, united, and peaceful Europe helps to uphold the norms that maintain political stability and promote economic prosperity around the world. Second, I would like to thank my staff and the many dedicated public servants with whom I have the privilege to work every day. I have benefited immeasurably from their collective wisdom, experience, and hard work. Their patriotism serves as an example to all of us. Third, let me note that my goal today is to answer your questions directly and clearly, to the best of my knowledge. I have not shared this Opening Statement in advance with either the White House or the State Department. These are my own words. It is important to emphasize, at the outset, that I have had limited time to review the relevant facts in order to prepare for my testimony. I will do my utmost to answer the Committees' questions fully and truthfully, but the shortness of time is challenging. Let me also say that I have good friends from both sides of the aisle, many of whom have reached out to me to provide support. As we go through this process, I understand that some people may have their own specific agendas: some may want me to say things to protect the President at all costs; some may want me to provide damning facts to support the other side. But none of that matters to me. I have no interest in pursuing higher office or taking political shots. Simply put, I am NOT here to push an agenda. I am here to tell the truth. Personal Background I am a lifelong Republican. Like all of my political Ambassadorial colleagues, I am an appointee of the President and serve at the pleasure of the President. I also know that part affiliations are set aside when representing the United States. Having served on non-partisan commissions by the appointment of three Democratic governors and on the transition team for Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, another Democrat, I am well accustomed to working across the aisle. For example, I worked briefly with former Vice President Biden's office in connection with the Vice President's nationwide anti-cancer initiative and admire his long record of public service. I had bipartisan support for my ambassadorial nomination. My successful business background and results-oriented focus made me, in my view, well suited to bring the fresh perspective to U.S. foreign policy that President Trump had sought. UKRAINE PORTFOLIO As you know, I was confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan voice vote as Ambassador to the EU on June 28, 2018, and I assumed that role in Brussels on July 9, 2018. From my very first days as Ambassador, Ukraine has been a part of my broader work pursuing U.S. national interests. Ukraine's political and economic development are critical to the long-lasting stability of Europe. Moreover, the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, which began nearly five years ago, continues as one of the most significant security crises for Europe and the United States. As the U.S. Ambassador to the EU, I have always viewed my Ukraine work as central to advancing U.S.-EU foreign policy. Indeed, for decades, under both Republican and Democrat Administrations, the United States has viewed Ukraine with strategic importance, in part to counter Russian aggression in Europe and to support Ukraine energy independence. My involvement in issues concerning Ukraine, while a small part of my overall portfolio, was nevertheless central to my ambassadorial responsibilities. In this sense, Ukraine is similar to other non-EU countries, such as Venezuela, Iran, and Georgia, with respect to which my Mission and I coordinate closely with our EU partners to promote policies that reflect our common values and interests. I always endeavoured to keep my State Department and National Security Council colleagues informed of my actions and to seek their input. I understand that all my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo as my work was consistent with long-standing U.S. foreign policy objectives. Indeed, very recently, Secretary Pompeo sent me a congratulatory note that I was doing great work, and he encouraged me to keep banging away. KEY TIMELINE While I continue my work in Europe, here in Washington, there continues to be inaccurate and unsourced speculation regarding my work in Ukraine. To be helpful, as you frame your questions, let me share an outline of the facts: First, as Ambassador to the EU, my Ukraine portfolio began on Day One, from the very first briefing materials I received in the Summer of 2018. Although it did not consistently occupy a great deal of my time, involvement in Ukraine matters was considered by the career professionals who prepared my briefing materials to be an important part of my portfolio. On July 13, 2018, just four days after assuming my post, I received a delegation from the government of Ukraine at the U.S. Mission in Brussels. This meeting was sought by the thenUkraine government and, like most meetings, was proposed and arranged by career EU Mission staff. Following those initial contacts, I attended numerous meetings in Brussels and other locations in Europe during the Fall of 2018 to advance U.S. interests in Ukraine. These interests reflect a whole of government engagement, not just a narrow focus. We discussed economic development, energy independence, and security concerns regarding Russian aggression in Ukraine. From my position in Brussels, my goal has always been to facilitate and expedite the integration of Ukraine into the broader Western norms of Europe and the United States. To be clear, my role has been to support my colleagues in the State Department for whom Ukraine issues are a full-time job and to lend my voice when helpful. These professionals included first and foremost the Head of Mission, which at the start of my service was Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and, more recently, Charge de Affaires William Taylor and their Embassy staff. I worked with Ambassador Yovanovitch personally during my first official visit to Ukraine in February 2019, and I found her to be an excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics, the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and associated regional issues. She was a delight to work with during our visit to Odessa, Ukraine. I was never a part of any campaign to disparage or dislodge her, and I regretted her departure. Similarly, in my time working with Ambassador Taylor, I have found him to be an insightful, strategic, and effective representative of U.S. interests. He cares deeply about the future of Ukraine and is a dedicated public servant. The Ukraine Mission worked hand in hand with Special Envoy Kurt Volker, another experienced diplomat with a special remit to address the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Mr. Volker is an exemplary professional. I viewed my role as adding value to the broader efforts of the Ukraine team through my engagements with high level leadership in Brussels and Washington. During my first official trip to Ukraine on February 26, 2019, I traveled to Odessa with Special Envoy Kurt Volker, former EU Deputy Secretary General Jean Christophe-Belliard, a representative of the Romanian EU Presidency, and many other officials. Joined by Ambassador Yovanovitch, U.S. Navy Commander Matthew Powell, and many others, we met with thenUkraine President Poroshenko on the U.S. Navy ship Donald J. Cook. This visit demonstrated the U.S. military's commitment to Ukraine and furthered our broader agenda of aligning with our EU partners to counterbalance Russian influence in the region. This visit followed on the heels of a Congressional Delegation to Brussels led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This delegation met with me and senior EU leadership. In these meetings in Brussels and Odessa, as in nearly every meeting in which Ukraine issues were discussed, corruption and rule of law were central topics of conversation. Corruption poses challenges to the legitimacy and stability of government; corruption is also an economic issue. Successive Ukrainian governments have sought to attract Western investors as a counterbalance to Russian interference and oligarch control of key Ukrainian companies. Western investment is fully in the strategic interests of the United States and our EU partners. However, efforts to access private markets have been made extremely difficult by the longstanding corruption. As one example, we frequently had conversations with Ukrainian leaders about transparency and corporate governance issues involving Naftogaz. In my experience, these issues have been the consistent context in which both my team and our Ukraine counterparts have raised corruption problems for many years. We have received very positive feedback from the NSC regarding our joint efforts to address these challenges in Ukraine. On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President of Ukraine, beating incumbent President Petro Poroshenko with nearly 73% of the vote. This was a momentous event in Ukraine political history and for the overall U.S.-Ukraine relationship. On May 20, 2019, given the significance of this election, I attended the inauguration of President Zelensky as part of the U.S. delegation led by U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, along with Senator Ron Johnson, Special Envoy Volker, and Alex Vindman from the NSC. During this visit, we developed positive views of the new Ukraine President and his desire to promote a stronger relationship between Kiev and Washington, to make reforms necessary to attract Western economic investment, and to address Ukraine's well-known and longstanding corruption issues. On May 23, 2019, three days after the Zelensky inauguration, we in the U.S. delegation debriefed President Trump and key aides at the White House. We emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine and the strengthening relationship with President Zelensky, a reformer who received a strong mandate from the Ukrainian people to fight corruption and pursue greater economic prosperity. We asked the White House to arrange a working phone call from President Trump and a working Oval Office visit. However, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns. It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani. It is my understanding that Energy Secretary Perry and Special Envoy Volker took the lead on reaching out to Mr. Giuliani, as the President had directed. Indeed, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I were disappointed by our May 23, 2019 White House debriefing. We strongly believed that a call and White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky was important and that these should be scheduled promptly and without any pre-conditions. We were also disappointed by the President's direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine. However, based on the President's direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President's concerns. We chose the latter path, which seemed to all of us \u2013 Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and myself \u2013 to be the better alternative. But I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani's agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President's 2020 reelection campaign. Following my return to Brussels and continuing my focus on stronger U.S.-EU ties, my Mission hosted a U.S. Independence Day event on June 4, 2019. Despite press reports, this event was planned months in advance and involved approximately 700 guests from government, the diplomatic corps, the media, business, and civil society. The night featured remarks by the Ambassador and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs. Following the main event, we hosted a smaller, separate dinner for about 30 people. President Zelensky and several other leaders of EU and non-EU member states attended the dinner, along with Secretary Perry, U.S. State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl on behalf of Secretary Pompeo, and numerous other key U.S. and EU officials. Though planned long in advance with the focus on improving transatlantic relations, we also viewed this event as an opportunity to present President Zelensky to various EU and U.S. officials and to build upon the enhanced government ties. The event was well-received. Contrary to some reporting, Bono did not attend or perform. During a trip to Washington on July 10, 2019, with the express, advance invitation of Ambassador Bolton, I joined White House meetings between representatives of Ukraine National Security and Defense with U.S. NSC officials, including Ambassador Bolton, along with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker. I understood following the meeting, as reflected in the summary of a phone call the next day between Secretary Perry and Ambassador Bolton, that there was a difference of opinion between Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and myself, on the one hand, and the NSC, on the other. We three favored promptly scheduling a call and meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky; the NSC did not. But if Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later. We had regular communications with the NSC about Ukraine, both before and after the July meeting; and neither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else on the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts, any complaints about coordination between State and the NSC, or, most importantly, any concerns that we were acting improperly. Furthermore, my boss Secretary Pompeo was very supportive of our Ukraine strategy. After a series of delays, on July 25, 2019, President Trump called President Zelensky to congratulate him on the recently concluded Ukraine parliamentary elections, which in Ukraine are separate from the Presidential elections. This was an important call, and I was pleased to hear that it occurred. But let me emphasize: I was not on that July 25, 2019 call and I did not see a transcript of that call until September 25, 2019, when the White House publicly released it. None of the brief and general call summaries I received contained any mention of Burisma or former Vice President Biden, nor even suggested that President Trump had made any kind of request of President Zelensky. I had heard afterwards that the July 25, 2019 call went well in solidifying a relationship between the two leaders. On July 26, 2019, Special Envoy Volker and I, along with others, met with President Zelensky in Kiev, Ukraine. This was a significant bilateral meeting, involving large teams from the United States and Ukraine, that had been planned by Special Envoy Volker's team weeks in advance and was not in any way tied to the July 25, 2019 White House call. I was invited to this meeting in early July. Indeed, as we planned the Kiev meeting, we did not know when or even if the White House call would occur. During this July 26, 2019 meeting in Kiev, we were able to promote further engagement, including discussions about a future Zelensky visit to the White House. I do recall a brief discussion with President Trump before my visit to Kiev. That call was very short, nonsubstantive, and did not encompass any of the substance of the July 25, 2019 White House call with President Zelensky. Finally, the White House and NSC invited me to the United Nations for the first face-to-face meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky in New York City, which I attended on September 25, 2019. This was a positive meeting, and I am pleased that the leaders were able to meet for the first time face-to-face. CLARIFYING OTHER ISSUES Given the various misstatements in the press, I want to take this time to clarify several issues, including questions involving the Ukraine public statement, the involvement of former Mayor Giuliani, and other alleged issues. Ukraine Public Statement First, I knew that a public embrace of anti-corruption reforms by Ukraine was one of the pre-conditions for securing a White House meeting with President Zelensky. My view was, and has always been, that such Western reforms are consistent with U.S. support for rule of law in Ukraine going back decades, under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Nothing about that request raised any red flags for me, Ambassador Volker, or Ambassador Taylor. Consequently, I supported the efforts of Ambassador Volker to encourage the Ukrainian government to adopt a public statement setting out its reform priorities. My recollection is that the statement was written primarily by the Ukrainians with Ambassador Volker's guidance, and I offered my assistance when asked. This was the \"deliverable\" referenced in some of my messages \u2013 a deliverable/public statement that President Trump wanted to see or hear before a White House meeting could occur. The fact that we were working on this public statement was not a secret. More broadly, such public statements are a common and necessary part of U.S. diplomacy. Requesting that parties align their public messaging in advance of any important leadership meeting is a routine way to leverage the power of a face-to-face exchange. Rudy Giuliani Second, there has been much press speculation about my own interactions with Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. To the best of my recollection, I met Mr. Giuliani in person only once at a reception when I briefly shook his hand in 2016. This was before I became Ambassador to the EU. In contrast, during my time as Ambassador, I do not recall having ever met with Mr. Giuliani in person, and I only spoke with him a few times. Ambassador Volker introduced me to Mr. Giuliani electronically. My best recollection is that I spoke with Mr. Giuliani for the first time in early August 2019, after the congratulatory phone call from President Trump on July 25, 2019 and after the bilateral meeting with President Zelensky on July 26, 2019 in Kiev. My recollection is that Mr. Giuliani and I actually spoke no more than two or three times by phone, for about a few minutes each time. As I stated earlier, I understood from President Trump, at the May 23, 2019 White House debriefing, that he wanted the Inaugural Delegation to talk with Mr. Giuliani concerning our efforts to arrange a White House meeting for President Zelensky. Taking direction from the President, as I must, I spoke with Mr. Giuliani for that limited purpose. In these short conversations, Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anticorruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anticorruption investigatory topics of importance for the President. Let me be clear: Mr. Giuliani does not work for me or my Mission and I do not know what official or unofficial role, if any, he has with the State Department. To my knowledge, he is one of the President's personal lawyers. However, my understanding was that the President directed Mr. Giuliani's participation, that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the President, and that Mr. Giuliani had already spoken with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker. Ten weeks after the President on May 23, 2019 directed the Inaugural Delegation to talk with Mr. Giuliani, I had my first phone conversation with him in early August 2019. I listened to Mr. Giuliani's concerns. My goal was the keep the focus on Ukraine and the strengthened relationship with the United States. Please know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters. However, given the President's explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed. Former Vice President Biden/Hunter Biden Third, given many inaccurate press reports, let me be clear about the following: I do not recall that Mr. Giuliani discussed Former Vice President Biden or his son Hunter Biden with me. Like many of you, I read the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call for the first time when it was released publicly by the White House on September 25, 2019. Although Mr. Giuliani did mention the name \"Burisma\" in August 2019, I understood that Burisma was one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies. I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Again, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens. NSC/Ambassador Bolton Fourth, I worked hard to keep the National Security Council, including Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill, apprised of our Ukrainian efforts. In fact, sometime in June 2019, Secretary Perry organized a conference call with Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker, myself, and others. We went over the entire Ukraine strategy with Ambassador Bolton, who agreed with thestrategy and signed off on it. Indeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill. Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukrainian policy. While I have not seen Dr. Hill's testimony, I am surprised and disappointed by the media reports of her critical comments. To put it clearly: Neither she nor Ambassador Bolton shared any critical comments with me, even after our July 10, 2019 White House meeting. And so, I have to view her testimony \u2014 if the media reports are accurate \u2014 as the product of hindsight and in the context of the widely known tensions between the NSC, on the one hand, and the State Department, on the other hand, which had ultimate responsibility for executing U.S. policy overseas. Again, I took my direction from Secretary Pompeo and have had his consistent support in dealing with our nation's most sensitive secrets to this very day. Stop Texting Fifth,certain media outlets have misinterpreted my text messages where I say \"stop texting\" or \"call me.\" Any implication that I was trying to avoid making a record of our conversation is completely false. In my view, diplomacy is best handled through back-and-forth conversation. The complexity of international relations cannot be adequately expressed in cryptic text messages. I simply prefer to talk rather than to text. I do this all the time with family, friends, and former business associates. That is how I most effectively get things done. My text message comments were an invitation to talk more, not to conceal the substance of our communications. Withholding Security Assistance Sixth,to the best of my recollection, I do not recall any discussions with the White House on withholding U.S. security assistance from Ukraine in return for assistance with the President's 2020 re-election campaign. I recall that, in late July 2019, Ambassadors Volker and Taylor and I exchanged emails in which we all agreed that President Zelensky should have no involvement in 2020 U.S. Presidential election politics. At the same time, we all believed strongly that U.S.Security Assistance should not be withheld. On September 9, 2019, Acting Charge de Affairs/Ambassador William Taylor raised concerns about the possibility that Ukrainians could perceive a linkage between U.S. security assistance and the President's 2020 reelection campaign. Taking the issue seriously, and given the many versions of speculation that had been circulating about the security aid, I called President Trump directly. I asked the President: \"What do you want from Ukraine?\" The President responded, \"Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.\" The President repeated: \"no quid pro quo\" multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood. I tried hard to address Ambassador Taylor's concerns because he is a valuable and effective diplomat and I took very seriously the issues he raised. I did not want Ambassador Taylor to leave his post and generate even more turnover in the Ukraine mission. I further encouraged Ambassador Taylor to contact Secretary Pompeo, as I followed up as far as I could go. As you have seen in the press, my contemporaneous messages support my recollection. Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason. CONCLUSION Simply put, my goal has always been to advance U.S. interests in securing a strong relationship with Ukraine. I continue to see our relationship with President Zelensky as having great importance to national security, and I continue to work to strengthen our ties, advance our mutual interests, and secure a stable, prosperous Ukraine for future generations. I will end my remarks the same way I began: Ukraine is not a dirty word. Ukraine is a fragile democracy fighting against a brutal and unscrupulous Russian neighbor. A strong Ukraine helps to uphold the norms that maintain stability and promote prosperity around the world. It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their Ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to going back to work tomorrow to advance the interests of the United States of America.",

The very day President Trump was sworn in \u2014 Jan. 20, 2017 \u2014 he signed an executive order instructing administration officials \"to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\" implementing parts of the Affordable Care Act, while Congress got ready to repeal and replace President Obama's signature health law. Months later, repeal and replace didn't work, after the late Sen. John McCain's dramatic thumbs down on a crucial vote (Trump still frequently mentions this moment in his speeches and rallies, including in his recent speech on Medicare). After that, the president and his administration shifted to a piecemeal approach as they tried to take apart the ACA. \"ObamaCare is a broken mess,\" the president tweeted in the fall of 2017, after repeal in Congress had failed. \"Piece by piece, we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!\" Two years later, what has his administration done to change the ACA, and who's been affected? Below are five of the biggest changes to the federal health law under President Trump. What is it? The individual mandate is the requirement that all U.S. residents either have health insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate was intended to help keep the premiums for ACA policies low by ensuring that more healthy people entered the health insurance market. What changed? The 2017 Republican-backed tax overhaul legislation reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0. What does the administration say? \"We eliminated Obamacare's horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate. A total disaster. That was a big penalty. That was a big thing. Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege [...] of having no healthcare.\" \u2014 President Trump, The Villages, Florida, Oct. 3, 2019 What's the impact? First of all, getting rid of the penalty for skipping insurance opened a new avenue of attack against the entire ACA in the courts, via the Texas v. Azar lawsuit. Back in 2012, the ACA had been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, because the penalty was essentially a tax, and Congress is allowed to create a new tax. Last December, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled that now that the penalty is $0, it's a command, not a tax, and is therefore unconstitutional. He also reasoned that it cannot be cut off from the rest of the law, so he judged the whole law to be unconstitutional. A decision from the appeals court is expected any day now. Eliminating the penalty also caused insurance premiums to rise, says Sabrina Corlette, director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. \"Insurance companies were getting very strong signals from the Trump administration that even if the ACA wasn't repealed, the Trump administration probably was not going to enforce the individual mandate,\" she says. Insurance companies figured that without a financial penalty, healthy people would opt not to buy insurance, and the pool of those that remained would be smaller and sicker. So, even though the $0 penalty didn't actually go into effect until 2019, Corlette says, \"insurance companies \u2014 in anticipation of the individual mandate going away and in anticipation that consumers would believe that the individual mandate was no longer going to be enforced \u2014 priced for that for 2018.\" According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums went up about 32%, on average, for ACA \"silver plans\" that went into effect in early 2018, although most people received subsidies to offset those premium hikes. What is it? Medicaid expansion was a key part of the ACA. The federal government helped pay for states (that chose to) to expand Medicaid eligibility beyond families to include all low-income adults, and to raise the income threshold, so that more people would be eligible. So far, 37 states and Washington have opted to expand Medicaid. What changed? Under Trump, if they get approval from the federal government, states can now require Medicaid beneficiaries to prove with documentation that they either work or go to school. What does the administration say? \"When you consider that, less than five years ago, Medicaid was expanded to nearly 15 million new working-age adults, it's fair that states want to add community engagement requirements for those with the ability to meet them. It's easier to give someone a card; it's much harder to build a ladder to help people climb their way out of poverty. But even though it is harder, it's the right thing to do.\" \u2014 Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Washington, Sept. 27, 2018 What's the impact? Even though HealthCare.gov and the state insurance exchanges get a lot of attention, the majority of people who gained health care coverage after the passage of the ACA \u2014 12.7 million people \u2014 actually got their coverage by being newly able to enroll in Medicaid. Medicaid expansion has proven to be quite popular. And in the 2018 election, three more red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 voted to join in. Right now, 18 states have applied to the federal government to implement work requirements; but most such programs haven't yet gone into effect. \"The one work requirement program that's actually gone into effect is in Arkansas,\" says Nicholas Bagley, professor of law at the University of Michigan and a close follower of the ACA. \"We now have good data indicating that tens of thousands of people were kicked off of Medicaid, not because they were ineligible under the work requirement program, but because they had trouble actually following through on the reporting requirements \u2014 dealing with websites, trying to figure out how to report hours effectively, and all the rest.\" If more states are able to implement work requirements, Bagley says, that could lead \"to the loss of coverage for tens of thousands \u2014 or even hundreds of thousands \u2014 of people.\" CMS administrator Verma has pushed back on the idea that these requirements are \"some subversive attempt to just kick people off of Medicaid.\" Instead, she says, \"their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.\" Work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky were put on hold by a federal judge in March, and those cases are on appeal. The issue is likely headed to the Supreme Court. What is it? Payments from the federal government to insurers to motivate them to stay in the ACA insurance exchanges and help keep premiums down. What changed? The Trump administration suddenly stopped paying these subsidies in 2017. What does the administration say? \"I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians. ... This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate.\" \u2014 President Trump, the White House, Oct 17, 2017 What's the impact? This change had a strange and unexpected impact on the new insurance markets set up by the ACA. Insurers were in a bind: They had to offer subsidies to low-income people applying for insurance, but the federal government was no longer reimbursing them. \"The first thinking [was], 'Oh gosh, that's going to cause premiums to go up, and it's going to hurt the marketplace,' \" says Christine Eibner, who tracks the ACA at the nonpartisan RAND corporation. \"What ended up happening is, insurers, by and large, addressed this by increasing the price of the silver plan on the health insurance exchanges.\" This pricing strategy was nicknamed \"silver loading.\" Because the silver plan is the one used to calculate tax credits, the Trump administration still ended up paying to subsidize people's premiums, but in a different way. In fact, \"it has probably led to an increase in federal spending\" to help people afford marketplace premiums, Eibner says. \"Where the real damage has been done is for folks who aren't eligible for subsidies \u2014 who are making just a little bit too much for those subsidies,\" Corlette adds. \"They really are priced out of comprehensive ACA-compliant insurance.\" What is it? The ACA initially established rules that health plans sold on HealthCare.gov and state exchanges had to cover people with preexisting conditions and had to provide certain \"essential benefits.\" President Obama limited any short-term insurance policies that did not provide those benefits to a maximum duration of three months. (The original idea of these policies is that they can serve as a helpful bridge for people between school and a job, for example.) What changed? The Trump administration issued a rule last year that allowed these short-term plans to last 364 days and to be renewable for three years. What does the administration say? \"We took swift action to open short-term health plans and association health plans to millions and millions of Americans. Many of these options are already reducing the cost of health insurance premiums by up to 60% and, really, more than that.\" \u2014 President Trump, The White House, June 14, 2019 What's the impact? The new rule went into effect last October, though availability of these short-term or \"skinny\" plans varies depending on where you live \u2014 some states have passed their own laws that either limit or expand access to them. Some federal actuaries projected lots of people would leave ACA marketplaces to get these cheaper plans; they said that would likely increase the size of premiums paid by people who buy more comprehensive coverage on the ACA exchanges. But a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that the ACA marketplaces have actually stayed pretty stable. Still, there's another consequence of expanding access to these less comprehensive plans: \"People who get these \"skinny\" plans aren't really fully protected in the event that they have a serious health condition and need to use their insurance,\" Eibner says. \"They may find that it doesn't cover everything that they would have been covered for under an ACA-compliant plan.\" For instance, you might pay only $70 a month in premiums but have a deductible that's $12,500 \u2014 so if you get really sick or get into an accident, you could be in serious financial straits. What is it? The ACA created Navigator programs and an advertising budget to help people figure out specifics of the new federally run insurance exchanges and sign up for coverage. What changed? In August 2017, the administration significantly cut federal funding for these programs. What does the administration say? \"It's time for the Navigator program to evolve. ... This decision reflects CMS' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated Exchanges to their most cost effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process.\" \u2014 CMS Administrator Seema Verma, written statement, July 10, 2018 What's the impact? It's hard to document what the impact of this particular cut was on enrollment. The cuts were uneven, and some states and cities got creative to keep providing services. \"We have seen erosion in overall health insurance coverage,\" Corlette says. \"But it's hard to know whether that's the effect of the individual mandate going away, the short-term plans or the reductions in marketing and outreach \u2014 it's really hard to tease out the impact of those three changes.\" Overall, Nicholas Bagley says, the ACA has been \"pretty resilient to everything, so far, that the Trump administration has thrown at it.\" Some of Trump's efforts to hobble the law have been caught up in the courts; others have not gone into effect. And despite efforts to lure people away from the individual insurance marketplaces or to make ACA policies unaffordable, \"the marketplaces have proved themselves to be remarkably resilient,\" Corlette says. Abbe Gluck, director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale, cautions that though the law has proven to be stronger than expected, all these actions by the Trump administration have, indeed, had an effect. \"These actions have been designed to depress enrollment \u2014 they have depressed enrollment,\" she says. \"They have increased insurance prices.\" Also, the uninsured rate for U.S. residents also went up in 2018 for the first time since before the ACA was passed. Despite that, one of the things that has kept the marketplaces as strong as they are, Gluck notes, is that they're not all run by the federal government. \"Since the Affordable Care Act is implemented half by state governments \u2014 mostly blue states \u2014 those state governments have been able to resist these sabotaging efforts,\" Gluck says. \"They have been able to extend enrollment, and they have been able to do outreach, because they run their own insurance markets. And in those states there is already evidence that sabotage attacks have not been felt as strongly.\" The piecemeal attacks on the ACA have made many people nervous about the future of their health coverage, Gluck says. \"The most important theme of [Trump's] administration of the ACA has been to sow uncertainty into the market and destabilize the insurance pool,\" she says. With open enrollment for 2020 health plans set to kick off in just a few weeks, Bagley wants people to know the ACA is still strong. The federal health law \"has been battered,\" Bagley says. \"It has been bruised. But it is still very much alive.\"",

Updated at 12:08 p.m. ET The nation's top spy told lawmakers on Thursday that he supports the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the Ukraine affair but said he struggled to deal with how to handle the case inside the Trump administration. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told the House intelligence committee in an open hearing that he believed the whistleblower and the spy world's inspector general had acted in good faith and that he has tried to handle a unique situation as best he could. \"I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\" Maguire said. He stopped short of characterizing the conduct by President Trump described in the complaint and in a partial transcript released on Wednesday of a phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine on July 25 \u2014 in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. Maguire said he did not want to get into the middle of the political battle: \"I am not partisan and I am not political,\" he said. \"I believe in a life of service and I am honored to be a public servant.\" But once the complaint reached him, Maguire said the White House counsel's office said the documents appeared to involve executive privilege, which he said was beyond his power to resolve \u2014 and which might mean Maguire couldn't give the documents to Congress. Later, the Justice Department also opined that the documents didn't qualify under the law to be forwarded to Congress. Even so, when Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson told Maguire that he felt compelled to tell Congress about the complaint, without revealing what it contained, Maguire said he agreed. \"It is not, perhaps, on the timeline I would have desired, Mr. Chairman, or you,\" Maguire said to Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the intelligence committee. But ultimately, Maguire said he believed the process has been followed correctly. \"I believe the whistleblower did the right thing,\" he said. Ultimately the complaint was revealed on Thursday via the House intelligence committee, following the release on Wednesday of the White House's account of President Trump's call with the president of Ukraine. Democrats miffed Schiff pressed Maguire as to why he approached the White House about the complaint when it, and Trump, were the subjects of that very complaint. And Schiff also asked why Maguire asked the Justice Department for legal advice even though Trump's conversation also invoked Attorney General William Barr. \"That this whistleblower was left twisting in the wind for weeks, and has been attacked by the president, should concern all of us,\" Schiff said. The chairman also stressed that he believes there's no ambiguity under the law and Maguire and his aides atop the intelligence community have no choice but to give Congress complaints like these. Maguire said the executive privilege aspects of the complaint meant he had no choice, and that as an executive branch official he also was bound by the opinions issued by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He sought to stress that this situation is unusual and that he has been trying to do his duty. \"This was not swept under the rug,\" Maguire said. Temperature rising in the capital The House hearing was watched closely in a capital roiling after House Democrats reached a new consensus this week about moving ahead with an impeachment inquiry \u2014 although no one knows what that may mean in practical terms or whether it will bring real consequences for Trump. Existing investigations led by House Democrats will continue but the Republican-controlled Senate remains largely behind the president. But one big question raised by this week's events was whether the action in the House and the revelations from this week might move any of Trump's allies in the upper chamber. Key Senate moderates said earlier they were waiting for facts to come through official channels, as in the testimony and documents that are now public, before making up their minds. At the same time, many of Trump's allies, as exemplified by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have remained stalwart in their support of the president. Wow.  Impeachment over this?  What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.  Democrats have lost their minds when it comes to President @realDonaldTrump. Acting DNI in the spotlight The saga began with a complaint to Atkinson, the intelligence community's internal watchdog, about allegedly improper commitments made by President Trump to a foreign leader. The complaint was later released by the House intelligence committee; read it here. That led, on Wednesday, to the extraordinary release by the White House of the account of a call in which Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. Maguire vowed before the hearing, in general terms, that he will do his duty in handling the Ukraine affair \u2014 but he also denied a press report on Wednesday that he had threatened to resign if he was constrained from talking with lawmakers. Maguire found himself in the job following Trump's removal of the Senate-confirmed former DNI, Dan Coats, and the resignation of his deputy, Sue Gordon. There is no word as to when the White House might nominate their full-time replacements. So in the meantime, Maguire is caught in the midst of the latest contretemps involving Trump, the intelligence community and a foreign government. He stressed that he sees himself as outside the political arena. At the same time, however, the acting DNI acknowledged that the biggest challenge facing the intelligence community faces today is securing American elections \u2014 which bears on the issue raised by the Trump phone call with Ukraine's president. President sanguine Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had at least one other phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as did Vice President Pence \u2014 calls that Trump said were also innocent. Trump said he was willing to release a transcript of those earlier calls, but he was dismissive about the reaction by Democrats. \"Impeachment, for that?\" he said. \"When you have a wonderful meeting \u2014 a wonderful phone conversation?\" The president stuck by his characterization of what he called the real Ukraine story \u2014 one he said was about \"corruption\" involving Biden, his family, Ukraine and China. Trump responded to a question about whether his request to Ukraine's leader was improper by charging that former President Barack Obama and conspirators within the U.S. government had persecuted him in the earlier Russia imbroglio. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham added on Thursday that the administration has been cooperating all along with revealing the documents at issue in the Ukraine affair \u2014 first the partial transcript and then the complaint. \"The president took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelenskyy, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself. That is because he has nothing to hide,\" she said in a statement. Trump's allies on the intelligence committee complained about what they called Democrats' baseless allegations that Magquire has been a White House toady. Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., also blamed what he called another conspiracy inside Washington aimed at Trump. \"I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president,\" he said. Biden, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing and condemned what he called conspiracy theorizing by Trump and the president's supporters. The former vice president repeated on Wednesday his earlier call that Trump cooperate with Congress' investigations into the Ukraine affair and said that if Trump doesn't, he'll throw his support behind impeachment. \"It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath,\" Biden said. \"He has put his own political interests over our national security interests, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian pressure.\"",

Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff vowed Thursday he is willing to sue the Trump administration over a dispute about the content of an as-yet-unknown complaint to the intelligence community's official watchdog. Schiff told reporters after a closed-door meeting with the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, that the Justice Department has opined that the material is shielded by privilege and can be withheld from lawmakers. Not so, Schiff argued, and \"if we have to go to court to get this, we will have a good case.\" The dispute is over a complaint to Atkinson brought by someone inside the spy world over activity involving someone high-ranking, which Schiff said very likely means Trump or someone close to him. Newspapers have reported the basis of the complaint involved something Trump said to a foreign leader. Schiff said on Thursday he doesn't know whether that is accurate, but he argued the law and practice are clear: Congress oversees the spy agencies and in this case it must see the materials at issue. \"If any party \u2014 whether it's the Department of Justice or the White House or someone indeed who may be the subject of the complaint \u2014 is able to ... deprive Congress of that information simply because they choose to, then the whistleblower statute doesn't work at all and it chills people from coming forward,\" Schiff told NPR Thursday afternoon. Trump scoffs President Trump denied on Thursday he said anything inappropriate to a foreign leader. The Washington Post reported that Trump, in a phone call with an unnamed foreign leader, made an unspecified promise that so alarmed one member of the intelligence community, it yielded the complaint. In a series of tweets, Trump called the report \"Fake News.\" \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself,\" Trump wrote, adding: \"No problem!\" Trump went on to wonder, \"is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" ....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! Schiff said in an earlier statement that the intelligence community's IG determined that this complaint is \"both credible and urgent, and that it should be transmitted to Congress under the clear letter of the law. The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistle-blowers and their complaints to Congress.\" Schiff said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify in an open session before the panel next week. \"We will hear more. We will learn more,\" he said. And if that hearing does not answer some of these questions, Schiff said, he will confer with the House's general counsel about legal action. The committee later released letters it received from the inspector general. The panel also released a letter from Schiff to acting DNI Maguire. The alleged phone call The Post reported that the as-yet-unknown intelligence official filed a formal complaint to the IG on Aug. 12 and that records show the president had \"conversations or interactions\" with five foreign leaders in the preceding weeks, including a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Other members of Congress away from Schiff's committee say they are waiting to learn more about what's behind all the hubbub. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, said he believes his panel may be next in line. \"I'm anxious to hear more about it, but I expect we will in due course,\" he said. New battle, old war The contretemps over the IG complaint is the latest political battle between Schiff and Trump, who skirmished for months during the height of the Russia imbroglio. Schiff was among Democrats who said there was evidence that Trump's camp colluded with the Russian attack on the 2016 election, citing the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. and other top aides took with a delegation from Moscow that year at Trump Tower. But Schiff also alluded to evidence that wasn't public, including with questions about whether Trump Jr.'s phone records from before the Trump Tower meeting might suggest that he had spoken with his father as it was being arranged. As it turned out, they did not, and Trump Jr. and the president have made Schiff a target of mockery and one of the faces of what Trump says is baseless hounding. The president revived that leitmotif on Thursday with another post on Twitter that complained about \"Presidential Harassment!\" Presidential Harassment!

It's unclear what impact his long-sought testimony will have.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former special counsel Robert Mueller arrives for testimony before the House intelligence committee on Wednesday, his second hearing of the day. It's unclear what impact his long-sought testimony will have. Former special counsel Robert Mueller did what Democrats wanted him to do on Wednesday \u2014 the question now is how much difference that may make. Mueller's hearings did not feature a telegenic star who could deliver a message as exuberantly as President Trump's opponents hoped. Even so, the House chairmen who wrestled for months to harpoon Mueller and reel him up to Capitol Hill got TV soundbites of the former special counsel saying the things they wanted: \u2014 The special counsel investigation did not exonerate or vindicate President Trump. \u2014 There were many contacts between Trump's campaign in 2016 and the Russians who attacked the election. \u2014 Trump's actions, for critics, constitute obstruction of justice, and Trump could be susceptible to criminal prosecution when he no longer enjoys the privileges that now protect him as president. Democrats also sought immediately to try to seize the attention on the special counsel investigation to push for new legislation to alter U.S. election law ahead of next year's vote for president. What wasn't clear is whether dawn over Washington on Thursday would reveal any changes to a political battlefield in which the combatants have mostly been entrenched for months \u2014 and were expected to remain that way barring some kind of major revelation by Mueller. At least one prominent political and media commentator was ready with his take not long after the second hearing adjourned: \"They lost so big today,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"The Democrats are devastated right now.\" All the allegations are \"phony stuff\" and the Democrats know it, Trump said, along with the \"phony cloud\" he said had descended since Mueller's appointment in the spring of 2017. President Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday after Robert Mueller's testimony, which he dismissed as a failure for Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption So there was one indicator: Not only did Mueller's testimony entice Trump to drop his earlier mode of apathy \u2014 in which he'd said he couldn't be bothered to watch the former special counsel \u2014 it also made Trump feel comfortable and confident enough to joust with reporters he mocked for \"fake news\" questions. \"We had a very good day today,\" he concluded. Democrats' dilemmas If Mueller's hours upon hours of testimony didn't leave Trump quaking, the hearings also may have reduced the political peril he faced from impeachment proceedings in the House. The former special counsel refused to be drawn into rhetorical ambuscades by lawmakers in either party and say whether he believed Congress must impeach Trump or whether Mueller agreed he was simply a pawn in a broader impeachment game. The hearings appeared to leave Democrats where they began: divided, with a minority \u2014 albeit sometimes vocal minority \u2014 of House members in support of impeachment proceedings; but a majority opposed, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds a news conference with Democratic committee chairmen Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Jerry Nadler after Mueller's testimony on Wednesday evening.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The speaker's mind, at least, did not appear to have been changed when she appeared at a news conference after the Mueller hearing. She didn't close the door to an impeachment inquiry but said she had a ways to travel before she'd feel confident talking seriously about the I-word. \"If we go down that path we should go the strongest possible way,\" Pelosi said. She alluded to unresolved disputes in court and elsewhere over evidence, as well as the need to bring along most Americans in support. Pelosi, her lieutenants and political Washington waited to see whether Mueller would have that effect on the nation. Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said his panel would press ahead with its fight to compel testimony by and documents from former White House counsel Don McGahn, who has been blocked by the White House from cooperating \u2014 and who likely isn't too eager on his own to play ball with Democrats. Pelosi said her patience isn't inexhaustible and her position could still change. If Trump continues to try to block Democrats' investigations, she suggested, that might provide impeachable grounds down the road. The \"areas of compromise\" House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told NPR that he has become resigned to little or nothing changing the basic views that Americans have taken for and against the president. Schiff cited Trump's ongoing war of words with four Democratic congresswomen, whom the president has tried to paint as the face of the Democratic Party for what he calls their extreme views \u2014 but whom he also said should \"go back\" where they came from in a racist post on Twitter. \"As I said before the hearing, I am very circumspect about how much attitudes change on the subject \u2014 not just on Trump and Russia but on Trump generally,\" Schiff told NPR's All Things Considered. \"I mean, if the racist comments of the president in the last two weeks haven't moved people's opinion, I don't know that anything Bob Mueller could say would change that. But nevertheless it's important that these facts be exposed to the American people and that we finish our investigative work into the areas of compromise that he wasn't able to talk about today.\" Trump's opponents hope the \"areas of compromise\" could yield a politically fecund trove of material for Democrats to try to hurl at Trump over the coming year, involving allegations that the president could have undisclosed financial connections to Russia or other skeletons in his closet. One lesson from Mueller's testimony on Wednesday was that if something wasn't included in the special counsel report, it generally wasn't the subject of Mueller's focus. That suggests Democrats will be plowing fresh ground as they continue their quest for Trump's tax returns and financial or business documents. There's no way to know, however, how long the investigations and subsequent court cases involving those inquiries might take to bear fruit \u2014 if, in fact, they have any for Democrats to pluck. Trump and Republicans call Democrats' post-Mueller investigations a transparent fishing expedition and a bid for a \"do-over\" of the Russia investigation, which, in Republicans' telling, disappointed Democrats because it didn't bring down Trump as his opponents hoped. The president's supporters looked ahead on Wednesday to what they called the truly important investigations still underway within the Justice Department \u2014 into the origins of the Russia imbroglio itself and the way the FBI and DOJ used their surveillance powers. \"The case is certainly not closed,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., told NPR. Attorney General William Barr has said those reports might appear this summer, although there aren't any details as to when. It also isn't clear whether Mueller's testimony might mean Congress could feel new pressure to enact some kind of new security legislation ahead of Election Day next year \u2014 or whether a status quo outcome from Mueller would guarantee that the Hill won't. Schiff used a news conference with Pelosi on Wednesday evening to join others who have called for a new bill, warning about what he called the implications of inaction ahead of the 2020 campaign. \"We go into this election more vulnerable than we should.\"",

            "article_content": "Credit:  NPR Former special counsel Robert Mueller is testifying before Congress on Wednesday, and lawmakers have so many questions they may not have enough time to ask them all. The House judiciary and intelligence committees have scheduled hearings for 8:30 a.m. and noon. Majority Democrats and minority Republicans are expected to try their utmost to get the most good they can from Mueller \u2014 in very different ways. Members of Congress already postponed Mueller's hearings once to wrangle more time. Complicating the matter will be Mueller himself, who has said he intends to confine his testimony to what he has already set forth in his report. In addition, the Justice Department sent Mueller a letter on Monday night saying it expects Mueller to not stray beyond what is publicly known about his work, citing executive privilege. That won't constrain members of Congress from trying. Here are some of the questions they might ask, broken up by the majority and the minority members on these committees. Democrats: Just summarize your findings One basic goal for Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., is to get Mueller to say on TV what he has already said in dry print. The special counsel's office uncovered an unprecedented wave of \"active measures\" launched by Russia against the 2016 election, aimed at blocking Hillary Clinton from being elected and at helping put Donald Trump into office. It documented a number of contacts between Trump's campaign and Russians and it established a number of what Democrats call questionable actions taken by Trump before and after the election. Democrats have sought to tamp down expectations about big new revelations from Mueller beyond the scope of his findings. Republicans: Did you find a conspiracy with the Trump campaign? What's good for the goose is good for the gander \u2014 Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., likely wants a sound bite of his own that he knows Mueller probably will give. He wants the former special counsel to say that he did not establish there was a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians who interfered. That was one conclusion from Volume I of the Mueller report. What will be trickier for both Democrats and Republicans are the findings of Volume II of Mueller's report, in which the special counsel explicitly did not clear Trump of obstructing justice. The report faulted uncooperative witnesses \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 and cited the Justice Department policy proscribing him from seeking an indictment against a sitting president. Mueller later explained in his own brief statement at the Justice Department that he never considered it an option to charge Trump. Attorney General William Barr has since said that he agrees Mueller could never have indicted Trump \u2014 but Barr felt that Mueller could have said whether he believed an indictment was necessary. This will likely come up in the hearings. Mueller's own view was that expressing an opinion about charges, even apart from the special counsel's ability to bring them, would be unfair to Trump. The president's immunity also means he could never have a day in court in which to defend himself against any allegation, Mueller believed. This complicated knot of legal interpretation may make it difficult for members of the committee majority and minority to bounce a clean ricochet off Mueller. Democrats: What didn't you investigate? Mueller has stepped down and his work is over. But Democrats are anxious about trying to preserve some momentum to animate their own ongoing investigations into Trump. The president and his supporters have pointed to Mueller's findings and called them the final word on any alleged impropriety. Trump has said, for example, that he assumes Mueller obtained his tax returns and concluded nothing was wrong. Now Democrats will have the ability to ask Mueller whether that's true. The answer could have some of the biggest long-term political implications for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her majority. If Mueller says \u2014 in so many words \u2014 that his report is a clean bill of health for Trump, it will mean new headwinds for Democrats' investigations and strengthen opponents' criticism that they're just new fishing expeditions. If Mueller appears to clear the way for the judiciary, intelligence and other committees to press ahead with the work they've begun, Democrats would be happy to take the torch from him. But remember, the Justice Department has made it clear that Mueller should not discuss aspects of the investigation that have been redacted and not cleared for public consumption. Republicans: Who are you to \"exonerate\" anyone? Trump, White House aides and their supporters in Congress argue that Mueller has violated the most basic responsibility of a prosecutor: assess whether there's sufficient evidence of lawbreaking and, if so, seek an indictment. If not, don't. It isn't a prosecutor's job to write a report about findings short of charges and it isn't his role to \"clear\" anyone, Mueller's critics argue. Everyone is supposed to be cleared in the American system unless she or he is proved guilty. Yet Mueller wrote this: \"While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" So not only have White House attorneys faulted Mueller for his report \u2014 \"part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper,\" as lawyer Emmet Flood scoffed \u2014 members of Congress likely want to ask Mueller why he went so far afield of what they consider his remit. Democrats: Will you say now whether you'd indict Trump? Look for majority Democrats to take the opposite tack. Barr, the attorney general, has said he considered the way clear for Mueller to say whether he believed Trump merits criminal charges in connection with the alleged obstruction of justice \u2014 with the caveat that there could be no actual indictment. All right, Nadler and his colleagues may say to Mueller, not only are you off the Justice Department payroll, your own former boss has said he didn't object to your giving an opinion about this. Even though the Justice Department's policy kept you from charging Trump, would you if you could have? Or to put it a different way, would anyone else who has done the things you've found Trump has done face criminal charges? Republicans: Why did you remove Peter Strzok? The melodrama involving Strzok, formerly a top FBI counterintelligence specialist, and Lisa Page, formerly a top FBI lawyer, has been one of the most embarrassing subplots in the Russia imbroglio for the FBI. Strzok and Page exchanged a number of candidly political text messages on their government phones in 2016 at the time they were involved in an extramarital affair. When investigators discovered all this and publicized the story and their messages, it fueled criticism that the Russia investigation was the product of \"bias\" by an insider cabal out to get Trump. Mueller removed Strzok from the special counsel's office when he got word about the text messages. Expect Republicans to invite him to relate that story early and often \u2014 and to press him about why they should accept anything from an office that included Strzok and others who've been criticized for political \"bias.\"",

Updated at 11:14 p.m. ET Robert Mueller has agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, giving Democrats the star witness they have long wanted to put before the American public. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that Mueller agreed to testify publicly after he was subpoenaed. He will be questioned separately by the two committees on July 17, according to a congressional aide. The two committee chairmen said in a statement, \"Americans have demanded to hear directly from the Special Counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia's attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign's acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack.\" Mueller has spoken in public only once about his investigation, making a statement to reporters at the Justice Department in May. In it, he said he hoped it would be his last comment on the subject. The announcement sets the stage for possible blockbuster hearing broadcasts, live on radio and television. Democrats have been stymied by the White House in their efforts to secure high-profile public testimony related to the Russia investigation. The president has prevented key witnesses, such as former White House Counsel Don McGahn, from testifying. He also has asserted executive privilege over Mueller's unredacted report to deny Congress the full document. Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's private attorneys, tells NPR's Tamara Keith he is \"not concerned.\" \"Bob Mueller has already stated that his report is his testimony; we now expect that his testimony will be what is in his report. It is important to note the irregularities that took place during this investigation will also be discussed during his testimony,\" Sekulow said. Trump himself tweeted, \"Presidential Harassment!\" The ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins of Georgia, said in a statement that he had encouraged Nadler to subpoena Mueller to \"bring to House Democrats the closure that the rest of America has enjoyed for months, and may it enable them to return to the business of legislating.\" \"While the special counsel found that no Americans conspired with Russia to attempt to interfere in our elections, many have willfully misrepresented that conclusion while Democrats have neglected their responsibility to safeguard future elections from foreign influence. I hope the special counsel's testimony marks an end to the political gamesmanship that Judiciary Democrats have pursued at great cost to taxpayers,\" Collins said. Democrats have pinned their hopes on Mueller, who closed up the special counsel's office and resigned from the Justice Department in May, to resuscitate their flagging investigations. They hope his appearance will grab the American public's attention in a way that his office's 448-page report on the investigation did not. It's unclear, however, how cooperative a witness Mueller will be. The former FBI director is famous for his straight-shooting, by-the-book approach. In his brief statement in May from the Justice Department podium, he emphasized that the probe did not exonerate the president and that Russia's systematic effort to interfere in the election \"deserves the attention of every American.\" He also made clear that he does not want to testify before Congress. If his office were to be dragged up to the Hill, he warned, any testimony \"would not go beyond our report.\" \"It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself,\" Mueller told reporters in May. \"The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.\" Still, House Democrats are anxious to get Mueller \u2014 even against his will \u2014 in front of a national TV audience. The calculation may be that any clips of Mueller speaking, even if he sticks to the script of the report, will register with many Americans in a way the special counsel's report did not. Democratic leadership in the House remains opposed to impeachment at this time. But a growing number of the caucus's rank and file \u2014 nearly 80 members \u2014 support beginning impeachment proceedings against the president.",

Updated at 4:12 p.m. ET Special counsel Robert Mueller shut down his Russia investigation on Wednesday in an unusual appearance in which he restated his findings and made clear that he never considered it an option to charge President Trump. \"We are formally closing the special counsel's office,\" Mueller told reporters at the Justice Department on Wednesday morning. In his 10-minute statement, Mueller highlighted a few portions of his roughly 400-page report, including the section on whether President Trump obstructed justice. \"If we had had confidence that the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\" he said. \"We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.\" Mueller emphasized that Justice Department regulations do not permit the indictment of a sitting president. Accordingly, Mueller said, he never considered it an option to seek one no matter what he had uncovered. If Americans or members of Congress want to hold a president accountable, Mueller said, an investigation like his is not the way. \"The [Justice Department's] opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" Mueller said. But the special counsel defended the need for his work and said he and his office had the merit to execute it. He noted the overarching findings on Russia's interference in 2016. The attack on the election was real, Mueller said \u2014 and it required a serious investigation. \"There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election, and that allegation deserves the attention of every American,\" he said. Mueller's remarks provided a subtle riposte to Trump and other critics who have described the special counsel as \"conflicted\" and leading a \"witch hunt\" based on a conspiracy to deny Trump the presidency in 2016. The president's allies, including Attorney General William Barr, want to turn attention now to the investigators who took part in the early part of this case and reveal more about what surveillance took place. Trump has authorized Barr to declassify intelligence or other findings. The president and supporters say they want to uncover what they've said might be abuse of power by the FBI and Justice Department. Skeptics, including the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they are worried about the administration \"weaponizing\" intelligence and risking the sources and methods by which it was obtained. End to the Mueller era Mueller's investigation ran from May 2017 to March 2019. One of his office's mandates from the Justice Department was to investigate whether Donald Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia in its election interference efforts. Mueller found insufficient evidence to charge anyone with such a criminal conspiracy, despite detailing dozens of connections between people in Trump's orbit and those connected with Russia. The special counsel also investigated whether the president obstructed justice over the course of the investigation. The report explicitly said it did not \"exonerate\" Trump on the question of obstruction. Trump responded shortly after Mueller finished, saying that his statement and report changes \"nothing.\" \"There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent,\" Trump tweeted. \"The case is closed! Thank you.\" Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said Mueller's statement should mark a break for Washington to put the Russia imbroglio in the past. \"After two years, the special counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same,\" she said. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., said Washington has too much important pressing business to continue litigating the Russia investigation. \"It is time to move on from the investigation and start focusing on real solutions for the American people, like fixing the crisis at the southern border and stopping China from stealing our intellectual property, Collins said. The White House had been notified Tuesday night that Mueller might make a statement, an official said. Mueller himself said on Wednesday he hadn't been encouraged or discouraged by anyone from talking publicly or with respect to his decision to testify before Congress. He did not sound eager about that. Mueller declined to answer questions from reporters after his statement Wednesday and said he did \"not believe it is appropriate\" for him to testify before Congress, as House Democrats have asked. The special counsel has said what he has to say, Mueller said. \"We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself,\" he said. \"The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.\" That didn't dissuade House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who said on Wednesday afternoon that he would continue to call for Mueller to appear. \"While I understand his reluctance to answer hypotheticals or deviate from the carefully worded conclusions he drew on his charging decisions, there are, nevertheless, a great many questions he can answer that go beyond the report, including any counterintelligence issues and classified matters that were not addressed in his findings,\" Schiff said. The ongoing political battle Some critics of Trump read Mueller's remarks on Wednesday as a clear message aimed down Pennsylvania Avenue: The responsibility for taking action about Trump now rests with Congress. \"Given that special counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the president, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump \u2013 and we will do so,\" said Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Precisely what that means, however, isn't clear, as disputes continue to smolder between the most anti-Trump Democrats who want impeachment proceedings and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has been more hesitant. \"Nothing is off the table,\" Pelosi said at an event in San Francisco. She vowed that Democrats would hold the president accountable, but Pelosi also reiterated that House committees would continue with their investigations, and that only a minority of members of the House Democratic caucus publicly calling for impeachment. Only about 35 of 238 House Democrats support impeachment, Pelosi said, but she also acknowledged that many Americans do too. The speaker said, in general terms, that \"no one is above the law \u2014 especially the president of the United States.\" House Democrats have also issued a subpoena for the full, unredacted text of his report and his supporting evidence \u2014 which the Justice Department won't provide. Barr says the grand jury material in Mueller's report must remain secret under federal regulations and has recommended more broadly that the work is protected under executive privilege. \"We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public,\" Mueller said. \"I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.\" Mueller's statement also follows an account in a new book, Siege: Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff, that described the special counsel's office as having prepared an indictment for Trump in connection with alleged obstruction of justice \u2014 the focus of Volume II of Mueller's report. No such indictment was ever unsealed, and Mueller's reiterated his office's process and defended his team's decision not to attempt to bring charges against the president as in keeping with the Justice Department's policy prohibiting that. \"Charging a president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider,\" Mueller said Wednesday. A spokesman told NPR that the documents described in the new book don't exist. NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.",

Updated at 1:55 p.m. ET Negotiations over a potential infrastructure program fizzled on Wednesday as a White House meeting between President Trump and Democrats escalated into blame-trading and political threats \u2014 including impeachment. The president was the first to appear after the session in a Rose Garden availability that he used to renew his call for Democrats to abandon investigations into him if they want to negotiate over improving the nation's roads and bridges or other legislation. \"I told the Democrats ... I want to do infrastructure,\" Trump said. \"I'd be really good at that. It's what I do. But we can't do it under these circumstances. Get these phony investigations over with.\" The president appeared behind a lectern that had been decorated with placards including details about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and Trump's leitmotif: \"No collusion. No obstruction.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared on Capitol Hill shortly after Trump's press conference. In their telling, Trump was never serious about an infrastructure program. The president had no proposal for how to finance billions of dollars in new spending, Schumer said. He described a setup inside the White House that Schumer said showed that Trump had decided beforehand that he wasn't going to negotiate, but instead simply tell Democrats no and then walk out to talk to reporters. \"There were investigations going on three weeks ago when we met \u2014 and he still met with us,\" Schumer said. \"Now that he was forced to say how he would pay for it, he had to run away. And he came up with this pre-planned response.\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks to reporters after meeting with House Democrats, many of whom are calling for impeachment proceedings, on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A source familiar with the discussion later described it in more detail. Trump came into the Cabinet Room at the White House and neither shook hands with the congressional guests nor sat in his seat. He spoke for about three minutes, telling the Democrats that he would only discuss infrastructure once their investigations were over. There won't be \"two tracks,\" Trump said, according to the source \u2014 in other words, Democratic members of Congress cannot both investigate and also negotiate with Trump on legislation, he said. Trump left the room before any of the members of Congress could speak, the source said. Pelosi later used a public appearance elsewhere in Washington to describe the White House meeting as \"very strange\" and warn that Trump's continued efforts to frustrate congressional investigations could lead the House to initiate impeachment proceedings. \"In plain sight, this president is obstructing justice and is engaged in a cover-up,\" she said. \"And that could be an impeachable offense.\" Whipsaw The late-morning whiplash followed what appeared to be some thawing of the  ice between Congress and the Trump administration. The Justice Department began giving ground to the chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who canceled what he had called a planned \"enforcement\" session because he said the Justice Department would comply with a subpoena and provide documents related to its investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. \"The department has repeatedly acknowledged the committee's legitimate oversight interest in these materials,\" Schiff said. \"I look forward to, and expect, continued compliance by the department so we can do our vital oversight work.\" The chairman's subpoena will remain in effect, Schiff said, but he expects to begin receiving the documents he has ordered by the end of next week. Exactly what materials he'll receive isn't clear, but Schiff has said they relate to the findings in Volume I of the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, which recounted investigators' discovery about the Russian interference \u2014 and the conclusion that the Trump campaign did not conspire with it, notwithstanding a number of contacts. Political battlefield Trump and Republicans say that Schiff and his colleagues are simply trying to drag out the Russia discussion for as long as they can in order to keep the spotlight on allegations that Mueller already has deflated. \"It's a total horrible thing that happened to our country,\" Trump said. \"It hurt us in so many ways.\" Democrats, meanwhile, are conflicted as to what action to take based on Mueller's findings and the reluctance they say they've encountered from the Trump administration about other inquiries, including his finances and business practices. Pelosi met with Schiff and other top lieutenants earlier on Wednesday morning to discuss the internecine disputes over whether, in the most extreme case, to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president. The speaker, who has previously said she opposes impeachment, is trying to calibrate a message that resonates with many constituencies. That includes her House chairmen \u2014 who are locking horns with the Trump administration \u2014 with liberal Democratic voters, who loathe Trump \u2014 and also with Americans more broadly, most of whom are much cooler about impeachment. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday morning that Democrats would continue to exercise their powers of oversight and keep up the pressure on the administration, but stopped short of using the I-word. \"We believe it's important to follow the facts,\" she said. \"We believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States. We believe the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\" Whether or not Trump intended before Wednesday morning's conference with Democrats to rebuff them \u2014 as Schumer charged \u2014 the remark by the speaker clearly annoyed the president. Trump called himself, possibly, the most transparent president of all time. \"I don't do cover-ups,\" he said. \"You people know that better than anybody.\" Pelosi then turned up the volume later on Wednesday when she appeared onstage at an event hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The speaker repeated her charge about the \"cover-up\" and said that if Trump's administration continues to resist investigations, it could be \"an impeachable offense.\" Democrats stalled, Democrats angry Democrats point to the stiff-arm they've gotten from Trump on obtaining an unredacted copy of Mueller's report. The Justice Department says it is protected by executive privilege. They also say they've been blocked from getting access to testimony and documents from others, including Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued subpoenas on Tuesday evening for more prospective witnesses, including Annie Donaldson, McGahn's ex-chief of staff, and former White House communications director Hope Hicks, a close and long-serving former aide to the president. It isn't clear yet whether the Justice Department may cite the same legal reasoning it has given for seeking to block McGahn's testimony: that presidential advisers of his stature are so close to the president that Congress might as well be trying to compel Trump himself to appear \u2014 which would violate the Constitution's separation of powers. What about Mueller himself? It also isn't clear yet what will happen with perhaps the highest-profile witness that Schiff, Nadler and other Democrats hope will appear: Mueller himself. Barr and the Justice Department haven't thrown up any official barrier to a hearing with Mueller, but at the same time, Nadler has appeared frustrated about being unable to nail down a date for a hearing. The famously taciturn special counsel \u2014 who hasn't spoken an official word in public since his appointment two years ago \u2014  is understood to be somewhat reluctant to appear in the spotlight of a hearing that would likely rival or equal earlier set pieces in the Russia imbroglio. Hearings including with Barr, former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen have drawn national attention, and a Mueller hearing would, too. Schiff, Nadler and their colleagues aren't giving up, though \u2014 they said on Wednesday that they'll continue to press for Mueller to testify as soon as practical. It isn't clear how much longer Mueller may continue to work at the Justice Department, and his eventual return to private life could affect the kinds of information to which he has access beyond his own recollections and, in turn, what he might be able to discuss with Congress.

Donald Trump Jr. has reached a compromise with the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify before the panel, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. The deal comes less than a week after the committee's initial subpoena inflamed tensions between the GOP-led panel and the White House. The mid-June interview will be limited in time \u2014 no more than four hours \u2014 although no topics are off limits, the source said. The primary agenda is expected to focus on knowledge Trump Jr. may have about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project as well as his involvement in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City with a Russian delegation after an offer of \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. A Senate Intelligence Committee spokesperson declined to comment. Trump Jr. first testified before the committee about such questions in December 2017. Negotiations over another appearance dragged on and eventually stalled, leading to the subpoena compelling the president's son to testify or risk being held in contempt. The debate over another round of testimony comes at a time when tensions are inflamed between President Trump and Capitol Hill over executive privilege \u2014 though most of that has centered on information the Democratic-controlled House is trying to obtain. In the Republican-controlled Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has declared \"case closed\" on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The White House saw the findings as vindication. The report did not find conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia on election interference. And while the special counsel did not conclude one way or another whether the president obstructed justice, Attorney General William Barr has cleared the president on that question. But this latest request for testimony from Trump Jr. comes from one of the Senate's more bipartisan committees, and its chairman, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr, has seemed unmoved by any criticisms from within his party. Trump himself weighed in earlier Tuesday as he departed the White House for Louisiana, saying that it was \"very unfair\" how his eldest child was being treated. \"It's really a tough situation because my son spent I guess over 20 hours testifying about something that Mueller said was 100 percent OK,\" Trump told reporter. \"And now they want him to testify again. I don't know why. I have no idea why. But it seems very unfair to me.\" Later on Tuesday, McConnell said, however, that it was the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman's prerogative on how to run his panel. \"None of us tell Chairman Burr how to run his committee,\" McConnell said. \"I asked him to undertake this investigation on Russian collusion a couple of years ago. He's indicated publicly that he believes they will find no collusion and we are hoping to get a report on that subject very soon.\" But the Senate GOP leader declined to answer a question about whether he agreed with Trump's comments about the subpoena and repeated he expected to get the intelligence report soon.",

Health workers in Congo's Ebola outbreak zone receive death threats.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: So what is China's next move here? It has been days now since the U.S. raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And to the surprise of many, China's government has not yet hit back. Here's the president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, on \"Fox News Sunday.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\") LARRY KUDLOW: It's interesting. The expected countermeasures have not yet materialized. We may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow. INSKEEP: At least up to this moment as we speak, Beijing has limited itself to verbal responses, denying U.S. claims that China walked back details of a trade deal. GREENE: All right. One person who's following this - NPR's Rob Schmitz, who is in Shanghai. Good morning, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So what happened to tit for tat? Is this a totally different tune now from China? SCHMITZ: (Laughter) Yeah. What's surprising here is that Beijing's inaction represents a break from how they've traditionally responded. GREENE: Yeah. SCHMITZ: When President Trump announced this first round of tariffs last summer, China responded immediately, imposing tariffs on the same amount of U.S. products. After Trump's second round of tariffs later in the summer, Beijing responded the same way. But the third round of tariffs in September were the big ones. Those were the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. GREENE: And those are the ones that - on consumer goods that Trump just raised by even more, 15% on Friday, right? SCHMITZ: Yeah, that's right. And when the U.S. imposed tariffs in September, China ran out of U.S. goods to impose tariffs on. It could no longer fight in this tit-for-tat way. GREENE: Nothing left. Yeah. SCHMITZ: Right. So Beijing imposed tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports, and those equaled around $60 billion. So now that President Trump has raised this third round of tariffs, the prevailing wisdom was that Beijing would raise its tariffs by the same amount. But that has not happened yet. GREENE: And why might that be? What - I mean, could this be strategic on China's part? SCHMITZ: Well, one reason might be that because Beijing has run out of U.S. products to impose tariffs on, and its own economy isn't doing that well, so they may have to get creative here in how they'll retaliate. And that might take some time to formulate. Another reason might be that there's a debate among the leadership in Beijing about how to respond. What's clear is that something is amiss here, but we don't really know what it is because China's government is so opaque. GREENE: But we do know we're at a point in a trade war where countries are running out of things to tariff, which is amazing. SCHMITZ: Right. GREENE: So, I mean, I know we don't know everything because you - as you say, it's hard to figure out what China might be thinking. But where do these talks go from here? I mean, is this a total standstill? SCHMITZ: Well, China's lead negotiator, Liu He, told China's media Friday that the U.S. and China will hold the next round of talks in Beijing, but he did not specify when. President Trump's statements since Friday about the matter have sort of run the spectrum from praise for Xi Jinping to then taking to Twitter to make even more threats, saying he's asked his staff to begin the paperwork on yet another round of tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of everything else China sells to the U.S. He's also praised his own tariff increase, saying it's more money in the U.S. government coffers despite the fact that, at some point very soon, American consumers will be stuck with the bill for much of this through higher prices on nearly everything they buy. GREENE: And that's what everyone is watching. I mean, at a point when consumers feel enough pain that the pressure builds on President Trump to make decisions based on that. All right. We'll see where this goes. NPR's Rob Schmitz joining us from Shanghai on the latest on the trade war. Rob, thanks. SCHMITZ: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: So as congressional Democrats launch more investigations into President Trump, the White House seems to be focusing on a single strategy, which is do not cooperate. INSKEEP: The president and his administration have refused requests for his tax returns and other records, rebuffed congressional subpoenas and blocked aides from testifying before House committees. Some of these battles appear to be heading for court, and they raise questions about Congress' ability to oversee the executive branch. GREENE: And NPR's Tamara Keith, who is NPR's White House correspondent, also hosts the NPR Politics Podcast, is with us. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi. GREENE: So how's this strategy going for the president - not to cooperate at all? KEITH: So far, so good, I guess. The White House is holding pretty firm on this idea that many of these congressional investigations lack legitimate legislative purpose. The White House is saying that congressional Democrats are asking for documents and other items that they don't have a legal right to see. And the website for President Trump's campaign has all kinds of items, like the collusion delusion T-shirt and witch hunt beer koozies. GREENE: Huh. KEITH: And talking to folks at the campaign, they are perfectly happy with the way this is going. And they say that this fight is energizing his supporters. GREENE: Well, Tam, I mean, you mentioned the witch hunt beer koozies. I mean, even as the president was calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt, I mean, White House staff were cooperating, speaking to investigators, turning over records, right? I mean, this is really a change. KEITH: Yeah. So there was this interesting legal theory that the White House is now really testing, which was that Mueller was part of the executive branch because he was part of the Justice Department, so the theory was that they could have anybody in the executive branch talk to Mueller and still would not have waived executive privilege. Now that these are congressional investigations, the theory goes that's a different branch of government, and they don't have to cooperate - that by cooperating with Mueller, they did not guarantee that they would have to cooperate with Congress. GREENE: Democrats are describing this as a critical moment, a crisis. I mean, you have House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying this is a constitutional crisis, these blanket refusals from the White House. And if you don't mind, I just listen to a little bit of the House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff on ABC's \"This Week.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\") ADAM SCHIFF: I don't think this country could survive another four years of a president like this, who gets up every day trying to find new and inventive ways to divide us. GREENE: I mean, can you put this moment in some historic context for us? KEITH: A constitutional crisis requires not just a disagreement between two branches of government, but something more than that. It would require the legislative - the - it would require the judicial branch to require someone to cooperate. So let's say the judicial branch mediates one of these disagreements between the White House and Congress, and then the White House still refuses to cooperate. That would then get to a crisis. At this point, many people that we talked to say that this is a conflict. It's absolutely a conflict between the Article 1 branch and the Article 2 branch of the Constitution. But we aren't there yet, they say, on an actual crisis. GREENE: All right. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith, also host of the NPR Politics Podcast. Thank you, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: So in the Democratic Republic of Congo, health workers who are fighting Ebola are now facing a lot of threats. INSKEEP: Threats like leaflets calling health workers the enemy or text messaging saying stop, or we'll kill you. And for some, these threats have turned violent or even deadly. GREENE: NPR's Nurith Aizenman has been reporting on this growing hostility against health workers, and she joins us. And Nurith, what is happening? Why, if you're fighting an outbreak of a disease, would you be threatened by people? NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Well, the problem is that this virus is circulating in an area of longstanding conflict between dozens of armed rebel groups and the government, and also people have felt very neglected by the government there for years. It didn't help that the government used Ebola as a justification to suspend voting in recent presidential elections. And so there have been these rumors swirling that either Ebola isn't real, or it's been introduced to kill people on purpose. And the rumors are even sweeping up doctors at regular clinics, you know, the ones who are often the first to spot a patient with possible Ebola symptoms. GREENE: Sure. AIZENMAN: And I spoke with a primary care doctor who works in a village clinic. Her name is Joyeouse Kivwira. And she was describing how, on a recent afternoon, she was at her house preparing lunch when she looked out her window, and she saw this angry mob gathering. Let's have a listen. JOYEOUSE KIVWIRA: (Through interpreter) People say that we - the local health workers - are getting money to refer patients to the Ebola treatment centers where they're sent to die. The crowd was shouting that they should chase us out, even kill us. AIZENMAN: You know, and luckily for her, some older men in the village rushed forward. And after about an hour, they were able to talk people down. And then Dr. Kivwira said as soon as that crowd dispersed, she just fled the village on foot. GREENE: So this is - I mean, it sounds like this is not just about targeting health workers. These are just bringing up a lot of resentments and a lot of the distrust in government that has always been in a country like Congo. But it - I mean, that makes me wonder how far this could go. Are these incidents really common? Is it dangerous now to be a health worker in this country, fighting this disease? AIZENMAN: Absolutely. I've spoken with the head of one of the local doctors' association, and he says that a lot of health workers report that they're getting increasingly threatened through text messages or even at home. You know, there have been incidents where attackers broke into the house of a government nurse while he was sleeping, and they made his wife watch as they took him outside and shot him dead with a bow and arrow. And then we've seen direct attacks on the Ebola responder teams, you know, treatment centers burnt to the ground, gunmen storming a meeting and shooting dead an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization. And each time there's an attack, the work that's needed to stop Ebola grinds to a halt, you know, things like identifying new cases and vaccinating their contacts. I mean, just last week alone, they had to stop operations for five consecutive days in the hot zone because of various violent incidents. GREENE: And that's just a reminder this is not just people who are risking their lives. It's other lives are at risk because they're not able to do their job to stop the spread of this thing. AIZENMAN: Yeah, yeah. That's right. And basically, this has led to a surge in infections of Ebola, just more than 1,600 cases now in this 10-month-long outbreak. And now we're seeing more and more just numerous aid groups calling for a total rethink of the strategy. The most prominent group calling for this is Doctors Without Borders, which evacuated after their treatment centers were attacked. And their argument right now is that the emphasis is so focused on biosecurity. You know, as soon as someone shows signs of Ebola, they're singled out. They're whisked off by people in hazmat suits to these special centers with orange plastic fencing that we've all seen. But for people who are already distrustful, that just breeds suspicion. And so the argument that's being made now is, you know, let's integrate Ebola back into the regular health system. Let's let people get an Ebola test at the doctor's office. If they're sick, let's let family members put on protective gear and go into the treatment center and sit by the bedside of the sick kid or parent. And if a patient doesn't want to go to a treatment center, maybe even help their families take care of them at home. And interestingly, the World Health Organization and even the government is starting to be more and more open to this idea. GREENE: All right. Difficult situation dealing with disease in a place with so much violence. NPR's Niruth Aizenman, thanks so much. We appreciate your reporting. AIZENMAN: Glad to do it.

Votes are being counted with results expected in the coming days after South Africans went to the polls Wednesday in what's being seen as a referendum on the party that's governed the country for 25 years, since apartheid ended. Local outlets report that turnout in townships appeared low on the public holiday, especially compared with the 1994 elections, the first time citizens from every race could participate. That year, Nelson Mandela was sworn in as South Africa's first democratically elected, and first black, president to lead a hopeful nation. His party, the African National Congress, is expected to retain a majority, but its margin for victory and sway on South Africa's provinces remain to be seen. Despite the ANC's storied past as the liberation movement that brought freedom and an end to apartheid, its reputation has suffered in recent years from rampant corruption, influence-peddling scandals and accusations that it failed to deliver on a promise to end inequality for black South Africans who suffered in the times of institutionalized segregation. Jacob Zuma resigned as president in 2018 amid widespread allegations of graft. He was succeeded by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, Mandela's original chosen successor. President Ramaphosa promised to \"continue to improve the lives of our people.\" At a recent ANC campaign rally, he also apologized for his party's mistakes. \"We admit that we have made mistakes and we put ourselves before our people and say yes \u2014 we have made mistakes, but it is only those who are doing nothing who don't make mistakes,\" he said. As part of his bid to be elected, which would secure him a five-year presidential term, Ramaphosa vowed to fight corruption. \"The era of impunity, comrades, is over,\" he said. The party is reportedly banking on \"Ramaphoria,\" voters' loyalty to Ramaphosa, despite senior leaders' skepticism of what his reforms could mean in practice. Voters appear to be prepared to give Ramaphosa a chance. He has faced off against Mmusi Maimane, who leads the country's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance. Maimane accused the ANC of endemic corruption and failing to fully deliver on housing, jobs, land distribution and other basic needs. Another opposition candidate, Julius Malema, was ousted from the ANC in 2012 and founded the Economic Freedom Fighters the next year. His party is expected to gain support, according to poll predictions. Malema, once a protege of Zuma, supports the expropriation of white-owned land without compensation for owners. And with Ramaphosa's tepid support, the ANC is now looking into amending the Constitution to allow such land seizures. Ramaphosa said the reform would happen \"in a manner that takes the interests of all into account,\" according to The New York Times. Many young South Africans chose not to participate in Wednesday's elections. \"We have the lowest voter registration among young people than we have ever had,\" South Africa-based social analyst Tessa Dooms told NPR. \"So the uptake for young people aged 18, 19 and 20, which is definitely first-time voters, is below 20% of that cohort.\" Lerato Lekoale, a 31-year-old voter, says it's a pity so many young South Africans decided not to register to vote, after Mandela and many other anti-apartheid stalwarts risked or gave their lives so that future generations could vote in a free South Africa. \"I'm standing there and thinking, does anyone else get emotional about voting anymore?\" she said. \"Young people don't seem to understand what it took to afford us this privilege, this right,\" she added. Another voter, Nkosikhulule Nyembezi, told NPR that South Africa is a young democracy that needs to be given a chance. \"The troubling thing is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots is widening,\" he said. Former South African President Frederik Willem \"F.W.\" de Klerk, who preceded Mandela, told news outlet eNCA, \"If the ANC wins and President Ramaphosa keeps his promises, things will get better.\" Despite being Africa's second-largest economy, South Africa has an unemployment rate of about 27%, and the growth in gross domestic product per capita has been \"close to nil since 2014,\" according to the World Bank. Inequality has persisted despite the end of apartheid, the financial institution added. In 2015, the richest 10% of South Africa's population held about 71% of net wealth, while the bottom 60% of the population held 7%. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton contributed to this report.",

The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to hold him in contempt of Congress, pushing the resolution to the full House. Updated at 5 p.m. ET The House Judiciary Committee has voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress after the Trump administration invoked executive privilege over the contents of the Mueller report. The developments Wednesday escalated the confrontation between congressional Democrats and the White House over documents related to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"We are now in a constitutional crisis,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., after the vote. The committee acted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing its demands to turn over an unredacted version of the report. The vote was 24-16 along party lines. The resolution now moves to the full House for a vote. As debate began on the contempt resolution, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd released a letter to Nadler, \"to advise you that the President has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials.\" The letter called it a \"protective assertion\" to ensure \"the president's ability to make a final decision whether to assert privilege following a full review of these materials.\" A Justice Department spokesperson called the vote \"politically motivated and unnecessary,\" asserting that the department could not comply with the subpoena for documents \"without violating the law, court rules, and court orders.\" Separation of powers The dispute centers on congressional Democrats' demands to see the entire version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election and is within a broader effort by the House to investigate Trump. A redacted version of Mueller's report has been made public, and a select group of lawmakers has been offered the chance to view a less redacted version. But Democrats want a wider circle of lawmakers, including all members of the Judiciary and intelligence committees, to be able see the complete report as well as the underlying evidence, including the investigative files that Mueller collected. A Justice Department letter sent Tuesday night said releasing that information \"would force the department to risk violating court orders and rules in multiple ongoing prosecutions, as well as risk the disclosure of information that could compromise ongoing investigations.\" During the debate over the contempt citation of Barr, Nadler said the decision to invoke executive privilege was \"a clear escalation in the Trump administration's blanket defiance of Congress' constitutionally mandated duties.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that \"Faced with Chairman Nadler's blatant abuse of power, and at the Attorney General's request, the President has no other option than to make a protective assertion of executive privilege.\" Sanders called it \"sad that Chairman Nadler is only interested in pandering to the press and pleasing his radical left constituency.\" Statement on Executive Privilege pic.twitter.com/6ujCZDnMC0 It's not clear how the Trump administration can argue that the contents of the Mueller report can be subject to executive privilege as the vast majority of it has already been made public and a published version is in fact a bestseller. Administration officials connected with the Russia story also have spoken to Congress in open hearings, including then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, intelligence community leaders and others. Nonetheless, Barr and the Justice Department now say that the privilege shields the material that Nadler wants, one day after the White House threatened to invoke it to block former White House counsel Don McGahn from turning over documents in answer to a committee subpoena. McGahn's attorney said on Tuesday that he would stand fast and do nothing \u2014 comply with neither the White House instructions nor the committee subpoena \u2014 until the legal questions surrounding the dispute have been resolved. If the House follows the Judiciary Committee in voting to hold Barr in contempt, that would send a criminal referral to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, whose boss is Barr.",

Vampire Weekend's last album, Modern Vampires of the City, helped vault it to festival headliner status, and topped year-end best-of lists when it was released. But that was six years ago \u2014 and a lot has happened in the time since. One of the main creative forces in the band, Rostam Batmanglij, left the group in early 2016. While the remaining members focused on side projects, voices in the music industry were beginning to float the idea that guitar rock might have slipped out of relevance. And then, of course, came the 2016 presidential election. This week, the band returns at long last with its fourth LP, Father of the Bride. Lead singer and guitarist Ezra Koenig joined NPR's Audie Cornish to discuss how age, experience and time away have changed his approach to songwriting; addressing politics both on record and onstage with Senator Bernie Sanders; and why, for a group like Vampire Weekend, the decline of guitar rock might not be the worst news. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Audie Cornish: I think of your music, in terms of some of the later albums, as being bittersweet in a way: cheerfully narrating a fair amount of pain. On this album, the song that made me think of that was \"This Life.\" Not just because the word \"suffering\" is in it \u2014 I think this is a good example of that cheeriness that isn't really matched lyrically. Ezra Koenig:  Growing up, I always liked artists like The Smiths and The Cure: They have some very upbeat, cheerful songs, but it's such a contrast with the lyrics. That always just made a lot of sense to me \u2014 especially if you're trying to kind of create a snapshot of life as you know it, that every song would have a mixture of joy and pain. It's interesting that you bring up the word \"suffering,\" because at some point, I realized that three of the songs had the word \"suffering\" in the chorus. The first song we put out, \"Harmony Hall,\" had this part that went,\"I thought that I was free from all that suffering.\" Almost like a Buddhist way of thinking: You think you've finally figured out a way to be free from suffering, but of course, life is a cycle. But then, I actually changed it to \"questioning,\" which I think is better for the song. I like that song because it also gets to this idea a lot of people wrestle with \u2014 of people and places that have maybe let you down. I don't know if I'm reading too much into that line, \"Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight / Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified.\" No, I think that's a fair interpretation. And yeah, also trying to come to terms with the idea that not only can it be painful or disorienting when an institution or a group or something lets you down, but that that's almost built into the fabric of reality, and you can't be shocked by it every time that it happens. But we all have been, right? I mean, I haven't had a soundtrack for that emotion. But the feeling that there is corruption in this place, or ugliness in this place, and how do I reconcile with that? Yeah, that's the funny thing. I always think about high school and college and reading books \u2014 from 100, 200, a thousand years ago, 2,000 years ago \u2014 where people are more or less saying the same thing about the cyclical nature of government, politics, even just individual pain and suffering. You read all that stuff when you're a kid and yet you're still a little bit surprised when you feel it in a personal way or a generational way or a national way. As much as we've been prepared for it by the wisdom of the ancients, it still is always shocking. [With] \"This Life,\" that was the inspiration for the opening lines: \"Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain / I just thought it didn't rain in California.\" You know all these things are lurking out there, and you still weep. Maybe we all have this gambler's nature, that we're going to be the one who bets big and wins big despite the obvious risks. This also gets to a question I have about trying to write songs that nod to the political, that engage in the ideas of the moment, and that still feel timeless. Because not everyone's doing it \u2014 just being honest, I'm not turning on the radio and feeling that. I may also be asking because you guys appeared with Bernie Sanders during the 2016 campaign. Taking that extra step to stand shoulder to shoulder with a politician is a significant moment. Yeah, it's funny: When I talk about it now, people say, \"You really put yourself out there.\" I really try to think back to how I felt in 2016 \u2014 and for me, growing up on the East Coast, New York, New Jersey, when I look at somebody like Bernie Sanders, this older, crunchy, independent senator from Vermont, he truly seemed to me like the least controversial candidate on Planet Earth. The first time we played with him was in Iowa, so early, early days of the primaries. The idea of really sticking our neck out, it didn't even occur to us \u2014 like, \"Who could have an issue with this guy? Maybe he won't win; maybe he's a little too left of center. But he just seems like the kind of guy everybody likes.\" Of course, I was deeply wrong about that. In retrospect, I kind of see that, obviously, the divisions in politics, particularly within the Democratic Party, are very intense. But I promise, when we first got up there with Bernie, it just felt like the most laid-back political thing you could possibly do. I read a quote where you said, \"With regards to songwriting, everyone's identity defines how they think about life.\" You were saying you don't get frustrated when people don't like the band because of your voice or something in the sound, but when they look at it through that accusation of whiteness or privilege or something like that \u2014 rather than who you are in particular. There were elements that I think we all felt when the band started that we were a little bit blindsided by. I always had a sense of humor about preppiness and the Ivy League; I went to Columbia, but I also had student debt and scholarships to pay for it. But the particular identity of Jewish people, which is my background, is not particularly pleasant for people to talk about \u2014 it gets fraught very quickly. In the interview you're referencing, we were talking about a song that's called \"Jerusalem, New York, Berlin,\" so it's not surprising people might want to look at it through the lens of identity. But my point was kind of just like, if you want to go there, you maybe do have to talk about Jewishness and the relationship of Jewishness and whiteness. But, you know, that creates a real can of worms in the current political climate, I think. It does. I appreciate you saying that it's not an easy thing to talk about. I mean, in that song you reference, towards the end there's is a line about that \"genocidal feeling that beats in every heart.\"It's serious language. Yeah, it's serious language, and it's also a song. If I wanted to make a direct, simple statement about what it means to be Jewish \u2014 what it means to be white, the relationship of America to Israel, Zionism, anti-Zionism \u2014 I could go on Twitter. That's there. There's a part of me that feels protective of the world of songwriting \u2014 to let it lie for a second, you know? To let it be open. I've always felt so connected to Irish folk songs. There's one called \"The Minstrel Boy\" that's about the boy who plays music along with the army, and there's this line that says, \" 'Land of Song!' said the warrior bard / 'Tho' all the world betrays thee.' \" That always struck me, that \"the whole world betrays\" the land of song. There's something so sad about that. We demand a lot \u2014 \"we\" meaning the audience. Yeah, and that maybe it's about letting the land of song live on its own terms. It sounds corny when I say it \u2014 but the land of song as being someplace that is a little bit separate from the daily battles that we face. You had a very funny quote to The Times of London: \"Guitar acts in 2019 have an irrelevance I've come to enjoy.\" Which is a joke, but not wrong, in a way. [Laughs] Well, yeah. I mean, being gone for six years, you watch a lot come and go. I saw there were these big questions being asked: \"Is guitar music dead? Is indie music irrelevant?\" And I saw the way that it caused stress and anxiety in many of my peers about their place in the world. Maybe that happens every time a wave crests \u2014 people get nervous. But can I ask a question? The idea of irrelevance is not always about, \"Is this sound cool? Is this the sound of now?\" Is it also that that music stopped speaking to people about their lives in a way that felt relevant? Like, rock fell down on the job? Maybe. But even beyond that, things come in and out of fashion. At some point, guitar seems like a funny old instrument, and other times it seems more charming or more exciting. I almost felt happy that as I started working on the record the question had been answered: \"It's not particularly relevant. Good. Stop worrying about it.\" We know that there's people who write poetry, opera, abstract expressionist painting, whatever \u2014 art forms that, by one way of looking at it, had their moments of relevance a very long time ago. And yet, we're often surprised by somebody who's dedicated to an art form and pulls out an idea that speaks to us. I think as you get older you realize you just just can't sweat it. There's almost something pleasant about just being like, \"Yes, it's irrelevant \u2014 now, can we talk about how to get the guitar sounding good?\" People are comparing some of the songs on this album to Phish, with the album art having kind of a hippie vibe. Which I love. And which is funny, because you guys were called too ivory tower, not punk enough. And now this album comes, and it's kind of like you're embracing your uncool impulses. Every Vampire Weekend album, going back to the start, starts with something uncool. That's where the action's at, in my opinion. It's not like preppiness was cool. Even the attraction to boat shoes and Oxford commas was not particularly cool. But there's something attractive, sometimes, about looking for the cool within the uncool.

Updated at 9:37 p.m. ET The Justice Department has released a redacted copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u00bb A copy of the document is available here. Read notable excerpts from the redacted report, annotated by NPR reporters and editors, below. We'll be updating this analysis throughout the day as we read the report. In the report: Page 9 ... while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.\" [ This section outlines how flimsy investigators eventually concluded the case was that those involved with now-familiar Russian contacts actually might have broken the law. Even the meeting involving top Trump campaign aides with a Russian delegation in New York City in June 2016 doesn't have enough evidence associated with it to charge those involved with an alleged campaign finance violation, they write. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 18 Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated \u2014 including some associated with the Trump Campaign \u2014 deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts. Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report. [ The special counsel's investigation was exhaustive, it says, but it could only include evidence it could access. Situations in which evidence was destroyed or encrypted services were used meant that investigators couldn't check what they were learning against the electronic record. The investigators say they can't eliminate the possibility that the information they couldn't access would reveal more about the events that took place in 2016 and since. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 10 In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \"coordinat[ed]\"\u2014a term that appears in the appointment order\u2014with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. [ The burning question all along in the Russia investigation was what might constitute a violation of the law for the purposes of the inquiry. Meetings and contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russians or their agents were reported in the press and became publicly known. Here's where Mueller's office explains the definition it used to analyze conduct and determine what would constitute lawbreaking. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Pages 22 and 23 By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and Instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants. IRA-controlled Twitter accounts separately had tens of thousands of followers, including multiple U.S. political figures who retweeted IRA-created content. [ In the 2 1/2 years since the 2016 election, the number of people touched by Russia's election interference has continued to balloon. Reports produced for Senate investigators last year revealed that IRA (Internet Research Agency) posts on Instagram received 187 million engagements and that IRA posts on Facebook received almost 77 million engagements. \u2014 Miles Parks ] In the report: Page 46 By no later than April 12, 2016, the GRU had gained access to the DCCC computer network using the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully spearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network, identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network. [ Russian intelligence agents had access to the networks of the DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) and the Democratic National Committee for months. They \"traversed\" the Democratic Party's digital infrastructure, in part, by stealing the credentials of the people tasked with protecting it. Russian agents compromised at least 59 computers in all between April 12, 2016, and June 8, 2016, the special counsel's office also said in the report. \u2014 Miles Parks ] In the report: Page 58 \"In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. [ This aspect of Russia's election interference exposed just how vulnerable U.S. elections are. There remains no evidence that any votes were changed as a result of Russian cyber-activity, but operatives were able to break into a board of elections website in Illinois and steal voter data on thousands of U.S. voters. Despite security improvements over the past two years and a newfound awareness of the threat, voting in America remains a massive target. The decentralized nature of how elections are administered means states and localities are on the front line of defense against entire nation-states. And it remains unclear whether lawmakers will allocate adequate resources soon enough to further shore up the system before a presidential election that is about a year and a half away. \u2014 Miles Parks ] In the report: Page 59 Similarly, in November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election. The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software (commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer. The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes that this operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained above, did not undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do so. [ This is new. The FBI believes that the Russian attackers (GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency) gained access to the network of at least one Florida county. No county in the state has revealed a breach publicly. It remains unclear which county, how long Russia had access to the county's network and exactly what information the attackers gained access to. \u2014 Miles Parks ] In the report: Page 59 Unit 74455 also sent spearphishing emails to public officials involved in election administration and personnel at companies involved in voting technology. In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of REDACTED, a voting technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company network. [ The company referenced here seems to be VR Systems, a Florida-based company that makes voter registration equipment. In an interview with NPR's Pam Fessler six months after the 2016 election, the company's chief operating officer said Russian hackers were unsuccessful in breaking into their systems. But today's report, and an indictment filed last summer by Mueller's team, disagree. One of the tough contradictions about American voting is the transparency, or lack thereof, from the companies responsible for election security. Even though elections are technically supervised at the state and local levels, in most cases the equipment that voters use to cast their ballots, have their votes counted and to check-in at the polls \u00a0is run by companies in the private sector. That makes forcing them to provide information about potential breaches, or their own security practices, incredibly difficult. \"There is far too little transparency from voting machine vendors about whether their products are secure against hackers and foreign interference,\" Sen. Ron Wyden told NPR ahead of the report's public release. \"Over and over again the corporations that are essentially gatekeepers of our democracy have either lied or refused to answer questions from me, from states and from security experts about what steps they've taken to protect our election infrastructure. I am convinced we cannot rely on these companies to do the right thing on their own.\" \u2014 Miles Parks ] In the report: Page 77 Cohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with I.C. Expert or its agents. In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with [Russian real estate development corporation] I.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization. Cohen provided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him the project was continuing. Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project) and Donald J. Trump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project) during the fall of 2015. [During the campaign and into the Trump administration, the Trump team and Donald Trump himself regularly denied any involvement with Russia. But the Mueller report concludes that Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were all apprised of a Trump Tower Moscow project that was being actively considered in 2015 and 2016. Elsewhere, the report makes clear that this wasn't a casual enterprise to the Trump family; it could have been a billion-dollar deal. The project ultimately didn't go forward, but the report makes clear that the Trumps' claims about not having any business dealings in Russia weren't accurate. \u00a0\u2014 Tim Mak ] In the report: Page 101 f. Trump Campaign Knowledge of \"Dirt\" Papadopoulos admitted telling at least one individual outside of the Campaign \u2014 specifically, the then-Greek foreign minister \u2014 about Russia's obtaining Clinton-related emails. In addition, a different foreign government informed the FBI that, 10 days after meeting with Mifsud in late April 2016, Papadopoulos suggested that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton. (This conversation occurred after the GRU spearphished Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta and stole his emails, and the GRU hacked into the DCCC and DNC, see Volume l, Sections III.A & III.B, supra.) Such disclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulos informed any Trump Campaign official about the emails. When interviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told the Office that they could not recall Papadopoulos's sharing the information that Russia had obtained \"dirt\" on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information about Clinton. [ Papadopoulos is the origin of the Russia investigation. When the FBI got wind of the overtures he was receiving from Russian agents, it kicked off the events that brought us to today. What this section establishes is that although the Russians whom Papadopoulos met were offering him dirt on Hillary Clinton, no one involved recalls discussing that. Papadopoulos and others, including Trump advisers Sam Clovis and Stephen Miller, now say they don't recall discussing the Russian offers at the time Papadopoulos was receiving them. \u00a0\u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 181 In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities. [ The Trump campaign engaged with some offers of help in 2016 and welcomed the support it was getting indirectly from fellow travelers such as WikiLeaks. But the substance of that activity did not amount to a criminal conspiracy, the special counsel's office concluded, and that's why no Americans have been charged with colluding with the Russian interference. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 195 Even assuming that the promised \"documents and information that would incriminate Hillary\" constitute a \"thing of value\" under campaign-finance law, the government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. [ Why didn't the Trump Tower meeting violate campaign finance laws that bar foreigners from giving a \"thing of value\" to an American campaign? Investigators spell out in this section that they didn't believe they could prove that the people in the meeting knew they were breaking the law, as would be required to obtain and sustain a conviction. That's why Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort didn't face charges connected with their meeting in New York City with a delegation of Russians in June 2016. Manafort did face other charges and was sentenced to prison, but prosecutors didn't allege any lawbreaking connected to the Trump Tower meeting. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 214 if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. [ The special counsel's office acknowledges that President Trump may have obstructed justice but that it can't make that determination with the evidence it has. It left the matter unresolved, and ultimately Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that Trump had not broken the law and will not face prosecution. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 215 Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting with Comey. Referring to the FBI's investigation of Flynn, the President said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" Shortly after requesting Flynn's resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel's Office attorney thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered. [ Another instance of a Trump aide refusing to carry out a Trump directive. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 217 One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions's job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through. [ Two more instances of aides or allies declining to follow presidential directives. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 218 After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \"flip,\" contacted him directly to tell him to \"stay strong,\" and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a \"rat,\" and suggested that his family members had committed crimes. [ In congressional testimony under oath, Michael Cohen said that he did not seek a pardon and that he would not accept one, having spurned Trump. Trump then said that, in fact, Cohen had asked for a pardon, and the report establishes that those talks did take place. Cohen's attorneys have sought to explain that there were some discussions but then Cohen closed the door and committed to cooperate with Republicans and investigators. All the same, Republicans have said Cohen lied to Congress and have called for a perjury investigation by the Justice Department because of it. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 219 Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time, the President's position as the head of the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing officialproceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses-all of which is relevant to a potential obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the President's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system's integrity is the same. [ Obstruction of justice is a difficult crime to prove under any circumstances, prosecutors say, but these were no ordinary circumstances. Here, investigators explain their thinking and the significance they applied to their determination that President Trump hadn't conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Because he hadn't, they write, that bears on the state of mind he had when he acted. He couldn't have been trying to cover up an underlying crime, so other possible motives had to be considered. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 218 In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns. [ Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey? Not to conceal evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian interference in the election, Mueller's team concluded. But one reason may have been Trump's fear that the FBI would uncover other things about him or his campaign that he understood to be crimes. The multiple possible other reasons for Trump's actions, as well as the inability of investigators to establish definitively why he acted, are what make obstruction-of-justice cases so difficult to prove. At the same time, this conclusion conflicts somewhat with the analysis on Thursday by Attorney General William Barr, who said the fact of no underlying conspiracy \"bears on\" the decision not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. For one thing, obstruction doesn't require the commission of an underlying crime. And for another, this portion of the report suggests that Trump might have been aware that there were crimes he could keep from the FBI by getting rid of Comey. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 251 Towards the end of the lunch, the President brought up Comey and asked if Christie was still friendly with him. Christie said he was. The President told Christie to call Comey and tell him that the President \"really like[s] him. Tell him he's part of the team.\" At the end of the lunch, the President repeated his request that Christie reach out to Comey. Christie had no intention of complying with the President's request that he contact Comey. He thought the President's request was \"nonsensical\" and Christie did not want to put Comey in the position of having to receive such a phone call. Christie thought it would have been uncomfortable to pass on that message. [ Chris Christie, then New Jersey's governor, ignores Trump's request to call Comey. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 284 In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the President about his decision to fire Comey and then spoke to reporters in a televised press conference. Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, \"[a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position.\" In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to review Comey's performance and that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter indicated that the \"vast majority\" of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said, \"Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.\" Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments. Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from \"countless members of the FBI\" was a \"slip of the tongue.\" She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made \"in the heat of the moment\" that was not founded on anything. [ One reason given by the White House for terminating FBI Director James Comey was that he had lost the support of rank-and-file FBI personnel. But then-Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was later ousted over his own problems with the Justice Department, contradicted that account not long thereafter. And as White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made clear to investigators in this section of the report, the statement about the FBI's loss of support for Comey was just made up in the moment and not founded on any accounts from within the bureau. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 290 The President learned of the Special Counsel's appointment from Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI Director. Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the news. According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, \"Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm f***ed.\" The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, \"How could you let this happen, Jeff?\" The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had \"let [him] down,\" contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, \"you were supposed to protect me,\" or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, \"Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\" The President then told Sessions he should resign as Attorney General. [A highly consequential moment \u2014 one that's highly telling about the Trump presidency. The episode makes a number of things clear: why Trump smoldered with such anger at then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions over what he felt was a betrayal by Sessions in recusing himself from the Russia investigation; how Trump viewed the role of attorney general \u2014 as a lawyer for the president whose responsibility is as much to \"protect\" him as serve as the nation's highest law enforcement officer; and Trump's instant determination to oppose special counsel Robert Mueller and criticize his investigation. This all set the stage for Trump's current attorney general, William Barr, whom critics accuse of covering for Trump by deciding not to bring criminal charges connected with alleged obstruction of justice. Barr says that the prerogative is his, and Mueller's findings don't require it. Barr also observed that Trump could have refused to cooperate with the special counsel \u2014 but he did cooperate and directed everyone in his administration to cooperate as well. Moreover, Trump was within his rights to take information \u2014 including, potentially, this passage \u2014 out of the redacted report and cite executive privilege, which permits an administration to keep some of its internal workings from public view. Trump didn't, as Barr pointed out, and this and other incidents were kept in the document. \u2014 Susan Davis and Philip Ewing] In the report: Page 293 On May 23, 2017, the Department of Justice announced that ethics officials had determined that the Special Counsel's prior law firm position did not bar his service, generating media reports that Mueller had been cleared to serve. McGahn recalled that around the same time, the President complained about the asserted conflicts and prodded McGahn to reach out to Rosenstein about the issue. McGahn said he responded that he could not make such a call and that the President should instead consult his personal lawyer because it was not a White House issue. Contemporaneous notes of a May 23, 2017 conversation between McGahn and the President reflect that McGahn told the President that he would not call Rosenstein and that he would suggest that the President not make such a call either. [ Don McGahn, then the White House counsel, again denied a presidential request to interfere at the Justice Department. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 308 By the end of that weekend, Priebus recalled that the President relented and agreed not to ask Sessions to resign. Over the next several days, the President tweeted about Sessions. On the morning of Monday, July 24, 2017, the President criticized Sessions for neglecting to investigate Clinton and called him \"beleaguered.\" On July 25, the President tweeted, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!\" The following day, July 26, the President tweeted, \"Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation.\" According to Hunt, in light of the President's frequent public attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House. [ President Trump's relationship with his first attorney general was fraught. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation because he couldn't be involved in an investigation into a campaign of which he had been a part. That outraged Trump and nearly brought Sessions' tenure to an early end \u2014 but ultimately Sessions hung on until November 2018. However, Sessions considered his situation so delicate that, as this passage describes, he had his resignation letter on his person every time he went to the White House, in case he needed it. \u2014 Philip Ewing ] In the report: Page 320 Because Porter knew [Rachel] Brand, the President asked him to sound her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General. Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show that the President told Porter to \"Keep in touch with your friend,\" in reference to Brand. Later, the President asked Porter a few times in passing whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task. [ Another instance of a Trump aide ignoring a presidential request. \u2014 Susan Davis ] In the report: Page 431 I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that any foreign government or foreign leader had provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign. [ Trump says in written answers to the special counsel's office that he doesn't remember knowing in real time in 2016 that Russia had offered help to his campaign. He says he also doesn't remember knowing about the Trump Tower meeting specifically. People who worked for Trump have said nothing that took place in his campaign or his business happened without his awareness; Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, specifically told Congress that he suspected that Trump had authorized the Trump Tower meeting with the Russian delegation beforehand. But Trump says he does not recall that \u2014 one of more than 30 things the special counsel's office said the president did not recall. Investigators sought follow-up questions with Trump, which he refused, and although they debated seeking a subpoena to try to compel testimony from him, they ultimately decided not to try to obtain one. \u2014 Philip Ewing ]",

            "article_content": "Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers. The news world is ravenously awaiting the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference. But Attorney General William Barr's two trips to the Capitol last week strongly suggest that the version of the report he releases will only whet the appetites of many in Congress and beyond for more information. That means the tension between President Trump and Congress is likely to escalate into a constitutional confrontation involving the competing authorities of at least two branches of government. As these storm clouds gather, Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers in this lawyerly version of Game of Thrones. Barr clearly intends to be at the center of the storm. And perhaps he has meant to be so ever since he sent a 19-page critique of the Mueller investigation to the Justice Department nearly a year ago, calling its approach to obstruction-of-justice charges \"fatally misconceived.\" That memo was a precursor to the four-page letter that Barr sent to Congress last month after reviewing the Mueller report. In that letter, Barr looked at the Mueller report's inconclusive statement on obstruction and determined that there was no case for obstruction. Mueller explicitly said his report was not exonerating the president on obstruction, but Barr decided it was. And last week, Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not want to discuss that element of the conflict at hand. That prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to say Barr was acting more like an attorney for the president than as the attorney for the United States. Not every observer will go that far, but Barr must have known he was opening himself up for exactly that kind of attack. In past crises of this kind, his predecessors as attorney general have often tried to either find a middle ground or distance themselves from the mortal combat between occupants of the White House and the Capitol. Typically, they have had close ties to the president who appointed them, yet most have looked to position themselves on higher ground \u2014 or what at least appeared to be safer ground. Take Barr's luckless immediate predecessor, Jeff Sessions. As a multiterm Republican senator from Alabama, Sessions was the first in his chamber to endorse Donald Trump for president. That got him a formal role in the Trump campaign and, after the election, the Cabinet job he had always wanted most \u2014 attorney general. But Sessions' time in his dream job was cut short. It turned out that he and his boss had failed to communicate on the matter of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the probe the FBI had already begun. To the president's surprise, Sessions felt he had to respect Justice Department rules and recuse himself from the Russia probe because he had been part of the Trump campaign. This left his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, to appoint a special counsel to run the probe after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. That's how Mueller came on the scene, deepening and widening the investigation into the Russian efforts and many tangential issues as well. Unable to stop Mueller, Trump turned his rage on Sessions for his decision to recuse himself. The Alabamian endured months of public criticism, personal insults and Twitter rants, only to be unceremoniously forced out right after the 2018 midterm elections. Sessions' predecessor was President Barack Obama's second attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who was in office when the Russia probe began and when the FBI was also looking into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. In the more normal course of things, that FBI report would have gone to Lynch, who would have determined whether to prosecute. But Lynch turned the matter over to FBI Director Comey, at least in part to avoid the blowback from her own ties to the Clintons. (Former President Bill Clinton had briefly met with her privately on an airport tarmac in the spring of 2016.) Comey declined to recommend prosecution in that case, but he also leveled a broadside at Clinton for \"extremely careless\" handling of the matter. Later, just weeks before the election, he briefly indicated that his investigation might be reopened (he subsequently said no new evidence had been found to necessitate reopening the case). President George W. Bush had problems with his attorney general picks too. The first, former Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, set off on a number of crusades of his own, then balked at his boss' efforts to use U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on potential terrorists inside the country. (He was bolstered in that reluctance by his deputy, who was Comey.) In 2005, Bush named his second attorney general, longtime Texas crony Alberto Gonzales. But Gonzales ran into trouble carrying out what appeared to be White House orders to purge U.S. attorneys around the country who failed to find voter fraud cases to prosecute after being told it was a priority. Gonzales resigned in September 2007, after Democrats had taken over both chambers of Congress and launched a series of hearings. As president, Bill Clinton had one attorney general, Janet Reno, for all eight of his years in office. But Reno was often remarkably independent, not least in appointing a special counsel in 1994 to investigate Clinton's real estate deals in Arkansas. Her first appointee found little to prosecute, but Congress reauthorized the probe and a panel of federal judges appointed a new special counsel named Ken Starr, who took the probe in new directions. One of those directions turned up former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who said she had a sexual affair with the president. Clinton's denials and testimony to a grand jury led to his impeachment by the House in 1998. While Reno had not appointed Starr or otherwise directly contributed to Clinton's impeachment, she could scarcely be seen as his fiercest defender. The classic case of a president's fraught relationship with his attorneys general had to be Richard Nixon and the five men who served him in that capacity. The first was his old law partner, John Mitchell, who had the job for three years before resigning to run Nixon's re-election campaign. That campaign turned out to include burglaries and other forms of \"dirty tricks\" that begot the upheaval known as the Watergate scandal. Mitchell would eventually serve 19 months in federal incarceration for his role in the original Watergate burglary and cover-up. Nixon's second attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, inherited the burgeoning scandal and was considered a team player. But he also let the Watergate investigation go forward. He resigned in the spring of 1973 as the evidence began to point back at the president himself. Nixon then appointed Boston Brahmin Elliot Richardson as attorney general in hopes of easing the pressure on Watergate. But Richardson brought in Archibald Cox as special prosecutor. Cox was a dogged investigator who would soon subpoena the tape recordings from Nixon's Oval Office. Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox, and Richardson resigned instead, as did his deputy, William Ruckelshaus (these events on one October weekend in 1973 were known as the Saturday Night Massacre). Nixon finally managed to get Cox fired, but to do so he had to go to the Justice Department's third-ranking official, Solicitor General Robert Bork. Nixon was surprised by the negative reactions from Congress and much of the public, and Bork persuaded him to name a new special prosecutor, the conservative Texas Democrat Leon Jaworski. The new man had said he considered the whole Watergate scandal overblown, but once installed as Cox's successor, he came to see the evidence differently. He made a number of cases and made them stick in federal court. Given this variegated history of positions taken by some of the more prominent attorneys general over the past half-century, it was striking to note the \"all-in\" character of Barr's testimony last week. Appearing before the House and Senate judiciary committees, Barr once again displayed the attitude that the nearly 400-page report and its supporting documents are the exclusive property of the Justice Department, headed by himself. Access for all others will be at his discretion. As before, Barr says any release must await the scouring of every page for problematic or sensitive material \u2014 of which there are several varieties. Few might dispute the need to black out uncorroborated grand jury testimony or secret material legitimately affecting national security. But Barr has also made clear he will protect \"peripheral third parties\" and other matters he deems sensitive. And those determinations will be made by Barr, perhaps in concert with lawyers working for him. As for those people in Congress eagerly awaiting the report, Barr said he would be willing to work with the chairs of the judiciary committees in both chambers to see if they might glimpse portions of the report not being made public. But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham both have marked out positions of their own on this issue, each asserting more of an outright claim on Mueller material than Barr seems to want to admit. Nadler, a New York Democrat, said his committee has a right to the whole report and all its underlying documents. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has strongly suggested he expects to get the real goods too, while being careful not to sound at odds with the attorney general. Graham has gone from being an acerbic Trump critic in 2016 to being one of Trump's strongest advocates. None of this should be surprising. Barr has been on the job for just over two months, after Trump announced in December his intention to nominate Barr. Even then it was widely understood that Barr's job would be to take the Mueller investigation in hand. Having not been involved in the 2016 Trump campaign, he had no obligation to recuse himself from the Russia probe the way his predecessor had. But Congress does have an administrative responsibility over the courts and the legal system. If the president cannot be indicted by the executive branch \u2014 which is the policy position long asserted by Barr's department \u2014 then only Congress has the power to contemplate any action against the president. Even Trump-friendly Graham has made this point, telling Barr that he risks seeming less than forthcoming if he withholds too much of the report. \"If you agree you can't indict the president, it's probably not a good reason not to share with us the derogatory information and executive privilege. You have to really watch about that being used to deny transparency,\" Graham said. In other words, Congress has a right and an obligation to examine the evidence \u2014 whatever it is. That makes the disposition of the Mueller report fundamentally a matter of constitutional checks and balances. Some say Congress would need to initiate impeachment proceedings before it could assert its claim on that evidence. But others argue the claim is rightful, legitimate and timely even now. In effect, they would argue Barr should have turned over what he got from Mueller as soon as Congress requested it \u2014 even while making the redactions he sees fit to make. Some form of compromise might eventuate here, but it is more likely that this dispute will reach the Supreme Court. If so, it may be the most explosive of all the hand grenades that are expected to be landing in the high court's black-robed lap in the months just ahead.",

            "article_content": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrives in a police vehicle at Westminster Magistrates court on Thursday in London. He was arrested by Scotland Yard police officers inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in Central London.\n                \n                    \n                    Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrives in a police vehicle at Westminster Magistrates court on Thursday in London. He was arrested by Scotland Yard police officers inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in Central London. Updated at 9:57 p.m. ET The Justice Department announced Thursday that it is charging Julian Assange, setting the stage for a historic legal showdown with the controversial founder of WikiLeaks. The unsealing of an indictment dated more than a year ago followed a whirlwind reversal of fortune for Assange, who was ejected from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he confined himself for years, and then hauled into custody by officers of the Metropolitan Police. Not only did Ecuador withdraw protection for Assange, according to wire service reports, the government has arrested a person who is allegedly close to WikiLeaks. Reuters quotes Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo as saying the person was picked up in Ecuador while trying to travel to Japan. British authorities have received a request to extradite Assange, they said. He is expected to appear at a hearing on May 2. Justice Department investigators have described the key role that they say Assange and WikiLeaks played in the Russian attack on the 2016 election, but the charges announced on Thursday allude to an earlier chapter in his long-running drama. The indictment unsealed on Thursday alleged: in March 2010, Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to ...  a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications. Manning was tried and convicted for the role she played in releasing U.S. government secrets to WikiLeaks; she served more than six years in prison before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama. More recently, Manning was ordered into custody again after a judge found her in contempt of court. Manning reportedly refused to give evidence to a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia in a case also connected to Assange. It wasn't clear whether the revelations about the existence of that grand jury proceeding could mean there is another indictment in store for Assange. The one unsealed against him was dated March 6, 2018. Manning's attorneys said on Thursday that the Justice Department's ability to file the charges showed it didn't need her to provide evidence and demanded that she be released. \"Grand juries may not be used for the sole and dominant purpose of preparing for trial, including questioning potential trial witnesses. Since her testimony can no longer contribute to a grand jury investigation, Chelsea's ongoing detention can no longer be seriously alleged to constitute an attempt to coerce her testimony,\" said lawyers Moira Meltzer-Cohen, Vincent Ward, Chris Leibig and Sandra Freeman. There had been suggestions in the past that a case against Assange was in the works. The Justice Department said it did not plan to release any additional information about Assange on Thursday. Trump: Not my thing President Trump, who professed his love for WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign when it revealed material that embarrassed Democrats, said at the White House on Thursday that he didn't have any knowledge about the charges against Assange. \"It's not my thing,\" the president said. What happens next is up to Attorney General William Barr, Trump said. The Ecuadorian Assange had been holed up at the embassy in London since 2012, after Ecuador granted him asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden in connection with sexual misconduct allegations. One of the Swedish cases against Assange expired, but another may still pose a legal threat to him. Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer representing the unnamed woman who accused Assange of rape, told NPR by email that she and her client would do everything they can to get the Swedish police to reopen the investigation. That case \u2014 and fear by Assange that Stockholm might extradite him to the United States if he went to Sweden to address it \u2014 prompted him to confine himself in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. British authorities respected the customs associated with the privileges each nation affords to another's diplomatic facilities and did not venture inside to arrest him. That changed on Thursday when Ecuador's ambassador said that Quito had revoked its asylum for Assange. Metropolitan Police officers could go in to serve their warrant. When they came back out, video footage appeared to show them carrying a bearded Assange to a police vehicle. Protest, support, criticism, controversy Last week, people gathered outside the embassy after WikiLeaks announced that Assange might be \"expelled\" from the building within \"hours to days.\" On the day of Assange's arrest, WikiLeaks pleaded for his protection, tweeting that \"Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimize and imprison him.\" Ecuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno described the government's decision to withdraw his asylum, describing his \"aggressive behavior.\" Moreno accused Assange of installing prohibited electronic and distortion equipment, blocking security cameras, mistreating guards, accessing embassy files and threatening the Ecuadorian government. He also said Assange had intervened in international affairs by working with WikiLeaks to publish leaked Vatican documents. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, expressed hopes that \"all his rights will be respected.\" Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, gave Assange data it stole in cyberattacks in 2016 so that he could release it as part of Russia's interference in the presidential election, prosecutors say. Assange also once hosted a talk show on Russia's state-backed media network RT. The war logs and the State cables WikiLeaks first gained notoriety in 2010 when it began to release troves of U.S. government secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Washington's conduct of diplomacy around the world. The files also revealed the identities of people who had worked with Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading officials to warn their lives may have been put in danger. Assange and his supporters have long maintained that he is a journalist and that WikiLeaks is a news organization like those protected by the First Amendment and other free-press laws around the world. Assange's revelations about the conduct of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the internal discussions within the State Department and other such matters amount to journalism and accordingly he has never committed any crime, boosters argue. Said Assange's attorney, Barry Pollack: While the indictment against Julian Assange disclosed today charges a conspiracy to commit computer crimes, the factual allegations against Mr. Assange boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source. Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges. Prosecutors' choice to focus their case on the alleged cyberattack suggests the Justice Department's case against Assange may depend less on questions about journalism or reportage and more on the technical aspects of what happened. Critics argue that any claim Assange could make to being a journalist has been voided by the work he did serving as an arm of Russia's \"active measures.\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said Assange is overdue for a reckoning in an American court. Said Warner: Julian Assange has long professed high ideals and moral superiority. Unfortunately, whatever his intentions when he started WikiLeaks, what he's really become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West and a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security. It is my hope that the British courts will quickly transfer him to U.S. custody so he can finally get the justice he deserves. The election interference Assange's trial may answer many other questions about the other chapters in his story. For example, in January 2019 the Justice Department announced charges against GOP political consultant Roger Stone connected with what authorities called work by him and others as alleged intermediaries between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Stone has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including lying to Congress and obstructing its investigation. Stone says he hasn't done anything wrong. Stone's trial and Assange's eventual trial may reveal more about the nature of the contacts they and others carried on in 2016. All the same, Attorney General Barr has said that special counsel Robert Mueller has not established there was a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and the Russians who interfered in the election. Washington and the world are waiting to learn more from a redacted copy of Mueller's full report, which is expected next week. NPR reporter James Doubek contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump sees vindication in the attorney general's conclusions on the Mueller report. How will that translate to his re-election bid, and what will his legal strategy be moving forward?  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: President Trump is expressing relief that the special counsel investigation is over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's lasted a long time. We're glad it's over. It's 100 percent the way it should have been. I wish it could have gone a lot sooner, a lot quicker. CORNISH: Though he remains critical of the process that played out over the past two years. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us now to talk about how the president and his allies are moving forward. And, Tamara, do we know the White House position on whether the Mueller report - the full report should be released? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, President Trump was asked about it today, and he said that it's up to the attorney general, but it wouldn't bother him at all. White House officials have been making extensive media rounds today, and they too are saying that it's really up to Attorney General Barr. Earlier today I talked to Sarah Sanders, who said that the White House has not seen the contents of the Mueller report and that they are not asking to see the contents. Though one spokesman who was making those media rounds did say that the White House does expect that Barr would come to them - the attorney general would come to them and ask if there were any materials that could be protected by executive privilege. But it's not clear that there are any of those materials, and it's not clear what the White House would do in that case. CORNISH: The president today acknowledged that special counsel Mueller conducted himself honorably. At the same time, he still slammed the investigation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING). TRUMP: It was a false narrative. It was a terrible thing. We can never let this happen to another president again, I can tell you that. I say it very strongly. Very few people I know could have handled it. We can never ever let this happen to another president again. CORNISH: Are we looking at a president who plans on letting this go? KEITH: Oh, he's not planning to let it go at all. Sanders - I asked her that question. She said that the president has spent two years being attacked by the media and Democrats, and so why would he let it go? And not only is the president going to keep talking about it, but his allies on the Hill, including Lindsey Graham, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, are now talking about investigating the investigators. And, you know, there is a communication strategy here. All of these media interviews that the White House has been doing, they keep saying no collusion, no obstruction. They're glossing over some of the nuance in Attorney General Barr's letter. And they're all doing this before the full Mueller report has been released. Part of this is just they're out to celebrate, they have good news. But part of it is also working to lock in this idea in the minds of voters and others before any additional information comes out that, you know, no collusion, no obstruction, say it one more time. CORNISH: How do you expect these developments to affect the president's re-election campaign? KEITH: Well, part of his appeal to supporters has always been about everyone being against him - and them, by extension. And this fits right in with that. A campaign official I spoke to said that the president will use the events of the last two years against Democrats and the media. Mark Lauder (ph) is the director of strategic communications for the campaign, the 2020 campaign. And he told me that he thinks that this Mueller report news both clears a dark cloud that had been hanging over the president and will cause some voters to possibly reconsider what they think of him. MARK LAUDER: It will provide for millions of Americans the opportunity that, despite all they heard for two years from the national media, that now we know to be not true, that they might take another look at this president, see the results that he's having. KEITH: And we're going to get our first preview of this on Thursday. President Trump has his first post-Mueller report rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. And you can expect that he'll take something of a victory lap there. CORNISH: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks for your reporting. KEITH: You're welcome.

The Justice Department is expected to send a summary of his findings to Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Special counsel Robert Mueller walks with his wife, Ann, in Washington, D.C., on Sunday. The Justice Department is expected to send a summary of his findings to Congress. Updated at 6:56 p.m. ET Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence that President Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election, according to a summary of findings submitted to Congress by Attorney General William Barr. \"The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\" Barr wrote in a letter to leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees on Sunday afternoon. That was despite \"multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign,\" he wrote. However, Mueller's investigation did not take a position on whether Trump obstructed justice by trying to frustrate the ongoing investigation. \"[W]hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" Barr quotes from Mueller's report. The attorney general wrote that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had concluded that the findings of the special counsel were \"not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\" The Justice Department leaders reached that conclusion, Barr wrote, without regard to the \"constitutional considerations\" that surround whether the department can seek an indictment of a sitting president. White House exults Trump talked with reporters as he prepared to return from Florida to the White House, calling the investigation \"an illegal take-down that failed.\" \"It was just announced there was no collusion with Russia, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. There was no obstruction, and it was a complete and total exoneration,\" Trump said before boarding Air Force One. \"It's a shame our country had to go through this, and to be honest, it's a shame your president had to go through this.\" Trump also said: \"Hopefully someone's going to look at the other side,\" seeming to revive suggestions that he wanted an investigation into his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, which he has called for several times. At Trump's rallies, there are frequent chants of \"Lock her up!\" FBI Director James Comey announced in 2016 that Clinton would not be charged. Credit:  AP Trump's outside attorneys, including Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, released a statement on Sunday hailing what they said was \"a complete and total vindication of the president.\" Top Republicans also seized on the news, arguing that Trump has now been absolved. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who played golf on Sunday afternoon in Florida with the president, said in a statement: \"Good day for the rule of law. Great day for President Trump and his team.\" No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \"The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report,\" Graham added. \"Bad day for those hoping the Mueller investigation would take President Trump down.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. said: \"It is abundantly clear, without a shadow of a doubt, there was no collusion ... This case is closed.\" Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said Barr's letter should \"assure every American there was no collusion between Russia and Donald Trump or his campaign.\" \"The special counsel's investigation was long, thorough and conclusive: There was no collusion. There is no constitutional crisis,\" Collins added. \"As the report states, 'the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.' \" Collins also urged House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to \"rethink\" the committee's ongoing investigations and shift to focus on issues such as immigration and criminal justice reform. Democrats wary Nadler, however, was more cautious and seized on the language by Barr that suggests Mueller's report left in limbo the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. \"Mueller clearly and explicitly is not exonerating the President, and we must hear from AG Barr about his decision making and see all the underlying evidence for the American people to know all the facts,\" Nadler tweeted. He continued: \"There must be full transparency in what Special Counsel Mueller uncovered to not exonerate the President from wrongdoing. DOJ owes the public more than just a brief synopsis and decision not to go any further in their work.\" Nadler also argued that given the 22 months Mueller spent investigating Trump, the two days that Barr spent boiling down his work is not sufficient. The House Judiciary Committee chairman said he intends to call Barr to testify soon before a hearing. Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer waited more than two hours after the letter's release to issue a statement, writing that it \"raises as many questions as it answers\" and continuing to call for the report's full release. The Democratic leaders echoed Nadler in pointing out that Barr's letter notes that Mueller did not exonerate Trump on the question of obstruction. They wrote it \"demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay. Given Mr. Barr's public record of bias against the Special Counsel's inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.\" Details of the investigation Barr wrote that Mueller interviewed about 500 witnesses, made requests to 13 foreign governments for evidence and obtained more than 230 orders for communications records. He also said that Mueller hasn't recommended indictments against anyone else and that there are no sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. The news about no more charges was part of the announcement on Friday when Mueller notified the leaders of the Justice Department that he had completed his work, which began in May 2017. For much of the weekend, Washington has been anticipating the conclusions from Barr, who spent Saturday and Sunday in his office, along with Rosenstein. According to a senior Justice Department official, Barr's chief of staff called White House lawyer Emmet Flood at 3 p.m. to give him a \"readout\" of the letter. Mueller has not been at the Justice Department this weekend, and he \"was not consulted on this letter,\" according to the department. The Justice Department is not giving a timeline as to when it may release additional material from the Mueller investigation, and it will review the report and materials for grand jury information and for information that could implicate ongoing investigations. Widespread calls for openness Calls have been nearly universal and bipartisan for Mueller's original report to be released and for the public or Congress to access its findings and its underlying source material. Many Republicans and Democrats agree that they will not be content only with a Barr-drafted synopsis of the report. \"It needs to be released to the Congress, and it needs to be released to the American people,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told CNN on Sunday morning. \"This has consumed two years of the American people's time, and we need full transparency.\" Congressional Democrats appeared nearly unanimous about the need for wide release, and individual Democratic leaders also tried to pre-empt what they feared might be attempts by the White House to conceal Mueller's findings. Executive privilege Specifically, one long-standing question has been whether Trump might seek to invoke executive privilege, the doctrine that allows an administration to keep secret some of its internal workings. Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, told NBC on Sunday morning that he thinks the president shouldn't attempt it. \"I do not believe it exists here at all because, as we learned from the [Richard] Nixon tapes case, executive privilege cannot be used to hide wrongdoing,\" Nadler said. Continued Nadler: \"In that case, the Supreme Court, nine to nothing, ordered that all the claims of executive privilege be overridden and the tapes be public. ... The president may try to assert it, may try to hide things behind it. But I don't think that's right or [will] be successful.\" Trump hasn't opposed publication Trump, for his part, has said in the past both that he doesn't mind if Mueller's report becomes public \u2014 because he says he has done nothing wrong \u2014 and that there shouldn't have been a Mueller report in the first place. Trump has gone back and forth about what he accepts about Russian interference in 2016, but he has been consistent that neither he nor anyone in his campaign had any connection to it. That idea is a \"hoax\" perpetuated by conspirators and Democrats who are sore that Clinton lost to him, Trump says, and who have been consequently running a \"witch hunt\" against him.

Most people in America want the Electoral College gone, and they want to select a president based on who gets the most votes nationally, polls say. Democratic presidential candidates are weighing in too. \"Every vote matters,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in Mississippi on Monday. \"And the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College.\" That line garnered one of her largest roars of applause for the evening. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren calls for abolishing the Electoral College and moving to a national popular vote: \u201cEvery vote matters\u201d #WarrenTownHall https://t.co/pPFMVywETf pic.twitter.com/yy0J0HgAjc Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke said there is a \"lot of wisdom\" in the idea and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also said she's open to it. The politicians are tapping into what's become a popular position with many voters, especially Democrats. In the U.S., 65 percent of adults think whoever wins the popular vote should hold the nation's highest office, according to an Atlantic/PRRI poll last year. Under the current system, voters in each state cast their ballots for electors, of which 270 are necessary to win. So it's possible for a candidate to win more votes overall across the country than a rival but not be inaugurated because of insufficient support from the Electoral College: a scenario that has occurred twice in the past two decades. But experts say reforming this practice isn't likely anytime soon for a number of reasons. First, there's the Constitutional problem. The amendments Fully overhauling the way the president is selected would take a Constitutional amendment, which would require the votes of two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives, two-thirds of the Senate, and three-fourths of the states. Support of that magnitude has become rare for anything in a sharply divided United States. An amendment hasn't been adopted since the 27th, in 1992, and one hasn't been adopted relatively quickly since the 26th, which took 100 days from proposal to adoption in 1971. President Trump once supported abolishing the Electoral College \u2014 he previously felt it was a \"total disaster for democracy\" \u2014 but since his 2016 presidential victory over Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but Trump received 304 electoral votes, he has changed his mind. Now, Trump feels the Electoral College is \"far better for the U.S.A.\" as he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. That position, shared by many Republicans, makes it highly unlikely that there would be sufficient support for changing the system. \"There's no realistic chance of a Constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College,\" said Jacob Levy, a professor of political theory at McGill University. The state way There may, however, be another way. A number of states have signed onto a pact that guarantees their Electoral College votes to the winner of the popular vote, no matter the outcome in their individual states. The compact would only go into effect once the number of states involved surpasses the 270 Electoral College vote threshold that is required to win the presidency. Today the pact has the support of states \u2014 and Washington D.C. \u2014 that total 181 electoral votes, largely those that have gone for Democrats in recent years. The pact raises questions of its own for democracy: It creates a situation in which voters in, for example, Colorado, may cast most of their votes for the Democrat in a presidential race \u2014 but the state might wind up giving its electors to the Republican depending on the national outcome. That might invite legal challenges from candidates or voters' groups if it took place. The cases for and against Supporters of a national popular vote argue something must be done; the Electoral College disproportionately inflates the influence of rural areas while undervaluing the votes of cities. That, critics say, means devaluing the votes of many non-white voters too. \"It really does over-represent some sparsely populated states, and it provides some skew and bias to our system that I just don't think is healthy anymore,\" said Paul Gronke, a political scientist at Reed College. Gronke notes, however, that there would be major administrative challenges if the U.S. ever got to the point of switching to a national popular vote. Would the federal government get into the business of administering the elections, or leave that up to state and local officials, as it does today? Could Washington administer a national recount in the event of a close result? \"How would that work?\" Gronke asks. \"You look at the Florida situation we had in 2000 \u2014 that already took a lot of time and effort, but imagine if that was done across the country. It's just not clear how you could do that.\" Gary Gregg, who leads the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville, says that if today's system over-privileges rural states, a national popular vote would be just as unfair in the opposite direction. Trump made a similar argument earlier this week, warning that \"smaller states & then entire Midwest would end up losing all power.\" ....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - & we can\u2019t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A. Gregg says that change would radicalize politics. \"The game will not be any longer to be a [politician who is] liberal but be able to appeal to a rural Ohioan,\" he said. \"The game will be: Be a liberal \u2014 to the extent I can maximize votes in major urban centers.\" Jacob Levy, of McGill University, disagreed with that argument. \"Precisely what it does is proportionately advantages where the people are,\" Levy said. \"And places where there are more people become more important when you're counting votes.\" Still, Levy said if he had to bet on whether the U.S. will still be using the Electoral College in 20 years \u2014 he thinks it will.",

Jackson is among the women judges playing a central role in the Russia investigation. Years from now, when people look back on the aftermath of Russia's attack on the 2016 election, a key part of that history will have been written by women. Most of the federal judges in Washington, D.C. \u2014 who have been quietly managing the grand jury process and presiding over arraignments and guilty pleas for nearly two years \u2014 happen to be women. It's a time when Washington's legal establishment worries about lost confidence in the justice system because of partisan attacks, including by President Trump. So judges appointed by presidents from both political parties, including Trump himself, have largely tried to operate above the fray \u2014 winning praise from experts across the political spectrum for their competence and efficiency. Addy Schmitt, a partner at the Miller and Chevalier law firm who served as a law clerk at the D.C. courthouse, said there's a long tradition of high-profile cases there, from Watergate to today. \"The women on the D.C. federal bench are playing a critical role in these historic events, and it is so exciting to watch,\" Schmitt said. The judges \"have all handled pressure and adversity to get where they are and that experience is serving them well,\" she said. \"No doubt some will criticize their decisions but it will be hard to criticize their thoughtfulness and integrity.\" Another part of that response came last week at an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans. In a panel about the evolving challenge of judging, senior U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman reported this: \"Well, I'm in the District of Columbia \u2014 not much is happening.\" As the crowd roared with laughter, he added: \"I am very proud of my colleagues. You come to the courthouse in the morning, and when there are cameras all over the place, you know that Amy Berman Jackson is busy \u2014 and others.\" Judge Jackson Jackson, 64, has become the decider-in-chief for many people following the investigation led by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Jackson sentenced former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on two conspiracy charges. Jackson delivered a blistering rebuke, accusing Manafort of \"gaming the system\" throughout his entire life and concluding that \"court is one of those places where facts still matter.\" Jackson's alma mater, the Park School, in Baltimore, was so proud of its alumna that it tweeted words of praise and pointed out she was a 1972 graduate. \"The defendant is not public enemy No. 1, but he is also not a victim either,\" Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Paul Manafort's sentencing.Judge Jackson is a Park School alumna graduating with the Class of 1972. pic.twitter.com/0Fvyj9QlmJ Jackson's time in the spotlight is far from over. At some point, the judge will sentence Manafort's former right-hand-man, Trump's former campaign vice chairman Rick Gates, who has pleaded guilty and whose ongoing cooperation with several Justice Department investigations has delayed his day of reckoning. Jackson, who was nominated in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, also is overseeing the case against longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone. Stone, who has pleaded not guilty to obstruction, witness tampering and false statements charges, has tested the judge's patience \u2014 and her gag order \u2014 with inflammatory online posts and public comments. One of his posts targeted Jackson specifically, accusing her of presiding over a \"show trial\" and including a photo of the judge herself. Images of the previously little-known judge became fare for cable TV news and online news reports. Jackson was not pleased and Stone was forced to apologize profusely in court. They had another encounter involving a new edition of a book Stone has written about the Russia investigation. Jackson has warned Stone he will not get another chance to comply, putting him at risk of jail. He's scheduled for trial Nov. 5. \"The skill, care and professionalism with which the judges in D.C. have been handling these highly charged cases provide the public with compelling, real-world examples of the critical and positive role played by a nonpartisan and independent judiciary and by the rule of law,\" said Peter Keisler, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm who served as acting attorney general under former President George W. Bush.

If Jackson has become the best-known face of justice in the Russia cases, another woman has been playing an enormously important role behind the scenes. Beryl Howell, 62, is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, where she supervises the secret grand jury that has been hearing evidence from the Mueller team. That process has been leak-free despite intense interest from the White House and media organizations that on busy days have stationed dozens of producers throughout the building. \"I know she's been working day and night but she isn't telling us what's going on,\" Judge Friedman told the ABA last week about the chief judge. \"She's doing a fabulous job.\" Howell also has been deciding a number of critical disputes, in action that's only entered the public sphere weeks if not months after it began. She delivered a scholarly opinion upholding the special counsel's mandate \u2014 and has weighed in on a variety of sensitive issues along the way in the investigation. Applications for search warrants released this week indicate for the first time that it was Howell who approved the government's request to access emails from former Trump fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen nearly two years ago, early on in the probe. Since then, Howell has ordered a lawyer for Manafort to testify before the grand jury after determining their attorney-client privilege had been pierced because of Manafort's fraud. \"When a person uses the attorney-client relationship to further a criminal scheme, the law is well-established that a claim of attorney-client privilege ... must yield to the grand jury's investigatory needs,\" she wrote. Howell also imposed steep fines against a company with foreign links that's fighting one of Mueller's subpoenas. Her decision was upheld by the federal appeals court in Washington, but the company has taken the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court. In court filings, the mystery company has argued the lower court rulings will \"upset American foreign relations and will produce a boomerang effect\" on the United States. Howell spent years as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, building cases against international narcotics rings and corrupt public officials. She went on to help draft laws on cyber crime and national security as a top aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Howell was named to the bench by Obama in 2010.

One of the newest judges on the bench also has a prominent Russia-related case on her docket. Dabney Friedrich, 51, was nominated to the post by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate in late 2017. Friedrich is overseeing the special counsel's case against Concord Management and Consulting. The company is owned by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a friend of President Vladimir Putin, and accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election and of providing support and direction to online trolls at the now-infamous Internet Research Agency. Earlier this year, Friedrich told a defense lawyer for Concord that his court filings, which referenced the movie \"Animal House,\" cartoon characters and nude selfies, were \"unprofessional, inappropriate, and ineffective.\" \"It's undermining your credibility in this courthouse,\" Friedrich said. \"Knock it off.\" He did. One of the more sensational cases on the D.C. court docket involves Russia, but not the Mueller team. Federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office and at Justice Department headquarters reached a plea deal with Maria Butina, a Russian woman who infiltrated the National Rifle Association and the National Prayer Breakfast to make connections with Republican power brokers. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, 56, is preparing to sentence Butina, likely sometime this spring.

Bob McDonnell gestures as he delivers the Republican Response to the State of the Union in the Virginia House of Delegates chambers at the Capitol in Richmond, Va., on  Jan. 27, 2010. Congratulations, Stacey Abrams, you have just won the most dubious political prize in Washington! Abrams, a former Democratic leader in the Georgia State Assembly, was named last week to respond to President Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Who would question that it's a privilege to deliver the opposition party's response to the president's State of the Union address? Well, perhaps you could start with some of the people who have actually done it. It may seem at first a shining proof of one's political potency, but as a career boost it often loses its oomph. It can even become a burden. To be sure, being granted this opportunity is a stroke of political luck. It's just not clear that the luck has always been good. Take Bobby Jindal, a former congressman and governor and presidential hopeful, who gave the Republican response after President Obama's first speech to a joint session of Congress in 2009. Then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal delivering the Republican Party's official response to then-President Barack Obama's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday Feb. 24, 2009.\n                \n                    \n                    Still image from video/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal delivering the Republican Party's official response to then-President Barack Obama's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday Feb. 24, 2009. The former congressman and future presidential candidate chose to speak from the vestibule of the Governor's Mansion in Baton Rouge and looked like he was in a hotel lobby. His presentation was widely panned, not least by conservative commentators, as both stagey and impolitic (especially in handling sensitive issues such as the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005).  Jindal, then enjoying a meteoric rise, never quite recovered his trajectory. After Jindal, the GOP found another fresh and promising governor in Virginia's Bob McDonnell, who delivered the response to Obama from Richmond in 2010. It was supposed to launch McDonnell's budding career on the national stage, but after four years as governor he was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison on federal corruption charges (a conviction later overturned by the Supreme Court.) It wasn't quite as bad for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who responded to Obama in 2013.  Rubio delivered a response in both English and Spanish, but is mostly remembered for lurching off camera to grab a water bottle.  Rubio was dismissed early in the 2016 presidential primaries but has at least re-established himself in the Senate since. In this frame grab from video, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio takes a sip of water during his Republican response to then-President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2013.\n                \n                    \n                    Still image from video/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this frame grab from video, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio takes a sip of water during his Republican response to then-President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2013. Other recent Republican responders have included former Speaker Paul Ryan and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, both of whom have at least temporarily left politics.  Another, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State, voluntarily left the House Republican leadership last year. The response to the State of the Union sends a politician's name recognition skyward overnight but then leaves that peak moment isolated, a mere spike on the fever chart. Today, people hear you mention senators such as Bill Frist or Jim Webb or governors such as Gary Locke or Mitch Daniels and they have trouble picturing these former State of the Union responders in their minds. That surely goes for Steve Beshear, a former governor of Kentucky, who played the role just two years ago. Still, who could turn down what may be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to speak to the entire nation right after the president? Well, to be fair, it's not the entire nation but that portion of the audience that remains tuned in after the president's done speaking to that portion of the nation that tuned in for him.  Last year, Trump drew 45.6 million people or about 19 percent of the voting age population, a percentage that tends to decline with each year of a president's tenure in office. There also tends to be a bit of a time lag between the address and the response, which the TV networks fill with their own panels of journalists and politicians reacting to the speech. So the audience falls off substantially. And we should add that the opposition responder is far from having equal footing with the president, who speaks before the whole Congress and nearly all the Cabinet and Supreme Court in person in the House Chamber in the U.S. Capitol.  The first responder for the opposition speaks from, well, somewhere else. Then there is the problem of what to say.  The response has routinely consisted of prepared remarks, read from teleprompters.  The logistics of preparing and producing a real-time response only after hearing the president would not only be daunting, but potentially disastrous. In this still image taken from video, Rep. Joe Kennedy III delivers the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union, at Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School in Fall River, Mass., Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this still image taken from video, Rep. Joe Kennedy III delivers the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union, at Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School in Fall River, Mass., Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2018. So even a well-crafted and savvy response can easily sound stilted or stale, especially if delivered in a studio.  The latest Democratic responder, Rep. Josephy Kennedy III from Massachusetts, managed to upgrade his TV moment last year largely by speaking to a live audience in Fall River, Mass. The first generation of these televised opposition party responses emerged in 1966 and 1967.  The president was Lyndon B. Johnson, the responders were the leaders of the Republican minorities in the House (Gerald R. Ford of Michigan) and Senate (Everett Dirksen of Illinois). Ford would later be president, while Dirksen became a Senate office building on Capitol Hill. Thereafter, the GOP began experimenting with a group approach featuring a posse of legislators from around the country. The Democrats followed suit after Republican Richard Nixon became president, and they again relied on the gang-tackle tactic when Ronald Reagan first came to office in the 1980s. The gang in this case, as late as 1982, was ten Democrats who were all white males from Congress. The following year the contingent was an even dozen, including one congresswoman who was also white. Not exactly what you would call looking like the country. After that, the Democrats tried taking the show out of Washington to get closer to \"real people.\" That worked pretty well for Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton in 1985, moderating a group of voters and getting folksy for the camera, perched on a stool. In 1987, the parties and networks agreed to the current format, televising the response live as soon as possible after the State of the Union itself. The first two Democrats who had to follow Reagan's act that year were Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas. Both looked pale and stiff and sounded much like the Dixie-based Democratic Party of generations past. Just two years later, the responding chores passed to a senator from Maine, George Mitchell, and a House Speaker from Washington State, Tom Foley, reflecting the shift in the parties' regional alignment. When Clinton became president in 1993, it had been a dozen years since the Republicans had needed to pick a responder.  They started with their congressional leaders, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois. But in 1995 the GOP looked outside the Capitol to a new governor of their own, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. She managed to embody diversity of age and gender while symbolizing the sweeping Republican victories of the 1994 midterms. (House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who would sit behind Clinton for three State of the Union addresses, did not deliver any of the GOP responses.) When George W. Bush was president, the Democrats mostly relied on their leaders in the House and Senate. Nancy Pelosi took part in the ritual twice. But three Democratic governors from Virginia, Kansas and Washington State were part of the mix as well. In recent years, there has also grown up a new tradition of mutiple responses by politicians who may or may not be speaking for one of the major parties. In 2014, when Rodgers gave the official GOP response (and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida provided a Spanish version), Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky also mounted responses. Lee spoke to a small audience and cameras for the website of the Tea Party Express. Paul posted his rebuttal on his web site, Facebook and YouTube. In similar fashion, when Kennedy responded to President Trump last year, a Spanish language response was offered by Virginia state legislator Elizabeth Guzman, and viewers of cable TV and various websites could also see responses from Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Maxine Waters and former Rep. Donna Edwards. It was against all this complicated backdrop that Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (who makes the choice in alternation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi), looked to an unconventional choice for this week's Democratic response. Abrams is not only the first African American woman to give her party's official response, she is the first person to do so who has held neither a statewide office nor an elected federal office. She is a former head of her party caucus in the Georgia legislature, but on the national stage she is known almost exclusively for having narrowly lost her bid for governor of Georgia in November 2018. But if Abrams is known primarily for a race she lost, at 45 she is also an avatar of her party's rising strength among younger voters, women and people of color. While she ultimately fell short in 2018, she was emblematic of the enormous upwelling of political activism among women that was the defining characteristic of the midterm elections at all levels nationwide. And the response role makes sense for Abrams and her political profile as well. If she wants to run for the U.S. Senate in 2020 (as rumored) it will be helpful to keep her name nationally prominent for fundraising. Alternatively, while there is no shortage of potential running mates for the Democratic ticket next year, Abrams could bring a unique blend of assets to that role. That would be especially true if she can defy the troubled history and uncertain karma of her assignment on Tuesday night.",

Adam Schiff told NPR he intends to use his power to convene hearings, call witnesses and get information. Adam Schiff wants to know who Donald Trump Jr. telephoned as he was organizing the meeting at which he was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. The chairman of the House intelligence committee told NPR he intends to use his power to convene hearings, call witnesses and get information to answer the question about whether Trump Jr., in setting up the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, spoke to his father, then-candidate Donald Trump. The intelligence committee has \"the ability to find out and we will find out,\" Schiff told Morning Edition in an interview airing Thursday. Trump Jr. made a number of contacts in order to organize the meeting at which he, brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian delegation following the offer, via intermediaries, of support for his father's presidential campaign. A few of the calls Trump Jr. made were to a blocked number. Other witnesses have told Congress that Trump used a blocked number. Trump Jr. told members of Congress he didn't remember who he called. Revivified committee investigation Schiff said the intelligence committee will not \"go into all the president's phone calls or all the president's finances,\" but he said it's the panel's \"job to find out whether a foreign power holds leverage over the president.\" If investigators could establish that Trump Jr. spoke to Trump as he was organizing the June 2016 meeting, it could suggest that Trump Jr. told his father that he'd received an offer of Russian help for the campaign \u2014 and that would undercut Trump's longtime denials that he knew nothing about the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and damage Clinton. Trump has denied any conspiracy to coordinate with Russians to influence the election. He goes back and forth as to what he accepts about the \"active measures\" that Moscow launched against the West, but he has been consistent in saying that the idea that his campaign had anything to do with those Russian efforts is a \"hoax.\" In the last Congress, then-Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., wrapped up the House intelligence committee's Russia investigation with a finding of no wrongdoing. The worst that could be said, the panel found, was that contacts between people on the Trump campaign and Russians were \"ill-advised.\" Now, with Schiff in charge and Democrats in the House majority, the panel is expected to hire new investigators, including a former prosecutor and a money laundering expert. The committee's first hearing this year will examine the perceived rise of authoritarianism around the world, Schiff said. But the investigations into Russia will garner more public attention. Schiff said he wants Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer who has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for multiple crimes including campaign finance violations, to appear before the committee this year. Cohen also is scheduled to testify before the House oversight committee next month. The White House Counsel's Office has been reportedly adding attorneys to prepare for legal fights with Democrats. A number of incoming Democratic chairmen beyond Schiff \u2014 including Elijah Cummings, D-Md., of the oversight panel, and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., of the House Foreign Affairs Committee \u2014 want to expand investigations into Trump. Schiff told NPR he expects the administration \"to stonewall\" his committee \"on any legitimate oversight it does.\" One battle could involve whether the committee will again try to subpoena the interpreter who was present for Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last July. Recent reports show the president has gone to unusual lengths to keep secret the details of what he has said to Putin in meetings in Finland and elsewhere. Schiff said he's \"examining the legal issues around either bringing in the interpreter, or getting the interpreter notes, or finding out through others in the administration what took place.\" The White House may argue that Trump's dealings with interpreters and other staff members are protected under executive privilege, but Schiff called that interpretation of the privilege \"superficial,\" since the inquiry isn't focused on what American officials have been saying to each other inside the administration. \"We're not interested in when he was talking to his counselors,\" Schiff said of the president. \"We're interested in what he was talking to Vladimir Putin about, and doesn't seem to me that any privilege applies there.\" Transcript of the interview between NPR's Steve Inskeep and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The interview has been edited for clarity. Steve Inskeep: I want to just begin by understanding how you see your new position here. How do you intend to run this committee differently than your predecessor? Rep. Adam Schiff: Well I have to think in just about every way. You know, certainly as it pertains to the Russian investigation we want to go back to the original mission which was to follow the facts wherever they lead and try to conduct this in a bipartisan way. You know probably going back to the midnight run. The then-Chairman Nunes late night excursion to the White House to get information that he would later present to the White House says demonstrating some Obama conspiracy to surveil the Trump campaign going back to that date. The Republicans left essentially trying to find out what the Russians did and how they did it and the role of the Trump campaign and embarked instead on an investigation of the investigators became essentially a surrogate for the Trump defense team. Obviously that's going to change we're going to go back to our original mission of following the facts. So we're already reaching out to witnesses that we wanted to come in but we couldn't get the then majority to either request or subpoena. We're going to get documents that we need to get to do our investigative work. But more broadly we want to take a deep dive on issues that we think have been neglected and our first open hearing next month will be on the subject of the rise of a \u2014 on the subject of the rise of authoritarianism around the world. And this to me is the much bigger picture than Russian interference in our election, bigger even than Russian interference in the elections of others that has been going on for some time in Europe and elsewhere. We see a real rise of autocracy around the globe everywhere from the Philippines with Duterte to Turkey with Erdogan, Al-Sisi in Egypt the rise of the far right in Hungary and Poland. That challenge to liberal democracy is going unanswered by this administration. And we want to shed light on this. Why would you begin the Russia investigation again, granting you didn't like the way that Devin Nunes did it or that his colleagues did it? There's been a Senate investigation that was seen as credible and bipartisan. There's the Mueller investigation. What could you add? Well, first of all, we never shut down the Russia investigation. The Republicans walked away from it, but we continued to bring in witnesses, but we didn't have the power to subpoena them or compel their testimony. And that didn't allow us to do a thorough job. In fact the report the Republicans issued has already been completely discredited. They relied on for among other things. Michael Cohen's testimony and other witnesses without checking to see whether any of it was accurate. Now that's no way to conduct an investigation. Cohen has since admitted to lying under oath. He has and we are going to be bringing him back before the committee to explore what areas were truthful and what weren't. And it's not just that we need to bring back certain witnesses. There are a great many that have never come before our committee, a great many unanswered questions and even had we been able to continue uninterrupted \u2014 and we've lost about nine months of time \u2014 the special counsel's investigation continues as does the Senate intelligence investigation. And we see in the testimony of Bill Barr just how important it is that the congressional investigations go on and I say that because Barr testified that he is not committing to sharing the Mueller report with the Congress or the country. This is the attorney general nominee. Right. Exactly. And we, I guess, can expect he's going to give us a \"Cliff Notes\"version that he will write himself. This means that the country may never learn about information that does not go into an indictment. And that just is completely unsatisfactory. The country deserves to know what the Russians did in our elections, what role the president played or his campaign associates played. And to have a situation where the nominee for attorney general says you can't indict a sitting president, you can only impeach one if it's warranted \u2014 but we're not going to give you the evidence to determine whether impeachment is i n order \u2014 means we're not gonna have a rule of law. We're going to have immunity. And that just cannot persist. You think it is worth then going over the very same ground Mueller has gone over perhaps because you can do it in a way that you would develop public information. I think there are areas that Mueller may not be investigating that need to be investigated because he may or may not be given the charter by the deputy attorney general or acting attorney general. What's an example? Money laundering. Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump businesses? This compromise the Russians hold over the president of the United States \u2014 we don't know the answer to that question, but we also don't know whether Bob Mueller has been allowed to investigate that issue. The president has tried to draw a red line around it. In my view, the president has no business drawing red lines. But nonetheless we don't know whether that has been investigated. But we do know it needs to be. But even areas where Mueller is investigating if it's going to be the position of the incoming attorney general, should Barr be confirmed, that the public doesn't get to learn about this, then it will fall upon Congress to share with the American people what happened and we will do that in several ways. We will do that by trying to compel that report to be provided to Congress but we'll also do it by developing the record ourselves and by sharing with the country the product of our investigation. Is that why you were hiring among other staff members a former prosecutor and an expert in money laundering? We are adding to the investigative capabilities of our committee in our staffing when we began the rush investigation. Our staff was what you would expect an intelligence committee staff to be comprised of \u2014 largely analysts, experts in the intelligence community, experts in doing oversight of the agencies so that we could make sure that they were sharing information to protect the country, not stove-piping it. That was one of the problems identified in the 9/11 Commission report ... The Constitutional and statutory obligations are being met but then we have this huge investigation also added to our responsibilities. But our staff were still the same analysts. Now over time we brought on additional staff. But there is still considerable need to bring on more investigative heft. And so we are interviewing candidates with an eye towards doing that. And what I said is correct: A money laundering expert ... a ... former prosecutor ... will be on that staff? You know, I can certainly share with you that we are going to be hiring people with investigative experience. And while I don't want to go into the particulars until we have people on board we're ready to share that information. We are looking to fill areas of expertise that we don't feel we have sufficiently in place and because the end of the day we want to make sure that we can represent to the public we've done a thorough and credible investigation and this is what we were able to find. It has been said that the president, before he became president, did large scale real estate deals and paid for a number of them in cash rather than financing, which is unusual in real estate. Do you intend to find out where the cash came from? Well we are certainly going to try to follow the money and the president's sons have also said \u2014 this compounds our concerns at various points in time \u2014 that they don't need the help or money from U.S. banks. They get all the cash they need from Russia. This is a quote from one of the president's sons about a decade ago. Yes. And I think one of the sons also said that a disproportionate share of their assets come from Russia. Now, the president has tried to disavow those remarks much like he has tried to disavow comments that he himself has made in the past that he was getting tens of millions of dollars from the Saudis and why shouldn't he like the Saudis the Saudis are spending so much money on his properties. If foreign money is influencing his decisions, that's a problem. If foreign business entanglement, lawful or unlawful, is compromise that the Russians or others hold over the president of the United States, that's a problem and it needs to be exposed. Let me ask about one detail that many people have asked questions about: There was a famous meeting as you know in 2016 involving Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, top campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. There were two phone calls from Donald Trump Jr. to a blocked number before and after that meeting, if I'm not mistaken. Do you have the ability to find out who he called and do you intend to find out? We do have the ability to find out and we will find out. And what you're referring to is in the setup of that meeting, and, by the way, two of the people in that meeting have been indicted already: Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney, who we have learned more and more about and her relationship with the Russian government. In the setup of that meeting, the son of a Russian oligarch arranges to speak with Don Jr., the president's son. The president's son is informed in advance of these conversations that the Russians have \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton that they want to share as part of what is described as the Russian government effort to help the Trump campaign. And the president's son's reaction is that he would love that help. And so there are these calls going back and forth between Don Jr. and Emin Agalarov, the son of Aras Agalarov, an oligarch close to Putin. Oddly enough Aras Agalarov is known as the \"Russian Donald Trump\" because he's a real estate magnate in Russia. Sandwiched between these calls where the president's son is trying to find out, \"Is this a meeting I should take, is this offer for real, should I bring in the campaign chairman, my brother in law?\" There's a call from a blocked number. We need to find out who that blocked call is from. And this is knowable? The phone company has this information? It can be subpoenaed? It's perfectly knowable. And of course when we brought in Don Jr. and asked him about the call and the obvious question was, \"We know that then-candidate Trump used a blocked call during the campaign. Was this call from Dad?\" And when we sought with our Republican colleagues to get an answer in the most definitive way possible \u2014 that is get the phone records \u2014 the response from the Republicans was, \"No. We don't want to know.\" Now, I can't imagine a more obvious investigative step than getting those phone records, but we were denied the ability to do that and that, in microcosm, was what the Republican-led investigation was about. It wasn't about finding out answers. It was about going through the motions of investigation so that a political report could be issued and they could absolve the president. That's not what they promised the American people they would do, but that is what they did. So we still need to get answers and one of the places we will begin is by getting those phone records. If you're going into all the president's phone calls, if you are going into all the president's finances, and perhaps an extensive look at his business career, at what point would that become a witch hunt? Well we're certainly not going to go into all the president's phone calls or all the president's finances. You know, whether the president was engaged in shady business transactions with people, that's not my job to find out. It is my job to find out whether a foreign power holds leverage over the president. So what I am concerned about, what we do need to look into is: Was he doing business with the Russians? Was it lawful business? Is it business that he is now denying and do the Russians have leverage over him? And to give you a perfect illustration of why this is so important, we've already learned through Michael Cohen that the business that he was trying to cultivate during the campaign went on much longer than has been acknowledged in effect. Quite the contrary. Michael Cohen testified it was over at the beginning of the year 2016. We now know it went on through the middle of that year. Even when Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee for president and was denying any business dealings with Russia, he was in fact pursuing a multi-multi-million dollar project in Moscow and seeking the Kremlin's help to make it happen. Now, the Russians knew this even as the president was denying it ... the Russians were on the other end of that transaction, which means at any point in time of the Russians' choosing they could expose the president's falsehoods about this and that is compromise. Now it's come to the public's attention recently the president may have tried to acquire or destroy the records of his private conversations with Putin over the last couple of years. Why is that? Why does he demand to meet alone with Putin? Why does he demand that there be no record of his discussions with Putin? This is extraordinarily worrying behavior by the president of United States. Last year when you did not have the power, you had to ask Republicans. You called for the interpreter from the president's private meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland to be subpoenaed to testify. Now that you do have the power, do you intend to subpoena that interpreter? We intend to do everything we can to find out what took place in these private meetings and we are examining the legal issues around either bringing in the interpreter or getting the interpreter notes or finding out through others administration what took place. What are the legal issues? Well, you know, they may make a superficial claim of executive privilege but when you look at executive privilege, that privilege applies when the president is talking to his advisers, seeking their counsel and the policy reason behind it is that he should be able to get the unfettered advice of his counselors to make decisions. But we're not interested in when he was talking to his counselors about. We're interested in what he was talking to Vladimir Putin about and doesn't seem to me that any privilege applies there. But that doesn't mean they won't claim one. And so we are investigating the legal issues around it. At the end of the day though, we need to find out whether the president behind closed doors is sacrificing U.S. interests because of some personal motivation. That's to me is the overriding and compelling interest here. Could there have been a comparatively innocent explanation for the president not wanting to tell other people in the government about his meetings with Putin? He clearly doesn't trust a lot of people in the government. He talks constantly about a \"deep state.\" He may simply not have believed that other people in the government could be relied upon with this information. I suppose if you work really hard at it you can fashion a rationalization for his behavior. But if you look at what he does quite overtly, what he did in public with Vladimir Putin when in Helsinki, for example, he said, \"Well, I've got my intelligence agencies telling me you interfered in our election but you're telling me you didn't and I don't know why you would.\" Basically, I believe you over our intelligence agencies. If he is saying that publicly, what is he saying privately? That seems to be the far more probable issue, that he does not want the public to know what he is saying, to the degree that he doesn't trust the people around him, perhaps because they recognize that what he is doing, as indeed General Mattis did, is inimical to our national interests. If the White House disagrees with you about executive privilege on a matter like the president's interpreter, you're prepared to go to court? Well, this is a decision that we will have to make in discussion with our leadership and I'm already coordinating with Eliot Engel, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, because what we are going to have to do as an over-arching matter is prioritize what fights we're going to have with this administration. We know they're going to stonewall us on whatever legitimate oversight we do and it means we're going to have to put our most important fights first and make sure that we are prepared for them. And so that's a decision we will have to make. But to me it seems imperative that we know whether the president of the United States is doing our bidding or his own family's bidding when he's in private discussions with a foreign adversary. When you were saying the reasons you need to redo this investigation, you said that William Barr, if he's attorney general, may not give you the evidence that you would need to decide whether something impeachable has taken place. And so you're doing your investigation. Can we then draw that conclusion that that is where this may be headed? That the purpose of this investigation is to find out whether there is an impeachable offense first? You know again we have never stopped the investigation so I wouldn't say that we'll need to redo it or reopen it. But we will need to continue it until we get answers until we are able to follow the facts wherever they lead. I don't want to prejudge what the conclusion is. In terms of what the remedy ought to be I'd like to finish our work. I'd like to make sure that we get the product of Bob Mueller's report as well. My point is that we can't have a situation where the president is effectively immunized against any consequence because the Justice Department takes the view that notwithstanding whether they would find evidence of criminality he cannot be indicted and that they will not share evidence with the Congress that would allow Congress to pursue any other remedy. That simply cannot be the policy of the Congress or the Justice Department that the president is above the law because that would effectively make the president above the law, neither subject to indictment nor impeachment. Is there any other aspect of the intelligence agencies that comes under your vast purview that has nothing to do with the president of Russia that strikes you as urgent that you need to dig into? Certainly I will. I don't know that I can say that has nothing to do with the president because, you know, all of the national security challenges facing the country in one way or another implicate presidential action. But we also expect to do a deep dive on Saudi Arabia to learn more about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We need to analyze the Saudi role in Yemen, the Saudi role in Syria, the Saudi role in the peace process ... how stable is the House of Saud. What are the risks to placing so much reliance on the crown prince? We're gonna do a deep dive on all those issues. We're also going to be examining North Korea. We've been assured by our president it's essentially \"problem solved,\" we can all sleep well. Now, that is not what we're seeing. We are not seeing a North Korea on an inexorable path towards denuclearization. So we'll continue to do a heavy focus on North Korea as well as on Iran and the threat posed from Iran. And we will be devoting a lot of our attention to the war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria and Yemen for the risks they pose to us from a counterterrorism point of view but also the risks they pose to our men and women in uniform. Do you expect this committee to do more of its work in public than it traditionally has? Yes. And, you know, even, you know, very basic public hearings were foreclosed by the previous majority for reasons I'm still not clear about. We have traditionally done quarterly worldwide threats hearings \u2014 open hearings that are followed by a closed session in which the leaders of the intelligence agencies testify publicly about what's keeping them up at night. As I mentioned, you know, our first hearing will be hearing an open hearing on the rise of authoritarianism. I want to do a lot more in open session. We're also going to look at within the Russia investigation what hearings or witnesses we might be able to bring in in an open session as well as releasing transcripts of witnesses who have come before our committee, so those are things all things that we are exploring. Should William Barr recuse himself from the Russia investigation if he's confirmed as the new attorney general? I do think he should. And I think it's astounding that we are at a point in history now where the ethical bar has been so lowered that an attorney general nominee can come before the U.S. Senate and say, \"I'm not willing to commit that I will follow the advice of ethics lawyers at the Justice Department.\" Is this really where we are? Shouldn't we expect at a minimum that any attorney general will agree to follow the advice of ethics lawyers? I think the problem here is he knows what that advice is going to be and that advice is going to be just the same as the advice to [Acting Attorney General] Matt Whitaker and for precisely the same reason: You have expressed publicly hostility to the Mueller investigation. You will not have public confidence if you play a role in that investigation. You should recuse. The reason why he won't commit to follow their advice is because he knows what their advice is going to be and because if he were willing to do so, he would not have been nominated. That's a problem. We should demand better than that. You know it's astounding to me that the only two people apparently qualified to serve as acting attorney general or new attorney general are people who have already weighed in against the Mueller investigation before they were even appointed or nominated. That just shows how low the bar is. I don't think we have to accept that I don't think we should accept that there are a great many very well qualified conservative lawyers who could be nominated for attorney general.",

The Russia imbroglio is barreling into another year that could deliver even more revelations and political heat than the last one \u2014 and maybe even a big finale. The criminal cases of several key players are unresolved, new charges could be ripe, and House Democrats are set to sweep into Washington with huge ambitions about how to use their investigative and oversight powers now that they wield the majority. Here's what you need to know: Three of President Trump's former top aides are waiting to be sentenced after reaching plea agreements with prosecutors. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, first was convicted in a bank and tax fraud trial in Virginia, then pleaded guilty to avoid a second federal trial in a separate conspiracy case in Washington, D.C. But the Justice Department said its cooperation agreement with Manafort had broken down over what the government said were lies Manafort had told investigators. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced early in 2019. Will he and his lawyers try to salvage their relationship with prosecutors so that the government asks the judge in the case to be lenient? And, if not, will Manafort's sentencing hearing include new details about the core question that special counsel Robert Mueller's office is investigating: Did Trump's campaign conspire with the Russians who attacked the 2016 presidential election? Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was scheduled to be sentenced in December, but a federal judge in that case delayed the decision. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn leaves federal court in Washington, D.C., after his sentencing hearing was delayed on Dec. 18.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former national security adviser Michael Flynn leaves federal court in Washington, D.C., after his sentencing hearing was delayed on Dec. 18. Now Flynn has no date scheduled for his sentencing. Instead, he and the government have been ordered to give Judge Emmet Sullivan a status update in March. This means Flynn may give even more cooperation to the Justice Department beyond the more than 60 hours of meetings and other materials he has provided so far. In fact, he could appear as a witness for the prosecution in a case the government is making against two of Flynn's former business partners, who have been charged in a scheme to smear an enemy of the Turkish government. So if all goes well for Flynn, serving as a government witness may be the cherry on the sundae and make the judge more inclined to show leniency in his ultimate sentence. Trump's former deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, so far has no sentencing date scheduled. He has been cooperating with prosecutors since he pleaded guilty to charges connected with Manafort and served as the star witness against his former mentor in the Virginia trial last summer. The Justice Department has asked a judge not to schedule a sentencing hearing for Gates because he's cooperating with so much of its work, much of which still appears to be behind the scenes. When, or if, Gates is sentenced in 2019 could be an important milestone in the investigation. There have been many suggestions about new charges by the special counsel's office. They might target political consultant Roger Stone, who has told NPR he thinks he'll be indicted, or associates of his such as conservative commentator Jerome Corsi, who told MSNBC that he walked away from a plea deal offered by Mueller's team. Stone and Corsi both deny they engaged in any wrongdoing. Political strategist Roger Stone talks to reporters at the American Priority Conference on Dec. 6, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Political strategist Roger Stone talks to reporters at the American Priority Conference on Dec. 6, in Washington, D.C. In December, the House intelligence committee voted to release to the executive branch a transcript of Stone's testimony before the panel. That move fueled speculation that Mueller might be preparing to charge Stone with lying to Congress, although there has been no official indication. Stone and his associates are thought to be potential connections between Trump's campaign and WikiLeaks, which released an avalanche of data stolen by Russian intelligence from political targets including the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. Stone and Corsi have suggested they won't give evidence against Trump, and Stone has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to submit to an interview or provide documents in response to requests from the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. If Stone, Corsi or others in this part of the Russia storyline are charged, that could mean high-profile new trials in New York City or around Washington, D.C. And if the Justice Department charges WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, after suggestions that may happen, that trial also could be huge \u2014 assuming the United States could get Assange out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he has taken refuge.

Congress has been a dominant force in the Russia imbroglio all along, but 2019 may bring a big change in tenor. The House Republicans who have criticized the Department of Justice and Mueller's office will lose their ability to convene hearings and subpoena witnesses. The House Democrats who've sought to defend DOJ and the Mueller investigation will gain those powers as they arrive in a new majority. One incoming Democratic chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, fired a warning shot well before the new Congress was even seated: He announced that he has sent 51 letters to \"the White House, multiple federal agencies and others requesting full compliance\" with existing requests for information by Jan. 11. Cummings and Democrats are likely to make more new requests of their own. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee, says he wants to reawaken the panel's investigation into the Russian attack on the 2016 election, one Republicans closed in spring 2018. The finding was that there was no wrongdoing by the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and that contacts between people involved and Russians were, at worst, \"ill-advised.\" Schiff and Democrats have called that a whitewash, and they say they want answers from many of the people involved and to open new lines of inquiry. Specifically, Schiff has said he wants to find out whether Deutsche Bank was involved with any payments to Trump. The German finance giant has figured in discussions about the Russia investigation for months, but it isn't clear where it may fit into the broader story. It has paid heavy fines to regulators after admitting its role in past money laundering, and some investigations appear to be ongoing. Former Attorney General William Barr has been nominated to return to his post atop the Justice Department.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Attorney General William Barr has been nominated to return to his post atop the Justice Department. The new year also is expected to bring a new ultimate boss for Mueller's investigation. Trump has nominated former Attorney General William Barr to return to the Justice Department to take the place of Jeff Sessions. Barr is expected to have a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee early in the year and it may prove contentious. Barr has been a public skeptic about the Mueller investigation \u2014 at least the part of it that may be focused on possible obstruction of justice by the president. Barr submitted some written criticisms to the administration and, in the past, echoed Trump's criticisms of former FBI Director James Comey. Democrats likely will press him about whether he can be involved with the Russia investigation or whether he must recuse himself, as Sessions did. Critics also want acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself, but as the Justice Department explained, he opted not to take himself out of the matter. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has continued to oversee the investigation anyhow, it emerged. Rosenstein was asked about Barr at a press conference before Christmas. He said that whoever was involved with the Russia investigation \u2014 whether it was him, Mueller, Barr or another Justice Department leader \u2014 it would continue to be handled \"appropriately.\" Jan. 1 marked the 595th day since Mueller was appointed. No one outside of his office has any clear idea about how much longer his team's work may go. Trump's attorneys said they believed it would be wrapped up by Thanksgiving \u2014 of 2017. When attorneys on the Mueller team left in October 2018, people took that as a sign the investigation might be cooling down. Predictions that \"Mueller is tightening the net\" or \"this is the fourth quarter\" haven't gone away \u2014 and yet the special counsel investigation hasn't, either. All that's clear about the road map to the end of the special counsel investigation is this: Justice Department regulations compel Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general at the conclusion of his team's work. (Another regulation requires the attorney general to provide certain notifications and reports to the leadership of the judiciary committees in both the House and the Senate.) Many in Washington expect the Mueller report also to go to Congress and become public, perhaps even making the same kind of imprint as earlier reports about President Bill Clinton or the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. How or even whether that happens, however, remain big questions \u2014 along with what any report could mean for Trump.",

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg got a really big boost to his campaign recently, announcing a staggering $24.8 million fundraising haul over the past three months. But that hasn't changed one of the toughest realities his candidacy faces: support among black voters that barely registers in the polls. Countering skeptics who doubt he can win crucial African American voters in the 2020 Democratic primary, Buttigieg rolled out the details of his plan to combat systemic racial inequality, named for legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass, on NPR's Morning Edition. \"If you're a white candidate, it is twice as important for you to be talking about racial inequity and not just describing the problem \u2014 which is fashionable in politics \u2014 but actually talking about what we're going to do about it and describing the outcomes we're trying to solve for,\" Buttigieg told NPR. His \"Douglass Plan\" aims to establish a $10 billion fund for black entrepreneurs over five years, invest $25 billion in historically black colleges, legalize marijuana, expunge past drug convictions, reduce the prison population by half and pass a new Voting Rights Act to further empower the federal government to ensure voting access. His campaign says it is equal in scale to the Marshall Plan, which used the equivalent of approximately $100 billion at current value to rebuild Europe after World War II. Buttigieg says the program would be enacted alongside potential direct reparations for slavery, not in place of it. The two-term mayor also supports a constitutional amendment to abolish the death penalty, and intends to expand the Supreme Court and eradicate the Electoral College. Buttigieg ties these lofty goals like changing the Constitution to his campaign's central theme of generational change. \"I don't know where we got the idea that it's impossible to do these things,\" he said. \"This is a country that changed the Constitution so you couldn't buy a drink and then changed its mind and changed it back. Are you really telling me that we are incapable of using one of the most elegant features of our constitutional system?\" On his Douglass Plan: [The Marshall Plan] demonstrates what America can do when we're serious. America basically rebuilt Europe after World War II, and what we need to do now is an investment of comparable ambition right here at home, because what we've learned is that racist policies being replaced by neutral policies is not enough, that the inequities that we have in our country were put in intentionally by generations and sometimes centuries of racist policy. They're not going to go away just because you replace a racist system with a neutral one. We need to intentionally invest in health, in home ownership, in entrepreneurship, in access to democracy, in economic empowerment. If we don't do these things, we shouldn't be surprised that racial inequality persists because inequalities compound. Just like a dollar saved, a dollar stolen also compounds. And I think that helps to explain the persistent racial inequality that we have in our national life today. On reparations: I think [the Douglass Plan] does not take the place of the conversation around reparations. I also support passing H.R. 40. I would sign it, which would create a commission to look at reparations. But I do think that this is also restorative, in the same way that reparations is intended to be. This is not a gift. This is a restoration. It is trying to address generational harms and specific intentional theft that took place. On the death penalty: The death penalty has been one of many examples where racial discrimination has played out. You can see it in the simple fact that someone convicted of the same crime is more likely to face the death penalty if they are black. Not to mention the very ugly history of the way that judicial and extra-judicial killings have been used to enforce white supremacy through American history. It's time to put an end to that. It's time to join the ranks of nations that have put the ugliness of capital punishment behind them. And while I'm pleased to see states taking this step, and I believe the federal government can and should take this step, too, at the end of the day it is the kind of thing that deserves to be in our Constitution. On his failure to diversify the South Bend police force We have undertaken measures from partnerships with local high schools, to community job fairs, to even bringing in behavioral researchers to help us assess which recruiting messages will draw the most applicants from communities of color. But at a time when the policing profession as a whole is, I think, struggling with a crisis of identity and people hesitating to want to join it, plus the fact that fewer and fewer people of color, certainly black teenagers, look at law enforcement and think 'this is a career for me,' there are colossal obstacles, not only in South Bend. But I accept responsibility for the fact that we've got a long way to go in our city. On engaging white Americans in the conversation around racism I think we'll know we're getting somewhere when this is not regarded as some specialty issue that candidates of color talk about or that we only talk about when addressing voters of color. This is a conversation that, frankly, white America needs to have too, because white America needs to face the roots of these inequities and the fact of systemic racism all around us. It's the air we breathe. I had a challenging conversation with our own police department where, when I talked about systemic racism in addressing officers, many of them felt that it was a personal attack. I need them to understand, especially white officers, the ways in which, no matter how good their intentions might be, that systemic racism is something they in particular need to be conscious of and need to understand how to be part of the solution on. So this is not something that only candidates of color should be talking about \u2014 very much to the contrary. On winning over religious conservative voters I think there are a lot of thoughtful and compassionate religious people who, maybe have thought of themselves as conservative, but who are looking at what's happening right now and asking some very deep and searching questions about where their values and their principles lead them, and what I found in terms of what's turned the tide on things like LGBTQ equality is the idea of compassion, the idea of empathy. My personal experience is that I have come to feel closer to God in the context of my marriage. But that's just my own story. The bigger story is that we are better human beings when we consider one another through the lens of how we would want to be treated as, again, secular and religious traditions teach us to do. And I think in that lens, a great many people who may be disoriented by the pace of change on LGBTQ equality can find their way to the right side of history.

Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders, seen at a South Carolina NAACP march in January, are two of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates pressed on the issue of reparations this week. Several Democratic candidates have been quick to embrace reparations recently. Bernie Sanders is more cautious. At a CNN town hall on Monday, a woman asked Sanders about his view on reparations, and at first he talked about trying to \"put resources into distressed communities and improve lives for those people who have been hurt from the legacy of slavery.\" Moderator Wolf Blitzer pushed him for a more direct response, noting that multiple presidential candidates have said they support reparations. Sanders answered the question with his own question \u2014 one that is now hanging over the 2020 Democratic field: \"What does that mean? What do they mean? I'm not sure that anyone's very clear,\" Sanders said. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris and author Marianne Williamson have all in some way said they are in favor of reparations for African-Americans \u2014 providing compensation to people hurt by discriminatory policies like slavery, Jim Crow laws and redlining. Warren has added that Native Americans should be a part of the conversation, as well. But while multiple candidates have been quick to say that they support the policy, they now face both the difficult question of what that kind of policy should look like, and the very basic question of whether their proposed plans even meet the definition of \"reparations.\" \"Baby bonds\" and tax credits as reparations Williamson has the most straightforward approach, saying she'd allocate up to $500 billion to redress a range of discriminatory policies. \"If you kick somebody to the ground, you owe it to them to do more than stop kicking,\" she told New York radio station Hot 97 earlier this month. \"You owe it to them to say, 'Here: Let me help you get back up.'\" Other candidates are touting their existing safety net programs as part of the reparations debate. Booker, for example, is promoting his \"baby bonds\" plan, which would put money into savings accounts for all American kids. However, far more money would go to children in poverty \u2014 who are disproportionately black \u2014 than to middle-class kids. \"It's certainly accurate to see to see the baby bonds legislation as a form of reparations through that lens,\" said Booker spokesman Michael Tyler. Similarly, when a journalist from the website The Grio asked Harris about her support for reparations, she promoted her \"LIFT Act,\" a tax credit plan that would disproportionately help poorer families. \"We have to recognize that everybody did not start out on equal footing in this country. And in particular black people have not,\" she said. \"And so we have got to recognize that and do something about that and give folks a lift up.\" Booker and Harris' policies get at the large racial economic divides at the heart of the reparations debate. Advocates for reparations often point to America's massive racial wealth gap. According to the Federal Reserve, the median white family had a net worth of $171,000 as of 2016. The median black family had around $17,000 \u2014 one-tenth as much. But while Booker and Harris' plans would likely help black families more than white, neither of their programs are race-based. That muddies the reparations debate, said Darrick Hamilton, executive director of The Ohio State University's Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity. \"Something that is economically inclusive but has a racial bent to it \u2014 those may or may not be good policies, but let's be clear: It's not reparations,\" he said. This isn't about quibbling over definitions, Hamilton added. Rather, there's the possibility that calling a policy reparations when it doesn't explicitly attempt to address past wrongs, amounts to putting a band-aid on a gaping, centuries-old wound. \"That would be almost a worst-case scenario, to say we have addressed the race issue when in fact we have not done it,\" he said. A reparations policy would include not only compensation, but also an acknowledgement of specific wrongs and reconciliation, according to Hamilton. Reparations vs. \"race-conscious\" policy While most candidates' policies may not meet those criteria, many are promoting economic plans that are being sold as \"race-conscious.\" For example, Warren's plan for housing aid \u2014 particularly to communities with a history of racial discrimination \u2014 could help shrink the racial wealth gap. But her campaign stresses that she does not consider that proposal reparations. Similarly, Sanders says that his policies to tackle inequality will shrink the racial economic gaps in the U.S. The candidates' focus on shrinking racial gaps is a sign of a shifting conversation about race. \"What they're all recognizing is that these disparities are very much part of the American landscape and finding solutions to them mean addressing issues they're as broad as living in our country itself,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington Bureau. What Americans think There isn't a lot of polling on the topic of reparations, but the polling that does exist points to a potential dilemma for candidates. A 2016 Marist poll found that a majority of African-Americans support the policy. Black voters are one of the most important demographics for the Democratic party. But then, that same poll showed that only 26 percent of Americans like the idea of reparations. This may add reparations to a list of other progressive policy ideas, like Medicare-for-all and free college, which are popular among Democratic primary voters but potentially polarizing in a general election. Hamilton, who is in favor of reparations, believes that polling like this doesn't mean the policy will stay unpopular forever. \"Not too long ago, Medicare-for-all was an idea that was criticized at the policy level as being pie in the sky,\" he said. In that sense, the 2020 Democratic race is evidence that ideas can change \u2014 sometimes unexpectedly fast.",

Former Attorney General Eric Holder travels to Iowa on Tuesday as he weighs whether to join a growing field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination in 2020, and he's expected to make a decision in the next two weeks, NPR has learned. Holder, who served for six years under former President Barack Obama, will make a decision on a White House run in the next two weeks. Meanwhile, the speech he plans to give at Drake University Law School in Des Moines certainly sounds like the building blocks of a possible campaign with a heavy condemnation of President Trump. \"We should be dissatisfied with an administration rife with corruption, stunning incompetence, and shameful intolerance,\" Holder will say in his speech, according to prepared remarks. \"Most of all, we should be dissatisfied by that same administration's total abdication of moral and policy leadership \u2014 and its failure to address the many other urgent challenges we face: A democracy that's under attack. A climate crisis that's ignored. And racial and cultural divisions that are weaponized and exploited for political gain.\" Holder will recall his visits before to Iowa in 2007 \"on behalf of a long-shot presidential candidate who had inspired me with his optimism and his vision for our country.\" And the former attorney general will talk about his upbringing \u2014 the grandson of immigrants from Barbados and son a of a World War II veteran and the racial discrimination he and his family faced throughout the years. \"I am dissatisfied \u2013 just as so many of you are dissatisfied \u2013 with the inequities that continue to divide us, the injustices all around us, and the refusal of some elected leaders to rise to this defining moment,\" Holder will say. \"That's why I cannot be silent \u2014 and I hope you won't be silent \u2014 as our nation confronts this time of challenge and consequence.\" Should Holder choose to mount a 2020 presidential run, it would be the first bid for elective office by the career prosecutor, who served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton and then assumed the top job under Obama, when he became the nation's first African-American attorney general. While leading the Justice Department, he made civil rights and voting rights a major focus. When Holder first floated the possibility of a White House bid last year, it took many by surprise. Since leaving the Obama administration in 2015, he rejoined a private law practice and also chaired the new National Democratic Redistricting Committee, designed to help Democratic candidates in key state races and to challenge gerrymandering ahead of 2020 redistricting and reapportionment. Holder will talk about that work and the importance of voting rights and an accurate census count during his speech Tuesday. \"Intolerance and cynicism may appear to be gaining strength \u2014 but that's simply not the case when our elections are fair and the true spirit of our people is accurately reflected,\" the former attorney general will say. \"The bad news is that \u2014 in far too many places \u2014 elections are not fair. The system is being rigged by politicians who are willing to bend or break the rules in order to stay in power.\" If he runs for president, the fact he was the first sitting Cabinet member in history to be held in contempt of Congress over his role in the bungled gun-trafficking operation known as \"Fast and Furious\" is sure to be brought up. He also helped Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, though he stirred controversy for saying \"When they go low, we kick 'em\" while on the campaign trail in Georgia \u2014 a riff on former first lady Michelle Obama's 2016 mantra \"When they go low, we go high.\" Holder later had to clarify he wasn't advocating violence. Holder seems to make a possible allusion to that sentiment in his remarks, closing with a push for change. \"Together, we must call out \u2014 and throw out \u2014 public officials who seek power by bringing out the worst in us. Now in that effort we must seek civility \u2014 but not at the expense of truth telling or the protection of treasured principles,\" Holder will say. \"The fact is: America is at its best when we face difficult questions and hard truths. America is at its best when we open our arms \u2014 and widen the circle of opportunity \u2014 for everyone who loves this country enough to make it their home.\"",

Updated April 1, 2020 at 10:40 a.m. ET The federal government is trying to get every U.S. household to answer some personal questions for the 2020 census. It's part of a once-a-decade tradition of counting every person living in the U.S. Each national head count comes with its own rash of confusion. The 2020 census is the first in the U.S. since the rise of social media and the first U.S. count that's primarily online. For months, the government has been preparing to combat disinformation campaigns that may try to disrupt the count, which is rolling out not only in the middle of a presidential race but also during the coronavirus pandemic. NPR has been tracking all of the developments to help you figure out what you need to know. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about the census, answered. Has the coronavirus pandemic delayed the U.S. census? The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced the Census Bureau to postpone its field operations, but the bureau says it is still collecting information from tens of millions of households that have been responding on their own. The head count officially began on Jan. 21, in Toksook Bay, Alaska \u2014 more than two months before Census Day (April 1), a reference date the bureau uses to determine where people should be counted (in general, at the address where they usually live and sleep as of that date). Most households were able to start participating around mid-March when letters with instructions were sent to 95 percent of homes around the country. On March 20, the bureau announced it is extending the end of counting for the census from July 31 to Aug. 14. Officials, however, say that the sooner households fill out a form on their own, the fewer door knockers the bureau will have to try to send out to visit unresponsive homes in person during the ongoing public health crisis. Why is the census important? The census is required by the Constitution, which calls for an \"actual enumeration\" once a decade since 1790. The 2020 population numbers will shape how political power and federal tax dollars are shared in the U.S over the next 10 years. The number of congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets are determined by census numbers. They also guide how an estimated $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding is distributed for healthcare, schools, roads and other public services in local communities. The demographic data are used by businesses to determine, for example, where to build new supermarkets and by emergency responders to locate injured people after natural disasters. How is the census taken? The 2020 count will be the first one to allow all U.S. households to respond online at my2020census.gov. Starting in early April, paper forms are expected to be sent to every household that has been asked to fill out a questionnaire but has not done so, and, for the first time, you can call toll-free numbers to give responses over the phone. Census workers are expected to make home visits to remote areas \u2014 including rural Alaska, parts of northern Maine and some American Indian reservations \u2014 to gather census information in person. Households in the rest of the U.S. that do not respond themselves by late April may start receiving visits as early as May from door knockers trained to conduct census interviews and collect responses using smartphones. Watch a demonstration of how to complete the 2020 census online form. Who gets counted in the census? The Census Bureau includes every person living in the U.S. \u2014 regardless of citizenship or immigration status. International visitors on vacation or work trips to the U.S. during the census are not included. Residents are counted at the address where they usually live and sleep. The Census Bureau has a detailed breakdown of how the 2020 census will count deployed troops, college students, incarcerated people, those displaced by natural disasters and other groups in unique living situations. Because COVID-19 has displaced many college students, the bureau is advising students who have left school but usually live off campus to respond online using their address at school. As for students who usually live in dorms or college-owned fraternity or sorority housing, the bureau says it is working with schools to make sure they get counted and that they should not be counted where they are temporarily staying due to the pandemic. What questions will the 2020 census ask? Most of the questions will be similar to what census forms have asked for in recent counts: Notable changes for 2020 include new write-in areas under the race question for the non-Hispanic origins of those who identify as white and/or black (\"German\" and \"Jamaican\" are among the provided examples). There are also new household relationship categories that allow couples living together to identify their relationships as either \"same-sex\" or \"opposite-sex.\" Federal courts have permanently blocked the Trump administration from adding to the 2020 census the question, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" The Census Bureau, however, continues to include a citizenship question on other forms it asks some U.S. households to complete, including the American Community Survey. Why was including a citizenship question on the census controversial? The Trump administration had previously insisted it wanted to add the question because the responses can be used to better enforce protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities through the Voting Rights Act. But a federal judge in New York has rejected that explanation as a \"sham justification,\" and a judge in California wrote that including the question \"threatens the very foundation of our democratic system.\" A majority of the Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts and kept the question blocked from the census because they found that the administration's reasoning appeared \"contrived.\" Critics of the question point to Census Bureau research suggesting that asking about citizenship in the current political climate would discourage households with noncitizens from participating in the census. The dozens of states, cities and other groups that sued the administration feared the question could result in an undercount of Latinx people and other communities of color. While the 2020 census won't include a citizenship question, the administration has directed the Census Bureau to compile government records on citizenship from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal, as well as state, agencies. The bureau is preparing to release anonymized citizenship information based on those records in 2021. President Trump says the information could be used to redraw voting districts in a way that, a GOP strategist concluded, would be \"advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.\" Can I refuse to answer a census question? You can skip questions, submit an incomplete census form, and still be included in the head count. But you can be fined for refusing to answer a census question or intentionally giving a false answer, although the penalty has rarely been enforced in the past. Returning a partially filled questionnaire may result in a follow-up phone call or visit from a census worker. Are census responses confidential? Under current federal law, the bureau cannot share census responses identifying individuals with the public or other federal agencies, including immigration authorities and other law enforcement, until 72 years after the information is collected. The Census Bureau, however, can release anonymized census information about specific demographic groups at a level as detailed as a neighborhood. Can I respond to the census in a language other than English? While paper forms will only be available in English and Spanish, you can respond online or by phone in Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Tagalog and Vietnamese. The bureau is also providing video and printed guides in 59 non-English languages, as well as a video in American Sign Language. Why is Hispanic or Latino not a racial category on the census? The White House's Office of Management and Budget requires the Census Bureau to ask about ethnicity in terms of Hispanic or Latino origin before asking about race. The ordering is designed to capture the racial diversity among people of Hispanic or Latino origin. A growing number of Latino census participants have been confused by this question format, resulting in \"some other race\" ranking as the third-largest racial group in census results from 2000 and 2010. The bureau has recommended combining the race and ethnicity questions into one, with \"Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish\" as an option for both race and ethnicity. But that would require the Trump administration to approve an Obama-era proposal to change the federal standards on race and ethnicity data. So far, OMB has not made public whether that proposal has been approved. Can I resubmit my household's response to correct a mistake? If you think you submitted your online response with incorrect or incomplete information, the Census Bureau says you can go back to my2020census.gov to resubmit your information. The bureau's website says it \"has procedures in place to resolve duplicate submissions.\" If you entered the 12-digit \"Census ID\" that was printed on the letters sent to your home to submit your first online response, you won't be able to use it again, but you can proceed without it by clicking on a link that says: \"If you do not have a Census ID, click here.\" How do I apply for a census job? Applications for the half-million temporary census positions, including door knockers and outreach specialists, must be submitted online. You can find more information on the bureau's recruitment website. When will the 2020 census results be released? The Census Bureau is expected to announce the new population counts by Dec. 31, 2020. That's the bureau's deadline for sending to the president numbers for the reapportionment of congressional seats, which goes into effect beginning with the 2022 elections. 2020 census data used for state and local redistricting are set to be released by March 31, 2021. The bureau is planning to release other new census data beginning in spring 2021. More questions and answers can be found in the Reddit AMA on the 2020 census that Hansi Lo Wang did in February 2019.

There have been 44 presidents in the nation's history, but just 17 chief justices. Some of the men who presided over the U.S. Supreme Court were enormously influential. Others, not. The chief justice today, John G. Roberts Jr., has already served for 14 years and, at age 64, he could well serve for another 20. Roberts remains an enigmatic figure. He is a committed conservative who has been publicly reviled by conservative politicians. He is a conservative who is the last best hope of liberals and moderates who dream, probably in vain, that he will significantly temper the court's turn to the right. The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts by Joan Biskupic Hardcover, 421 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? His public persona is charming, funny, and unrevealing. Seeking to pierce that practiced facade, reporter Joan Biskupic has written a biography called The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts. It is the fourth biography she has written about a sitting justice, and in some ways, the most enlightening. But she says Roberts was her \"toughest subject, start to finish.\" Her eight off-the-record interviews with her subject seemed more like fencing matches where she stood on one side, trying to find out or confirm new information, and he stood on the other, trying to find out what she already knew. As she puts it, \"If anybody put little thought bubbles over our heads he would have been saying, 'I wish she wasn't asking me these questions,' and I would have said, 'I wish you were Antonin Scalia because he gave me 12 on-the-record interviews and he was happy to talk about why he did what he did.'\" Some colleagues wary of Roberts Roberts, in contrast, is much more reserved, guarded, even \"secretive\" \u2014 traits that Biskupic reports have made his colleagues on both left and right sometimes \"wary of him.\" The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive, Roberts was raised in the upper-middle-class, nearly all-white suburbs of Gary, Ind. He was a golden boy from the get-go \u2014 an outstanding student at an outstanding Catholic prep school, who excelled as a Harvard undergraduate and at Harvard Law School. As a lawyer, he argued 39 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Even his appointment to the Supreme Court had a lucky twist. Named to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, his nomination was quickly upgraded two months later when then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.  In the years since, his record has been solidly conservative. He has voted consistently to undermine voting-rights laws, emasculating even measures enacted by huge congressional majorities; he's voted against attempts to voluntarily make public schools more racially mixed, against affirmative action in higher education, against laws enacted by Congress to limit the role of big money in congressional campaigns, against abortion rights, against same sex marriage, and for more deference to religious rights.  And yet, he has been roundly denounced by many conservative politicians, including President Trump, who in 2016 called his vote to uphold Obamacare a \"disgrace.\" For Trump and other conservatives, Roberts' original sin was his decisive fifth vote upholding the health care law. Biskupic tells a complicated tale of how Roberts arrived at the health care decision. She tells how, to the consternation of fellow conservatives on the court, he changed his initial vote \u2014 something that is unusual, but hardly unheard of \u2014 and she has put together a fascinating look at negotiations inside the court on the final outcome. Biskupic, who has covered the Supreme Court for decades, has an interesting take on why Roberts voted as he did. Like his fellow conservatives, he thought Congress exceeded its power in requiring health care for everyone. But he viewed the penalty imposed on those who didn't get health coverage as a tax, and thus a legitimate exercise of congressional power. And that vote saved the economic core of the law. \"Perhaps his vote stemmed from his concern for the Court's legitimacy,\" or his desire not to have the Supreme Court at the center of the 2012 election campaign, Biskupic says. But in the end, as she said in an interview with NPR, it very likely was also \"born of a concern for this important law and the business of health care, which he knew well from his days\" as a lawyer representing the industry. So in the Affordable Care Act case, Roberts' view was influenced by his experience, his practical understanding of the economics of health insurance. In contrast, his views on race and religion are far more ideological, doctrinaire and immovable. On these questions, Roberts has \"never wavered,\" according to Biskupic. \"I believe that there's this straight line from what he wrote as a young lieutenant in the Reagan years to what he writes now from the center chair of the Supreme Court,\" she says. Maintaining his position Indeed, she reports that in the Reagan years, Roberts led the charge to oppose renewal of the Voting Rights Act and strategized on how to limit school desegregation decrees. U.S. Supreme Court justices pose for their official portrait in the East Conference Room at the Supreme Court building on Nov. 30, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Although he maintained at his 2005 confirmation hearing that the memos he wrote advocating these positions merely reflected the views of his bosses, some of his superiors strongly disagreed with him. And ultimately, President Reagan signed the renewal of the Voting Rights Act into law. That was a disappointment to Roberts, whose memos show a young man infuriated by what he saw then, and still sees now, as racial preferences in a variety of spheres. Take, for instance, the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act that provided federal oversight of any changes in voting rules made by state and local governments with a history of racial discrimination in voting. That provision was widely seen as the most effective piece of civil rights legislation since the period right after the Civil War. But in 2013, in a case from Shelby County, Ala., Roberts, as chief justice, wrote the court's 5-4 decision striking it down because Congress had not changed the original formula for determining which jurisdictions were covered. As Roberts put it, \"Our country has changed in the past 50 years.\" Black and white voters are now voting in roughly equal numbers, he asserted, and advance clearance of voting rule changes is no longer needed. That proposition was quickly rebutted when many southern state and local governments, once free from the pre-clearance requirement, quickly enacted new laws and regulations that made it harder for African Americans and other minorities to vote \u2014 things like closing or moving polling places in minority areas, and limiting early voting. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg all but forecast those results in her dissenting opinion in the case. \"Throwing out pre-clearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes,\" wrote Ginsburg, \"is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain storm because you are not getting wet.\" Author Biskupic says outright that the discriminatory consequences of Roberts' voting rights decision have been profound on the ground. \"I think the consequences of Shelby County have been rather stark,\" she says. If Roberts had any understanding of the practical impact of his decision, Biskupic suggests, it is trumped by his view that the pre-clearance requirement amounted to an unconstitutional racial preference. Biskupic takes Roberts to task, as well, for disregarding more than a century of legal doctrine on race in order to put his long-held, contrary views, into place. His opinion in the voting rights case, she observes, is based on a \"novel constitutional ground.\" It invokes the principal of \"equal sovereignty,\" meaning that the states must be treated equally. But that principle, she says, is \"at odds with the usual understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Indeed, she points out that the Reconstruction Act passed by Congress after the Civil War included a provision that barred Southern states from readmission to the Union unless they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. Far to the right on abortion and same-sex marriage Roberts' views on other flash point social issues are similarly far to the right. According to Biskupic, at the Justice Department in the 1980s, Roberts was at the forefront of the effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the court's 1973 abortion decision. And on the court, he has never voted to invalidate an abortion restriction. That said, Roberts knows that the new conservative court majority doesn't have to overturn Roe to render it a hollow shell. If the court were to uphold all manner of abortion restrictions enacted in states where abortion is unpopular, the court would ensure that abortion is difficult, or even impossible to obtain in those states. Similarly in the area of gay rights, while it seems unlikely that the court would reverse itself on gay marriage, the new conservative majority may well side with those who refuse, on religious grounds, to provide services to gay couples. After all, as Biskupic points out, John Roberts not only dissented in the same-sex marriage cases, it was the only time in his tenure as chief justice that he chose to read his dissent from the bench. \"From the dawn of human history until a few years ago for every people known to have populated this planet, marriage was defined as the union of a man and a woman,\" he began. \"But today five lawyers [justices] have ordered every state to change its definition of marriage to one that matches a new one that they favor. Just who do we think we are.\" Roberts, raised a conservative Catholic, has not changed, Biskupic writes: \"At a time when American social attitudes were changing rapidly, John Roberts was not changing. Central to his personality was a certain constancy on many social issues.\" The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy last June, and the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to replace him, means that, as Biskupic puts it, Roberts \"has the court he always wanted.\" Without Kennedy, Roberts has gained \"greater control.\" He is \"no longer yoked to a centrist conservative pulling him to the left,\" she observes. He no longer \"has to woo Kennedy, appease Kennedy, deal with Kennedy.\" Rather, \"He's leading the court much more in his own image, and the law will likely be what he says it is.\"",

Updated at 5:08 p.m. ET A federal judge in New York has ruled against the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman ordered the administration to stop its plans to include the controversial question on forms for the upcoming national head count \"without curing the legal defects\" the judge identified in his 277-page opinion released on Tuesday. The question asks, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" Such a question has not been included among the census questions for all U.S. households since 1950, although it has been asked of a sample of households for past head counts and for the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Furman found that the decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census was \"unlawful\" because of \"a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut\" violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, including cherry-picking evidence to support his choice. Ross oversees the Census Bureau. \"To conclude otherwise and let Secretary Ross's decision stand would undermine the proposition \u2014 central to the rule of law \u2014 that ours is a 'government of laws, and not of men,' \" Furman wrote, quoting one of the country's Founding Fathers, John Adams. Ross, Furman added, \"ignored and violated a clear statutory duty\" to use existing government records about people's citizenship status as much as possible rather than using the census to ask a citizenship question. In another violation of the law, Ross \"announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis rather than explaining it,\" Furman said. Furman left open the possibility that Ross might be able to move forward with the question if he were to meet a series of specific requirements, including providing his \"real rationale\" that would support his decision to add the question. The judge also ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence to prove their claim that Ross' decision was intended to discriminate against Latinos, Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans and immigrant communities of color in general. Such a claim, Furman noted, would need to be backed up with testimony from Ross about his intent for the question. The issue of questioning Ross, however, has been put on hold after the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on a dispute over what evidence can be considered for the lawsuits. The justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments in February on that issue, as well as on whether Ross can be questioned under oath by the plaintiffs' attorneys about why he approved adding the question. Furman's decision marks a significant milestone in a legal battle that began shortly after the Trump administration announced last year that the 2020 census would include a controversial question about U.S. citizenship status. \"Today's ruling is a win for New Yorkers and Americans across the country who believe in a fair and accurate count of the residents of our nation,\" said New York State Attorney General Letitia James, whose office represented some of the lead plaintiffs under the state's former attorney general, Barbara Underwood. Dale Ho, one of the lead plaintiffs' attorneys at the ACLU, called Furman's opinion a \"forceful rebuke\" of the Trump administration's actions. \"These are not the acts and statements of government officials who are merely trying to cut through red tape,\" Ho said during a press call, referring to the way Ross pushed to get a citizenship question onto the census. \"Instead, they are the acts and statements of officials with something to hide.\" The Census Bureau's public information office referred NPR's request for comment to Commerce Department spokesperson Rebecca Glover, who deferred to the Justice Department for comment. \"We are disappointed and are still reviewing the ruling,\" said Kelly Laco, a Justice Department spokesperson, in a written statement. \"Reinstating the citizenship question ultimately protects the right to vote and helps ensure free and fair elections for all Americans.\" Furman has noted that he does not expect his order to be the final word on the question's fate. The district court ruling in New York is expected to be appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court. \"If a higher court disagrees with this Court's ruling, the citizenship question may well end up on the questionnaire,\" Furman wrote in his opinion, adding that the administration should be allowed to prepare for that scenario. He specified that the Trump administration can continue to \"study\" using the census to collect citizenship data and to test a citizenship question, as the bureau plans to do beginning in June. In addition to the two lead cases before Furman at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the administration is fighting five more lawsuits across the country filed by dozens of states, cities and other groups that want the question removed. A second trial over the question began earlier this month in California, and another is scheduled to begin in Maryland on Jan. 22. The administration has maintained that the citizenship question was added because the Justice Department wants to use the responses to better enforce Voting Rights Act provisions that protect racial and language minorities from being discriminated against. The lawsuits' plaintiffs, however, have argued that the administration has been misleading the public. Ross, the plaintiffs insist, misused his authority over the census and, by adding the citizenship question, discriminated against immigrant communities of color. Research by the Census Bureau suggests asking about citizenship status in the current political climate will scare households with noncitizens from participating in the head count. That, in turn, could jeopardize the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the U.S.",

            "article_content": "NPR's history podcast, Throughline, examines how the issue of abortion became a defining political issue for evangelicals.  NOEL KING, HOST: Several states have recently passed restrictive abortion laws. And some of those laws are already being challenged in federal courts, which opponents of abortion rights will tell you is part of a strategy. If a legal challenge to abortion rights makes it to the Supreme Court, then the Supreme Court may consider the status of Roe v. Wade. Evangelical Christian political groups have mobilized around limiting access to abortion. And many of them would like to see this go to the Supreme Court. But evangelicals were not always so involved in this fight. The latest episode of NPR's history podcast, Throughline, traces what happened. Rund Abdelfatah co-hosts Throughline. Hi, Rund. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE: Hi, thanks for having me. KING: So opposition to abortion has become so associated with evangelical Christians that it seems like that's the way it was all along. ABDELFATAH: No. In fact, the Southern Baptist Convention, they actually passed resolutions in 1971, 1974 and 1976 - after Roe v. Wade - affirming the idea that women should have access to abortion for a variety of reasons and that the government should play a limited role in that matter, which surprised us. The experts we talked to said white evangelicals at that time saw abortion as largely a Catholic issue. KING: So if Roe v. Wade didn't cause the sea change, what did? ABDELFATAH: In short, desegregation. Two years before Roe v. Wade, in 1971, there was a Supreme Court case that began to pull white evangelicals into politics. Me and my co-host, Ramtin Arablouei, dove into the story of that case, known as Green v. Connally. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ABDELFATAH: Segregation in public schools had been outlawed since 1954, but changes on the ground were really slow. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) DWIGHT EISENHOWER: ...Southern states have instituted public school plans... ABDELFATAH: ...And complicated. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) EISENHOWER: ...For gradual progress in the enrollment and attendance of school children of all races. LISA HARPER: White supremacy is threatened at the deepest level. It's an existential threat. ABDELFATAH: This is Lisa Harper. She's written several books on Christianity, including \"Left Right & Christ: Evangelical Faith In Politics.\" RANDALL BALMER: In Holmes County, Miss., the first year of desegregation, the number of white students in the public schools decreased from 700-some to 28. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE: This is religious historian Randall Balmer. BALMER: The second year of desegregation, the number of white students in the public schools in Holmes County decreased to zero. ABDELFATAH: So where were these white students going? Well, they enrolled in private so-called segregation academies run by evangelical leaders as tax-exempt religious schools. BALMER: And a group of parents in Holmes County, Miss., said, this isn't right. ABDELFATAH: And they won. BALMER: And the gist of the decision was that any organization that engages in racial discrimination or racial segregation is not, by definition, a charitable institution. Therefore it has no claims on tax-exempt status. ARABLOUEI: Many white evangelical leaders relied on those tax exemptions to operate their private, segregated schools in places like Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Virginia. And they felt entitled to those tax exemptions on religious grounds. BALMER: The alarm begins to grow among various evangelical leaders, including Jerry Falwell, who of course had his own segregation academy in Lynchburg, Va. ABDELFATAH: The name Jerry Falwell might sound familiar because he'd go on to become a leading figure of the religious right and one of the architects of the Moral Majority, a Republican political action group that would come to play an important role in American politics. ARABLOUEI: Randall Balmer says the Green v. Connally loss mobilized a lot of evangelical leaders like Falwell. HARPER: They lost the bid to protect white space once again. ARABLOUEI: Around this time, a conservative political activist named Paul Weyrich was trying really hard to grow the Republican Party base. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL WEYRICH: So many of our Christians have what I call the goo-goo (ph) syndrome - good government. They want everybody to vote. I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by... BALMER: And he's the person who understood electoral potential of white evangelicals. And he set out to mobilize them. ARABLOUEI: The question was, how? BALMER: Weyrich understood that racism - and let's call it what it is - was unlikely to be a galvanizing issue among grassroots evangelicals. ABDELFATAH: So he needed to find another issue. At the time, evangelicals were concerned about all sorts of things - government overreach for one, and also social changes around roles of women, gay rights and free speech. Then in 1976, something unexpected happened. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIMMY CARTER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Good evening. Shortly before dawn, Jimmy Carter reached the end of... ARABLOUEI: Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist evangelical and Sunday school teacher, was elected president of the United States. Yet even as Carter became the face of evangelicals, he quickly began to lose support among them. BALMER: This is the great paradox surrounding Jimmy Carter and his career is that he's the person who begins to mobilize evangelical voters, or at least to awaken them about the political process. And then, of course, through the machinations of Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell and others, the same group of people turn radically against Jimmy Carter four years later. ABDELFATAH: Carter didn't share a lot of their conservative views. So during Carter's presidency, Randall Balmer says that Weyrich continued searching for that holy grail of issues, the thing that had the potential to really unite evangelicals around the Republican Party. And in 1978, five years after Roe v. Wade, it finally hit him. BALMER: I was reading through Weyrich's papers - midterm election, 1978 - and it's almost like the papers began to sizzle because Weyrich said, I found it; this is the issue that's going to work for us in order to mobilize grassroots evangelical voters. ABDELFATAH: Abortion. ARABLOUEI: Because while many evangelicals weren't initially all that bothered by Roe v. Wade, a few years on, the number of abortions had begun to climb, which made some evangelicals kind of uneasy. Weyrich saw that uneasiness as an opportunity. ABDELFATAH: He teamed up with some prominent anti-abortion activists and helped amplify resistance to abortion among evangelicals. It worked. In 1979, the Moral Majority was formed. They threw their support behind Republican candidate Ronald Reagan. And Reagan won. This began the close relationship between the Republican Party and white evangelicals.

Updated Nov. 7 at 10:40 a.m. ET Election Night 2019 is in the books. And while much of the focus is on the winning candidates in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia and what that might mean for the 2020 presidential election, millions of voters also decided on a range of ballot measures. Here's a short list of results from around the U.S. Tucson, Ariz. Proposition 205: Making Tucson a Sanctuary City fails While Arizona remains a conservative-leaning state, Democrats control the state's second largest city. Six years after the City Council designated Tucson an \"immigrant welcoming city,\" some sought to push that mandate even further by allowing residents to decide on whether it should become a \"sanctuary city.\" Given the chance on Tuesday, Tucson residents roundly rejected the measure, with initial results showing more than 70% of voters disapproving. If approved, Prop 205 would have put in place more restrictions on how law enforcement officials there impose immigration laws. BREAKING #Tucson's #Prop205 creating sanctuary city is going down hard. #12News pic.twitter.com/Sfjz8LkSCB As member station Arizona Public Media reports, if Proposition 205 had been OK'd, \"it would likely have faced legal challenges based on potential conflicts with SB 1070.\" That's the controversial Arizona law that allows law enforcement officials to check immigration documents if they suspect someone is in the country illegally. Even Tucson's newly elected Democratic mayor, Regina Romero opposed the measure, according to Arizona Public Media. Romero made history Tuesday by becoming the first Latina and first woman to win that post \u2014 even got a shout out by Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Congratulations to @TucsonRomero on her historic election as the first Latina and first woman mayor of Tucson, Arizona! Regina is a champion for our environment and working families\u2014and I'm looking forward to the big, structural change she'll bring to her community. Colorado Proposition CC Fails. Proposition DD narrowly passes Both these propositions have to do with taxes. Proposition CC would allow the state to take money intended for tax refunds and put it toward education and transportation costs. As Colorado Public Radio explains, Proposition CC \"would have allowed the state to keep money that would normally be returned to taxpayers because it exceeds revenue caps set in the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.\" However, voters rejected the measure, according to initial returns tallied by The Associated Press. Backers of Proposition CC had pledged that future tax refunds from the state \"would have gone to transportation, K-12 and higher education,\" as the member station reports. On Proposition DD, the measure to legalize sports betting had been too close to call but supporters were able to eke out a victory. By late Wednesday, the Colorado Secretary of State's office showed that \"yes\" votes had pulled ahead, 51% to 49%. Proposition DD will impose a 10% tax on a gambling establishment's house winnings for the state to use to fund water projects around Colorado. When the law goes into effect on May 1, CPR reports, the first sporting events Coloradans can \"bet on is the Rockies vs. Phillies game the night of May 1. Nationally, the Kentucky Derby is run the next day, May 2.\" Jersey City, N.J. Question 1 [restrictions for short-term rental properties] passes In what was called \"the most expensive municipal referendum\" in New Jersey history, Jersey City residents overwhelmingly approved increasing regulations on short-term rentals. The move was widely seen as a blow to Airbnb and VRBO. Voters said \"yes\" to limits on what units and properties are eligible for the part-time rentals, as well as capping the number of nights a property can be used as a rental at 60 per year, among other provisions. According to NJ.com, Airbnb spent more than $3 million to defeat the measure, but the company failed to make much of an impact, as more than 69% of voters said \"yes\" to Question 1. Voters in San Francisco rejected Proposition C, which was backed by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs and sought to overturn a San Francisco Board of Supervisors ban of e-cigarettes sales at brick and mortar stores, and barred deliveries of online purchases to addresses in the city.\n                \n                    \n                    Nam Y. Huh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voters in San Francisco rejected Proposition C, which was backed by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs and sought to overturn a San Francisco Board of Supervisors ban of e-cigarettes sales at brick and mortar stores, and barred deliveries of online purchases to addresses in the city. San Francisco Proposition C [on ban of e-cigarettes sales] is rejected In June, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a ban on the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes in the city until the Food and Drug Administration completes a product safety review. Proposition C, which was supported by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, sought to overturn the board's decision before the ban goes into effect at the start of the new year. The ballot measure failed. As member station KQED reports, \"voters overwhelmingly rejected the referendum, with the 'no' side pulling into a strong position just after polls closed Tuesday night and only strengthening its margin of victory as the evening progressed.\" The Board of Supervisors' ban prohibits the sale of e-cigarettes in brick and mortar stores, and also bars vaping devices bought online from being delivered to addresses in San Francisco. KQED adds that Juul spent more than $18 million to defeat this ban. Texas Proposition 4 [state income tax ban] passes Residents of Texas don't pay state income tax. On Tuesday night, Texans made sure it stays that way by approving a measure that make it even more difficult to impose such a tax. As the Dallas Morning News reports, Texas typically promotes the lack of a state income tax as \"a conservative bona fide and part of a key attraction for businesses.\" With the passage of Proposition 4, the newspaper notes, \"two-thirds of the Texas House and Senate will be required to vote to repeal the amendment.\" If that weren't enough, lawmakers now also have to schedule a statewide election to implement any state income tax. Washington state Referendum 88 [restricting affirmative action] too close to call People in Washington state appear poised to send a message to lawmakers: Race, sex and ethnicity should not be factors when selecting a qualified applicant. Voters banned affirmative action in 1998. Earlier this year, however, lawmakers passed a measure called Initiative 1000 that essentially reimposed affirmative action and allowed the state to weigh certain characteristics when making considerations on employment, contracting and acceptance in schools. Referendum 88 put I-1000 to a vote \u2014 enough \"no\" votes would keep the initiative from going into effect. As of Wednesday afternoon, the referendum was failing by a narrow margin. Assistant Secretary of State Mark Neary says Washington state is still counting roughly 365,000 mail-in ballots. As Seattle's KUOW notes: \"After majority Democrats passed [I-1000] in the final hours of the Legislative session this April, opponents gathered enough signatures over the summer to put the new law to a public vote. \"The opposition effort was led by a group of Asian Americans who said they feared their children would be passed over for university admissions in favor of other racial minorities. ... \"A mostly African American coalition delivered Initiative 1000 to the Legislature in January. This fall, a diverse coalition of business, labor and advocacy organizations, known as the Washington Fairness coalition, campaigned to protect the law from repeal.\" The affirmative action vote more than 20 years ago was \"emotional and highly charged,\" The Seattle Times notes, adding that Tuesday's vote in essence served as a new \"barometer for feelings about the state of equity and discrimination.\"",

Elizabeth Warren. Brown, like many progressive voters, thinks 2020 presidential candidates should \"not equivocate\" in calling Trump a white supremacist. Jeromy Brown, a 46-year-old teacher in Iowa, considers President Trump a white supremacist. \"If the shoe fits, then say it, and the shoe fits him,\" Brown said, while waiting in a photo line at an Elizabeth Warren rally in August. \"Why should he be excused from that label?\" Brown, like many white liberal voters, appreciates that some Democratic presidential candidates have begun explicitly referring to Trump as a white supremacist. His top choice, Warren, told The NPR Politics Podcast in August that \"when the white supremacists call Donald Trump one of their own, I tend to believe them.\" But she's not alone in using such strong and direct language. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly referred to Trump as a \"racist\" on the campaign trail. And former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke insists that tackling white supremacy should be the No. 1 law enforcement priority in the country. Undoubtedly, race and racism have become more salient political issues because of how the president talks about immigrants and minorities. But the shift in how white liberals think about race actually predates both the president's victory and the response from 2020 Democratic candidates. Beginning around 2012, polls show an increasing number of white liberals began adopting more progressive positions on a range of cultural issues. These days, white Democrats (and, in particular, white liberals) are more likely than in decades past to support more liberal immigration policies, embrace racial diversity and uphold affirmative action. Researchers say this shift among white liberals indicates a seismic transformation in the last five to seven years and not just a blip on one or two survey questions. \"The white liberals of 2016 or even 2014 are very distinguishable from the white liberals of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s,\" said Zach Goldberg, doctoral student at Georgia State University who has been studying the change. In poll after poll, on a range of racial issues, both Goldberg and another researcher, Andrew Engelhardt at Brown University, have independently discovered repeated evidence of a more left-leaning white Democratic electorate. These days, a large majority of white liberals \u2014 nearly 3 in 4 \u2014 say discrimination is the main reason black people can't get ahead. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. For some context, in the early 2000s, white liberals were split on that question \u2014 about half said blacks who couldn't get ahead were mostly responsible for their own condition. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. An increasing number of white liberals now think the criminal justice is biased against black people. An increasing number of white liberals also say the police are more likely to use deadly force against black people. And, more white Democrats say the Confederate flag is a symbol of racism, rather than Southern pride. The reverse was true in 2000. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Some metrics even seem to be suggesting that white Democrats express more woke attitudes than their fellow brown and black Democrats. Goldberg cited the 2018 American National Election Studies pilot survey, which found that 78% of white Democrats thought having more races/ethnicity in the country make it a \"better\" place to live. Fifty-seven percent of black Democrats, and 63% of Hispanic Democrats said the same. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. About two years ago, Engelhardt said he also noticed another major shift. \"Starting about 2016 ... white liberals actually rate non-white groups more positively than they do whites,\" explained Engelhardt. \"Usually, it's the opposite.\" Most racial groups feel more warmly about their own race than they do about other races. That's true for every group, except white liberals, according to the American National Election Studies. Engelhardt says these recent flips suggests there's something about being white in America that white liberals are trying to distance themselves from \u2014 something that could be accelerated by the rhetoric and tone of Trump and some of his supporters. When white liberals adopt some of these progressive positions, Goldberg said, they're \"virtue signaling\" \u2014 they want to prove that they're allies of minority groups and feel they need to do that more assertively and openly in the Trump era. Although Trump did not create the current conditions, both Goldberg and Engelhardt agree the president has accelerated the change in white voter attitudes. Brown, from the Warren rally, derided some of his fellow white people for being \"white supremacists\" who think they are the only people \"with the real birthright claim on this land, even though that makes no sense whatsoever.\" Engelhardt also suggests white guilt could be a motivating factor. At an O'Rourke rally in Iowa a few weeks ago, 64-year-old Polly Antonelli teared up as the former congressman recounted a story from the El Paso, Texas, shooting. The suspected shooter in that incident had told police he was targeting Mexicans. Antonelli said it's \"highly appropriate\" to refer to Trump as a white supremacist. \"He is the one dividing people, by saying the things that he says about Muslims, about Mexicans, about s******* countries,\" she said. \"Calling him out on his crap might sound divisive, but it's a reaction to his divisiveness.\" Antonelli admits that her own opinions on race have evolved as she learned more about different cultures. \"I realize how little I know and how I need to be more careful about what I say and how I pigeonhole people because of how they look,\" she said, indicating a sense of cultural awareness you hear more often voiced by white liberals in recent years. The \"moral buttons\" are being pushed One possible explanation for the dramatic shift in racial attitudes in the last decade is that white Democrats who disagreed with the party's embrace of diversity have just abandoned the party altogether. But even though the makeup of the parties has fluctuated, that's not the only explanation; Researchers point to a genuine shift among the white liberals who have remained in the party. \"Whites' identification as Democrats and Republicans is motivating them to hold different attitudes about people of color in the United States,\" said Engelhardt. Goldberg says he noticed an abrupt change around the time mainstream news outlets started picking up on social media accounts of fatal police shootings of black men. \"[White liberals'] exposure to injustice inequality has been heightened because of the internet,\" said Goldberg. \"The moral buttons of white liberals are being more frequently pressed.\" Engelhardt agrees, and pointed to one specific incident as a potential catalyst \u2014 when a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. \"This kind of renewed attention to discrimination is new and novel for white liberals,\" he said, explaining why there has not been as large of a shift among people of color on these survey questions, in part because they didn't need social media videos to know what was already happening in their communities.",

            "article_content": "U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., says that under current election procedure, there's \"no way\" he could win statewide office in Mississippi. Several African-Americans are now challenging those procedures.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., says that under current election procedure, there's \"no way\" he could win statewide office in Mississippi. Several African-Americans are now challenging those procedures. Mississippi voters will be choosing a governor and other statewide offices in November under a unique set of election rules that date to the 19th century. A federal lawsuit by four African-American citizens is challenging the system as racially discriminatory. The target of the lawsuit is what was called \"The Mississippi Plan,\" codified in the state's 1890 Constitution \"to take political power out of the hands of African-Americans, and it was extremely effective,\" says Paloma Wu, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Mississippi office. The constitutional convention was called after Reconstruction when African-Americans were winning elected office after the Civil War. The framers explicitly stated, \"It is the manifest intention of this Convention to secure to the State of Mississippi 'white supremacy,' \" according to the journal of the proceedings. \"It was headlined to keep political power in the hands of white people who were outnumbered by free black people and their descendants,\" Wu says. To that end, they adopted a two-tiered path to win statewide office, like governor or attorney general. Candidates must get both a majority of the popular vote, and win in a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts, (only 42 of which are majority black). Otherwise, the state house of representatives gets to decide who wins. Longtime Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson, a black Democrat, calls it the end of a line of notorious Jim Crow disenfranchisement tools. \"Whether it was the poll tax or the Black Code, there were a lot of things put in place [that] down through the years have been declared unconstitutional,\" says Thompson. \"To our knowledge, this is the last vestige of Southern discrimination in the electoral process.\" African-Americans are about 38% of Mississippi's population and tend to vote Democratic, while Republicans dominate the political landscape \u2014 including control of the legislature. Since Reconstruction in Mississippi \u2014 the state with the highest percentage population of African-Americans \u2014 there has not been a single black statewide office holder. Thompson says the election system has been effective in limiting the opportunity for black politicians to seek statewide office. \"Under the present terms, there's just no way that I could win,\" says Thompson. \"I could win the popular vote and lose the vote of the Mississippi legislature and it would nullify the will of the people.\" That's one of the arguments from four African-Americans who are suing in a case backed by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee's Foundation, the political action committee headed by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. \"When you have a system like this that was conceived as part of a discriminatory plan and it still plays out to make it more difficult for African-American voters to elect candidates of their choice, that's a violation of the Constitution,\" explains Rob McDuff, a civil rights lawyer with the Mississippi Center for Justice who is working on the case. The lawsuit names as defendants Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, both Republicans. They declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood, who is running for governor and could be affected by the outcome of the case. In a court filing, private lawyers representing Gunn and Hosemann wrote: \"neither the speaker nor the secretary wish to defend the motivations behind a law allegedly enacted with racial animus.\" Though they are seeking to have the case dismissed, arguing in part the timing of the complaint demonstrates it's about partisan politics, not race. McDuff, the plaintiff's attorney, acknowledges the political nature of the lawsuit in an election year, but says that doesn't change the argument that Mississippi's system dilutes the power of black voters. \"Because of the way Mississippi's House of Representative districts are drawn which makes it more difficult for the candidate of choice of black voters to win a majority of the electoral districts than the candidate of choice of white voters,\" McDuff says. Legislation to change the system has never gained traction. \"I think we're wasting time if we have that kind of language in our constitution, we need to remove it,\" says State Sen. David Jordan, a Democrat from Greenwood, Miss. \"I don't think I should be barred by something that was part of keeping me from reaching my potential based on, simply because my ancestors were slaves.\" Communications Director Nicole Webb said in a statement that the Mississippi Republican Party has no opposition to amending the constitution to remove the contested election requirements, but questions the sincerity of Eric Holder's interest in the case, calling it a \"continuation of national Democrats' attempts to delegitimize elections they do not win.\" Mississippi's two-tiered election test from the 1890 constitution has only come into play once \u2013 in 1999. Democrat Ronnie Musgrove won the popular vote for governor, but fell short of winning a majority of house districts. He was voted into office by a then-Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. But heading into this year's election, Republicans hold about 60 percent of Mississippi's 122 state house seats. And a tight race is anticipated between Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood.",

Joseph Biden of Delaware, seen in 1975, told NPR at the time that he supported a constitutional amendment to ban court-ordered busing programs to integrate schools.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, seen in 1975, told NPR at the time that he supported a constitutional amendment to ban court-ordered busing programs to integrate schools. In 1975, one of the most divisive cultural and political issues of the time was busing, the practice of putting black and white children on buses and sending them to different schools within a school district to achieve integration. Factoring prominently into the debate against busing, however, was a young, liberal, 32-year-old Delaware senator by the name of Joe Biden. Asked in an interview at the time by NPR's David Ensor whether he would go so far as supporting a constitutional amendment to stop court-ordered busing, Biden was open to it. \"That would clearly do it,\" he said, adding, \"I'm going to go at it through a constitutional amendment, if it can't be done through a piece of legislation.\" Here's the full quote from the transcript: ENSOR: What about a constitutional amendment, I asked Biden. Isn't that what you're going to end up supporting if you want to stop court ordered busing too? BIDEN: That would clearly do it. We are trying to figure out whether or not we can come up with an innovative piece of legislation which would limit the remedy and I don't honestly don't know whether we can come up with something constitutional. And if we can't I will not in an attempt to eliminate busing violate the Constitution. I won't do that. The only way if I'm going to go at it, I'm going to go at it through a constitutional amendment if it can't be done through a piece of legislation. Biden also warned in the interview that one of the reasons many liberals were in favor of busing is that racists were against it. \"I think that part of the reason why much of this has not developed, much of the change has not developed, is because it has been an issue that has been in the hands of the racist,\" Biden said, \"and we liberals have out-of-hand rejected it because, if George Wallace is for it, it must be bad. And so we haven't really looked at it. Now there's a confluence of streams. There is academic ferment against it \u2014 not majority, but academic ferment against it. There are young blacks and young white leaders against it.\" The Biden campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment. Biden defends himself The issue of busing has threatened to derail Biden's campaign after he came under attack from Sen. Kamala Harris of California at Thursday night's debate. Harris noted that she was bused as a child and was hurt by Biden's handling of remarks he made that he worked with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed. On Friday, Biden took another shot at defending himself, speaking in Chicago before the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, headed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \"I heard and I listened to and I respect Sen. Harris,\" Biden said. \"But you know we all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can't do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights.\" He added: \"I never, never, never, ever opposed voluntary busing, [such] as the program that Sen. Harris participated in, and it made a difference in her life. I did support federal action to address the root causes of segregation in our schools and in our community, including taking on the banks and redlining, and trying to change the way in which neighborhoods were segregated. \"I've always been in favor of using federal authority to overcome state-initiated segregation. In fact, I cast the deciding vote in 1974 against an amendment called the Gurney amendment, which would have banned the right of federal courts to be able to use busing as a remedy [to segregation].\" During the debate, Biden also said he was not against voluntary busing, only Department of Education-mandated busing. It sounded like a states-rights argument, similar to what had been used by those who wanted to keep segregation in place. But on Friday, Biden rejected that. \"These rights are not up to the states to decide,\" he said. \"They're the federal government's duty to decide. It's a constitutional question, to protect the civil rights of every single American. And that's always been my position.\" A historically divisive issue Busing was a hotly divisive issue in the 1970s. It was unpopular with white families and even divided black families. A 1973 Gallup Poll found that while a majority of Americans favored school integration, just 5% believed busing was the best way to do it. That went across racial lines \u2014 just 4% of whites and 9% of African Americans thought busing was the best way to do it. Americans thought other policies should be focused more on and would do a better job of achieving school integration, like changing school district boundaries to bring together students from different social, racial and economic groups (27%) or that there should be more affordable housing in middle-class neighborhoods (22%). Even a generation later, 82% of Americans said they favored letting students go to their neighborhood school over busing. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that almost 9 in 10 whites said so, and blacks were split \u2014 48% to 44%, with a plurality preference for keeping students in neighborhood schools. Even nearly three-quarters of younger respondents in 1999 \u2014 ages 18 to 29, who might have gone through busing themselves and who thought integration programs were beneficial \u2014 said letting children attend neighborhood schools would be better than busing. (Harris would have been 35 in 1999; Biden was 57.) A 1971 Gallup Poll found that fewer than half of Americans (43%) thought integration programs had improved the quality of education for black students. By 1999, though, 80% of those younger respondents thought they worked. In other words, the generational divide is real. In 1974, the Supreme Court weighed in on busing and \"white flight,\" which saw white families abandon the cities for the suburbs. In Milliken v. Bradley, the court struck down a plan to desegregate Detroit public schools by having white children, who lived in the suburbs, integrated into inner-city schools. The court said that was \"wholly impermissible\" and emphasized the importance of local control over public schools \u2014 and \"white flight\" only continued.

            "article_content": "Updated at 4:57 p.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden is defending his civil rights record after a rough Democratic debate Thursday night where California Sen. Kamala Harris blasted him over his past opposition to federally mandated busing. \"I heard and I listened to and I respect Sen. Harris. But you know we all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can't do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\" Biden told the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in Chicago. \"I want to be absolutely clear about my record and position on racial justice, including busing. I never, never, never ever opposed voluntary busing.\" The black community has historically strongly supported Biden. \"Y'all are the ones that brung me to the dance,\" he told the group of African American and labor leaders. But while jovial at times, his pushback underscores how important black voters are to the Democratic primary; it's a critical coalition that Harris is trying to flip to her side, beginning in earnest Thursday night. After more than 40 years in public life, Biden's record before he became the vice president to the country's first black president is getting renewed scrutiny. The longtime former Delaware senator argued he had long worked to address the \"root causes\" of education inequality for blacks and whites, including working to desegregate neighborhoods. He touted his support for extending the Voting Rights Act, along with his opposition to an amendment that would have effectively banned busing, which \"wasn't the most popular vote in the country at the time.\" \"These rights are not up to the states to decide,\" Biden said. \"They're our federal government's duty to decide. It's a constitutional question to protect the rights of every single American, and that's always been my position.\" \"I know I've fought my hardest to ensure [that] voting rights, civil rights are enforced everywhere,\" Biden emphasized. Harris, the only black woman in the Democratic contest, swiped hard at Biden during Thursday's debate in one of the most memorable and tense moments of the evening, not just over his approach to busing but over other recent comments about his \"civil\" working relationship with segregationist lawmakers in the Senate. \"It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,\" Harris said. \"And it was not only that \u2014 you also worked with them to oppose busing.\" She then described how growing up in California she was bused to integrate her public schools. \"And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly,\" Harris said. There was a little girl in California who was bussed to school. That little girl was me. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/XKm2xP1MDH Biden retorted that he \"did not oppose busing in America\" but \"busing ordered by the Department of Education.\" He said Harris' criticisms were  \"a mischaracterization of my position across the board.\" On Friday, however, Biden tried to focus on what he described as Trump's indifference toward growing racial violence. Biden also touted his eight years of service in the Obama administration. \"My president gets much too little credit for all he did,\" Biden said about the 44th president. \"I'm tried of hearing about what he didn't do. This man had a backbone like a ramrod.\" As for Trump, Biden said he has \"yet to apologize or criticize the Ku Klux Klan and the white nationalists,\" pointing specifically to the president's controversial equivocation after a rally involving white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. Trump said that there were \"some very fine people on both sides,\" after a violent clash of protesters. The Washington Post investigated Biden's past stances on busing earlier this year, finding that in the mid-1970s he was in fact resistant to busing as a solution as racial tensions were escalating back in his home of Wilmington, Del. The Post reports Biden took \"a lead role in the fight, speaking out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority-black schools and black children to majority-white schools. He played down the persistence of overt racism and suggested that the government should have a limited role in integration.\" In 1975, Biden told a Delaware newspaper, \"I do not buy the concept, popular in the '60s, which said, 'We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.' I don't buy that.\" Friday morning, Jackson told CNN that Biden's stance in the '70s \"was on the wrong side of history.\" He said Harris was \"on point\" with her comments. Rev. Jesse Jackson on Joe Biden's busing record: \"My judgment is it was the wrong side of history ... Kamala Harris, she was on point\" pic.twitter.com/gNSzUQ51Ww Still, at his organization's event Friday afternoon, Jackson \u2014 a civil rights leader who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and ran twice for president himself \u2014 introduced Biden. \"You have the stuff that it takes to make America better,\" he said.",

Castro, a former HUD secretary, has laid out a major affordable housing plan. Updated at 9:28 a.m. ET If you listen carefully, you'll hear something unusual on the presidential campaign trail this year. Democratic candidates are talking a lot about the lack of affordable housing, an issue that rarely, if ever, comes up in an election.  They're trying to tap into a growing national concern, as well as a potential voting bloc. Several of the candidates have offered extensive plans that they say would address the housing shortage that is affecting millions of low and middle income voters. They've proposed everything from refundable tax credits for overburdened renters, to spending billions of dollars on new affordable housing.  They've also raised the issue as a prime example of racial and income inequality, another focus of the Democratic campaigns. \"It is not acceptable that, in communities throughout the country, wealthy developers are gentrifying neighborhoods and forcing working families out of the homes and apartments where they have lived their entire lives,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who's running for the Democratic nomination, wrote recently in the Las Vegas Sun. And California Sen. Kamala Harris was met with cheers at a gathering of housing advocates in Washington, D.C., earlier this year when she said, \"The right to housing should be understood to be a fundamental right, a human right, a civil right.\" All of this is music to the ears of Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \"We've seen candidates talking more about the crisis and the solutions than we have I think in entire presidential campaigns in history,\" she says. Yentel says in the past, she and other advocates would listen to presidential debates and town halls waiting for the candidates to say anything about the affordable housing shortage \"and just sort of hang on for any word even remotely related to housing. Like, oh, he said 'community' or he said 'house.' \" But until this year, she says they never heard about housing policy or possible solutions. An aerial view shows homes under construction at a housing development in Petaluma, Calif., in January. As housing prices surge around the country, Democratic presidential candidates are offering plans to address the shortage of affordable homes and apartments.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An aerial view shows homes under construction at a housing development in Petaluma, Calif., in January. As housing prices surge around the country, Democratic presidential candidates are offering plans to address the shortage of affordable homes and apartments. Yentel thinks it's a reflection of the severity of the problem. Rents around the country have been rising faster than wages and almost half of all renters now have to spend more than 30% of their incomes on housing. About 11 million of those households spend more than 50% of their incomes on rent. Low-income families feel the most pain, but the problem has also started to creep up into the middle class. \"For voters who are in the rental housing market, the cost of housing is as big an economic stressor as virtually anything else,\" says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, whose polling has found housing costs are an issue in every region of the country, as well as in cities, rural areas and suburbs. And, he says, the concern is growing. When Garin asked voters in 2016 if they thought housing affordability was a problem where they lived, 39% said it was a fairly serious or very serious problem. This year, that number is 60%. \"That's quite a change over the course of one election cycle,\" he says. Perhaps of more interest to candidates, 75% of all voters this year say they would be more likely to vote for someone who has a plan to make housing more affordable, which may explain why candidates are lining up to offer plans. \"People are experiencing an affordable housing crisis whether they're Republican or Democrat, whether they live in a red community or a blue community, and whether they're middle class or they're working poor, whether they're white or black,\" says Julian Castro, who was the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama and announced his housing plan this week. He says it would not only address the lack of affordable housing, but would effectively eliminate homelessness in eight years. Castro would provide housing vouchers to all families who need help. Right now, only 1 in 4 families eligible for housing assistance gets it. He would also increase government spending on new affordable housing by tens of billions of dollars a year and provide a refundable tax credit to the millions of low- and moderate-income renters who have to spend more than 30% of their incomes on housing. Among the other proposals: One challenge for Democrats is finding a way to pay for their ambitious and costly plans. Warren and Castro have both said they would repeal some of the tax breaks enacted two years ago for corporations and higher-income individuals. President Trump has argued that those tax cuts are helping the economy, which in turn helps all Americans. The administration has said it hopes to increase the supply of affordable housing by providing tax incentives for construction in economically distressed areas, called \"opportunity zones,\" and by eliminating restrictive zoning laws. Another challenge for Democrats is getting low-income renters out to vote.  They're generally younger and more transient and tend not to turn out as much as wealthier homeowners. That's a concern for Charise Genas of Boston, who was at a candidate forum in Washington, D.C., this week sponsored by the Poor People's Campaign. \"I even pulled my kids by their ears saying, 'You're voting,' and they tell me 'Ma, my vote don't count.'  I say 'That's a lie, Every vote counts,' \" says Genas. She thinks the lack of affordable housing is the No. 1 issue for many voters this year, including herself.  Genas says her grown children currently have their own places to live, but \"they're saying, 'Ma, I might have to come home because the rent is so high.' \"",

Pete Buttigieg isn't giving President Trump much credit for saying the South Bend, Ind., mayor's marriage to a man is \"absolutely fine\" and \"good.\" \"That's nice,\" Buttigieg said dismissively in an interview on Friday with the NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio. \"I'm more interested in policies that affect LGBTQ people.\" Buttigieg's remarks came in response to comments made by Trump during a Fox News interview this past week. Asked to comment on seeing Buttigieg and his husband on stage campaigning, Trump said, \"I think it's absolutely fine, I do.\" He added, \"I think it's great. I think that's something that perhaps some people will have a problem with. I have no problem with it whatsoever.\" Buttigieg, who married his husband, Chasten Glezman, last June, has gone from a relatively unknown millennial mayor of a small Midwestern city to a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate in a historically large field. During this rise, one thing Buttigieg has done repeatedly is parry small dust-ups with Trump and Vice President Pence into news coverage, a valuable commodity with more than 20 other Democrats competing for attention and airtime. In his interview with NPR \u2014 which will be posted in the NPR Politics Podcast feed on Tuesday \u2014 Buttigieg was incredulous about the fact that Trump's comments were even news. \"What somebody says in an interview is one thing. How they govern is another,\" said Buttigieg. \"So much attention is given to whatever remarkably outrageous and vicious and insulting thing that the president said. Or I suppose in this case, the expectations are so low that he made news by saying something that wasn't viciously insulting. And that's not what matters.\" Taking aim at the administration's policies on LGBTQ rights, Buttigieg referenced reports of a State Department policy that some same-sex couples say is complicating the adoption and surrogacy process. The policy, Buttigieg said, \"effectively alienates the children of same-sex couples from their parents by saying that they were born out of wedlock if you're doing surrogacy or adoption abroad, which is discrimination.\" He also called on Trump to support the Equality Act, an LGBTQ anti-discrimination bill that passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Friday. It is unlikely the bill will be taken up by the Senate, and an administration official said the bill is problematic. \"The Trump administration absolutely opposes discrimination of any kind and supports the equal treatment of all,\" the official said. \"However, this bill in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.\" Buttigieg said he doubts Trump would support the bill, saying, \"That's a shame.\" Trump has long expressed openness to gay people and said in 2016 that same-sex marriage is settled law. But his administration's policies have favored religious freedom over gay rights, and early in his presidency he moved to ban transgender service members from the military. In what was a wide-ranging interview with the NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio, Buttigieg also joined other Democratic presidential candidates in criticizing the strict abortion restrictions signed into law last week in Alabama and passed by the legislature in Missouri. The Alabama measure outlaws almost all abortions in the state and makes no exceptions for cases of incest or rape. The Missouri bill would ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy or later and, like the Alabama law, includes no exception for incest or rape. \"What you have here is an agenda that is radical, that is out of step with what most Americans, even Americans in conservative states, believe is the right thing to do,\" said Buttigieg. \"It's disturbing. I think it amounts to an assault on freedom.\" The raft of new abortion legislation is on a collision course with the federal courts and possibly eventually the Supreme Court. Asked about whether he would have a Roe v. Wade litmus test for Supreme Court nominees, as some Democrats have suggested, Buttigieg wouldn't quite go that far. \"You can't necessarily do it by setting up hypotheticals, but believe me when I say that the vision of freedom that will get me elected president and that will be the basis for my interviews of judicial nominees would not leave room for the kind of assault on freedom that we are seeing in these states today,\" said Buttigieg. The interview is part of a series that the NPR Politics Podcast, Iowa Public Radio and New Hampshire Public Radio are conducting together with the Democratic field of 2020 candidates. Last week, NPR and NHPR also interviewed New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.",

The new rule, issued by the HHS Office for Civil Rights, affirms existing conscience protections established by Congress, director Roger Severino says.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P.

The new rule, issued by the HHS Office for Civil Rights, affirms existing conscience protections established by Congress, director Roger Severino says. The Trump administration issued a new rule Thursday that gives health care workers leeway to refuse to provide services like abortion, sterilization or assisted suicide, if they cite a religious or conscientious objection. The rule, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, is designed to protect the religious rights of health care providers and religious institutions. According to a statement issued by HHS's Office for Civil Rights, the new rule affirms existing conscience protections established by Congress. \"This rule ensures that healthcare entities and professionals won't be bullied out of the health care field because they decline to participate in actions that violate their conscience, including the taking of human life,\" OCR Director Roger Severino said in a written statement. \"Protecting conscience and religious freedom not only fosters greater diversity in healthcare, it's the law.\" Last year Severino made it clear that defending religious freedom was his primary goal when he created a new Division of Conscience and Religious Freedom. \"Never forget that religious freedom is a primary freedom, that it is a civil right that deserves enforcement and respect,\" Severino said when he created the division. As part of that change in focus, HHS in the last week also changed the Office for Civil Rights' mission statement to highlight its focus on protecting religious freedom. Until last week, the website said the office's mission was to \"improve the health and well-being of people across the nation\" and to ensure people have equal access to health care services provided by HHS. But the new statement repositions the OCR as a law enforcement agency that enforces civil rights laws, and conscience and religious freedom laws, and \"protects that exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions by individuals and institutions.\" That change, which was first noted by the Sunlight Foundation, dovetails with the new rule issued Thursday. The rule finalized Thursday allows health care workers who have a \"religious or conscience\" objection to medical procedures such as birth control or sterilization to refuse to participate in those procedures, even in a tangential way. This represents an expansion of existing protections. \"This rule allows anyone from a doctor to a receptionist to entities like hospitals and pharmacies to deny a patient critical \u2014 and sometimes lifesaving \u2014 care,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center, in a statement. Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, says the rule offers health care providers broad leeway to refuse women reproductive care, such as an emergency abortion to protect the life or health of the mother, if they claim the procedure offends their conscience. The rule protects health care workers who have indirect involvement in such procedures, as long as their roles have an \"articulable connection\" to a procedure such as abortion, sterilization or even administration of birth control. \"If I am the person who checks you into the hospital, that's an articulable connection. If I'm the person who would take your blood pressure, that would be an articulable connection,\" she says. The rule applies to individuals and also to entire institutions, such as religious hospitals. \"This rule is consistent with decades of federal conscience law,\" said Jonathan Imbody, vice president of government relations at the Christian Medical Association. \"Education about and enforcement of these laws has long been neglected.\" The group has dozens of stories on its website of health care providers who say they were punished because of their religious or conscience objections, including an OB-GYN whose malpractice insurance company said it wouldn't cover her if she refused to inseminate a lesbian and an anesthesiologist who refused to participate in an abortion and objected to referring a patient seeking one to another doctor when he refused to participate. In its rule, HHS cited a case, Means v. the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, in which a woman sued the church because she was denied an emergency abortion, was sent home multiple times by a Catholic hospital and ended up with an acute infection after she miscarried. The agency said the lawsuit filed by the patient is an example of hospitals being coerced to perform abortions against their will. The ACLU, however, says that same case shows that health care providers should not be allowed to put their religious beliefs ahead of the health of their patients.",

Partisan gerrymandering is back at the U.S. Supreme Court. A year and a pivotal justice's retirement after the high court dodged the question, those seeking to break the political stranglehold over legislative redistricting are urging the justices to draw a line beyond which the Republican and Democratic parties cannot go in entrenching their political power, sometimes for decades at a time. Two cases are before the court Tuesday. One is from Maryland, where Democrats drew new district lines to eliminate one of the state's two GOP seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The other is from North Carolina, where it was Republicans who drew maps to strengthen their political power. For nearly two decades, people have been challenging partisan redistricting as unconstitutional, arguing that, at some point, enough is enough. In 2004, the Supreme Court divided 5-4 in dismissing a claim on procedural grounds. The decisive fifth vote was cast by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who explicitly left the door open to striking down future partisan gerrymanders if \"a manageable standard\" could be found for courts to apply. \"Technology is both a threat and a promise,\" he wrote, noting that with the advent of computer technology, the temptation to leverage partisan advantage would \"only grow\" unless constrained by the courts. His hope, he wrote, was that \"new technologies may produce new methods of analysis\" for the courts to use in identifying and remedying the problem. An uphill battle without Justice Kennedy But Kennedy retired last summer and was replaced by the far more conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. That leaves the odds heavily against those challenging partisan gerrymanders. Uphill battle or not, on Tuesday it will be game on, with the focus mainly on North Carolina. There, the statewide vote is split roughly equally between Democratic and Republican voters, but the Republican-controlled state Legislature, in drawing the current congressional district lines, deliberately and openly drew them to maximize the GOP advantage. As Republican David Lewis, chairman of the state House committee on redistricting, put it: \"I propose we draw the maps to give an advantage to 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats, because I do not believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\" The openness of the Republican partisanship was at least, in part, because a previous, and similar, gerrymander had been struck down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Splitting a campus in half to dilute the Democratic vote The methods used by the North Carolina Republicans were the same as those used by Democrats in Maryland and most other partisan redistricting efforts across the country. It's called \"packing\" and \"cracking.\" That's when the drawers of the lines either pack in voters of the opposition party in one place to maximize their own power in other parts of the state or crack them and spread them out to dilute their strength. In North Carolina, the Republicans packed as many Democrats as they could into three districts, and then cracked other Democratic districts in half or in thirds, so that the Democratic vote would be diminished in safe Republican districts. Janet Hoy, co-president of the North Carolina League of Women Voters, points to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro as \"one of the best examples of gerrymandering and how damaging it can be.\" By splitting up predominantly Democratic Greensboro, she notes, half the dorms at the historically black North Carolina A&T campus were put into one GOP district and half in another. The League, Common Cause and voters in every district challenged the redistricting and won in the lower courts. But the Supreme Court blocked that ruling from going into effect and agreed to review the case. A lawyer returns to the battle 55 years later For lawyer Emmet Bondurant, who represents those challenging the redistricting, this is not a new fight. In 1964, at age 26, he argued before the Supreme Court that the one-person, one-vote principle should apply to congressional districts. He won 55 years ago, and he calls this case \"really a sequel.\" Now 82, Bondurant will tell the justices that while the original one-person, one- vote cases were about requiring legislative districts to be equal in population, this case is about ensuring that a representational democracy works as intended. With extreme partisan gerrymanders and no chance of winning in most districts, he argues, the party out of power can't recruit good candidates, can't raise money, or even interest its own voters in going to the polls. The only elections that actually matter in a district that is \"so rigged,\" he said, are primaries. The general election is \"irrelevant.\" And that, in turn, leads to further political polarization. The court, he observed, has long held that the Elections Clause of the Constitution \"prohibits a state from attempting to dictate electoral outcomes or favor or disfavor a class of candidates.\" \"What clearer definition could you have to outlaw partisan gerrymandering?\" he asks. Like getting rid of gambling in a casino Defending the Republican redistricting, lawyer Paul Clement also looks to the Elections Clause. \"The framers of the Constitution very consciously gave the authority to draw districts and make other election regulations to political entities,\" he notes, adding that partisanship in gerrymandering goes back 200 years. \"Trying to say that a certain degree of political gerrymandering or partisan gerrymandering is too much is like trying to figure out how much gaming in a casino is too much,\" he said. \"I like that analogy,\" an undaunted Bondurant retorted. In a state where gambling is illegal, he said, any casino would be illegal. And in the United States, where \"the First Amendment prohibits viewpoint discrimination against people in political parties, it's not a question of degree,\" he contended. \"The government has no business putting its finger on the scale.\" But, of course, it is to some extent a matter of degree, counters the other side. Clement points out that in the one-person, one-vote cases, the Supreme Court eventually came up with a formula, a \"right\" answer \u2014 in state legislative districts the population had to be equal within 10 percent, while congressional districts had to be pretty close to dead-on equal. So what is the formula here? During arguments in a partisan gerrymandering case last year, Chief Justice John Roberts called the proposed formula \"sociological gobbledygook.\" Among the criteria Bondurant is proposing this year is one that is easier to understand. It is that the North Carolina partisan gerrymander is, quite simply, an extreme statistical outlier. Bondurant points to studies conducted of alternative maps, as many as 24,000 alternative maps that statisticians drew, using the neutral factors like compact districts and respect for local boundaries. A data expert weighs in \"The map that the state chose is more extreme than 99 percent of all the possible maps you could have drawn,\" said Eric Lander, director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, who filed a brief in the case. Lander is an expert in analyzing large data sets and a geneticist who was a principal mapper of the Human Genome Project. By comparing the North Carolina redistricting map with tens of thousands of maps generated by computers using neutral principles, he said, you can identify the extreme outliers. \"Happily,\" he said, North Carolina's redistricting is \"so extreme\" that the court, for now, doesn't have to go further in developing a standard. In the future, Lander acknowledged, the court would likely want to develop a broader range of extremity beyond which states could not go \u2014 70, 80, 90 percent, for instance. That is what the court did in the 1960s and '70s in figuring out permissible population differentials. There is nothing unusual about this approach, Lander noted. Government scientists use exactly these kinds of computer models to determine the probabilities of \"a hurricane hitting Miami, or a nuclear plant being safe.\" Procedural dodges Nonetheless, the newly constituted conservative court majority may well want to stay out of what judges sometimes call \"the political thicket.\" And there are procedural ways the justices can avoid ruling in these cases if they want to. They could, for instance, say that none of the voters who challenged the North Carolina redistricting can show the kind of harm needed to have \"standing\" in court to sue. But if not these voters, then who? \"It may be that nobody has standing to bring these kinds of claims,\" Clement contended. And he points to the Supreme Court's refusal to hear challenges to the Vietnam War as an example of cases that could not get in the courthouse door, because nobody had standing to sue. Bondurant views that comparison as ridiculous. \"If the court rules in favor of Mr. Clement, \" he said, \"you are giving partisan state legislators what I will describe as a hunting license with no bag limits.\" And the results, he maintained, would be \"catastrophic\" for democracy.",

Bernie Sanders spoke with NPR.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke with NPR. The Bernie Sanders who's running for president in 2020 is not the same Bernie Sanders who ran in 2016. Yes, he has many of the same policy positions, and many of his 2016 supporters are enthusiastically backing him again. But the Vermont independent senator is no longer the insurgent taking on a political Goliath with huge name recognition. Now, he is the candidate with high name recognition, taking on candidates who are introducing themselves to the American people again. Not only that, but he is running against candidates who have adopted positions he energized Democrats around in 2016, such as Medicare-for-all and a $15 minimum wage. NPR's Rachel Martin spoke to Sanders about differentiating himself in this field of candidates, as well as why he thinks he can win this time. Sanders is the fourth candidate Morning Edition has interviewed as part of its Opening Arguments conversations examining White House hopefuls' core messages. Martin: \"The ideas that you championed during that [2016] campaign, which were then considered fringe are now not fringe. ... So if we take the Democratic presidential field, you've got candidates now who who sound like Bernie Sanders. So why do you need to run?\" Sanders: \"Well, maybe the more appropriate question is, 'Why do they need to run?' [laughter] \"Look, I've been doing this for a long time, and I'm very proud of the 2016 campaign, in the sense not only that the ideas that we fought for, which were, as you indicated, considered radical and extreme, but are now accepted. \"But the other part of the equation is that we reached out to the American people, and we said, look: it's not just the progressive agenda that we have to fight for. You need to be involved in the political process. If you want to transform this country, you can't do it unless millions of people begin to stand up and fight back, because change never occurs from the top on down. It's always from the bottom on up.\" In the 2016 Democratic race, Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in what became a simple outsider vs. establishment confrontation. His ideas, including single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free college, set him apart from Clinton and also helped him earn legions of fervent supporters. Sanders scored a sort of victory after 2016, as many of his ideas have caught on. But that victory may make his 2020 run more difficult, as he is now running against several other candidates with similar ideas. The challenge this time is not only to sell those ideas to skeptical, more-moderate voters, but to differentiate himself from other progressive candidates such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California. \"First of all, I mean, all of us agree that we want more diversity in our politics. I'm very proud of the fact by the way we played a role in this. I campaigned very hard for women candidates, for African-American candidates, Latino candidates. And if you look at the freshman class in the U.S. Congress, man, that does look like America in a way that we have not seen in a long time, and I'm very, very proud of that. \"But when I hear people, Democrats, independents talking, what they say mostly is we desperately must have a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump. And I think if you look at the 2016 election, if you look at areas where Secretary Clinton lost \u2014 in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana \u2014 I think we are as strong, if not stronger, than any other Democratic candidate in winning those states. \"So I intend to be campaigning vigorously all over this country. We intend to be putting together a strong coalition of blacks and whites and Latinos, Native Americans, Asian-Americans. We're going to focus on creating a government and an economy that works for all, and not just the 1 percent. And I think that's the formulation that can win the nomination and win the presidency.\" Democratic voters showed in 2018 that they are enthusiastic for nonwhite and female candidates \u2014 the current Congress is the most diverse ever, with a record number of women, almost entirely due to Democratic wins. Perhaps reflecting that, non-straight-white-male candidates appear to feel that now might be their time \u2014 the current field includes black, Asian, Latino, gay and female candidates. Still, Sanders is performing well in early polls. To win the nomination \u2014 and to win the presidency \u2014 he'd have to figure out how to put together a broad coalition of diverse voters. This was a challenge for him in 2016. While he performed well among young voters, as well as rural white voters, Sanders did particularly poorly among African-American voters. Sanders earned the support of only about 1 in 5 black voters, compared with about 3 in 4 for Clinton. (That said, he did much better among younger African-Americans than older ones.) Knowing this, Sanders has shifted his message somewhat this campaign. In his opening rallies of his 2020 campaign, Sanders invoked his activism for racial justice, including a college-era protest against segregation that got him arrested. Sen. Bernie Sanders\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders Martin: \"Would you support a reparations plan designed specifically to narrow that gap?\" Sanders: \"Yeah \u2014 but not if it means just a cash payment or a check to families. I would not support that. ... I am sympathetic to an idea brought forth by Congressman Jim Clyburn. ... And he has what he calls a 10-20-30 plan, which says that 10 percent of federal resources should go to communities that have had 20 percent levels of poverty for 30 years. In other words, the most distressed communities in America....\" Martin: \"But is there something special unique and exceptional that needs to happen when we're talking about the sin of slavery?\" Sanders: \"Well, you're right. The horrors of slavery all are horrors that are impacting African-Americans today. And it must be addressed. But I think if you're looking at the most distressed communities in this country, which is what Rep. Clyburn is talking about, unfortunately, they are often African-American communities, often Latino communities, sometimes white communities....\" Martin: \"I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has kind of claimed credit for the current intellectual movement behind reparations, has called for a national reckoning \u2014 that it doesn't matter if the policies in practice actually do what you're talking about, there needs to be an emotional awakening.\" Sanders: \"I think that's a very good point. I think that many of us, obviously Caucasians, are not fully aware of the horrific impact not only impact, but it's almost the unspeakable reality of what slavery did to this country.\" Sanders said he supports reparations, but the specific policy he describes here doesn't fit what experts say is the definition of such a policy. The 10-20-30 plan, for example, would likely disproportionately improve the lives of black Americans, who have higher rates of poverty than white Americans. But the point of reparations is to address the wrongs of discriminatory policies, including slavery, Jim Crow laws and redlining. This plan does not specifically aim to boost black Americans affected by those policies, nor does it include an element of specifically addressing and healing from those policies. \"Something that is economically inclusive but has a racial bent to it \u2014 those may or may not be good policies,\" Ohio State University professor Darrick Hamilton told NPR recently, \"but let's be clear: It's not reparations.\" Sanders did tell NPR he thinks white Americans need to be better educated about slavery. But he doesn't say it would be part of a specific reparations policy. \"I think what we have to do, and I will be doing it, is to do a better job maybe in explaining what we mean by socialism \u2014 democratic socialism. Obviously, my right-wing colleagues here want to paint that as authoritarianism and communism and Venezuela, and that's nonsense. \"What I mean by democratic socialism is that I want a vibrant democracy. I find it interesting that people who criticize me are busy actively involved in voter suppression trying to keep people of color or low-income people from voting, because they don't want a vibrant democracy. I do. \"Second of all, what it means, Rachel, is that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world we can provide a decent standard of living for all about people. That's just the reality. That's not Utopian dreaming; that is a reality. Health care for all can be done, and we can save money in doing it. We can have a minimum wage which is a living wage, and I'm delighted to see that, you know, right now, five states already passed $15 an hour minimum wage. The House of Representatives is gonna do it. We have got to do that.\" Republicans appear to be ramping up to make the term \"socialism\" one of their key weapons in the 2020 race. President Trump has repeatedly criticized socialism in his tweets and in speeches this year, and the term was repeatedly invoked at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. The term \"socialism\" is polarizing in U.S. politics \u2014 a slight majority of Democrats, 57 percent, said they had a positive view of socialism (however they define it) as of August 2018, according to Gallup. In that poll, Democrats were slightly more likely to view socialism positively than capitalism (47 percent). Meanwhile, Republicans were far more likely to view capitalism positively (71 percent to socialism's 16 percent). Polls have also shown that socialism is particularly popular among younger voters. While Sanders' \"socialist\" brand may play well among primary voters, it could be tougher to sell among more moderate Democrats and centrist or right-leaning independent voters. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll provides some evidence of this: Only 25 percent of Americans said they'd be enthusiastic or comfortable voting for a socialist, while 72 percent said they had reservations or were uncomfortable with the idea. Kelli Wessinger and Eric McDaniel produced and edited this interview for broadcast.",

Al Sharpton and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. at a November 2018 meeting of Sharpton's National Action Network on Capitol Hill. Klobuchar and other Democrats weighing a presidential bid have been courting the black community more intensively than past election cycles. Updated at 9:24 a.m. ET When Elizabeth Warren announced her exploratory committee for president at the end of last month, the Massachusetts senator didn't only talk about a crumbling middle class - her signature policy issue - but she acknowledged the impact of race and racism on the economy, saying that \"families of color\" face a rockier path \"made even harder by the impact of generations of discrimination.\" A few weeks later, Julian Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, explicitly spoke about reforming the justice system when he announced his candidacy for president, saying that \"for far too many people of color, any interaction with the police can become fatal.\" Just last week on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced her intentions to run for president by mentioning the need to take on \"institutional racism.\" And California Sen. Kamala Harris chose the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to announce her campaign, highlighting issues of racial inequality and her parents' experience in the civil rights movement. \"The thing about Dr. King that always inspires me is that he was aspirational,\" Harris told ABC's Good Morning America on Monday, nodding to a theme of her campaign. All of these Democrats are making explicit appeals to African-American voters in the early stages of announcing their plans to seek the presidential nomination. And at least half a dozen Democrats interested in the 2020 presidential race are speaking at events on Monday to commemorate King. It's a sign of how important black voters are in the Democratic primary and a recognition of the growing reality that to win a general election, they'll need strong black voter turnout. In 2016, black turnout fell in key cities, such as Milwaukee, Detroit, and Philadelphia, in states Hillary Clinton lost. \"You see the candidates centering these issues of racial justice. That just didn't happen in 2016 in the same way,\" said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a superPAC founded in 2016 to engage black voters. Shropshire says the rhetoric from Democratic candidates has shifted for two main reasons: as a reaction to the explicit racial divisions of the Trump era and shifting public perception around police brutality. \"In 2016, the Black Lives Matter movement was still new. I think candidates were unsure of how to respond to it,' said Quentin James, the co-founder of Collective PAC, an organization whose mission is to build black political power. \"It was almost a hostile relationship with them and many activists.\" In 2016, the country as a whole was grappling with how to talk about race and police brutality, said James, but in the years since, with more news stories of unarmed black men being killed, he thinks candidates have developed more nuanced responses. \"What I'm seeing in 2020 is that people are actually on the right side of those issues this cycle because they've had two to four years to think about how to address them,\" said James. Diverse field of candidates The 2020 primary will also likely be the most diverse field the Democratic party has ever seen with at least two African-American candidates - New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris. There is no doubt both Booker and Harris have a level of credibility in the African-American community. Booker has pushed to end mass incarceration and Harris has spoken up about the rate of black maternal mortality. In a limited survey of black women this past December, Harris did particularly well. The Rev. Al Sharpton says he expected Booker and Harris would resonate with black audiences, but he was surprised by how well a couple of other Democrats have been received: Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \"They just connected better than I thought they would,\" said Sharpton. \"I thought Warren had almost taken preacher lessons.\" Some analysts say white candidates who can convincingly connect with black audiences get an extra benefit, particularly given the racial tensions in the country. \"If you have a white candidate that frankly can give voice authentically to these issues ... it is counterintuitive in a way that I think helps the white candidate, said Cornell Belcher, a former pollster for Barack Obama's presidential campaigns and is now president of Brilliant Corners Research & Strategies. He points to Mitch Landrieu, who's white but connected with black voters by taking down Confederate statues around New Orleans when he was mayor of that city. \"For better or worse, I think a Landrieu, for example, taking on the Confederacy, in the long run, he gets more value out of that than say Cory Booker taking on the confederacy,\" said Belcher. But activists and analysts say black voters want more than just rhetoric. \"This can't be a road to Damascus kind of conversion,\" said Sharpton, who has met with nearly every serious 2020 Democratic presidential contender. Voters care are about how diverse a candidate's staff is, what the candidate's track records is, and, most important, policies that recognize the concerns of diverse black voters. \"This critique that's about economics and class that ignores the variable of race comes across as insulting to people of color,\" said Belcher, explaining that's why Bernie Sanders struggled in the 2016 primary. Both Belcher and Sharpton say none of the candidates have yet offered many concrete details to black voters. But Sharpton says, so far, at least, they're talking more about racial justice than before. \"Whether that is a political calculation or whether that's a sincere appreciation is what we've got to be able to see,\" said Sharpton. He says the candidates this time around realize they cannot win the nomination without significant support from black voters, so there is an understanding of the political reality in their outreach. \"You're not gonna be the nominee of the Democratic party if you are the candidate who's coming in 5th place in South Carolina,\" said Belcher, referring to one of the early primary states where black voters are an outsized portion of the electorate. In more than half a dozen states voting on Super Tuesday, which in 2020 will fall on March 3, just a month after the primaries begin, black voters make up at least 10 percent of the Democratic electorate. In some states like Alabama, more than 50 percent of Democratic voters are black. In a political climate where candidates need black voters in the primary season, some activists and analysts say there's a concern that this outreach is genuine, and not just politically strategic for the primaries. \"The question that I'm waiting to see is will candidates continue to talk about these issues when they go to Trump country,\" said James.",

Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Mo., sparked a national civil rights movement around how police and government treat black residents. Yet even as the political momentum around police accountability picked up in other places, some candidates and policies that emanated from the movement stalled around St. Louis and Missouri. But there's a big shift over the past year in St. Louis County, the place where a Ferguson police officer shot and killed Brown five years ago. A multiracial coalition banded together to elect Wesley Bell as St. Louis County's first African American prosecutor. He ousted Bob McCulloch, who was in office when a grand jury declined to bring charges against the police officer who shot Brown. \"The criminal justice system is predicated on trust. And people feeling that they have a voice and that voice is being heard,\" Bell said. \"And what we saw in Ferguson was a symptom of a much larger problem that people didn't feel that the system, the justice system, actually worked for them. And just to be clear on that because I've knocked on doors all over this county.\" Michael Brown Sr. gets ready to release balloons to honor what would have been his son's 20th birthday at a party to honor Mike Brown's life at Canfield Green Apartments in Ferguson, Mo., on May 20, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolina Hidalgo/St. Louis Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michael Brown Sr. gets ready to release balloons to honor what would have been his son's 20th birthday at a party to honor Mike Brown's life at Canfield Green Apartments in Ferguson, Mo., on May 20, 2016. Since he took the oath of office earlier this year, Bell has aggressively sought to implement ideas that gained favor after Brown's death \u2014 including setting up a unit within his office to investigate instances when police use deadly force. He also wants to steer low-level offenders into diversion programs that emphasize rehabilitation instead of prison. \"Just the fact that someone like myself in this office with those types of policies, which 10 years ago would have been unheard of, are signs that we're heading in the right direction,\" he said. \"We need to do better\" There's evidence that Bell's win is trickling down into the rest of St. Louis County government. Since taking over in late April after his predecessor's resignation, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page has successfully pushed for the county police department to be equipped with body cameras. He's working with white and black county council members to overhaul the county's jail and to make it illegal for some landlords to discriminate against tenants who use Section 8 vouchers.

Even folks with more conservative philosophical underpinnings recognize that we need to do something different in St. Louis County.\" There's been some modest progress in the Missouri General Assembly in enacting policy changes stemming from the Ferguson protests. Lawmakers went after cities that heap big traffic fines on motorists. Both political parties embraced overhauls to the criminal justice system, including focusing on mandatory minimum sentences. But unlike some other state legislatures, Missouri lawmakers haven't sought to change how police officers are investigated or how they're trained. And legislators from some St. Louis suburbs such as state Rep. Shane Roden say the Ferguson protests have backfired among their constituents. \"The people from Jefferson County from the outside view were mad,\" Roden said. \"I mean, it's an absolute disgrace \u2014 this is what happens when politics get involved in law enforcement issues.\" The pushback to Ferguson activism cascaded into national politics, where Donald Trump's bellicose rejection of the protest movement was part of his campaign for president. Cori Bush, a Ferguson demonstrator who unsuccessfully ran for Congress, said she has been frustrated to see politicians making complete support of law enforcement part of their campaign pitch. Demonstrators walk down West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson on Aug. 9, 2016, two years after Michael Brown was killed by a Ferguson police officer on nearby Canfield Drive.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolina Hidalgo/St. Louis Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators walk down West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson on Aug. 9, 2016, two years after Michael Brown was killed by a Ferguson police officer on nearby Canfield Drive. \"One thing that would really drive me nuts when people would say 'I stand 100% with law enforcement.' You don't stand 100% with your spouse. So let's stop that,\" Bush said. \"One thing we would always see on the ground, we would say 'Black Lives Matter.' And the response would be 'Blue Lives Matter' \u2014 when the response is really just yes. Yes they matter.\" Other activists believe that it's deceptive to use election results and passed bills as a measuring stick for progress. They also contend that five years isn't nearly enough time to wipe out housing and education segregation \u2014 or racism and distrust throughout St. Louis that has been in place for generations. American problems Bell, the recently sworn in prosecutor in St. Louis County, said he has noticed that people here now seem more willing to talk openly with each other about inequity and racism. And he says those tough discussions among ordinary people are critical.

And we're seeing it throughout the region. \"These issues have to be addressed as more than just African American or black or brown problems,\" he added. \"They have to be addressed for what they are \u2014 American problems.\"",

            "article_content": "When she was growing up, New Yorker culture writer Jia Tolentino attended a Houston megachurch with her family. \"The population was extremely white and wealthy, which my family was not,\" Tolentino says. \"It was the kind of place where you had a daily Bible class from first grade 'till senior year.\"\n                \n                    \n                    C. Elena Mudd\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jia Tolentino's strict Christian upbringing backfired. \"I am sure that you don't send your kid to Christian school for 12 years and hope that they'll do what I did: Which is have The New Yorker publish 7,000 words about how the church led me to love doing MDMA and love rap music,\" she says. The New Yorker culture writer was brought up in a Southern Baptist megachurch in Houston. She says the \"lasting legacy\" of that upbringing is a lifelong desire to replicate the ecstatic feelings she had experienced in the religion \u2014 which she sought out via hallucinogenic mushrooms and the drug MDMA, or Molly. In her new book of essays, Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion, Tolentino writes about how social media shapes identity, public discourse and political engagement, particularly for millennials such as herself. \"The Internet has obviously been an incredible ground for social movements being organized,\" she says. \"You saw the Parkland kids did it, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo ...\" But she warns that expressing opinions online can feel misleadingly meaningful. \"It's always a starting place, it can never be an ending place,\" she says. On her belief that opinion doesn't necessarily translate into action We will have a mass shooting in America and people will get online and express their very true anguish, and people express their anger and their righteousness, and this formidable undeniable moral narratives about how children should not be dying in the U.S. like this \u2014 and then nothing happens. And so the gun control debate is just a continual reminder to me: An opinion doesn't necessarily translate to action. Moral clarity, these days, it means a lot less than I would like it to mean. ... As someone whose job is to write down what I think, it's something that I have to remind myself \u2014 that it doesn't really matter when I say what I think. You can't just talk about it, you've got to be about it. ... I don't know how much a hashtag is worth compared to millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars from the NRA. I think the Internet has a way of making the representation of something seem equal to if not more important than the thing itself. And so it's sort of the signal of our desire for change and for accountability. Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino Hardcover, 303 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On the lessons she took from the Bible I think that the Bible itself led me to a leftist point of view. I would read the Gospels and think: These are books about economic redistribution and helping the hungry and the sick. I was drawn to that, and I was drawn to the purity of devotion that faith contains. And then what I would hear in church was much more often the \"prosperity gospel,\" which is that wealth is almost a sign of divine favor, and God wants us to be wealthy. ... If you're wealthy that means you're blessed and kind of implicitly it means you're worth more to God \u2014 or certainly to your country. The flip side of that is if you don't have any money, then that's also God's will, and I found that unbearable and so cruel. And that was one of the first things that made me think I would not be religious ... for very long. On how she connects the religious ecstatic tradition of her church with her later drug use One tradition within Christianity and within religion in general that I've always been drawn to is the ecstatic tradition. It's this idea that through attaining an ecstatic state you reach a sort of union with God. I found traces of that in my megachurch. ... The lights would be down, and everyone would have their hands up and the music would be so loud, and I would feel ... completely overwhelmed with a sense of ecstasy, and sort of nameless powerful connection with the people around me and with something mysterious beyond me. And I loved that feeling. My sort of inherent desire to reach for that feeling persisted long after my actual sense of religion, or adherence to it, or belief in it, belief in God, even, after that went away. I grew up in Houston in the early 2000s and that was a period where Houston rap was a world unto its own, and ... I started to access that feeling in different dark rooms ... when everyone had their hands up and everyone seemed sort of transported and out of their minds. ... I don't know whether it was because of this ecstatic tendency that I have in me that I believed in God in the first place, or if the ecstatic tendency that persists as a sign that I still believe after all of this. On being stationed in Kyrgyzstan with the the Peace Corps \u2014 and leaving after a year It was devastating. I think of this time in the Peace Corps as the great failure of my life in a lot of ways. ... The women I knew were so strong and ... domestic violence was endemic. It was everywhere and I was harassed constantly. ... I've always been inclined to think about the world in terms of systems and our tiny, tiny place in them, but there it was the first time that I'd understood how tiny I was within this network of global power and economic history. ... I was devastated to have more power than the women around me, and I also felt so powerless, and I couldn't process it. It was tough and it was incredibly instructive, and it was probably the hardest time in my life and also like one of the most important to me. On being a feminist writer who is sometimes critical of other women For a few years I worked in women's media, and for a couple of years, I was an editor at the feminist site Jezebel. And often we would report on something like, let's say the inadequacy of the idea of \"leaning in,\" or we would report on business practices by some female entrepreneur, and the immediate response we would get \u2014 not the only response, but one we would get consistently every time we did that \u2014 was: Isn't the job of a feminist to build women up, not tear them down? And that seemed to me to be a misuse of the freedom that we have to be critical and to treat women with respect, which means reporting on them like any other human. I think over the last 10 years, feminism has become \u2014 very wonderfully so \u2014 a more mainstream point of view. I think we saw it in the #MeToo movement, this idea that women's stories were important and to be given credence and to be centered became more of the default, which was incredible to see. And as feminism has become more mainstream over the last 10 years, part of that has been: We've gotten good as a culture in general at sussing out sexism. When a woman is criticized for being \"shrill\" or \"crazy,\" we know that those words are code for \"unlikable because you're a woman and you spoke for 30 seconds longer than I'd like you to.\" We've gotten great at protecting women against unfair criticism. And then, a couple of years ago \u2014 I just started to notice this idea \u2014 this sort of well-meaning protective impulse get twisted and co-opted and sort of stretched beyond any use or meaning. So, for example, when Melania Trump went to go visit the kids at the border wearing that Zara jacket that said [\"I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?\"] on the back and people very rightfully called her out for that being just an absolutely monstrous thing to do. ... And then the White House and conservative media sort of mounted what would nominally be a feminist defense which is \"a woman has a right to wear whatever she wants.\" It's like, \"Don't talk about her looks or her clothing choices,\" and then the discourse gets swallowed into three days of talking about whether or not it was sexist to criticize her clothes. On the origin of the idea that criticizing women isn't feminist I've tried to think about what freedoms I have that women 10, 20, 30, 40 years older than me didn't when they were my age. And one of them is to not be threatened by disagreement and not be threatened by someone thinking that I'm wrong. Jia Tolentino Male power has had such an intense, strong stranglehold on America that I think there's reason to think that this coalition of people that believe that women are equal is constantly under threat, to the point that we must present a united front. But ... I'm 30. I feel lucky to have been born at a time when I took it for granted as a kid that I could be what I wanted. I've tried to think about what freedoms I have that women 10, 20, 30, 40 years older than me didn't when they were my age. And one of them is to not be threatened by disagreement and not be threatened by someone thinking that I'm wrong. I think that it's another thing that the Internet sort of exacerbates is this idea that ... it's really important to have everyone agree with you, that means something. And for me, criticism coming from a sincere place is a really important thing. On wishing for body neutrality versus body positivity I think the body acceptance movement, in a lot of ways, and the diversification of the beauty ideal to not just be like a stick-thin, white, blond supermodel etc., in a lot of ways that's obviously, obviously very great. [More] people are able to [see] themselves as beautiful than ever before. At the same time ... what I would prefer is for beauty to be less important, to not need to say, \"all women are beautiful,\" but to be able to say that it doesn't matter, that you don't need to be beautiful, to de-escalate the importance of beauty. ... I've often wished for, like, a body neutrality movement, or I just don't need [to] think of myself as beautiful and that's totally fine.

At 37 years old and having held no higher office than mayor, Pete Buttigieg has gone from an unknown presidential candidate with a difficult-to-pronounce name to holding well-attended rallies and generating buzz with televised town halls over the course of a couple months. One thing that has helped him earn attention in the crowded 23-person Democratic field is how he talks about his faith and how he talks about his marriage. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, married last year in an Episcopal church in South Bend, Ind., where Buttigieg is finishing his second term as mayor. \"It has made me more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware, more decent,\" he told the audience at the LGBTQ Victory Fund's brunch in Washington, D.C., in early April. \"My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.\" Mayor Pete Buttigieg: \"My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man, and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.\" https://t.co/76lcMjQckB pic.twitter.com/czcdF2s1mq There's a history there. Buttigieg came out publicly in June 2015 with an editorial in his local newspaper. It was just weeks after then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a religious freedom law that set off a nationwide political firestorm because it opened the door to discrimination against LGBTQ people. And it complicated the relationship between the two politicians, to say the least. In a wide-ranging interview with The NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio, Buttigieg was asked to recount a time in his life when he failed. While he didn't cite a specific incident, Buttigieg turned again to his marriage. Buttigieg greets attendees of the Iowa 2020 Book Club, which meets regularly to read every presidential candidate's autobiography before the caucuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Olivia Sun for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Buttigieg greets attendees of the Iowa 2020 Book Club, which meets regularly to read every presidential candidate's autobiography before the caucuses. He spoke about how one can \"say or do something that hurts somebody you love.\" \"Your politics doesn't make you a good person,\" Buttigieg said. \"I'm not sure anything makes you an outright good person or bad person \u2014 that we're all capable of doing good or bad things. And if you want to know how much good you can do, and how much hurt you can do, just ask somebody you love.\" Asked to explain what he meant back in April when he said his marriage moved him closer to God, Buttigieg explained: \"My understanding of my faith is that \u2013 through a Christian framework \u2013 part of what we are called to do is to lay down our own self-interests, after the model of divinity that comes into this world in the form of Christ and lays down his life. And in order to do that, you have to care about something or someone more than yourself. So much of the New Testament is about love. The idea that God is love. The idea that the greatest of these faith hope and love is love. ... \"But I think there's a real relationship between romantic love and the kind of love that is talked about in my faith's tradition. The kind of love that motivates and animates. The kind of sacrifice, and the kind of humility, and the kind of reaching out to others that I believe my faith calls on me to do. And that that is the way to be nearer to God. And my marriage has done that for me, because there's a person in my life who I learned to care about more than I care about myself.\" Hear the full episode of the podcast at the audio link above.",

            "article_content": "Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow by Henry Louis Gates Hardcover, 296 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? American history, as it exists in the popular imagination, has often tended toward the self-congratulatory. Events of the past are frequently filtered through a majority lens, focusing on the perceived heroics of, for example, white abolitionists and civil rights activists. To hear some tell it, the civil rights struggle of the 1960s ended when President Lyndon B. Johnson, having indulgently listened to Martin Luther King Jr., signed the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, after which racism was solved and everything was better forever. It's for this reason that while most Americans are generally familiar with Reconstruction, the period of time afterward that is sometimes called the \"Redemption\" era frequently gets forgotten. As literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. puts it in his brilliant new book, Stony the Road, Redemption was \"when the gains of Reconstruction were systematically erased and the country witnessed the rise of a white supremacist ideology that, we might say, went rogue, an ideology that would long outlast the circumstances of its origin.\" Gates' book is a fascinating social and intellectual history of the time between Reconstruction and the rise of the Jim Crow period of American history. It's an absorbing and necessary look at an era in which the hard-fought gains of African-Americans were rolled back by embittered Southern whites \u2014 an era that, in some ways, has never really ended. Stony the Road \u2014 which takes its name from a line in \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" often called \"the Negro national anthem\" \u2014 seeks to explain how the racist dismantling of African-Americans' civil rights came about and how it influenced the way people of color experience the country today. The first part of the book deals with the backlash to Reconstruction by whites, including some white people who themselves opposed slavery: \"Reconstruction revealed a fact that had been true but not always acknowledged even before the Civil War: that it was entirely possible for many in the country, even some abolitionists, to detest slavery to the extent that they would be willing to die for its abolition, yet at the same time to detest the enslaved and the formerly enslaved with equal passion.\" Gates goes on to explore how whites justified their reluctance to extend civil rights to African-Americans through their use of \"racial science, journalism, political rhetoric, and finally fiction and folklore.\" He looks at the pseudo-scientific theory of polygenesis, which held that different races of people had different origins, and the eugenics movement, \"the most devastating form of scientific racism,\" which advocated selective breeding of humans with the goal of producing more \"desirable\" people. Both were responsible for decades of suffering experienced by African-Americans. Finally, Gates writes about the racist iconography that played \"a pivotal role in persuading American society that black human beings were not only fundamentally different from white people, but irreversibly different in kind, and dangerously so,\" and traces the rise of \"the New Negro,\" a term referring to mostly middle-class African-Americans who sought to fight against discrimination while subverting the racist stereotypes that had haunted black people for decades. It will come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with Gates' impressive body of work that Stony the Road is every bit as fascinating as the author's previous books. It's a work of history, but a living one \u2014 Gates explains how the years following Reconstruction still affect the lives of Americans today. \"I often wonder if Frederick Douglass and his fellow abolitionists could have imagined the extent to which this antiblack racist discourse would remain very much alive in American society a century and a half after the end of the Civil War,\" he writes, and sadly, one doesn't have to search very deeply to find analogs of the Southern \"Redeemers\" today. He also handily dispenses with the myth that the fight against American racism ended with the election of President Barack Obama, which, absurd as it sounds, some people still somehow believe. \"Looking back roughly two years after Donald J. Trump's election,\" Gates writes, \"the idea that one black person's occupancy of the White House \u2014 and a presidency as successful as his \u2014 could have augured the end of race and racism seems both na\u00efve and ahistorical.\" Reconstruction and the Dawn of Jim Crow by Henry Louis Gates and Tonya Bolden Hardcover, 225 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Gates' analysis is predictably brilliant, but he's also just a joy to read. He writes in long sentences that don't ramble, but rather draw readers in and keep them engaged; his gift at crafting elegant prose serves to complement the persuasive arguments he makes in his book. Stony the Road comes just two months after the publication of Dark Sky Rising: Reconstruction and the Dawn of Jim Crow, a wonderful young-adult nonfiction book he co-wrote with author Tonya Bolden. That book is an excellent introduction to the era he writes about in Stony the Road; both are wonderful additions to the field of American history, though, obviously, for different audiences. And both should be required reading for anyone who seeks to know how America ended up the way it did. \"The process of Reconstruction involved nothing less than the monumental effort to create a biracial democracy out of the wreckage of the rebellion,\" Gates writes. It's an effort that's ongoing, and Gates makes a convincing case that it's a fight we can't afford to abandon.",

            "article_content": "A Memoir in Essays by Damon Young Hardcover, 307 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Editior's note: This story contains a racial epithet. Damon Young says he's spent much of his life waiting to be called by a name we won't repeat, even though it appears in his new memoir \u2014 What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker \u2014 a lot. His essays are pointed, ruminative, often barbed and funny reflections on how the fact of his skin color has posed particular lifelong challenges, questions, and anxieties. \"My parents have this story about the time where they basically got into a race riot at this neighborhood deli in Pittsburgh, because the white boy behind the cash register called my mom and my grandmother niggers,\" he recalls. \"Deli meats were thrown all over the place, windows were broken, olives were scattered, it was a mess. And so, this happened when I was maybe six or seven years old, and so my parents would tell this story at gatherings and at parties, and I wanted a story like that for myself, about a time where I was racially intimidated or that word was used against me, and I was able to defend myself ... and the book deals with similar sorts of anxieties and similar sorts of absurdities that just spring from this entire 'existing while black' experience.\" On his love for his father He's not just my dad, he's one of my best friends. He taught me to write \u2014 I remember when I was like in seventh or eighth grade, I would have these take-home essays I'd have to write for class, and he'd help me with them. I'd get A's \u2014 well, he would get A's, because he would basically write them, like, I wasn't getting the A's. He was getting the A's. And he would teach me these words like \"behoove\" and \"cognizance,\" and these words that I would try to, in sixth or seventh grade, try to incorporate at recess, with minimal success. And so my dad has been this constant positive force throughout my life, and he still is. On whether racism contributed to his mother's death She had been a smoker for 30 years, and people know that if you smoke for that length of time, there's a higher likelihood that you will develop certain diseases. But I just think about, what about the environmental and structural and atmospheric forces that may have compelled her to smoke for that long? I think about the years before her cancer was diagnosed, when she would complain about back pain and stomach aches and headaches, and was going to the doctor's, and sometimes they'd give her Advil or tell her to get more exercise. It makes me wonder, you know, would they have taken her pain more seriously if she wasn't a black woman? And I am 95% certain that her race impacted her health, and also impacted how she was treated \u2014 but I'm not 100%, because you can't be. And that gap between the strong likelihood and the certainty, that gap is what drives people crazy sometimes. On basketball \u2014 and his conservative point guard I played in high school, went to college on a basketball scholarship, and I still try to play as much as I can now. When I do find a good pickup game, you stick with that, and so there's one that I'm a part of, and the majority of the guys who come to this game, who frequent this game, are white, including one guy who is probably my favorite guy to play with. He's this great passer, great teammate \u2014 I also knew that he was not just a conservative but a pretty dogmatic Trump supporter. And so the week of the election, this game still went on. And usually for me, basketball is my, that's my release, that's my self-care, that's my catharsis. That's where I go and play and sweat and, you know, just go through this whole process of just feeling better. And so there's a chapter in the book that talks about just, I guess, the absurdity of attending that game that week, where it exists as a stress reliever, but then you're going there and playing with a guy who I know has contributed to the stress in an indirect way \u2014 and also the navigating and the negotiating that is almost mandatory if you're a black person in America. On a chapter about holding his daughter The whole chapter, at least the first part of the chapter is just ... me navigating how to give her all the good parts of me, while kind of hiding all the bad parts, and hoping that the bad parts die with me. Wanting her to be discerning, but not so discerning and so thoughtful that she gives herself acid reflux, like I have. And then also recognizing that yes, she is black, but she is a black girl, which means she'll also have to contend with sexism on top of the racism, and that makes things even more difficult. You know, I think it ends on a hopeful note, because I look at her and I see my mom, I see my dad, I see myself, I see my wife, and it ends on the hope that yeah, maybe she will take the things that I believe are the good things from me, and the things that I believe are the good things from my wife, and the things that I believe are the good things from my parents, and be able to put those things together and succeed \u2014 whatever success looks like for her.",

Soon after, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said Israel \"has complete equality of rights for all its citizens.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Gali Tibbon/Pool via Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arab citizens have equal rights under the law but that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people \u2014 and only them. Soon after, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said Israel \"has complete equality of rights for all its citizens.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is drawing criticism for saying that Israel is \"the national state, not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people.\" The comment prompted many people \u2014 including Israel's president and the star of Wonder Woman \u2014 to defend Israel's Palestinian Arab minority. Palestinian Arab citizens are about a fifth of Israel's population and often face discrimination and accusations of disloyalty. The prime minister's comment set off criticism, debates over Israel's true nature \u2014 and observations that with Israel's legislative elections now less than a month away, Netanyahu's provocative language might be calculated to help his Likud Party at the polls. Netanyahu and his party are warning that if they lose upcoming elections, the new government could include Arab political parties. The saga began when Israeli actress and TV host Rotem Sela posted an Instagram story about comments that Culture Minister and Likud member Miri Regev made during a news interview. Sela questioned why Regev's statements about what she called the dangers of Palestinian Arab citizens taking part in a governing coalition went unchallenged. \"When the hell will someone in this government tell the public that Israel is a country of all its citizens,\" Sela wrote. Much of the dispute that followed played out on Instagram, where Netanyahu responded to Sela, \"Dear Rotem, an important correction: Israel is not a state of all its citizens.\" Referring to a hotly contested law adopted last year that defines Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, the prime minister said Arab citizens have equal rights under the law, but that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people \u2014 and only them, Ynet News reported. Israeli movie star Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman, weighed in, backing Sela and calling her an inspiration. \"Love thy neighbor as yourself. This isn't an issue of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,\" Gadot said on Instagram, according to The Associated Press. \"It's an issue of dialogue.\" On Monday, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter that Israel \"has complete equality of rights for all its citizens,\" adding, \"There are no first-class citizens, and there are no second-class voters. We are all equal in the voting booth. We are all represented at the Knesset.\" Rivlin did not refer to Netanyahu directly, saying in a tweet, \"Recently, when political thinking is turning all reason on its head, we hear entirely unacceptable remarks about the Arab citizens of Israel.\" For political observers in Israel, the story has echoes of 2015, when Netanyahu posted a last-minute video on the day of a national election, claiming (falsely, it turned out) that right-wing rule of Israel was in danger because large numbers of Arab voters were heading to the polls in buses provided by left-wing groups. The tactic was widely criticized \u2014 but it was also credited with helping to sway the election result. During this election season, Netanyahu's camp has circulated the phrase, \"It is either Bibi or Tibi\" \u2014 using the prime minister's nickname and referring to rival Ahmed Tibi, a Knesset member since 1999 and leader of Ta'al, also called the Arab Movement For Change party. But Netanyahu's actual rival for the prime minister's chair is the Blue and White Party's Benny Gantz. Earlier this month, the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement in which it \"called on Israeli political leaders across the spectrum to stop delegitimizing Israeli Arab political parties and vilifying the Arab minority population of Israel.\" In that statement, Carole Nuriel, the director of ADL's Israel office, said recent incidents of politicians using anti-Arab rhetoric were \"a deeply troubling trend that, if it continues, could undermine Israel's vibrant democracy.\" This is not the first public dispute between Netanyahu and Rivlin, two former allies in Likud. Rivlin was an early critic of the Jewish nation-state measure, saying shortly after his election in 2014 that it risked separating the concepts of Israel as being both democratic and Jewish. In 2015, Rivlin also criticized Netanyahu for his behavior toward then-U.S. President Barack Obama. The prime minister had clashed with Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and angered him by visiting Washington to deliver a controversial speech to a Republican-led Congress.",

Should Northam step aside, Fairfax would become Virginia's second black governor.\n                \n                    \n                    The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, D-Va., has not called for embattled Gov. Ralph Northam to resign. Should Northam step aside, Fairfax would become Virginia's second black governor. Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax is a lot of things Virginia's current governor is not: young, charismatic and part of a multicultural wave sweeping through the commonwealth's Democratic Party. He could soon be called upon to lead the state, should Gov. Ralph Northam, a fellow Democrat, reverse course and adhere to the avalanche of calls \u2014 from inside and outside Virginia \u2014 for him to resign. If that happens, Fairfax would be only the second African-American governor to serve in the history of Virginia, and one of just a few across the country since Reconstruction. Fairfax, who is 39, was seen as a rising star within the party long before the controversy surrounding Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page, which includes a picture depicting one man in blackface and one dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member, erupted late last week. Northam has resisted calls to resign. On Monday, Fairfax denied a sexual assault allegation first reported by the online publication Big League Politics. The blog published a screenshot of a chat message from the accuser, describing a sexual assault in 2004. A source close to the accuser confirmed that the screenshot is authentic. The Washington Post has reported that the accuser \"described a sexual encounter that began with consensual kissing and ended with a forced act that left her crying and shaking.\" The Post said it did not publish a story when it learned of the allegation months ago because the publication was not able to corroborate the woman's account. Fairfax, speaking to reporters as he left the state Senate Monday, acknowledged he met the woman in 2004 and said they \"ended up going to my hotel room.\" But, NPR member station WVTF's Mallory Noe-Payne reports, he denied the alleged sexual assault, calling the accusation \"completely false,\" \"completely uncorroborated\" and \"totally fabricated.\" \"Everything was 100 percent consensual,\" he said. He mentioned his wife and young daughter, saying his family and faith are strong. Fairfax's office also released a statement earlier Monday on Twitter denying the allegation. \"Lt. Governor Fairfax has an outstanding and well-earned reputation for treating people with dignity and respect. He has never assaulted anyone \u2014 ever \u2014 in any way, shape, or form,\" the statement read, adding that the lieutenant governor \"will take appropriate action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false accusation.\" The silent protest Since assuming office a little more than a year ago, Fairfax has drawn praise for standing up against celebrations of Virginia's racist past. As lieutenant governor, one of Fairfax's duties is to preside over the state Senate. Last month, on Robert E. Lee's birthday, while elected officials paid tribute to the Confederate general, Fairfax stepped off the dais and sat in quiet protest. \"I want to be clear that my children, my grandchildren will not see me on videotape presiding over a motion honoring people who fought for a set of laws and a society that would have enslaved members of their family,\" Fairfax told  WVTF shortly after the protest. \"It was the right thing to do for him and the right thing to do for Virginia,\" says Jeffrey Bourne, a Democrat in the Virginia House of Delegates. Bourne is a member of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, which has called for Northam's resignation. He says Fairfax's protest sent a message that racism and bigotry are things in Virginia's distant past. \"It was a great testament and an example of who Justin Fairfax is, and who Justin Fairfax will be in his public service life.\" Fairfax is descendant of a Virginia slave, named Simon Fairfax, who was emancipated in 1798. The lieutenant governor says that he had a copy of his great-great-great grandfather's manumission documents in his pocket when he was sworn into office in 2018. Fairfax received his undergraduate degree from Duke University and studied law at Columbia, both on scholarship. Before taking office, he served as assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. His wife, Dr. Cerina Fairfax, is a dentist who has a family practice in Northern Virginia. They have two young children, Cameron and Carys. For his part, Fairfax has not called on Northam to resign following the revelation that the governor's yearbook page included a racist photo. In a statement Saturday, Fairfax said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the images, and he told NBC4 in Washington that he hoped the governor would come to the right decision. \"We're at this really important inflection moment in the history of Virginia, and this nation, and we need leaders and leadership that can unite us,\" Fairfax said. Northam apologized for appearing in the photo late Friday and \"for the hurt that decision has caused then and now.\" On Saturday, he reversed his position, saying he was actually not in the photo. \"Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now\" Virginia Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have called on Northam to resign. So have leading presidential hopefuls Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. So did former Vice President Joe Biden, who also tweeted over the weekend that \"Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.\" There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now. Not to mention President Trump and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who have also called for a resignation. Rachel Bitecofer, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., says Fairfax leading Virginia through this time of healing could be a good thing for the state. \"I do think there's a lot of symbolic value from having Justin Fairfax become the state's governor at this critical juncture in American politics, particularly here in Virginia where racial politics have been so much in the limelight.\" She points to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., at a Unite the Right rally, and to 2018 GOP Senate nominee Corey Stewart, who ran as a champion of Confederate values. She adds that should Fairfax serve the remainder of Northam's term, he would be eligible to run for a full four-year term in 2021. Under Virginia's Constitution, governors are limited to one elected four-year term. But because Fairfax would assume the role, he could run again.",

            "article_content": "Protests erupted across south India after women sneaked into a temple that banned females old enough to menstruate. The temple is part of a debate between gender equality and religious freedom.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Protests erupted in southern India this week... (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in foreign language). SIMON: ...Over the fact that three women set foot in a Hindu temple, the Sabarimala temple. It's a famous pilgrimage site that attracts thousands of devotees each year. And for centuries, the temple did not admit women between the ages of 10 and 50. But this week, three women who are in their 40s managed to enter the shrine. NPR's Lauren Frayer reported on the story for us last month. And now she joins us from her base in Mumbai, India. Lauren, thanks so much for being with us. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: You're welcome, Scott. SIMON: And what sparked these protests? FRAYER: Well, the Sabarimala temple is dedicated to a celibate deity - Lord Ayyappa. And some faithful believe that women of childbearing age could be a distraction to him. Some also believe that women who menstruate - who are old enough to menstruate - are impure. And in fact, after these women visited the temple this week, Hindu priests did purification rituals at the shrine. We should remember that temples, churches, mosques around the world have similar restrictions. I mean, some have separate areas for women and men to pray in. Other religions do have rules about what women who are menstruating can and cannot do. But this ancient temple and its rules really hit a nerve in modern India. It became the target of a right to pray campaign by Indian feminists. So this is a religious issue, but it's also becoming political. In fact, the Indian Supreme Court ruled - back in September - that the temple's ban on women aged 10 to 50 amounts to gender discrimination. SIMON: And how are Indian politicians handling this in a country whose politics is sometimes so divided along these lines? FRAYER: That's right. India's prime minister is a Hindu nationalist - so is his ruling party. So this issue plays very well with his base. But the state where the temple is located, Kerala, is ruled by communists. And they have lined up behind the women. They say they'll uphold the Supreme Court order and ensure women of all ages can pray there. They've even ordered police to escort women to the temple. But that may cost them votes. Protesters have burned effigies of Kerala's chief minister. And even the main opposition party in India, Congress, the party of Mahatma Gandhi, is backing these Hindu nationalist protesters rather than the women. And that may be because elections are coming. And polls show a majority of Indians think this temple has a right to set age restrictions on women. In fact, the Supreme Court now says it will review its ruling later this month. It may change its mind amid such a backlash. SIMON: Well, how do we read what's happened? FRAYER: Small step towards gender equality or infringing on religious freedom - you know, that depends on who you ask. To some, the fact that these three women got into this shrine, yes, is a victory. Before they did, there was a feminist protest, a human chain encouraging women to enter the temple. But the three who did are now under police protection - in hiding for their own safety. I mean, I can tell you, I went to the temple late last year - or rather, I tried to get close to it. I couldn't get a taxi driver to take me within 20 miles. I had to have a police escort. Hindu men are stopping cars, checking for women who are under age 50. My hotel receptionist warned me to stay away. And so many devotees I talked to, though, said they didn't want to discriminate against women. That's not their aim. They just want to practice their religion as they see fit. And their freedom of religion, to them, means keeping women who could be menstruating away from a certain god, a celibate god.

About 300 miles south of Salt Lake City, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is at the heart of some of the most remote terrain in the lower 48. Famous for its red rock canyons, arches and fossil beds, the rugged land is punctuated by sites like Death Ridge, Carcass Canyon and Hell's Backbone Road. Those names staked on the old maps by the region's first white settlers tell you all you need to know about how harsh, brutal and beautiful the land is. \"Them old cowboys back in those days, they were tough,\" says Shannon Steed, a businessman and armchair local historian. Steed comes from a long line of Mormon pioneers: the cowboys and loggers who helped tame this country, as locals put it, and scratch out a living from it. His hometown Escalante, population 800, along the meandering Escalante River is ringed by mesas. The town has long struggled economically, especially since its timber mill closed in the 1990s \u2014 Steed's father ran it. Depending on who you ask, things got even worse when President Bill Clinton protected much of the area as a national monument in 1996. Today, it remains a flashpoint for one of the rural West's perennial and most polarizing fights \u2014 who gets to do what on federal public lands. In December 2017, President Trump signed a proclamation shrinking the protected boundaries of the GSEM nearly in half. This summer, the administration is moving ahead with plans to open up parts of it to mining and expanded cattle grazing, despite legal challenges and a recent effort by Democrats to thwart the move.

'E for Escalante' The latest battle over the Grand Staircase is reigniting a decades-old debate about the future of the rural communities in and around the monument, which have lately seen an influx of newer residents setting up businesses around tourism. On the outskirts of town, Steed points out a closed timber mill his dad used to own. Up to his left is a large \"E\" painted on the side of a hill. \"It doesn't stand for environmentalist,\" Steed says. \"It stands for Escalante.\" In some corners of this town, environmentalist is still a dirty word. \"We've always said it's God's country,\" Steed says. \"The people from out here said that's because nobody'd have it but God, and now it seems like everybody wants it.\" Shannon Steed stands on land that used to house his father's sawmill. The mill closed in the early 1990s due in part to a lack of available timber supply from nearby National Forest lands.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shannon Steed stands on land that used to house his father's sawmill. The mill closed in the early 1990s due in part to a lack of available timber supply from nearby National Forest lands. From Steed's perspective, the environmentalists won the land in 1996 when Clinton designated it the largest national monument in the country. The original designation protected roughly 1.7 million acres (Congress later added to it to make it 1.9 million). \"He just made a big land grab out of it and locked it all up,\" Steed says. If Trump's proclamation holds in court, and the monument is downsized into three smaller units, much of the land could be reopened to mining. Nearly two-dozen mining claims have already been filed, mostly from locals. One Canadian company looked into mining cobalt after Trump's proclamation. There is also believed to be extensive coal reserves, but there are long-standing questions about its economic viability. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. And then there are the ranchers who lease federal public land in and around the monument to graze livestock. When Clinton designated the monument, most existing grazing leases were grandfathered in. But no new leases were to be issued. That could soon change. In political limboTodd Phillips is a rancher who has grazed his cows on the monument land for years. But he's not betting his future on expanded grazing within the monument. \"I think it depends a lot on the election,\" Phillips says. \"I think if a Democrat gets in, I think they're gonna put it back like it is and probably then some just to prove a point.\" Congressional Democrats just ordered an investigation. They claim the Trump administration illegally appropriated funds to redraw the monument boundaries based on where they could lease land to industry. They really do, they actually hate us. Shannon Steed On the ground, federal land managers say they are just following orders from above as the ligation plays out in federal court. They're currently drafting a plan for how the land, and underlying resources, will be used. \"We've been told by those above us that we need to get this plan written,\" says Harry Barber, the acting manager of the monument for the Bureau of Land Management. \"We'll do it until we're told not to.\" Utah \u2014 with its conservative politics, history of a robust environmental movement and world-famous national parks and monuments \u2014 is one of the most tense states in the nation when it comes to control of federal public lands. Utah's elected leaders are often seen as at the forefront of the push to transfer vast amounts of public land to state or private control. In Escalante, locals like Shannon Steed and Todd Phillips see their rural heritage as being under threat. \"Some of these guys, these radicals, aren't gonna be happy until there isn't any cows left on public land,\" Phillips says. Steed agrees. \"They really do, they actually hate us.\" A rural divide But this isn't just an ages-old western tale pitting rural ranchers against influential environmentalists from liberal cities like San Francisco or Washington. Today Steed and Phillips now share their communities with a diverse set of people. More recent transplants are running businesses that have sprung up since the monument was created: from the James Beard finalist, farm-to-table restaurant to modern hotels and vacation cabins to the thriving Escalante Outfitters, owned by Nathan Waggoner and his family. \"These are public lands. They don't just belong to people in the gateway communities here where I live,\" Waggoner says. \"They don't just belong to people in the state of Utah. They belong to everybody.\" Located between Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument has become a big tourist draw since its designation in 1996.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Located between Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument has become a big tourist draw since its designation in 1996. Waggoner worries that a new mine or more cattle could turn the protected land into an industrial zone and drive the tourists, and his source of income, away. He employs more than two dozen people who work in his outdoor gear shop, cafe, cabins and outfitter. Increasingly, the traditional tourist season is expanding in length, meaning only a couple of lean months a year when the business may close. That's really hard to have a small business in America with such big strings being pulled. Nathan Waggoner Since President Trump signed the proclamation at the Utah state capitol in December 2017, Waggoner says he's been operating in a state of constant uncertainty. \"That's really hard to have a small business in America with such big strings being pulled,\" he says. Waggoner joined one of the lawsuits filed by a local environmental group called Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners. They're arguing President Trump illegally usurped Congress by shrinking Escalante and the nearby Bears Ears monuments' boundaries. Legal experts have widely held that, under the Antiquities Act, a president can designate a monument but only Congress has the power to shrink it. When she first moved to Escalante in 2007, says Nicole Croft, executive director of Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners, the monument designation was so controversial that \"you did not tell people you moved here because of the monument.\" So instead she would give the other reason she moved \u2014 her son's asthma. She wanted to escape the winter smog in Salt Lake City and raise her family in a small town. Croft says politicians are stoking the fight over the monument, playing on people's fears of economic uncertainty. \"Grazing represents the pioneer spirit and the hard-scrabble heritage that Mormon people are really proud of,\" Croft says. \"You know, that's part of my Mormon heritage that I'm very proud of. \" Mistrust of the federal government also runs deep in that Mormon heritage. Especially in southern Utah, where in the 1800s, the feds dispatched troops to stop the settlers from practicing polygamy. For Nicole Croft, anti-government leanings may be behind the resistance to a changing economy. It's a phenomenon that's occurring across the rural West where once-natural resource dependent towns are transitioning to more recreation and amenities, sometimes to the chagrin of families who've worked the land for generations. The new tourism jobs don't tend to pay as well as jobs in the mining sector. But, since the Grand Staircase monument was designated, this isolated region's population has actually grown, alongside a 24% increase in new jobs. Even Shannon Steed, the longtime local, relies on tourism. He runs wild west-themed shows, tours of dinosaur fossil beds and petrified forests and rents out restored farm houses on Airbnb. But he says there's a catch. \"The tourism around here is seasonal,\" Steed says. \"You've got six months to make it and six months to starve.\" More mining and ranching could coexist here with the tourism, Steed says. It's an argument that will be debated into 2020 and beyond.",
