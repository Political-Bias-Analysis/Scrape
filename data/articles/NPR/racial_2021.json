On Wednesday afternoon, Enes Kanter, a center for the Boston Celtics, traded his uniform for a t-shirt bearing an image of the Dalai Lama, and read a pro-Tibet message that has prompted Chinese broadcasters to take the Celtics off the air in China. \"My message for the Chinese government is 'Free Tibet.' Tibet belongs to Tibetans,\" Kanter said in the video, describing restrictions, imprisonment and \"cultural genocide\" he attributed to Chinese rule and calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a \"brutal dictator.\" \"After learning all of this, I cannot stay silent. I stand with my Tibetan brothers and sisters, and I support their cause for freedom,\" he said. Dear Brutal Dictator XI JINPING and the Chinese GovernmentTibet belongs to the Tibetan people!#FreeTibet pic.twitter.com/To4qWMXK56 With the video, Kanter waded into the long-running debate over the sovereignty of Tibet. Internationally, the region is recognized as part of the People's Republic of China. But Tibetans disagree; since 1959, a Tibetan \"government in exile\" based in India has protested what it calls an illegitimate colonial rule. Now, all Celtics games have been removed from Tencent, the huge Chinese streaming platform that carries NBA games. Neither the NBA nor Tencent has released a public statement on the situation, nor did either immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. \"[Kanter] was clout-chasing, trying to get attention with Tibet-related issues. His wrong remarks are not worth refuting,\" said Wang Wenbin, the spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, at a press conference Thursday. \"Tibet is part of China.\" It is not the first foray into pro-democracy activism for Kanter, who was born in Switzerland to Turkish parents. His critical comments about the regime of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have caused Turkish authorities to revoke his passport and demand his extradition to Turkey, where he has been indicted for alleged involvement with a terrorist organization. Kanter denies the charges and says they are politically motivated. But with his comments about Tibet, Kanter has waded into an especially sensitive subject for the NBA, as China is by far the league's largest foreign market. The NBA, perhaps the most politically progressive men's professional league in the U.S., has long fostered a culture where players feel free to voice their opinions on issues like police brutality, racial justice and presidential elections. But players and staff have repeatedly run into trouble when criticizing China, whether about Tibet or pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. In 2019, as the protests in Hong Kong were at their peak, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted an image to Twitter that read \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" On mainland China, the backlash was immediate \u2014 and especially notable because the Houston Rockets had long been China's most popular NBA team, thanks to a Hall of Fame-level career by Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming. After Morey's tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association, led by Ming, cut ties with the Rockets. The Chinese consulate in Houston issued an anti-Rockets statement. Chinese businesses removed Rockets merchandise for sale. Tencent delisted Houston games and China Central TV canceled NBA broadcasts. Afterward, the NBA called the tweet \"regrettable,\" and Morey apologized after deleting the original tweet. \"I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\" he wrote. Two years later, Tencent still does not offer streams of the Philadelphia 76ers, where Morey now works as the president of basketball operations. The NBA is far from the only sports league to face backlash in China after critical comments by players. After Arsenal star Mesut \u00d6zil spoke out against the treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in China, the Premier League's broadcast partners in China refused to show the team's matches. Arsenal publicly distanced itself from the comments before benching \u00d6zil. He left the team earlier this year.",

Experienced critics know: sometimes it pays to be skeptical of TV show revivals that try to make an old series feel fresh by changing the race of the main characters.But ABC's Black-centered reimagining of TV's classic exercise in nostalgia, The Wonder Years, avoids that pitfall for a simple reason.  The year in which it is set, 1968, was one of the most pivotal times for Black America in recent history. Think about it. Malcom X had already been assassinated. Riots over racial issues convulsed poor Black neighborhoods from New York City to Los Angeles. The Vietnam War was claiming more young brothers every year. And Black artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield were trying to shrug off their buttoned-down images and bring a grittier, street-level energy to their art. That's why I was so excited to see that, in ABC's new version of The Wonder Years, 12-year-old Dean Williams' father was a too-cool R&B musician who also teaches at a local college in Birmingham, Alabama. Played by The West Wing and Psych alum Dul\u00e9 Hill, Papa Williams has a hit record on the radio and a habit of telling his family to \"be cool\" whenever a tense moment approaches.The pilot episode set the scene quickly, with charismatic star Don Cheadle serving as Dean's grown-up voice, narrating the action as if he was looking back through a slender haze of nostalgia.\"Growing up, Mom and Dad gave me 'the police talk,' about how to handle yourself around cops,\" Cheadle says over images of young Dean (Elisha \"E.J.\" Williams) riding a bike through his neighborhood, a Sam and Dave song percolating in the background. \"There was a presidential election that created a racial divide, and there was a flu pandemic that they said would kill a million people around the world. But it was 1968... and that's the state our country was in.\" Surprise! Turns out that 1968 was more like 2021 than you might think. What I love most about this new Wonder Years is how it balances coming-of-age moments which are universal for middle class Americans \u2013 bullies at school, wanting your crush to notice you, struggling not to embarrass yourself at a Little League game \u2013 with stuff that was specific to Black families like mine.Dean's dad cautions him that setting up a Little League game against a white team might not end well. When Dean asks about certain subjects his parents are talking about, he's reprimanded with a curt command: \"Stay out of grown folks' business.\" Dean has to wonder if his white teacher is racist in a way that might actually help him and gets beat up in school for acting too white. Elisha Williams plays Dean Williams in The Wonder Years reboot.\n                \n                    \n                    Erika Doss/ABC\n                    \n                \nhide caption Elisha Williams plays Dean Williams in The Wonder Years reboot. And a twist at the episode's end brings home how different this era can be for Black folks hoping to reach toward equality in the years to come.  A recent rewatch of the original Wonder Years pilot from 1988, starring Fred Savage as 12-year-old Kevin Arnold and soon-to-be Home Alone costar Daniel Stern as his grown-up voice, reveals a show positioned as a baby boomer's manifesto. Kevin is heading into middle school struggling to balance his geeky friends, overbearing siblings, a simmering crush on a neighbor and the occasional intrusion of bigger events, including \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 the death of a neighborhood boy drafted to serve in the Vietnam War. Filled with needle drops worthy of The Big Chill soundtrack \u2013 When a Man Loves a Woman, Turn, Turn, Turn and With a Little Help From My Friends were in the pilot episode alone \u2013 the show explained the formative years of a generation reared in a suburban paradise and tempered by war in Vietnam, sliding from the Age of the Greasers to the Age of The Hippies.Their world was so white it almost hurts your eyes to look at it now. One big reason changing the races of characters in a series reboot can make sense is because the adjustment can reclaim a bit of cultural space \u2013 allowing people of color to tell their own stories in a fictional world where they had previously been rendered invisible. (Though it is interesting that series star Fred Savage also serves as an executive producer for the reboot and directed the pilot episode.)That's the real reason I enjoyed the new Wonder Years reboot so much. Here, I'm not the one trying to imagine how people like me would fit into a narrative set at such an important time.  And, just maybe, the rest of America might learn a little more about its history by seeing those pivotal moments from a perspective different than their own.",

From the pandemic and protests for racial justice to a pivotal presidential election and Senate runoff, the last year and a half has been a news cycle like no other. And yes, professional journalists across the country have been all over it. But so have student journalists at college newspapers around the country. In Athens, Ga., students have been running the University of Georgia's newspaper, The Red & Black, since 1893. Editorial meetings this last year may have unfolded over Zoom, but these students have been covering huge stories in person. Taylor Gerlach, a recent graduate and former photo editor of The Red &Black, was documenting a protest near campus right after Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd when police came in with tear gas. \"I heard canisters being fired, and it was just a moment of chaos. I saw the gas and my throat started burning,\" Gerlach says. \"I was just making photos. It was like my brain was in work mode.\" Gerlach raced back to her apartment, showered to wash off the tear gas and then started uploading. She says it hit her that night that she was there to bear witness, that she, a student journalist, was holding people in power accountable. As part of NPR's We Hold These Truths series, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been talking about the press and its role in our democracy. We're ending this installment meeting the next generation, including The Red & Black's spring editor-in-chief, Sherry Liang. From her office in the newsroom, she spoke about what it's been like to lead a newspaper in this mother of all news cycles. \"I have moments where I just sit there and I'm like, 'I don't know the answer' sometimes. And then I think, 'Yeah, that makes sense because I'm 20 years old.' I'm not supposed to know the answers,\" Liang says. \"Most of us aren't even of legal drinking age, and we're trying to cover our town and our university and we're one of the primary sources of news here. So it's been a lot to process.\" Liang spoke to NPR's All Things Considered about growing up in a news environment defined by former President Trump's attacks on the media, the power of journalism to make a difference in the community and the way she thinks bringing your identity and experience into reporting is the future of news reporting. Listen in the audio player above, and read on for highlights of the interview. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. On why the paper has had a record number of new recruits I think especially at the end of last year, during the summer, people have kind of dispersed because they're quarantined with their parents across the country. And we had record digital metrics that summer. And I think people were really seeing the importance of being able to have an accountable news source to check what's going on, check the protests. Parents were sending us news tips like crazy. And so these were all factors that I think punched up our recruitment and made people want to join. On wanting to practice journalism despite former President Trump's attacks on the media I think we kind of grew up in an interesting time because in 2016, when Trump was elected, I was also taking my first journalism class in high school. So this was kind of like our reality that we entered the field into. I guess what we find is that there is a very vocal minority, as well, of people who don't trust the news. But at the same time, we have very loyal readers who are subscribed to our newsletter, who look at our app every morning, who genuinely come to our site for answers, and I think it's important not to lose sight of that. On how the paper handled editorial decisions that many national newsrooms also faced At the start of the summer, when I was digital managing editor, we were having these really long conversations about what objectivity meant, what professionalism meant. It was like, hours on hours each week of just sitting there and talking through [these questions]. It started with trying to make a policy about AP style. So like, \"Should we capitalize the B in Black?\" We landed on capitalize. We had sources come up to us and saying, like, \"Hey, if you're going to write an article about us, we want you to capitalize the B in Black.\" It was hard for us to say \"no\" to that because they've trusted us with their stories and part of it is building trust with the community. On the impact of last year's events on students' desire to continue into journalism I don't think this last year has dissuaded many of us from entering this field at all \u2014 if anything, it's given us more reason to enter and help make a change. A lot of us have come into this field because we want to hold our institutions accountable. Especially as an independent news organization, I think we have a lot of power in this community to make a difference. I don't know what that [career] would look like exactly for me; I think a lot of us are just figuring things out as they come. But I don't think this last year has dissuaded many of us from entering this field at all \u2014 if anything, it's given us more reason to enter and help make a change. On bringing personal experience and identity to news reporting I had a big identity crisis, when the Atlanta shootings happened. It hit very close to home because I grew up around Atlanta, so I was very familiar with the area; I grew up in a majority Asian community. A lot of questions about my identity as a journalist came up, especially as we've come to find, I think I'm the first East Asian editor-in-chief at The Red & Black as well. That experience made me realize: Is there a possibility that journalism can be personal as much as it is news reporting? And is there a way we can have people of these identities report on the news as we would see on the front page of any major news organizations, but also talk about their experiences?  Because I think that's just as valuable and it improves the credibility of the journalist as well. Sam Gringlas and Courtney Dorning produced and edited the audio of this story.

From the pandemic to racial justice protests, a contested election and a second presidential impeachment: The events of the past year divided the nation, but they also challenged conventional notions held in newsrooms about objectivity and fairly representing diverse points of view. For NPR's We Hold These Truths series examining what is and isn't working in America's democracy, All Things Considered's Mary Louise Kelly has been pulling back the curtain on how the media works to explain why journalists cover the news the way that they do. For this installment, she spoke with a trio of newsroom leaders: Terence Samuel, NPR's own managing editor for news; Sara Just, executive producer of PBS NewsHour; and Dawn Rhodes, senior editor at Block Club Chicago, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to ground-level local reporting. The group discussed how they've responded to the events of the past year and whether they've made permanent changes to how they report the news. Listen in the audio player above, and read on for highlights of the interview. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. On choosing the right words to describe key events Terence Samuel: We had a huge discussion about whether George Floyd was \"killed\" or whether George Floyd was \"murdered.\" And that was not just a conversation limited to this newsroom, but literally all the readers and all the listeners felt that they had enough information to weigh in on that conversation. Even when we said he was killed, some people complained that he was murdered, and suddenly \"killed\" was no longer a powerful enough word to describe it. Sara Just: One of the phrases I think that we talked about was \"protesters\" versus \"members of the community\" [to describe] people who came out to protest. Sometimes that distinction of remembering that these are people in their community, talking about what they want to see in their community, has a different kind of impact. The other language distinction that I recall having in real time wasn't last summer but on Jan. 6 when we were discussing whether to call the people outside the Capitol \"protesters\" or \"rioters\" or \"a mob.\" I remember that day, [the guidance] just changed as the day went along, minute-by-minute. Dawn Rhodes: Our language was definitely \"they stormed the Capitol\" and \"it was an attempted coup.\" We definitely used that language, understanding that [race typically informs these decisions]. I think in news media, we probably wouldn't be wrangling over this so much if the color of the people or the demographics of the people doing something like that were different. And so understanding that, if they were a group of Black supporters or Latinx supporters, people would be calling that \"a riot.\" People would be calling that \"a horde of people.\" One of the things that we struggled with in that language of describing what happened to George Floyd \u2014 what happened to Jacob Blake, what happened to Breonna Taylor and so many people last year \u2014 was just using active voice. We tried to make a decision to say \"police [shot] Jacob Blake,\" \"police killed George Floyd,\" \"police killed Breonna Taylor,\" and that was a switch. On whether their newsrooms have changed how they report on police or treat police sources: Samuel: For a long time in traditional media, when you said \"check it out,\" in some places what that meant was actually \"check with the police\" because that was the official source. You wanted to see the police report. Suddenly it was clear, and I think people who have been covering protests and police shootings over the last decade or so have come to understand, that police reports are not as reliable as we made them out to be. And so we have gone beyond just relying on police sources and particularly, police reports. Rhodes: [Being a local newsroom] definitely informs the way that we write about crime and write about anything involving police. Through our reporters being in the community and neighbors [knowing] to contact them to say \"Hey, did you hear about this?\", very often, we come across people who have seen a crime happen, and they can give context that the police can't. And sometimes the story ends up being very different. How the current moment has changed how newsrooms think about balance and objectivity Just: We don't need to go find someone to come on our program to say \"Black lives don't matter,\" but really understanding that reporting on the community must include people with all different views. And so when we talk to people in a community where a protest has happened, we talk to people who participated in the protest., we talk to people who did not participate in the protest \u2014 as much as we can. That kind of balance informs our work, even though it doesn't necessarily lead to an actual debate. Rhodes: I think that we all mean well when we talk about approaching stories with objectivity; I think the intent behind it is OK. But I think that really glosses over who's being served by these very traditional notions of objectivity and neutrality. Our approach to it isn't so much objectivity in the way that we traditionally understand it, it's about being fair. I think that when we start our stories from a place of understanding that a situation is inherently unfair and it's inequitable and that certain people here, they don't have as much opportunity to tell their story, I think that that helps us achieve a little bit of balance because we're starting from a sense of \"things are not balanced.\" Ashish Valentine, Sam Gringlas and Courtney Dorning produced and edited the audio of this story.

MUMBAI \u2014 Sagar Kishore Naharshetivar has been driving a van around southern India with his father lying in the back, hooked up to an oxygen tank. His father has COVID-19 and needs treatment. This past week, they've tried hospitals in three different towns, even crossing state lines from Maharashtra to Telangana. All the hospitals are full. \"We can't find a hospital bed for him, but I can't just take him home after all this, in his condition,\" Naharshetivar told local TV, speaking through a pink patterned bandanna in lieu of a mask. They've been driving for 24 hours, he says. He glances back at his father, nervously. \"His oxygen is running out.\" Some 800 miles away in the capital New Delhi, several COVID-19 patients died on gurneys outside another hospital overnight Wednesday as relatives jostled them toward a crowded entrance. They couldn't get through the door in time. On the other side of the country in Gujarat, in western India, a man sobs over the body of his relative, a cancer patient who'd also tested positive for the coronavirus and died in the parking lot of yet another overcrowded hospital, unable to get care. Arguments erupted over who was to blame. Ghastly scenes are playing out at hospitals and clinics across India as the country's health system collapses under a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. On Thursday, India confirmed nearly 315,000 new infections over the preceding 24 hours \u2013 the highest single-day tally for any country on any day since the pandemic began. As the health system breaks down, there are fears that law and order may follow: Oxygen tankers are traveling under police guard to fend off looters. The black market trade in medical equipment has soared. Vaccines were stolen Thursday from a hospital warehouse in Haryana \u2013 but then the thief returned them hours later, with a note of apology. Police say the thief may have intended to steal anti-viral drugs, which are also in short supply. People are stockpiling oxygen tanks at home, figuring there's no use in even trying to get into a hospital anymore. Social media are full of desperate pleas from Indians seeking hospital beds, oxygen, anti-viral drugs, vaccines. One longtime journalist live-tweeted his declining oxygen levels until he died. \"I have never felt so desperate or helpless,\" Dr. Trupti Gilada said in a Facebook video she recorded of herself, weeping as she huddled in her car outside the Mumbai hospital where she works. \"We are seeing young people. We have a 35-year-old who's on a ventilator. Please pray for our patients.\" Why the sudden spike? On graphs, India's sudden spike in new infections shoots straight up like a wall, rather than a rising curve. The surge has bewildered Indians, coming just after their country's caseload plummeted to record lows in February. \"Popular belief in the country, from the public to policymakers, was that India will not have a second wave \u2013 and unfortunately that let the guard down,\" said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, an epidemiologist and public health expert who serves on a technical task force advising the Indian government on COVID-19. \"It's clear that the marked opening of society \u2013 with travel, local elections, religious gatherings, weddings \u2013 led to superspreader events. And the emergence of variants certainly added speed.\" Last month, India's Health Ministry announced it had detected 771 variants of the coronavirus in India, including ones first identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil as well as what's being called a new \"double mutant\" variant. (That name may be misleading, because all variants have multiple mutations, and this one has since been given a better name: B1617.) In that variant, Indian scientists said they're studying two mutations that may increase the infectiousness of the virus and also help it evade vaccines. Fears have escalated as Indian media carry reports of fully vaccinated people getting sick, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, 88, who was hospitalized with COVID-19 nearly three weeks after his second vaccine dose April 3. As of Tuesday, his condition was stable. But experts said those fears of vaccine inefficacy are not yet backed up by science. It's unclear how ill any of those fully vaccinated people have become, and which of the hundreds of variants circulating around India they caught. The Health Ministry said it has administered 132 million vaccine doses so far in a population of nearly 1.4 billion. That means fewer than 10% of people have received one dose, and fewer than 2% have gotten both. On Tuesday, the Indian government released data showing that only 0.03% or 0.04% of fully vaccinated people had tested positive for the coronavirus. India has been administering two vaccines that have shown high rates of efficacy in clinical trials: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one and another made by the Indian company Bharat Biotech. \"Even if this [B1617] strain is the worst case \u2014 and it would be really, really bad news for India \u2014 if other countries put in place now the kind of border measures we've seen work, we could potentially stop it going global,\" said Christina Pagel, a mathematician at University College London who's been tracking coronavirus variants. \"We need to act now out of precaution.\" This week, the U.K. restricted most travel from India. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also told Americans to avoid all travel to India, even if they've been fully vaccinated. Both governments cited India's variants. A grim world record India's daily tally announced Thursday exceeded the previous record of 313,310 cases set by the United States on Jan. 8, according to the CDC. But with testing kits also in short supply across India, that number may represent a fraction of the infections nationwide. Confirmed deaths from the coronavirus also broke an Indian record Thursday, with 2,104 fatalities recorded in the previous 24 hours. But deaths too may be drastically undercounted, because many of the people dying outside hospitals never got tested. Bodies are piling up in morgues. Crematoriums can't work fast enough.

In response, Modi's government announced it would open up vaccinations on May 1 to anyone over age 18. (Until now, only those over age 45, or front-line workers, have been eligible.) But earlier this month, hundreds of clinics across the country ran out of doses. People showed up for their appointments to find signs taped to hospital gates saying their vaccination clinics were closed for lack of supplies. It was a sudden turnaround for a country that has prided itself on being the world's biggest vaccine producer. India had been exporting COVID-19 vaccines. But amid shortages, the CEO of India's largest manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, tweeted a plea last week to President Biden, asking him to lift an export ban on raw materials. While Serum's vaccines are made in India, it imports sterile materials from the U.S. to do so. On Monday, India's government also approved a $610 million grant to help boost Serum's production. Nevertheless, opposition politicians said Modi has acted irresponsibly. In recent weeks, he presided over huge election rallies in West Bengal, one of five regions holding state elections throughout this month. On Thursday, Modi's close aide and home minister, Amit Shah, had at least three rallies scheduled, though attendance was belatedly capped at 500 people. Indian officials also refused to curb this month's Kumbh Mela, one of the largest gatherings of people in the world, where millions of Hindu faithful take a ritual dip in the Ganges River. Thousands of participants tested positive for the coronavirus in the aftermath of the event, and at least one religious leader died. Last weekend, Modi tweeted that the rest of Kumbh Mela should be held \"symbolically.\" In his address to the nation Tuesday, Modi ruled out another national lockdown, telling Indian states that local lockdowns should be implemented only as a last resort. \"Try as much as possible to protect yourselves from lockdown,\" Modi said. \"Focus on micro-containment zones.\" Police check commuters in Mumbai during a planned 15-day lockdown that began on April 14, closing all businesses, services, activities and public places except those deemed essential.\n                \n                    \n                    Bhushan Koyande/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Police check commuters in Mumbai during a planned 15-day lockdown that began on April 14, closing all businesses, services, activities and public places except those deemed essential. For example, apartment buildings where people test positive for the coronavirus have been sealed off, with no one allowed to enter or exit. Police patrol their perimeter. In India's two biggest cities, Mumbai and Delhi, local lockdowns are already in place. Only essential travel is allowed, with a permit. Everyone except for front-line workers have been told to work from home. Residents aren't allowed to go for a stroll or jog, or they'll be fined. In March 2020, when coronavirus cases were relatively low in India, Modi imposed the world's biggest national lockdown. Residents were given barely four hours' notice to stay in their homes. The economic cost was painful: India's economy shrank nearly 24%, and there were cases of migrant workers starving in the streets. This week, amid fresh restrictions in Delhi, one of the capital's main bus stations was once again packed with migrant workers, trying to escape the city for their home villages. There was little physical distancing. Migrant workers line up to enter a railway station in Mumbai on April 14 hoping to leave the city ahead of a lockdown.\n                \n                    \n                    Stringer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Back in southern India, after 24 hours of driving his father from hospital to hospital, Naharshetivar doesn't know how much longer he can do this.

            "article_content": "Sinead Boucher, the owner and CEO of New Zealand publisher Stuff, says the decision to quit Facebook has been beneficial for the company.\n                \n                    \n                    Marty Melville/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sinead Boucher, the owner and CEO of New Zealand publisher Stuff, says the decision to quit Facebook has been beneficial for the company. Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, Sinead Boucher offered $1 to buy Stuff, New Zealand's largest news publisher. Boucher was already the company's chief executive and was worried that its Australian media owner would shut down the publisher. Things had started to look really grim: The economy had ground to a halt and advertising revenue had evaporated. \"I knew that they ... would potentially just decide to wind us up,\" said Boucher. \"So it was just a punt.\" The punt worked. The Australian company accepted the offer of 1 New Zealand dollar, worth about 70 U.S. cents. Just like that, in May, Boucher found herself the owner of the most popular news website in New Zealand and about 50 local, regional and national newspapers and magazines. One of the first decisions she made as owner was to break up with Facebook. How Boucher reached that point illustrates just how complicated the relationship between Facebook and news publishers has become over the years. Stopped all posts on Facebook and Instagram Boucher had worked for years as a reporter and editor before moving into management. She saw the change of ownership as an opportunity to rethink Stuff's approach to covering the news in New Zealand and to focus the company on building trust with readers. \"People sometimes say to me, 'It must be so stressful now, owning the company,' \" she said. \"Actually, in a lot of ways, it's been liberating because there is a freedom in being able to make your own decisions, for better or worse.\" Stuff's decision to quit Facebook did not come out of the blue. In 2019, after a horrific mass shooting at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was livestreamed on Facebook, the company began to reconsider its relationship with the social network and stopped spending money to advertise there. Just over a year later, in July 2020, Stuff launched a new experiment: its website, newspapers and magazine stopped posting anything at all on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram. Boucher said the company was increasingly questioning whether being on the social network was \"compatible\" with its new focus on trust. \"We still felt uneasy with a lot of the decisions Facebook has made or a lot of the things they turned a blind eye to,\" she said, such as hate speech and misinformation. Overall traffic rose, even though social media traffic fell But this decision was also risky: Almost a quarter of Stuff's traffic came from social media \u2014 and mainly from Facebook. \"We were expecting that it would bring a significant drop in our traffic,\" Boucher said. Those fears never materialized. While Stuff's social media traffic did drop, overall traffic went up. Boucher attributes that in part to 2020 being such a busy news year, from the pandemic to global racial justice protests to big elections in New Zealand and, of course, the U.S. \"If we had remained on Facebook, we might have had another 5% growth,\" she said. \"But even if we throttled our growth ... it's brought us a lot of positives.\" Donations from readers went up, for example, once word of Stuff's decision leaked out. Boucher said the company's newsrooms felt the impact, too. \"We can definitely see a change in the way people react to us and talk to us\" she said. \"Hearing anecdotally from journalists, they feel like they've been able to get interviews they would not have got before. They feel that it has really has contributed to people trusting us more, thinking about us as an organization with a clear set of values.\" A one-month pause turns into a long-term breakup The Facebook pause was supposed to last a few weeks. It's now been more than eight months \u2014 and Boucher says she has no plans to return to Facebook. Breaking up with Facebook is not an easy decision for any publisher. Many news outlets feel they need to be on Facebook to reach people. A third of Americans say they regularly get their news on the social network, according to the Pew Research Center. At the same time, the news business is in real financial trouble because a big chunk of advertising dollars now go to Facebook, as well as Google. In fact, Facebook has become such a dominant force in how people get information that some governments are trying to force the social network to pay media outlets for news stories. Facebook recently protested a proposed Australian law by briefly cutting off all news from the continent. (The social network backed down after the government made some changes to the measure.) Facebook says the dynamics of its relationship with publishers are widely misunderstood \u2014 that, in fact, publishers need the social network more than it needs them. But Boucher says her experience suggests publishers should prioritize a different relationship: the direct one they have with their audience. Fears that Stuff would collapse were \"baseless\" Still, she isn't willing to say never. She describes the move as \"an ongoing experiment rather than a black and white permanent decision.\" That's because she worries about one big downside: If Stuff is not posting its stories on Facebook, does that leave a hole that will be filled by false or misleading information? \"We're really conscious that a lot of people still use the platform as a primary way to access news and information,\" she said. \"We wonder about the risk of withdrawing journalism from Facebook and what that leaves behind for people to be exposed to, particularly around things like COVID vaccine.\" Even so, Boucher says she is confident she made the right decision. And she says that while Stuff is one company, in one small country, it has a lesson for publishers of all sizes: There is life beyond Facebook. \"Taking that step and deciding to just give it a go taught us so much,\" she said. \"All our fears that without these platforms, we would just collapse \u2014 that was baseless.\" Editor's note: Facebook and Google are among NPR's financial supporters.",

John Lewis, D-Ga., in Atlanta in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Alyssa Pointer/The Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Pool/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic activists have embraced former President Barack Obama's description of the filibuster as a \"Jim Crow relic\" during remarks he made at the funeral for U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., in Atlanta in July. Democrats working to dismantle the filibuster as a major impediment to their legislative agenda say the procedural maneuver is a threat to civil rights. They are working to reframe the push to abolish the 60-vote procedural hurdle as a fight to protect those rights and follow through on promises Democrats made to voters \u2014 particularly Black voters \u2014 who helped deliver them the White House and control of the Senate. \"The question will be for Democrats who were powered into office on the strength of Black and brown voters what they will actually do to make sure racial justice can actually rule when it comes to policies,\" said Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights advocacy group Color of Change. \"2020 showed us what racial justice can do for an election,\" he said. \"And now, 2021 has to be the time in which those who are in power can show us what an election can do for racial justice.\" The coming battle over the filibuster illustrates the difficulty Democrats will have in persuading their entire conference to support the action in a Senate divided evenly with Republicans. It also highlights the messaging Democrats will use \u2014 and Republicans have pushed back against \u2014 to erode the procedure viewed by many Senate traditionalists as a way to protect the minority party. But Robinson said moves to restrict voting access in states such as Georgia have elevated the filibuster fight as Democrats try to pass federal voting protections. Senate Republicans are threatening to filibuster that legislation, requiring 60 votes for it to pass. Democrats and Republicans each control 50 votes in the Senate, and Vice President Harris can only step in to break a tie. That means that most legislation is subject to a filibuster by Republicans. For many Black Democrats, such as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the threat of that blockade recalls a history of senators using the filibuster to block anti-lynching legislation and keep Jim Crow laws on the books. \"Their efforts are designed to gain power for their party by suppressing political participation by minorities,\" Clyburn said. \"Today, Republicans are using the big lie about the 2020 elections as a pretext to advance a litany of minority voting suppression laws.\" It is a message that many Democrats have been primed to hear for months. Former President Barack Obama opened the door to ending filibuster in July when he advocated for federal voting rights legislation during his eulogy at the funeral of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., himself a legendary civil rights advocate. \"Let's honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for. And by the way, naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that is a fine tribute,\" Obama said, going on to list ways voting rights could be protected. \"And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster \u2014 another Jim Crow relic \u2014 in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do,\" he said. Obama's phrase, \"Jim Crow relic,\" has been adopted by activists and elected Democrats all the way up to President Biden. Democratic strategist Joel Payne said it is an effective way to reach people. \"Time will tell whether it is a more successful message,\" he said. \"But I can tell you it is a message that has more connectivity.\" Payne said the campaign against the filibuster is transforming from a technical argument into a tangible political demand to deliver things such as voting protections and pocket book issues such as a $15 minimum wage. \"We could do all these things for middle-class people,\" he said. \"If only we could do it with the 50-vote threshold, I think it makes it real for people as opposed to just saying, 'Hey, the Republicans are playing unfair.' \" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has insisted that the filibuster is neither racist nor unfair. He told reporters last week that the racial framing of the filibuster was about Democrats trying to push an election-law power grab. \"If it were related to civil rights, why were Democrats using the tool last year and the year before that and the last six years?\" McConnell asked. \"Why is it all of a sudden a civil rights issue when it wasn't for them as recently as last year?\" Loading... McConnell is correct that Democrats also used it to block legislation when they were in the minority and increased the use of the filibuster in the Trump era. But historians disagree with his framing. Kevin Kruse, a historian and professor at Princeton University, said it's true that the filibuster was not created to block civil rights bills. But that obscures the reality of how it was used, he said. \"It's not that the filibuster itself is inherently racist, but it has been the favorite tool of racists,\" he said. \"It certainly has a deep racial history.\" Kruse said both parties used the filibuster to block bills to protect the rights of Black Americans. He said people who say the filibuster forces compromise ignore that history. \"In the 1930s, the Democrats use the filibuster repeatedly to kill anti-lynching legislation,\" he said. \"The result of their effort, they were successful, was that that measure was dropped entirely.\" Kruse listed other examples, including efforts to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Loading... \"The result of that wasn't some compromise,\" he said. \"The bill wasn't watered down to meet their needs, instead in fact was strengthened. So this idea that the filibuster leads to compromise is simply ridiculous, and if you look at the racial history of it, you can see that entirely.\" The shift in framing of the filibuster may be energizing activists and some within the Democratic Party, but the question remains if it will move filibuster defenders such as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Democrats would need to vote unanimously to get rid of the procedural blockade. Robinson of Color of Change said the decision to keep the filibuster or dismantle it to pass progressive policies could make a significant difference in maintaining the coalition that elected Democrats in 2020. \"We'll be watching,\" he said. \"We'll be pushing, and we will be there in 2022 to fight, but the question will be, is what will Democrats give us to fight for?\"",

Republicans in the Georgia Senate have narrowly approved an omnibus voting bill that would end no-excuse absentee voting 16 years after Republicans first enacted it. The legislation, SB 241, would make a number of sweeping changes to Georgia's election code, most notably cracking down on who is eligible to vote by mail. Instead of allowing anyone to request an absentee ballot, the bill would limit it to people who are over 65, are physically disabled, are required to be outside their voting precinct during the three-week in-person early voting period and Election Day, have a religious holiday that falls on Election Day, work in elections or qualify as a military or overseas absentee voter. Despite the Senate passage Monday, some of the state's top Republicans have indicated they oppose curbing mail-in voting. One of those Republicans, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, is opposed to removing no-excuse absentee voting and some other measures proposed by fellow Republicans and opted not to preside over the debate. Three vulnerable Republican senators from swing districts \u2014 John Albers, Kay Kirkpatrick and Brian Strickland \u2014 were the only ones who did not co-sponsor the bill and opted to be excused from the vote. Republican Sen. Chuck Hufstetler was excused from the vote as well. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan sponsored the bill and misleadingly said his proposal would not limit mail-in voting options for Georgians \u2014 estimating that more than 2.7 million of 7.7 million registered Georgians would still be eligible to vote that way. \"This is not preventing anyone from voting by mail-in absentee,\" he said. \"All this is doing is laying the groundwork for relieving the stresses as we continue to see moving forward.\" Some Republicans, including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, say they support cutting back on vote by mail to help county elections officials who were overwhelmed in the 2020 cycle by record turnout, an unprecedented number of absentee ballots and in-person voting constraints because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Gov. Brian Kemp, Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and Duncan \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 have indicated they do not support curbing mail-in voting. Debate for the bill stretched nearly three and a half hours Monday, with Democrats blasting the GOP-backed measure as modern-day voter suppression after Democrats flipped the state's presidential contest and both of its U.S. Senate seats. Democratic Sen. Jen Jordan has emerged as one of the fiercest critics of Republican-backed voting changes, speaking out on the floor against the lack of transparency involved in the 32-page measure, including discrepancies in the bill that Republicans said would be fixed down the road. \"That's sloppy, y'all,\" she said. \"Especially when you're talking about a bill that's going to impact people's lives, that's going to impact the fundamental right to vote. ... Actually, it's pretty shameful.\" Sen. Sheikh Rahman, another Democrat, said Republicans should focus less on laws restricting voting and more on talking to voters about their policies. \"Why not try to reach out all the voters in Georgia, like people that look like me?\" he said. \"Georgia is changing. Georgia's already changed. ... If you reach out to folks like me, that looks like me, talks like me, you might be able to hold on to power.\" The House has passed its own 66-page omnibus bill that would add additional ID requirements for absentee ballots, strip some power from the secretary of state's office and standardize early voting hours, making most counties add additional days and hours but limit larger, more diverse and Democratic-leaning counties. Voting rights groups and Democrats point to election data that show weekend voting, Sundays in particular, is disproportionately used by Black voters \u2014 especially Black churches that hold \"souls to the polls\" events. A number of elections-related bills are still slated to be discussed in the Senate on Monday, including a proposal that would end Georgia's automatic voter registration provision, which is responsible for capturing more than two-thirds of Georgia's 7.7 million registered voters.",

Updated Monday at 1:18 a.m. ET Myanmar's military says it is taking control of the country in a coup against the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained along with other National League for Democracy leaders on Monday. The army said that power would be transferred to Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing, in a statement broadcast on military-owned television that also declared a one-year state of emergency, Reuters reported. Hours earlier, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters that State Counsellor Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other civilian leaders were \"taken\" in an early morning raid. \"I want to tell our people not to respond rashly and I want them to act according to the law,\" he told the wire service, saying that he also expected to be detained. \"The military seems to take control of the capital now,\" Myo Nyunt told CNN. Later, the party urged the people to oppose the \"coup\" and any return to \"military dictatorship.\" The military said it detained the democratically elected leaders in response to \"election fraud,\" Reuters reported. Soldiers were on the streets in the capital, Naypyitaw, and in the largest city, Yangon, and Internet and phone outages hit major cities, the BBC reports. Suu Kyi's NLD party won elections in November. Parliament had planned to convene on Monday with the NLD set to form a government, but the military-backed political party has rejected the results as unfair. The election commission has denied accusations of fraud, according to news reports. Since the election, tensions have increased, with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing mentioning the possibility of a coup last week, Voice of America reported. The talk led more than a dozen countries, including the U.S., to \"urge the military, and all other parties in the country, to adhere to democratic norms.\" On Sunday night, the White House said President Biden had been briefed on the detentions of the country's civilian leaders. \"The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed,\" read a statement from spokeswoman Jen Psaki. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \"strongly condemns\" the detentions, spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said in a statement, and \"expresses grave concern regarding the declaration of the transfer of all legislative, executive and judicial powers to the military.\" \"These developments represent a serious blow to democratic reforms in Myanmar,\" continued the statement. I strongly condemn the coup in Myanmar. The legitimate civilian government must be restored, in line with the country's constitution & the November elections.

The NLD's landslide election wins in November came as ethnic minorities were prevented from voting and amid voting safety concerns over the coronavirus. The country's military held full control from 1962 until 2011, when it relinquished absolute power and the country began opening up. The NLD first won elections in 2015. But the military still wields considerable influence in Myanmar politics. The military-drafted constitution guarantees it 25% of the seats in parliament, as well as control of three security ministries. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and once a pro-democracy activist, was held captive by the military in jails or under house arrest for nearly two decades. She remains a beloved figure in Myanmar but has received intense criticism from abroad in recent years over the country's persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority. In 2019, Suu Kyi defended Myanmar against genocide charges at the International Court of Justice, standing by the military's actions. Some 750,000 Rohingya fled the country's Rakhine state following the army's bloody crackdown in 2017.",

The two used to draw together growing up in New Hampshire, sometimes visiting museums to sketch, but both said they hadn't been keeping up with the hobby. \"It was hard to motivate myself to draw,\" Maggie said. \"And so getting on these FaceTime calls with Harry served not only the purpose of reconnecting with my brother, but also making me do this activity that I hadn't done in years and really actually found out that I missed.\" Harry Wolfson-Slepian poses with a pastel drawing they did on FaceTime with their sister Maggie.\n                \n                    \n                    Harry Wolfsen-Slepian\n                    \n                \nhide caption Harry Wolfson-Slepian poses with a pastel drawing they did on FaceTime with their sister Maggie.

While a number of Republican-led states have moved this year to restrict voting access, even more states have approved expansions of ballot access. New York is among the latter group. And Tuesday's election could pave the way for additional reforms. It's a notable transformation. Despite being one the bluest states in the nation, an academic study had ranked New York's voter access laws below states like West Virginia, Louisiana and Nebraska. But that began to change after the 2018 midterms, when Democrats took control in both houses of the state legislature in Albany and began a multi-year effort to expand voting access. Some of the reforms sought require amending the state constitution, a lengthy process that includes voters approving any change via a ballot referendum. New York's 2021 ballot includes five measures, two of which could directly affect how the state's voters participate in future elections: If approved, neither proposal would automatically result in the implementation of those policies. They would instead remove language in the state constitution that currently prevents no-excuse absentee voting and same-day registration. Brianna Cea, a Brooklyn-based political organizer, founded Generation Vote, an organizing network aimed at mobilizing younger voters. She said dropping a registration deadline would raise voting rates among students, immigrants and communities of color. In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Cea recalled that student organizers encouraging their peers to vote ran up against New York's current registration deadline of Oct. 8. That left many who were unaware of the deadline frustrated that they could not participate. But she also noted that expanding absentee mail voting could raise electoral participation among voters she has met from the more rural, conservative communities in Upstate New York. \"They said, 'I wish I could make it to the local board of elections, but that's like a 35-, 40-minute drive, and I don't have time to drop off my ballot,' \" Cea recalled from outreach work done in the Binghamton area. Democrats and voting advocacy groups like Common Cause and the League of Women Voters support passage of both measures. And although the amendments had limited Republican support in the state legislature, the party is now firmly lined up against them. At a recent event on Long Island, GOP state Chair Nick Langworthy launched the Just Say No campaign to mobilize opposition to the two proposals, which are located on the backside of ballots. \"You vote on the back of that ballot, flip that over and no, no, no, no,\" Langworthy urged, surrounded by local Republican officials. The campaign launch has been followed by a barrage of similar stops around the state. Without citing evidence, Langworthy called the ballot measures a \"red carpet for fraud\" and deployed a now-familiar GOP tactic for opposing expanded voting access: raising debunked questions about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. The appeal included the type of racially tinged, vague warning about the erosion of conservative voting power that has become common among the Republican base. \"They are trying to change New York,\" Langworthy said. \"They are trying to change our country by changing New York.\" Some in the GOP have raised more nuts and bolts concerns about the extra cost of administering same-day registration and expanded mail-in voting. Dustin Czarny, election commissioner in Onondaga County and chair of the Democratic Caucus of the New York State Election Commissioners Association, said he does not think that will be an issue. \"Participation in our elections is a good thing,\" Czarny said in an interview. \"And yes it will take more resources, but I will note that the New York state budget gave us funding to prepare for the eventual passage of this amendment.\" Czarny's Republican counterpart, Commissioner Erik Haight of Dutchess County, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. While conventional wisdom suggests that increased voter turnout benefits Democrats at the expense of Republicans, some political scholars are rethinking that notion. In fact, a new theory holds that opposition to expanded voting access could ultimately harm the GOP. \"Their argument is that the party that's favored by the short-term issues in a campaign are favored, rather than always the Democrats,\" explained Harvey Schantz, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. The idea echoes former President Donald Trump's strategy of expanding his base, rather than appealing to persuadable independent voters. Although Trump was ultimately unsuccessful in the 2020 election, record voter turnout produced Republican gains in the U.S. House and state legislatures across the country. Schantz notes that when it comes to increasing turnout, same-day registration has the greatest impact of so-called convenience reforms to the voting process, which also include early voting and access to voting by mail. Who benefits from higher turnout ultimately depends on which voters are mobilized in the final weeks before an election. As Schantz notes, if the demographic is white voters without a college degree, Republicans could be the party that gets a boost. Before the New York GOP's recent push to defeat the ballot proposals, they had been paid minimal attention. The state Democratic Party has been largely quiet on the measures, and didn't respond to a request for comment. Democrats have a so-called trifecta in the state capital of Albany, controlling the governorship and both houses of the legislature, currently with super-majorities in both chambers. If voters approve amendments to the state constitution, it would free that majority to expand voting access ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.",

Many Latino voters in South Texas turned against Democrats during last year's presidential election \u2014 and winning them back could prove critical to the party's hopes of retaining control of Congress during next year's midterms. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a new, multimillion-dollar effort to engage and mobilize voters of color ahead of the midterm elections, including investments in local organizing and a seven-figure research and polling effort. The plan, the details of which were shared first with NPR, includes an initial $30 million investment to hire local community organizers, launch targeted advertising campaigns aimed at nonwhite communities, as well as building voter protection and education programs. The committee is also working to combat disinformation efforts that are specifically focused on voters of color. The announcement comes as Democrats are preparing to defend their slim congressional majorities in 2022, and as many in the party are still assessing their unexpected losses in significant elections this month. It is an early signal of how national Democrats plan to work to ensure that the racially diverse coalition that elected President Biden and delivered victories in key states across the country that gave Democrats a bare Senate majority shows up again. \"What we have learned from studying the 2020 election is when we invest in communities of color, it pays real dividends,\" New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview. The announcement is also an indication that party leaders are aware that the broad, racially diverse coalition of voters that elected Democrats must be engaged consistently, and must not be treated as monolithic groups. While Democrats won the White House last year, they lost ground among nonwhite voters without a college education. Biden's campaign faced criticism over mixed results among varied segments of the Latino electorate, missteps that were blamed for setbacks in critical states like Florida and Texas, where a number of key House races will be decided in 2022. Democrats are also facing aggressive redistricting by Republicans in some states, as well as souring approval ratings for the president and the Democratic Party. Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams, a freshman who is leading the committee's efforts around voting rights and voter education, said that \"we can't just show up in a community and expect people to listen to us and turn out overnight.\" Williams, who is also the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, said that recent Democratic victories in her state were the result of years of aggressive \u2014 and consistent \u2014 work. \"And I had a novel idea, what if we did year-round organizing and continued to bring information to the voters and continued to let voters know how Democrats were delivering for them? That's what we did in Georgia, that's how we won in Georgia, and that's what we're doing with the DCCC,\" Williams said. Maloney said that as part of the Building our Base Project, he wants \"boots on the ground much earlier, not just showing up at election time, and putting the resources behind it with a culturally competent, diverse team that knows what it's doing.\" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee itself was the subject of complaints over diversity in its leadership, prior to Maloney's tenure as chairman. The committee says its staff is currently comprised of nearly 50% people of color, and the senior leadership team is 71% people of color. The DCCC also elevated Tasha Cole, the deputy executive director for diversity, equity and inclusion, as a member of the senior leadership team and added Missayr Boker to lead the committee's independent expenditure. Boker is the first Black person and person of color to hold that role. The committee also plans to target Republican efforts to spread misinformation, as well as to cast all Democratic candidates as far-left. The committee says it will have a particular focus on social media platforms frequently used in communities of color. Voters of color were flooded with disinformation in the days leading up to the November 2020 election, and some Democrats say the party didn't do enough to combat it. \"It's not enough to just wave it away and pretend it doesn't matter. We need to take these lies and distortions seriously,\" Maloney said. \"We need to have a robust effort to counter that disinformation, and we need to do research so we understand exactly how to do that without turning off our most reliable voters.\" The Democratic National Campaign Committee is also launching its own voter protection team and increasing its efforts to educate voters. Federal voting rights legislation remains stalled in the Senate, despite repeated attempts by Democrats to pass bills in response to a wave of state-level laws championed by Republicans that restrict ballot access. Democrats and voting rights advocates say those laws have a disproportionate impact on people of color. \"We're making sure that we are doubling down on making sure that people know how to navigate all of these new rules and new laws, and making sure that any roadblocks to the ballot box are 'un-hurdled' by the DCCC,\" Williams said. \"We should not have to out-organize our way out of voter suppression, but we're not giving up.\" House Republicans have been taking cues from Democrats in many ways when it comes to candidate recruitment in recent years as they focus on a more diverse slate of recruits. The National Republican Congressional Committee says this year that nearly 90% of its 70 target districts have a female, veteran or minority candidate already filed to run. It's a strategy the GOP used in 2020 when it was able to significantly narrow Democrats' majority in the House, even as Republicans lost control of the Senate and White House. Asked about Republican recruiting efforts, Maloney said the House Republican Caucus \"is not a diverse group of people that represents the full mosaic of the United States.\" \"What I can tell you is that we will field a truly diverse group of candidates. And I should point out, that some of our candidates who are running in the toughest districts are people of color, and we know that they have done an extraordinary job of telling their story and bringing voters to their cause.\" Maloney ticked off the names of a number of Democratic incumbents of color: Reps. Lucy McBath of Georgia, Antonio Delgado of New York, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut and Lauren Underwood of Illinois. \"They have all done an extraordinary job of winning tough districts that are not diverse. And so we believe, absolutely in our hearts, that our diverse candidates are our true strength, not just in districts that are diverse, but in some of the most competitive districts of the country,\" he added.",

SRINAGAR, India (AP) \u2014 Jamia Masjid, the grand mosque of Srinagar, dominates its neighborhood with an imposing main gate and massive turrets. It can hold 33,000 worshippers, and on special occasions over the years hundreds of thousands of Muslims have filled nearby lanes and roads to offer prayers led from the mosque. But Indian authorities see the mosque as a trouble spot \u2014 a nerve center for protests and clashes that challenge India's sovereignty over the disputed Kashmir region. For Kashmiri Muslims it is a sacred venue for Friday prayers and a place they can raise their voices for political rights. In this bitter dispute, the mosque in Kashmir's main city has largely remained closed for the past two years. The mosque's chief priest has been detained in his home almost nonstop throughout that time, and the mosque's main gate is padlocked and blocked with corrugated tin sheets on Fridays. The closure of the mosque, which is revered by Kashmir's mostly Muslim population, has deepened their anger. \"There is a constant feeling that something is missing in my life,\" said Bashir Ahmed, 65, a retired government employee who has offered prayers at the mosque over five decades. Indian authorities refused to comment on the mosque restrictions despite repeated queries from The Associated Press. In the past, officials have said the government was forced to close the mosque because its management committee was unable to stop anti-India protests on the premises. The shutting of the 600-year-old mosque came amid a clampdown that began in 2019 after the government stripped Kashmir of its long-held semiautonomous status. In the past two years, some of the region's other mosques and shrines \u2014 also closed for months due to the security crackdown and the subsequent pandemic \u2014 have been allowed to offer religious services. Jamia Masjid has remained out of bounds to worshippers for prayers on Friday \u2013 the main day of congregational worship in Islam. Authorities allow the mosque to remain open the other six days, but only a few hundred worshippers assemble there on those occasions, compared to the tens of thousands that often gathered on Fridays. \"This is the central mosque where our ancestors, scholars and spiritual masters have prayed and meditated for centuries,\" said Altaf Ahmad Bhat, one of the officials at the grand mosque. He dismissed the law-and-order reasons cited by the authorities as \"absurd,\" adding that discussions about social, economic and political issues affecting Muslims were a core religious function of any grand mosque. The grand mosque is mainly reserved for mandatory Friday congregational prayers and special services. Obligatory daily prayers are usually held in smaller neighborhood mosques. For the region's Muslims, the mosque's closure brings painful memories of the past. In 1819, Sikh rulers closed it for 21 years. Over the past 15 years, it has been subject to periodic bans and lockdowns by successive Indian governments. But the current restrictions are the most severe since the region was divided between India and Pakistan after the two nations gained independence from British colonialism in 1947. Both claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety. The Indian government initially grappled with largely peaceful public protests seeking a united Kashmir, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent entity. But a crackdown on dissent led to Kashmir's eruption into an armed rebellion against India in 1989. India has depicted the insurgency as Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, a charge Pakistan has denied. Indian forces largely crushed the rebellion about 10 years ago, though popular demands for \"Azadi,\" or freedom, remained ingrained in the Kashmiri psyche. The region made a transition from the armed struggle to unarmed uprisings, with tens of thousands of civilians repeatedly taking to the streets to protest Indian rule, often leading to deadly clashes between stone-throwing residents and Indian troops. The grand mosque and its surrounding areas in Srinagar's heart emerged as central to these protests. Sermons at the Jamia Masjid would often address the long-simmering conflict, with Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the chief priest and one of the region's top separatist leaders, giving fiery speeches highlighting Kashmir's political struggle. Authorities often clamped down, banning prayers at the mosque for extended periods. According to official data, the mosque was closed for at least 250 days in 2008, 2010 and 2016 combined. The armed conflict again intensified after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 and won a landslide re-election in 2019. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led government toughened its stance both against Pakistan and Kashmiri separatists amid rising attacks by Hindu hard-liners against minorities in India, further deepening frustrations among Kashmir's Muslims. Soon a new wave of rebels revived Kashmir's militancy and challenged India's rule with guns and effective use of social media. India responded with sometimes deadly counterinsurgency operations. Freedom of religion is enshrined in India's constitution, allowing citizens to follow and freely practice religion. The constitution also says the state will not \"discriminate, patronize or meddle in the profession of any religion.\" But even before the current security operation in Kashmir, experts say conditions for India's Muslims under Modi have worsened. In Kashmir, the clampdown on the most revered mosque has aggravated these fears. \"Jamia Masjid represents the soul of Kashmiri Muslims' faith and has remained at the center of demands for social and political rights since its foundation some six centuries back,\" said Zareef Ahmed Zareef, a poet and an oral historian. \"Its closure is an attack on our faith.\" On special occasions like the last Friday in the fasting month of Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of faithful pray in the mosque, filling its neighborhood's winding lanes and roads. For the last two years, such scenes have remained missing. Muslims say the gag is undermining their constitutional right to religious freedom. Ahmed, the worshipper, on a recent Saturday afternoon sat inside the mosque, a wood and brick architectural marvel with 378 wooden pillars. He said he has never seen the mosque shut and desolate for such an extended period. \"I feel deprived and violated,\" Ahmed said as he raised his hands in supplication. \"We have been subjected to extreme spiritual suffering.\" Many Kashmiri Muslims have long said New Delhi curbs their religious freedom on the pretext of law and order while promoting and patronizing the annual Hindu pilgrimage to an icy Himalayan cave visited by hundreds of thousands of Hindus from across India. The Amarnath pilgrimage lasts for nearly two months, although it was canceled for the last two years due to the pandemic. On a recent Friday, as the mosque remained closed, its sprawling marketplace, an otherwise vibrant and bustling neighborhood, wore a deserted look. Babull, a mentally challenged man in his 40s who inhabits the place in and around the grand mosque, whirled around the neighborhood. He cautioned shopkeepers of imminent danger from police raiding the place, as they have done in the past. Nearby, a gaggle of Indian tourists went about clicking selfies in the backdrop of the mosque's barricaded and locked main gate. Kashmiri onlookers watched them in silence.",

For the first time in its history, Boston is inaugurating a newly-elected mayor on Tuesday who is not a white man. Michelle Wu \u2013 who's Asian American \u2014 is the first woman and first person of color elected to lead the city. While many are hailing it as a major turning point, others see it as more of a disappointment that the three Black candidates in the race couldn't even come close. Many in Boston were hopeful that this would be the year, in this time of racial reckoning, that Boston might elect its first Black mayor, as most of the nation's 30 largest cities have already done. Three Black candidates were in the race, and one even had the advantage of running as an incumbent, after automatically inheriting the job \u2013 as an interim \u2014 when Mayor Marty Walsh left to become secretary of labor in the Biden administration. And yet, neither Acting Mayor Kim Janey, nor the others, even made it to the final runoff election this month. \"I got home, and I cried,\" says Danny Rivera, an artist and civil rights activist in Boston. \"I cried my eyes out because I don't know the next time we'll see a Black mayor in our city.\" At Janey's farewell address in Boston last week, Rivera says he was especially disappointed because of how poignant and relatable he found Janey's personal history in Boston. As a girl, in the 1970s, she was among those bused into white neighborhood schools where Blacks were pelted with insults and rocks. Later, as a teenage mom, she struggled to make it when she was all but written off. \"I believe that it is lived experience that matters most, and what separated [Janey] from every other candidate,\" he says. \"That's all super powerful, and I thought we missed the moment.\" Twenty-year-old Nia Ashleigh, a student at the Berklee School of Music, also felt let down that none of the Black candidates had enough support to be ultimately viable, but she says, she was not surprised. \"It's just one of those things where it feels like what else is new?\" she quipped. Indeed, in the preliminary election, the three Black candidates combined got about three-quarters of the vote in areas of the city with the highest concentrations of people of color. But in the whitest areas, they won only about one quarter of the votes, according to an analysis of election results and Census data conducted by The MassINC Polling Group. \"I mean the data speaks for itself, and it's troubling,\" says former Massachusetts State Rep. Marie St. Fleur. Especially, she says, for a city still straining under a longtime reputation as racist. \"For those of us born or raised in Boston, and who lived through some of the darker days, the fact that we blinked at this moment is sadness,\" she says. \"At what point in the city of Boston will we be able to vote \u2014 and I'm going to be very clear here \u2014 for a Black person in that corner office?\" To be sure, there were other factors, and fault, at play in the way the race turned out. \"We can only play race card for so many occasions,\" asserts the Rev. Eugene Rivers, a longtime Black community leader. \"I mean Black leadership failed to produce success even with an incumbent. We failed. Now that's not on white people.\" Black leaders are already talking about taking lessons from incoming Mayor Wu's successful campaign to improve their own political organizing and messaging and to increase Black turnout in future races. Some are also calling for a more coordinated strategy to coalesce behind a single Black candidate, to avoid splitting the vote as happened this year. But others bristle at the idea of expecting any Black candidate to drop out of a race because there are too many of them. Imari Paris Jeffries, executive director of King Boston, the group building a memorial on Boston Common to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Paris Jeffries says he also feels \"grief\" that a Black candidate didn't make the cut this year. But while important symbolically and psychically, he says, a candidate's race should not be the determinant in any race. \"In this anti-racist discourse, I don't think we're going to find identical twins of our experience in order for [candidates] to empathize,\" he says. \"I think we have to start creating a larger tent and find common ground together.\" It's a theme incoming Wu has struck throughout her campaign, and again, when she was asked about it as she attended Janey's farewell address.

Wu defeated fellow city councilor Annissa Essaibi George to become the first woman of color elected as mayor of Boston. \"I have heard and want to continue acknowledging the disappointment of many in our community who wish to see representatives of the Black community,\" she said. \"We will continue working to meet this moment to take on systemic racism and the barriers that have been perpetuated for far too long.\" Boston voters, like Pam Cannon of Roxbury, will be watching. \"I'm going to hold her to it,\" Cannon says. \"I'll make sure she comes to my neighborhood. I'll be calling her up. I'm going to be checking in with her.\" So will Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., who endorsed Wu in the final election, after all three of the Black candidates had been eliminated. \"I don't give anyone anything,\" Pressley said, as she also attended Janey's farewell address. \"[Wu] earned my endorsement, but she earned it because she is prepared to be honest about the disparate outcomes across every issue, and I expect that the Black community, will hold her accountable. Because this is about changing the legacy of the city of Boston.\" Former Boston City Council member and Janey supporter, Tito Jackson, agrees. He, too, made a bid to become Boston's first elected Black mayor four years ago, and also fell short. But he says Janey's short, but historic tenure has helped move the conversation forward. \"We're not going to put our head down and we're not going to walk around like we lost,\" Jackson says. \"[Janey] advanced the issues that I brought up four years ago, that no one wanted to touch\" before the death of George Floyd put new focus on racial equity and justice in America. \"But those issues were in the forefront this go-around.\" For her part, outgoing Acting Mayor Janey struck a similar message, insisting her time in the corner office did push Boston forward and left the city better off than it had been, largely because she approached every issue \u2014from housing to schools and health care \u2014 \"through a lens of racial equity.\" Still, she adds, \"There's a lot more work to do, when it comes to all our '-isms,\" in Boston and across the country.",

Great-granddaughters of Halsey attended the service, where the Rev. William Barber II eulogized Halsey. On Nov. 10, 1898, a mob descended on the offices of The Daily Record, a Black-owned newspaper in Wilmington, N.C. The armed men then moved into the streets and opened fire as Black men fled for their lives. Finally, the rabble seized control of the racially mixed city government. It expelled Black aldermen, installed unelected whites belonging to the then-segregationist Democratic Party and published a \"White Declaration of Independence.\" Historians have called it a coup d'etat. The number of people who died ranges from about 60 to as many as 250, according to some estimates. The Daily Record, Oct. 20, 1898\n                \n\n                    North Carolina Newspapers/North Carolina Digital Heritage Center\n                    \n\nhide caption The Daily Record, Oct. 20, 1898 It's a past that had been largely forgotten or ignored by Wilmington's white population \u2014 and discussed only in hushed tones among the town's Blacks. In recent years, however, the city has embarked on a reckoning of sorts. This week, Wilmington is marking 123 years since the massacre. In one event over the weekend, a procession and funeral were held at Wilmington's Pine Forest Cemetery to honor Joshua Halsey and Samuel McFarland, two of the few identified victims of the 1898 violence. Halsey's unmarked plot finally received a headstone. In 2019, John Sullivan and his research partner, Joel Finsel, of the nonprofit Third Person Project, located the only known physical copies of the The Daily Record, which ceased publication after 1898. Then they set about searching for some of the victims of the massacre, finding Halsey's gravesite last year and McFarland's this year. \"You had a lot of bodies pushed into the river,\" Sullivan tells NPR. \"You had bodies buried privately in backyards, sometimes days after the killings, because families were afraid to come forward and be associated with the victims.\" He says others who hid in the swamps surrounding the city likely died of exposure or were lynched by the mob. The remains of the vast majority are unlikely to ever be found, according to Sullivan. \"Wilmington was the largest city in the state at that time,\" explains Kenneth Janken, a professor of African, African American, and diaspora studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"The majority of elected officials in the city government were African American.\" Janken says that a white supremacist conspiracy to take over Wilmington was in the works for some months. It appeared to gain steam in the summer, when the owner of the The Daily Record, Alex Manly, wrote a rebuttal to a speech delivered by prominent Georgia writer, lecturer and white supremacist Rebecca Felton. She called for lynching African American men to \"protect\" white women. \"I say lynch a thousand times a week if necessary,\" Felton proclaimed. Manly's editorial, which accused whites of some of the same crimes they accused Blacks of, was picked up by white newspapers and circulated widely, Janken says. It proved incendiary. \"I'm not sure how much attention it got immediately, but it did catch somebody's attention,\" he says.

By the time of the election in early November, white supremacists had organized into \"red shirt\" squads that intimidated Black voters, leading to low voter turnout and ensuring a Democratic victory. Even so, because many aldermen were not up for reelection, the city remained in the hands of a governing coalition between Republicans and Populists. That is until Nov. 10. Prior to the violence, the city's population was just over half African American, with many of them prosperous business owners. But between those Blacks killed and the ones either driven out or forced to flee, the racial makeup of the city was forever altered. Elaine Cynthia Brown, who grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and now lives in California, is a great-granddaughter of Halsey. Sometime after the violence, his widow, Sallie, left Wilmington and never returned. Brown says her family is spread across the U.S. as a direct result of what happened. \"It changed our lives forever.\" For Sullivan and Finsel, finding the remains was no easy task. On the centenary of the massacre, the city convened a commission to examine the history of the event. It produced a report in 2006 that mentioned two graves of victims  believed to be in private plots at Pine Forest, but said they could not be found. \"The cemetery record-keeping was chaotic,\" Sullivan says. Over the years, things were moved, he says, \"and there's a swamp right by the cemetery that floods occasionally, so things get wiped away.\" The cemetery's handwritten registry was a major obstacle. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Finsel was allowed only short visits to the library. \"He went back like 50 times, but he finally got the whole 900-page registry digitized, and then we started going to work transcribing it,\" says Sullivan. Finsel likens the state of the archive to the Dead Sea Scrolls. \"They were in tatters,\" he says. The maps of the cemetery were like \"fun house mirrors,\" Sullivan says. \"There were five different systems used over the 170 years ... to locate information like how to categorize locations of graves.\" Then Sullivan and Finsel got a key clue that helped them to triangulate Halsey's plot. The Pine Forest groundskeeper was able to locate the grave of Halsey's brother, who remained in Wilmington and died 23 years after the 1898 massacre. Joshua Halsey was buried nearby. Members of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina honor Joshua Halsey at his gravesite at the Pine Forest Cemetery in Wilmington, N.C., on Nov. 6. The ceremony was also attended by community members who remembered Halsey, who was killed in an attack by a white supremacist mob in 1898.\n                \n                    \n                    Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina honor Joshua Halsey at his gravesite at the Pine Forest Cemetery in Wilmington, N.C., on Nov. 6. The ceremony was also attended by community members who remembered Halsey, who was killed in an attack by a white supremacist mob in 1898. \"We knew that they had been looking,\" Brown says. \"Then John [Sullivan] called us and invited us to a Zoom meeting.\" \"We were just like, 'Oh my God,' \" she says. \"We all knew, as far as the family goes, what it meant.\" Sullivan says he is just happy to make a contribution and document history in some small way. He thinks there could be others found buried at small cemeteries elsewhere in the city. For many of the victims, however, even if remains are found, \"you'd have to get lucky with DNA.\" As for McFarland, work is still underway to examine his headstone, which has deteriorated with age, according to Sullivan. \"I feel like our attempt to honor those killed is always going to have this cloud of scores of unknown dead hanging over it,\" he says. \"The trick is to remember them whenever we're commemorating individual aspects of the massacre.\"",

Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia's closely watched governor's race. It touches most every household in the United States, whether as taxpayers or as parents, but come Election Day, education rarely makes it to the top of voter priorities. That wasn't the case this week. Republican Glenn Youngkin made schools, and particularly parental control, his closing issue in his upset win over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. Between September and October polls, education rose 9 points to be the top issue for voters going into the race, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Parents who wanted more voice in schools broke for Youngkin by a large margin in exit polls. In New Jersey, Republican gubernatorial challenger Jack Ciattarelli similarly took up criticisms about the teaching of race in schools, and about vaccine and mask mandates. He came closer than many expected to beating Democrat Phil Murphy. And across the country, 215 school board members faced recall elections \u2014 quadruple the number in an average year, according to the website Ballotpedia, which also noted a drop in uncontested seats. Ballotpedia separately tracked elections for 300 school board seats where candidates made an issue of race, COVID restrictions and/or sex and gender. The 1776 PAC, a newly founded national political action committee, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for anti-\"woke\" school board candidates. They claimed, as of Wednesday morning, to be winning or in the lead in 44 out of 58 races they supported. However, Ballotpedia says its numbers, which are incomplete, show that so far, incumbents are winning 6 out of 10 races. The usual figure is more like 8 in 10. Incumbents \"are not getting the floor wiped,\" says Douglas Kronaizl, a staff writer at Ballotpedia. But, he says, the high number of candidates and recall efforts is in itself \"a manifestation of the energy that is around these issues. ... We definitely have seen, more often than in previous years, these kind of more national issues being discussed on a local level.\" But what was the outcome of that discussion? In their small sample of races that were \"nationalized,\"  candidates who were in favor of mainstream medical guidance and in favor of teaching kids about racial injustice won two to one against the 1776 PAC candidates, and others who trumpeted anti-mask positions. One reading of this week's results is that Republicans successfully played on the anxieties of conservative white voters who think attempts by schools to address structural racism have gone too far. For months, angry parents have been showing up to school board meetings \u2014 yelling, picketing, sometimes even throwing punches and hurling threats. Things have gotten so heated that the U.S. attorney general pledged to get federal law enforcement involved. Established conservative groups like the Manhattan Institute are providing aid and support to this movement, in ways such as issuing guides to opposing \"woke schooling.\" There are also newly emerged networks, like Parents Defending Education and Moms for Liberty, and hundreds of local groups on Facebook and elsewhere. Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of Moms for Liberty and a former school board member in Florida, said she is \"ecstatic\" over Tuesday night's results. She says they demonstrate clearly that parents want to get \"back to basics,\" and away from overtly anti-racist education. \"I call it alphabet soup laced with snake oil. It's CRT, DEI, SEL, this word salad of acronyms that are being shoved into every crack and crevice of American education.\" CRT means Critical Race Theory, an academic theory of structural racism that is taught largely at the undergraduate level. DEI is diversity, equity and inclusion. And SEL is \"social-emotional learning,\" a largely unrelated set of concepts that has lately been lassoed into the ire over \"woke\" education. In Virginia, Youngkin released an ad in the final days of the race featuring a mom complaining about her son being assigned the novel Beloved, by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison. The stated reason was the novel's scenes of sexual assault, but this is a masterwork dealing extensively with enslavement and the Black experience. White women in Virginia swung 15 points toward the GOP, more than any other subgroup of voters, going 57% for Youngkin and 43% for McAuliffe according to exit polls. Keri Rodrigues is the president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for parent voice founded in early 2020. In that capacity she travels to local school board meetings, talks to parents, and regularly polls them. She agrees that angry parents swung this election. She disagrees on what they're really angry about. She says groups like Moms for Liberty, and the people yelling at school board meetings, don't represent the average parent. \"According to our polling, 74% of American families actually support having culturally relevant and factually correct information provided during the U.S. history curriculum,\" she says. Instead, the parents she talks to are upset that their children are still struggling, socially and emotionally as well as academically. She likens extended remote schooling to a form of \"solitary confinement.\" Fights are breaking out at school. Bus driver shortages have parents summoned to pick their kids up unpredictably. There are substitutes covering classes. Justice, of Moms for Liberty, agrees that school closures are probably parents' top issue. \"I think definitely COVID restrictions,\" were top of mind, she says. \"There were schools in Virginia that never opened or were only opened partially. Parents have watched their children stagnate.\" School closures lasted longer in the United States than in most high-income countries, and much longer in blue jurisdictions than in red ones. Virginia had the seventh-fewest days of in-person learning last year among the 50 states, according to the website Burbio. New Jersey was 10th. NPR's recent polling with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that 69% of parents were concerned that their children had missed learning during remote schooling, and the available evidence suggests that those concerns are justified. Rodrigues is an executive committee member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. She points out that in New Jersey, where the Republican candidate far outperformed expectations, anti-woke school board activists haven't been much of a factor. Nor are parents for the most part opposed to masks or vaccines. They're just fed up. \"Folks like me have been saying for the past 18 months, you are underestimating the level of anxiety, fear and, frankly, the erosion of the relationship that schools have come to rely on when it comes to parents and families right now,\" she says. Schools have lots of federal funding available for coronavirus recovery, most of which they haven't yet spent. Rodrigues and Justice agree that schools need to get a lot more responsive to parents' and children's needs. But how, exactly, to do that? Virginia Gov.-elect Youngkin's actual education agenda won't raise many eyebrows. Besides banning critical race theory \u2014 not too hard, as it's not actually taught in schools \u2014 he has pledged to open 20 charter schools and put a police officer on every campus. He's also backed paying teachers more. A major question going forward is whether the Democratic Party breaks further with teacher unions, one of their most reliable constituencies, who are also perceived, fairly or unfairly, as the main factor that kept schools operating remotely in blue states. McAuliffe was mocked in right-wing media for inviting Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, to share the stage at the closing of his campaign. Rodrigues' group has backers that include the Walton Family Foundation (a supporter of NPR) and the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, who push for more union-free charter schools. Not surprisingly, then, she says it's time for the Democratic Party to forge its own path on education. \"What I see Democrats do is completely outsource any thinking around education to the teachers unions. And that's not what this moment calls for.\" In practice that could mean a return to something like the bipartisan education reform consensus of the Obama years, which emphasized accountability and choice.

That frustration has driven a slate of parents to contest this fall's school board elections in Centerville, where polarizing national issues have transformed what's typically a sleepy race. It's something that's happening across the country. School boards have become the latest political battlefield, with fights over masks and COVID-19 vaccines, and with conservative parents concerned about diversity curriculum. These races are being watched by Republicans, who lost a lot of ground in the suburbs over the past eight years, and are hoping education could be a winning issue for them in congressional races in 2022 and the next presidential race as well. In Centerville, at that school board meeting in April \u2014 a meeting that was quickly adjourned after it devolved into a shouting match \u2014 the crowd cheered as Lysa Kosins spoke about her health concerns about wearing masks. Kosins said she had pulled her two children out of the school district because she didn't want them to have to wear masks. \"They complain to me every day about how they don't want to wear it,\" Kosins said. \"They don't want to go to school.\" Heather Schultz, another parent, spoke next, ending her remarks with a warning. \"If you continue to ignore the families speaking out against this and other related topics,\" she said, \"the people who elected you will replace you with people who support our ideals and goals, because we are no longer asleep at the wheel.\" Kosins and Schultz are now running for the board. A third candidate, Dawn McGuire, is also part of their slate, running under the slogan \"Parents' voices matter,\" which aims to replace three current board members and effectively take control of the five-member panel. Their campaign signs say \"Conservatives for Board of Education,\" though in Centerville, the school board is a nonpartisan election. Lysa Kosins, one of the candidates challenging the incumbents for the Centerville school board, meets with voters at a local ice cream shop.\n                \n                    \n                    Mawa Iqbal/WYSO\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lysa Kosins, one of the candidates challenging the incumbents for the Centerville school board, meets with voters at a local ice cream shop. Centerville is the kind of suburb people move to for its high-quality schools. It went Republican in the last two presidential elections, but by smaller margins in 2020 than 2016, part of a pattern nationwide that saw voters in the suburbs stray from Trump. David Roer has served on the board for 28 years and is now fighting to keep his post. A pediatrician, he stands by the board's mask requirements. \"The goal was to keep these kids in school,\" he said. \"But the only way we saw keeping these kids in the classroom five days a week was to use the masks.\" He said he's been harassed on Facebook. And one night, Roer said someone even came to his house. \"On a Saturday night in the dark,\" he recalled. \"Starts ringing the doorbell, starts yelling and screaming at us. 'You're what's making America bad.' I had to call the police.\" A colleague on the board, Megan Murray Sparks, who has five children and coaches just about every sport you can imagine, said she's afraid of how intense it has become. At a meeting in late August, there was more outrage about masks. \"Every entrance we had security,\" she said. \"They had a safe room that they were going to put us in that they had planned out if anything was to happen. I was so scared before the meeting I was physically ill in the bathroom, texting my priest.\" The incumbents are pitching themselves as \"qualified, experienced and reasonable\" on their campaign website. Dr. David Roer and Megan Murray Sparks, incumbent members of the Centerville school board. They have been alarmed by anger and threats.\n                \n                    \n                    Tamara Keith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. David Roer and Megan Murray Sparks, incumbent members of the Centerville school board. They have been alarmed by anger and threats. The school board challengers said they don't condone violence or threats and are shocked at how heated the race has become. Take the case of Javier Mata, who owns a Mexican restaurant on Main Street with his parents. The challengers asked him if they could put up a campaign sign on the lawn in front of the restaurant. \"Because we've always done this in the past and never had any issues, we were like, 'Sure, why not?' \" said Mata. He didn't see it as an endorsement and offered to let the incumbents put up their sign too. But then he said he started getting emails and calls with people saying they wouldn't come to his restaurant anymore if he kept the sign up. \"Something so small, became so big,\" he said. He thought about taking the sign down, but then got mad about the whole thing and let the challengers put up a larger sign. Mata doesn't live in the district and can't vote in the school board race, but it's added a lot of drama to his life anyway. Javier Mata was surprised when a school board campaign sign prompted complaints from some customers, who threatened to boycott.\n                \n                    \n                    Tamara Keith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Javier Mata was surprised when a school board campaign sign prompted complaints from some customers, who threatened to boycott. This isn't the norm for school board races in Centerville, which fall during off years, when candidates for president and Congress aren't on the ballot. They typically fly under the radar, with low voter turnout and little controversy. In fact, an NPR review of Ohio voting records finds the challengers did not vote the last school board election in 2019. They volunteered in their children's classrooms and sports teams, but they say the pandemic and frustration with school closures is what got them engaged in the work of the school board. Schultz said they felt like they had to run because the current board wasn't listening. \"We absolutely respect a parent's right to put a mask on their child, or not,\" she said. \"If you want to send your kid in a mask or have them get any vaccine of any kind, that is your decision. And as a board member we will not make that decision for you. We will respect yours.\" The slate of challengers also opposes diversity education, writing on their campaign website that they will not allow any curriculum taught in the schools that \"pretend to be about 'diversity and inclusion,' but advocate for the utilization of racial discrimination to achieve 'antiracist' ends.\" This is another flashpoint in the culture wars of the moment, intense debates in which national issues have crept into even the most local of races. What happens in races like the one in Centerville this fall may provide a sense of whether this is a real groundswell of concern among parents or whether it is coming a vocal minority. Many Republicans see opportunity here for races higher up the ballot next year and beyond. As an example, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, has made school fights a centerpiece of his campaign. A candidate running in the Republican primary for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio showed up last week to a school board meeting saying he was there to speak up for parents, a political stunt that got attention after he was escorted out by police.

Concerned with the chaos and division, they are now working to get the incumbents re-elected. But Republican pollster Christine Matthews, who spends a lot of time doing focus groups with suburban women, isn't convinced this strategy will work for the GOP. \"This is not something that's going to bring a swing suburban mom into the fold,\" said Matthews, who is president of Bellwether Research. \"In fact, what swing women tell me that they hate almost more than anything right now is the division between people in our country, the fights.\" She said it excites Republican base voters but for independent voters needed to win elections, this could actually cause a backlash to all the chaos. Unlike a presidential election, where the candidates are distant and the stakes abstract, with school boards, people's kids are involved and school board members are trusted members of the community. There were some early signs of backlash in Centerville, where a group of moms have gotten together, united by their frustration with the fights. Most of them haven't been active in politics before \u2014 but now they're working to get the slate of incumbents reelected to the school board. \"We are a top-performing district,\" said Bonnie Smith. \"We are a reasonable community. And to create this friction and this chaos is inappropriate and personal.\" Additional reporting for this story was contributed by WYSO's Chris Welter and Mawa Iqbal and NPR's Lexie Schapitl.",

Lawmakers looking to gain or keep a political edge during redistricting over the years have carved up some inventive electoral districts: Ohio's \"snake by the lake,\" Pennsylvania's \"Goofy kicking Donald Duck,\" and two centuries ago, the snake-like district in Massachusetts that inspired the term \"gerrymander.\" In Virginia, House of Delegates District 72, sometimes called the \"toilet bowl\" because of how it curves around Richmond, became the gerrymandering poster child in the state as advocates pressed for a redistricting commission to create fairer political maps. Voters overwhelmingly approved the bipartisan commission in November 2020, but this year, as the commission has tried to redraw voting districts in the midst of legislative elections and a race for governor, the group is mired in partisanship that has become increasingly bitter and personal. In fact, the commission gave up trying to draw state legislative maps after three Democrats, responding to what they said was GOP stonewalling, walked out of a meeting earlier this month. Mackenzie Babichenko, the commission's Republican co-chair, summarized the mood a few days later: \"It seemed as though there was just a fundamental lack of trust of each other's motives.\" In most states, lawmakers draw up their own political districts. Virginia is one of about ten states that has moved to a special committee that includes citizens to handle the process. But unlike elsewhere, Virginia's commission includes a mix of lawmakers and citizens that critics say doomed it from the start. The commonwealth's closely watched off-year statewide and legislative elections have also heightened the partisan mood as Democrats defend their grip on the legislature. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is also trying to win back his old job in a tight race with Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin. Democratic Delegate Schuyler VanValkenburg, door knocking for his race on Nov 2., represents the district sometimes referred to as a \"toilet bowl\" in Virginia's House of Delegates. Although, he says he prefers to call it a \"horseshoe.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Ben Paviour/VPM\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Delegate Schuyler VanValkenburg, door knocking for his race on Nov 2., represents the district sometimes referred to as a \"toilet bowl\" in Virginia's House of Delegates. Although, he says he prefers to call it a \"horseshoe.\" State Delegate Schuyler VanValkenburg, a Democrat who represents the so-called \"toilet bowl\" district (although, he prefers to call it a horseshoe), says changing demographics and anti-Trump sentiment allowed his party to eventually flip both legislative chambers in 2019, but the mood is different this year. \"The wins in 2017 and 2019 were narrow wins because they were gerrymandered,\" VanValkenburg says. \"And so that requires a high level of turnout and requires a high level of voting to keep these seats.\" That is not necessarily the case with a Democrat in the White House. As he campaigns this fall, VanValkenburg has occasionally checked in to see various proposals on how his district should be redrawn. Back before voters passed it, many Democrats in Virginia advised voting against the commission, warning that the inclusion of politicians would keep it from being independent enough from politics. Also, that it wouldn't do enough to make sure minority groups were fairly represented. VanValkenburg \u2014 who championed the commission \u2014 says despite the body's failings, it's still a step in the right direction. \"The process we have now is very transparent,\" VanValkenburg says. \"It's very open. I think people are seeing how messy redistricting is \u2014 hopefully it leads to more reform. I would be a fan of more reform.\" Several members of the commission have already offered up ideas on how to improve it: removing politicians, adding independents or creating a partisan balance that reflects the state's political makeup rather than a 50-50 split. Democratic co-chair Greta Harris advised her colleagues to read up on Virginia's history of racial discrimination after heated debates over how people's race should be used in maps. Harris also spoke directly to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which is now poised to take up the drawing of state maps as the commission deadlocks. \"I am appealing to the justices of the Supreme Court of Virginia, to take the principles that we discussed at the beginning of this process ... to look at the law, not only at the federal level, but at the state level, and lift up fairness,\" Harris said, before walking out of the meeting. It's all a disappointment to voters like Julia Hebner, a 14-year resident of the horseshoe-shaped district who supported creating the commission. Hebner blames politicians in the group for its failings and says they should be excluded in the future. \"I mean, everybody says this: The politicians shouldn't be choosing their voters. The voters should be choosing the politicians,\" Hebner says.",

In the Bay Area of Northern California there has been a spike in hate-driven violence against Asian Americans. A 64-year-old grandma assaulted and robbed in San Jose. A 52-year-old Asian American woman shot in the head with a flare gun in Oakland. All of it feels too close to home for Lisa Lu, a new mom who lives in the Bay Area. \"I felt like during the height of the pandemic it didn't feel safe for me to go outside, and I was actually pregnant for most of the pandemic,\" Lu says. \"So that was especially scary, like the thought of me going anywhere and being attacked and anything happening to my baby.\" According to a new poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 1 in 4 Asian Americans feared \u2014 in the past few months \u2014 that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity. More than 20% of Native American and Black households also expressed this fear. Loading... The attacks in Lu's area on Asian Americans are reflective of the nation. Last year, the FBI recorded the highest number of hate crimes in more than a decade, with 64% motivated by race, ethnicity or heritage. But that number is likely even higher, advocates and experts say, since some agencies don't report this data to the FBI and many agencies report no incidents. For Asian Americans, the spike in attacks and the rising fear came with the global pandemic and the racist rhetoric from the Trump administration, including the use of derogatory terms like \"Kung Flu.\" \"Trump calling it the China virus, that's when I felt like life changed,\" Lu says. \"And honestly I don't want to venture out to any areas that are not diverse, and even in San Francisco and Oakland, I wouldn't walk alone.\" Lu always has a buddy when she's out walking and she urges her older parents to stay inside as well. \"What's different about our poll is that we asked about your personal fears,\"  says Mary Findling, the assistant director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, speaking about the new poll. \"We were shocked that 1 in 4 Asian Americans and around 1 in 5 Black and Native Americans say that in the past few months, they've feared that someone might threaten or physically attack their household because of their race or ethnicity.\" Based on the data, she says,  crime may seem rare or random for white people. \"But if you're not white, what we found is it's not random or rare at all,\" she says. \"And this is really capturing people's everyday lived experiences. One in 4 is a lot of people who are looking over their shoulders in fear.\" The poll also found in the past few months alone that 31% of Native American households reported facing discrimination or unfair treatment because of their race or ethnicity, followed by 29% of Black households, 26% of Asian households, and 20% of Latino households. For Asian Americans, in the past year there has been a lot of focus on high profile incidents like the horrific killings of Asian American women in Atlanta this spring, or the mass shooting in Indianapolis where half of those killed were American Sikhs. But according to Stop AAPI hate, Asian Americans are also dealing with everyday hateful slights and transgressions that contribute to the growing fear. \"The fear is based not only on potential hate crimes, but even the hate incidents,\" says Manjusha P. Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. \"They're refused service at a grocery store or at a coffee shop, they're worried about even just being verbally harassed.\" Incidents like those make up 90% of the 9,000 that have been reported to her organization in 15 months. And that, she believes, is \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" Kulkarni says Asian Americans have been depicted as the perpetual foreigner across centuries. Because they're treated as outsiders, these communities become easily scapegoated. That's what happened with COVID, which originated in Wuhan, China, she says. \"Immediately you had President Trump drawing correlations. Blaming outright COVID on the Chinese people, using the racist rhetoric that he did: 'Wuhan virus, China virus, Kung flu,'\" she says. \"Then, essentially, people sort of extrapolating that and saying 'Oh, well, you know, these people brought it.' It's not dissimilar to the Japanese American incarceration, even the bubonic plague in the 1800s where Chinese Americans were blamed.\" Before the start of the pandemic, Bay Area resident Lu had faced discrimination. She grew up in a largely white neighborhood as an Asian kid. But she's never felt this acute sense of fear for her physical safety until now. For 58-year-old Victoria though, as a Black woman, she says she's had that feeling as long as she can remember, because she's been targeted before. She's only using her first name for privacy. She's a survivor of sexual assault. \"Because of my race and also, even more especially, because of my gender,\" she said. \"I'm already a target as being seen as weak [as a woman] and then the color of your skin [the assumption] that you will not possibly report it, you will possibly not be believed.\" And for Chris in North Dakota \u2014 he's Native American \u2014 he also worries about threats or attacks. He spends most of his time on the reservation, where he works and takes care of his brother. Worried about repercussions, he wants to use only his first name as well. He says that when he's off the reservation he's been feeling growing anger from Trump supporters. \"Most people are really friendly here, but there are some people that brazenly discuss not wearing masks in public and discuss immigrants and discuss Native Americans to each other while they're in the store and around people.\" He says he often hears offensive things, like the idea that Native Americans are lazy or there are too many Black immigrants in town. And the rhetoric has grown over the past year and a half, before and after the elections. So he keeps to himself and doesn't discuss his ethnicity or his beliefs. \"They're so vocal about it and offensive with their comments about it,\" he says. \"We're part Native American and there's just this political divide in the country right now after the last president and everything. And so I just try to keep everything low key.\"",

They called for an end to rampant corruption that is siphoning their country's oil wealth, for better public services like reliable water and electricity, and for a bigger voice in a government. The protest movement forced out Adil Abdul-Mahdi, then the prime minister, in May 2020, and triggered new elections. On Sunday, Iraqi voters will go to the polls to elect a new parliament for the fifth time since longtime dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted after the U.S. invaded in 2003.

After the U.S. invasion in 2003, Washington backed the establishment of a governing structure in Iraq designed to share power among the country's different religious sects. But this has reinforced patronage and inefficiency in government, and a deteriorating quality of life for Iraqi citizens. While some protesters are contesting the election as candidates, many others have called for a boycott on the vote. The election's eventual outcome will be shaped by powerful players including the country's sectarian leaders, Iran and the U.S. Here's a look at the vote and key issues. After years of seeing existing political parties fail to deliver effective governance, the turnout on Sunday will be a test of how much voters still believe in Iraq's political system. According to Iraq's electoral commission, there are more than 25 million registered voters. There are more than 3,200 candidates for 329 seats in parliament. New parliamentarians will choose the next prime minister, a job currently held by Mustafa al-Kadhimi. A new election law allows Iraqis to vote for specific candidates instead of broad party lists. It's meant to make politicians more accountable and reenergize an electoral process that has increasingly suffered from voter apathy and fraud. A major problem, though, is that most newly established political parties or independent candidates don't have the same funds or organizing power as the bigger, established parties. Moreover, some new candidates say their ability to campaign has been hampered by threats and even assassination attempts. These candidates are therefore not expected to win many seats, and existing parties are likely to take the biggest share of the votes. Among Iraq's majority Shiite population, the Sadrist Movement led by the popular cleric Moqtada al-Sadr will vie for votes with Al-Fateh, an alliance of political parties \u2014 many of which are linked to militias \u2014 that are influenced by Iran. Politicians in Sunni-majority areas have been campaigning on promises to help rebuild the many areas that were destroyed in Iraq's years-long fight against ISIS. The party of Parliamentary Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi, is among the most popular in these areas, although he is challenged by businessman Khamis Khanjar, who has invested heavily there.

She is from a new political party that is running on a platform promoting better public services for Iraqis. In Iraq's Kurdish region, with a population of about 5 million, the Kurdistan Democratic Party of that region's prime minister, Masrour Barzani, is expected to prevail. Iraqi political parties backed by Iran have called for American troops to leave Iraq \u2014 it's a central part of their election campaigns. Tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated in January 2020, after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military commander, Gen. Qassem Suleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad. Washington has said the U.S. combat mission in Iraq will wrap up by the end of this year, but that the U.S. will continue to train and advise the Iraqi military. In practice, U.S. troop numbers are expected to remain similar, though the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in the country will likely be less visible.

With very few funds, volunteers for candidate Taghrid Mohammed Alkhazali can only afford to print and put up small campaign posters. They are with a new political group whose name translates to \"I'm taking my rights.\" Critics say the U.S. shares some responsibility for the failure of governance in Iraq. After the 2003 invasion, the U.S.-backed Iraqi Governing Council established a system of sectarian apportionment, which continues to this day. This quota system divides cabinet roles and ministries and their resources between ethno-sectarian parties. With the country in the grip of a bloody sectarian civil war, this was intended as a way to ensure that different ethnic groups and religious sects had political representation. Mounting anger against this system, known as the muhasasa, was one of the causes for the popular protests that began in 2019. It is widely seen as a key reason for the problems of governing in Iraq today. It has led to gridlock in parliament and lent itself to widespread corruption and patronage, as political parties siphon off state funds to pay off their supporters or reserve jobs for loyalists. The vote will likely be followed by months of negotiations between the main players. It's expected that no party will secure an absolute majority and that the election will be followed by a lengthy bargaining process, as parties build coalitions and divide up control of ministries. This could take months. Najiha Daher sweeps sewage and wastewater away from the door of her grocery store in a slum district of Baghdad.

Corruption and dysfunction in government have left Iraqis with crumbling public services, in a country that is rich with oil. The U.S. and Iran will likely have some role in shaping the ultimate outcome. In the past, these countries have essentially signed off on a choice of prime minister that is acceptable to both. Washington and Tehran both have an interest in established political parties continuing to wield power under the existing political system. For the U.S., maintaining the status quo is safer than not, and will help avert any potential new crisis for President Biden's White House after the chaotic U.S. pullout from Afghanistan. It also allows the U.S. to keep American troops in the country in some form and to continue to have influence in a country of strategic importance in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Iran's influence in Iraq's government has grown, and Tehran has strengthened the power of Iraqi militias it backs. But keeping the status quo is at odds with what many Iraqis want. They crave changes that they hope will yield a better quality of life. Many of the protesters who risked their lives to bring about these elections now say they will boycott them, believing they will bring little real change.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center, and James Barrag\u00e1n, reporter at The Texas Tribune, about the redistricting process in Texas and around the country.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Republican lawmakers in Texas released a map first thing Monday morning. Stephanie Gomez was in the middle of an all-staff phone call. STEPHANIE GOMEZ: You know, we got the text. Like, the maps are out. These are the maps that we have been waiting for. And so, of course, everything stopped. CHANG: Gomez is associate director of Common Cause Texas. It's a nonprofit that works on issues like voting and elections. And the map that she's talking about - well, it's a big deal. GOMEZ: I don't know if I'm allowed to cuss, but it was very like, oh, hell. Everyone, open up the maps, and let's just - let's take a look at everything. CHANG: It's the first draft of what congressional districts could look like in Texas for the next decade. Maps for state house districts are also being rolled out. You see; every state right now is drawing new districts based on the 2020 census. GOMEZ: What's most noticeable - right? - is kind of like these muddy little blocks in the urban areas of Texas. Of course, our eyes were like, OK, we're supposed to get two opportunity districts for minorities. Let's see where they end up putting those. CHANG: Texas grew so much over the last decade that it's going to get two more seats in the next Congress. And that population growth is driven almost entirely by Latinos and other people of color in the state. But here's the thing. This new map, proposed by Republican state lawmakers in Texas, would actually reduce the number of voting districts where Black and Latino voters are the majority. GOMEZ: It's so hard to be a Texan who is fighting for an equitable democracy. CHANG: The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which grades redistricting maps on things like how fair or competitive the districts are, gave the Texas Congressional District Map a flat-out F. We're going to spend the next few minutes now unpacking what's going on with the Texas map and also check in on how this redistricting process is going across the country. We're joined now by Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, and James Barragan. He covers politics at the Texas Tribune. Welcome to both of you. JAMES BARRAGAN: It's good to be here. MICHAEL LI: Good to be here. CHANG: Let's focus on Texas for the time being. James, again in that state, Republicans have the power to draw voting maps because they control the Legislature. You know, it's no surprise here that Democrats don't like this Republican proposal for this new map, but can you just explain what specifically are Democrats criticizing? BARRAGAN: Well, I think the main thing is that the population growth of the state over the last 10 years was fueled 95% by communities of color, particularly the Hispanic community here. What map-drawers will do often is that they'll \"crack it,\" quote, unquote, by bringing a portion of a district that's from a faraway other area and just jut into the area where that large Hispanic population is. The one I'm thinking particularly, just because I've covered it for many years, is the Dallas, Fort Worth area, where the Hispanic population in Dallas is actually the largest racial or ethnic group in the county. And there was opportunity there for those people to have a candidate of their choice, and there was no such district drawn. And that's important because, particularly in Dallas, like, there's never been a Hispanic elected to Congress from that area, even though it's a significant amount of the population. CHANG: OK, that's cracking. That's when you're diluting minority voting power. What else are they doing? BARRAGAN: And then there's packing. In a district like, for example, Colin Allred, who flipped the district in 2018, which was traditionally Republican, they've packed Democratic voters into what was previously a competitive district that could have gone one way or another to make it easier for him to win. But that also helps other Republican neighbors have easier races, such as Beth Van Duyne in Congressional District 24. CHANG: OK, so that's packing. That's when you're concentrating like-minded voters into districts so there are fewer districts that are actually competitive. But let's be very clear, legally speaking. What we're talking about - partisan gerrymandering - that is redrawing district boundaries that give political advantage to the party in power. It's been going on for generations now. And it is not in and of itself unconstitutional. I mean, the Supreme Court reinforced that it is not in and of itself unconstitutional back in 2019. LI: That's right. But that doesn't mean that there isn't some limit to partisan gerrymandering, because at another decision, the Supreme Court said if you overuse race as a tool to achieve partisan advantage, that could be a racial gerrymander that violates the Constitution. In other words, you can't use race as a tool to get to a partisan gerrymander. CHANG: Exactly. LI: And of course, the reality is in Texas, you can't get to a partisan gerrymander without hurting communities of color. CHANG: Partisanship and race are inextricably intertwined. You know, we should also note that this is the first time that states are redrawing their congressional districts since the Supreme Court gutted part of the Voting Rights Act, when they eviscerated a provision that had required certain states with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get free clearance from the federal government before making any voting changes. That was Shelby County v. Holder back in 2013. How much can we attribute what's happening in Texas right now to that Supreme Court ruling? BARRAGAN: I think a large portion of it could probably be attributed to it. There's no buffer to protect voters of color from being discriminated against. And so I think lawmakers are drawing maps that are advantageous to them because there is no immediate buffer. Of course, there can be litigation, and people who are aggrieved by this can try to get an injunction on these maps. But previously, there had been this requirement that the federal government had to OK these maps, and that was put in place specifically to prevent this kind of discrimination against voters of color. That is no longer the case right now. CHANG: Well, Democrats have also pushed to use partisan gerrymandering to their advantage in states like Maryland, Illinois and New York. Michael, can you just talk a little bit about how the redistricting process in New York is playing out so far? LI: Well, what we're seeing around the country is that the process is a lot more partisan than it was last time. You know, even in states that adopted reforms that were designed to make the process more bipartisan, that isn't turning out to be true. You know, people are putting on their team hats and, you know, trying to maximize advantage for their political party. And, you know, Democrats this cycle are doing it as much as Republicans. In the past, Democrats have been a little asleep at the wheel, but they're awake this year. CHANG: I also want to ask, you know, because states are handling this process in lots of different ways, there is a handful of states that have shifted to independent redistricting commissions where politicians are not the ones who are redrawing the maps. This was supposed to take the partisanship out of redistricting. But Michael, does that even work? Are these commissions truly independent from politics? Is that even possible? LI: Well, what we've seen about independent commissions and the maps that they've drawn so far - there's a limited amount of data available because it's a relatively new concept - is that they actually do draw really good maps. So, for example, in California, as Democrats win more votes, they win more seats. As Republicans win more votes, they win more seats. And a prime example of that is Orange County in California where Democrats picked up a bunch of seats in 2018. Republicans won a bunch back in 2020 as the mood shifted slightly. And that would be what most people say democracy should look like. CHANG: Well, James, these maps in Texas are not final. Can you just tell us what's the next step in the process here? BARRAGAN: Sure. If it's approved by the Senate, it'll get sent over to the House. And then the House will go through the same process before sending it over to the governor. I think one complicating factor is that we're in a 30-day special legislative session here in Texas. And so we may run out of time to pass all of these maps and may have to go into an overtime period. CHANG: That is James Barragan - he covers politics at the Texas Tribune - and Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. Thank you to both of you. BARRAGAN: Thank you.

Republican House Speaker Tim Moore is shown here gaveling in a session in April 2020. RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina judges struck down the state's latest photo voter identification law on Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law \"was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,\" Superior Court Judges Michael O'Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 100-page majority opinion. \"Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.\" The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, is now likely headed to a state appeals court, which had previously blocked the law's enforcement last year while the case was heard. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling. With a similar lawsuit in federal court set to go to trial this January and another state court lawsuit now on appeal, it's looking more unlikely that a voter ID mandate for in-person and absentee balloting will happen in the 2022 elections. The ruling reflects \"how the state's Republican-controlled legislature undeniably implemented this legislation to maintain its power by targeting voters of color,\" said Allison Riggs, the plaintiffs' lead attorney. Spokespersons for Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, didn't immediately respond to email requests for comment. GOP legislative leaders have tried for a decade to require photo IDs to cast ballots. Republicans have said voter ID laws are needed to build public confidence in elections and to prevent voter fraud, which remains rare nationwide. But many Democrats see the mandates as attempts at voter suppression. In July 2016, a federal appeals court struck down several portions of a 2013 North Carolina elections law that included a voter ID mandate, saying GOP lawmakers had written them with \"almost surgical precision\" to discourage voting by Black voters, who tend to support Democrats. Lawyers for the voters who sued over the 2018 law said it suffered the same racial defects as the 2013 law \u2014 following a long effort by North Carolina elected officials to weaken African American voting as a way to retain control of the General Assembly. The 2013 law was carried out briefly in 2016 primary elections. GOP legislative leaders and their attorneys disagreed, saying the latest ID rules were approved with substantial Democratic support and improved to retain ballot access while ensuring only legal citizens can vote. The categories of qualifying IDs were greatly expanded compared to the 2013 law to include college student and government-employee IDs. Free IDs also are available from county elections boards or at early-voting sites, and people without IDs can still vote if they fill out a form at the voting precinct. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Nathaniel Poovey wrote that passage of the voter ID law falls in line with the state constitution, citing its support from several Black legislators and the citizens voting for the constitutional referendum. \"Competence evidence before this three-judge panel does not suggest our legislature enacted this law with a racially discriminatory intent,\" Poovey wrote. But the majority on the panel decided that the changes didn't eliminate fully the racial bias and permanently blocked enforcement of the ID law. About three dozen states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, and about half of these states want photo ID only, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A provision contained in a sweeping federal overhaul of elections pushed this year by congressional Democrats would effectively neuter state voter ID laws by allowing people without an ID to sign a form at the polls instead. Six voters \u2014 five Black and one biracial \u2014 sued in Wake County court on the same day that GOP lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto of the 2018 voter ID bill. During the trial, Some of the plaintiffs testified about their difficulties in obtaining an ID or voting when the earlier photo ID law was in effect. Lawyers for the GOP said all voters would continue to be able to vote under the 2018 law. The plaintiffs' case emphasized analysis from a University of Michigan professor who said Black voters are 39% more likely to lack a qualifying photo ID than white registered voters. The analysis, however, left out data on some categories of qualifying IDs. Changes to these and other voting procedures in North Carolina once needed federal preapproval. But a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling meant such \"preclearance\" actions were no longer required. The legislature approved the 2013 voter ID law just a few weeks after that ruling.",

MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 The Minnesota Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday evening for voters in Minneapolis to decide on the future of policing in the city where George Floyd was killed, just ahead of the start of early and absentee voting.The state's highest court overturned a lower court ruling that rejected ballot language approved by the City Council. A district judge said the wording failed to adequately describe the effects of a proposed charter amendment that would replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety that \"could include\" police officers \"if necessary.\" But Chief Justice Lorie Gildea said in a three-page order that the justices concluded that the challenge to the ballot language did not meet the \"high standard\" that the court set in earlier cases. She said the court will issue a full opinion laying out its legal reasoning sometime later to avoid impeding the start of voting.The Supreme Court was under pressure to rule quickly because early and absentee voting opens at 8 a.m. Friday in the Minneapolis municipal elections. The ballots were already being printed when Hennepin County District Judge Jamie Anderson ruled against the language Tuesday. It was the second time she had struck down the council's wording. Chief Justice Lorie Gildea put the case on the fast track Wednesday.Lawyers on both sides said beforehand that they expect the high court ruling allowing the ballot language to be the final word, given the late hour. Leaders of the pro-amendment Yes 4 Minneapolis campaign were pressing ahead with a rally set for Friday afternoon. The proposal has its roots in the \"defund the police\" movement, which gained steam after Floyd's death last summer sparked protests, civil unrest and a national reckoning on racial justice. The amendment does not use the term \"defund.\" But it would remove the city charter's requirement that Minneapolis have a police department with a minimum staffing level. Many details of how the new agency would work would be left up to the the City Council and mayor to decide later.Yes 4 Minneapolis, which spearheaded the initiative, insists that the city would continue to have police if voters approve the amendment, but that the new department would be free to take a fresh approach to public safety that could reduce excessive policing against communities of color.Opponents of the amendment, including former council member Don Samuels and his wife, Sondra, said the ballot language leaves too many important questions unexplained for voters about how the new department would be implemented, led, staffed and funded.Yes 4 Minneapolis argued in its filing with the Supreme Court that the Minneapolis Police Department would not automatically disappear if the amendment passed. The group said the department would continue to exist under current city ordinances until the City Council passed new laws to establish the new agency, and that the council could keep the force in place as long as necessary for an orderly transition.",

Of all the candidates trying to unseat California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the recall election wrapping up Tuesday, conservative talk show host Larry Elder has the best chance.Elder works for the right-wing broadcaster Salem Media Group, an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media, with hosts who peddle discredited claims about COVID-19, last year's elections and more. But Salem Media is not merely an employer for Elder; it is a platform, a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race. Polls suggest the recall attempt will fail. Yet Elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should Newsom falter. And whatever success he has derives, in large part, from the significant support of Salem Media. Salem Media Group contributed $35,000 to Elder just last week (under California law, corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates' campaigns). On Sunday, Elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website Townhall and KRLA-AM radio in Southern California, the home station for Elder's nationally syndicated radio show. Both outlets are owned by Salem Media. At an event Sunday night, Elder was hailed as a hero. It was sponsored by the Townhall website and KRLA-AM radio, both owned by Salem Media Group. The right-wing network has helped to propel Elder's candidacy. Another KRLA host, Jennifer Horn, who was helping to moderate the evening's event, noted that for legal reasons Salem couldn't have him stage a true campaign-style rally. But it was at times hard to tell the difference: Elder sat comfortably, microphone in hand, bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor-made to stir last-minute supporters to vote. \"Your question was what would I do when I become governor?\" Elder asked, drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word \"when.\" Horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a Hyatt Regency in Orange County by his preferred nickname: the \"Sage of South Central.\" Elder grew up in South Los Angeles, went to Brown University and earned a degree in law at the University of Michigan. Yet he would not make his mark in law. If his unlikely bid succeeds, Elder would be the first African American governor for the nation's most populous state. He would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs, particularly on matters of race and gender, intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents. At the event Sunday, Elder promised to kill any of Newsom's coronavirus-related mandates, joked with another radio host that he was \"the Black face of white supremacy,\" and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men. Elder told attendees that he's not against the vaccines for COVID-19 and that he himself has been vaccinated, but he questioned the need for government mandates. On his radio show, he has given ample time to those casting doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines themselves. And he has also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Such controversies might inspire rebukes from some employers. Not so at Salem Media, which has welcomed conspiracy theorists into its lineups. As a warmup for Elder's appearance on Sunday, hosts interviewed a rogue's gallery of Trump surrogates: former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk, and Blaze and Fox News host Mark Levin. All of them are employed by various outlets of Salem Media. Salem Media seeks to appeal to \"a voter base of fundamentalist Christians who are urged to the polls, based on their conservative and sometimes socially regressive beliefs, anti-abortion, anti-LGBT, etc.,\" says Columbia University scholar Anne Nelson, author of Shadow Network, a book on the political alliance of conservative media and religious and business groups. Salem Media's founders were a pair of brothers-in-law, Stuart Epperson and Edward G. Atsinger III. They established the outfit in 1986 as a religious broadcaster. Their mission has now expanded to incorporate conservative fundamentalist Christianity and to promote victories by like-minded Republicans. Salem Media, which is publicly traded on Nasdaq, now owns more than 100 stations, making it among the largest radio groups in the country. It says it syndicates its programs to 3,000 stations nationwide. Additionally, it owns a welter of conservative opinion sites, including not just Townhall but also HotAir, PJ Media, RedState and Twitchy. Salem Media claims more than 200 million unique users a month, a figure that's hard to verify. But Nelson says that through the radio stations and the sites, Salem Media can encourage Trump-minded people to vote, especially in more conservative swing states in the Midwest and South. Elder had been a nationally syndicated host twice for ABC Radio in Los Angeles. When he was let go the second time in 2015, Salem hired him. Nelson says he's found ways to align himself with his even more conservative bosses. \"Elder has kind of gravitated towards endorsing these positions and tapping into that voter base with this massive radio network support that's built under him,\" Nelson tells NPR. The senior executive at Salem Media assigned to handle media inquiries did not respond to three messages left by NPR over five days seeking an interview for this story. Elder's campaign also did not respond to requests for comment. In 2018, Salem Media fired writers at RedState who were deemed insufficiently supportive of Trump, according to reports in CNN and elsewhere. Behind paywalls, some Salem Media commentators offer even more extreme takes. In July, PJ Media Editor Paula Bolyard warned readers that the critical reaction to the site's coverage of COVID-19, especially its caustic takes on public health officials, had taken a toll. And, Bolyard wrote, there was a reason she was asking readers to subscribe to get past the paywalls: She did not want to subject her site's most powerful posts to scrutiny. \"Regular readers of PJ Media know that much of our COVID-19 coverage has been behind a paywall, accessible only to our VIP subscribers,\" Bolyard wrote. \"It's just not worth our time to have to deal with the fact-checkers, who have been working overtime to discredit us and damage our reputation.\" Behind the paywalls for various Salem Media sites, writers and podcasters have blasted the use of masks and vaccines against COVID-19 and instead promoted discredited cures. Additionally, hosts unleash coarse rants against the media, and glory in their ability to evade not just fact-checkers but social media moderators. On repeated paywalled streaming videos, RedState's Scott Hounsell raises aloft a middle finger to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey. To be clear, Salem, an explicitly conservative fundamentalist Christian media company, charges viewers, listeners and readers money to access uncensored and profane content. Yet unfettered conspiracy theories can be found in free content, too. On the free version of the Townhall podcast Triggered, hosts Matt Vespa and Storm Paglia earlier this year called Congress a disgrace. They mused why anyone should be surprised by the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Moments later, however, they concluded the event wasn't real but a setup by the FBI. In July, on his Salem radio show, Elder took a call from a voter urging him to run and suggesting that the vote might be sabotaged against him. Elder laughed at the Trump-like prediction of electoral fraud and said he wouldn't be surprised. In more recent days, Elder's campaign has set up an official site claiming fraud is taking place in the California recall race, even though the election has yet to wrap up. It's a claim \u2014 unsupported by any meaningful evidence \u2014 that's receiving a warm reception throughout Salem Media.",

Burton California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento after beating back the recall attempt that aimed to remove him from office.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Gov. Gavin Newsom addresses reporters Tuesday at the John L. Burton California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento after beating back the recall attempt that aimed to remove him from office. The attempt in California to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has failed, according to a call by The Associated Press, allowing the governor to stay in office until at least 2023. Tuesday's vote ends a campaign against Newsom that began before the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. Loading... \"I am humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercised their fundamental right to vote,\" Newsom said Tuesday night, speaking almost somberly to a group of reporters. \"We [have] so much more in common in our state than we give ourselves credit for,\" he added, expressing how difficult life has been for Californians during the pandemic. The governor's victory serves to vindicate his leadership of the state through COVID-19, but he won't be off the campaign trail for long. He'll have to run for reelection next year if he wants to keep his seat after his term ends. This recall petition was one of six circulated by the governor's opponents to remove him since he took office in January 2019. Getting the vote to the ballot took an unlikely synchronization of political fortune and Newsom's own missteps. Last year, a judge gave the recall campaign an additional four months to collect signatures, citing the difficulties in distributing petitions during the pandemic. Later that day, Newsom dined at the upscale French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley, ignoring his own guidance to avoid gatherings as the spread of the coronavirus picked up. The dinner became the enduring symbol of the recall campaign and fodder for the most convincing attack against the governor: that he failed to practice what he preached. Instead of waiting for the 2022 gubernatorial election, thousands of the governor's detractors signed petitions to put Newsom's fate on the ballot this year. The resurgence of the virus also allowed Newsom to draw his clearest contrast between the candidates hoping to replace him, most notably conservative radio talk show host Larry Elder, who conceded the race late Tuesday local time. Republican conservative radio show host Larry Elder speaks at a rally for the California gubernatorial recall election on Monday in Monterey Park, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican conservative radio show host Larry Elder speaks at a rally for the California gubernatorial recall election on Monday in Monterey Park, Calif. In late July, Newsom announced vaccine mandates for California state employees, health care workers and school staff, along with a mask requirement for schoolchildren \u2014 orders that Elder promised to revoke on Day 1 if elected. But Elder's emergence as the clear favorite on the ballot's second question \u2014 who should replace Newsom if he's recalled? \u2014 allowed the governor to turn the race from a referendum into a choice. The governor spent the final days of the campaign slamming Elder's conservative positions on climate policy, abortion and minimum wage. Elder has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and, in response, Democrats linked the recall effort to Trumpism and to the national Republican agenda on issues such as reproductive rights and voting access. Elder, like the former president, has claimed without any evidence that Trump lost last year's election to election fraud. \"There are all sort of reasons the 2020 election, in my opinion, was full of shenanigans,\" Elder said earlier this month. \"And my fear is they're going to try that in this election in the recall.\" The first complaint listed in the recall petition against the governor was that he favored the interests of people in the country \"illegally.\" But that argument largely faded into the background as the spread of COVID-19 allowed the campaign to gain momentum. Further complaints from the \"yes\" campaign: The \"no\" campaign's main points: The short answer: Federal judges allowed for the recall election to move forward. The long answer: Some legal scholars questioned the process in recent weeks because the two-question recall ballot makes it possible for the governor to be replaced by a candidate who earned fewer votes, That's because the governor \u2014 or any elected official facing a recall in California \u2014 needs a majority vote in the first question, which asks if they should be removed, to stay in office. That meant if Newsom won only 49% support in the first question, he would have been recalled, and his replacement would have been the candidate with the most votes on the second question, even if that candidate won less than 50%. In late August, a federal judge declined to stop the recall. The lawyer who brought the suit appealed to the Ninth U.S Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, but a panel of judges declined to halt the election. They will take written arguments through mid-October. There were 46 candidates on the ballot to replace Newsom, who encouraged those voting \"NO\" on the first question not to choose a candidate on the second question. For that reason, it was seen as unlikely that all but a few candidates would gain even a small percentage of the total vote. These were the top five names in the most recent polling. Larry Elder Elder, a Republican, has brought his libertarian views to the Los Angeles talk radio airwaves for decades, landing a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Elder said as governor he'd pursue a rollback of the recent gas tax increase, which funds road improvements and transit projects. Elder derided Newsom's efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and vowed to suspend some of the state's environmental regulations to spur development. Kevin Paffrath Paffrath, a Democrat, has garnered millions of viewers for his YouTube videos, which share tips for investing in real estate. Paffrath promised a centrist governorship. In an interview with KQED, he described himself as \"51% Democrat, 49% Republican\" and listed his top priority as housing all of the state's unhoused residents within 60 days, though details were scant. Paffrath also unveiled out-of-the-box proposals such as enlisting prison inmates to clean the state's streets; offering 14-year-olds the opportunity to attend a \"future school\" that includes a focus on career training; and building an aqueduct to the Mississippi River to bolster California's water supply. Kevin Faulconer Faulconer, a Republican, was the mayor of San Diego from 2014 to 2020, making the city the largest in the U.S. to have an elected Republican mayor at the time. As governor, Faulconer claimed he would have eliminated state income taxes for certain individuals and families in California. Faulconer also vowed to withhold funds from local governments that don't build homeless shelters and then clear tent encampments. Critics in San Diego accused him of failing to respond urgently to homelessness until 2017, when a hepatitis A outbreak among the city's homeless population killed 20 people. John Cox Cox, a Republican, also ran and lost decisively to Newsom in 2018. Cox is a millionaire former public accountant, housing developer, lawyer and investment manager who has run for office unsuccessfully in both California and Illinois. As governor, Cox said he would have cut income taxes by $30 billion and eliminated wasteful state spending. He has also promised to cut homelessness in half by increasing treatment for unhoused people and enforcement against those who refuse help, and vowed to build more housing by cutting red tape and regulations. Cox's plans are light on specifics. Caitlyn Jenner The Republican reality TV star \u2014 a former Olympian most recently known for her turn on Keeping Up With the Kardashians \u2014 promised to focus on cutting red tape and regulations, and said she would veto any tax increase. She also attacked Gov. Newsom's COVID-19 response, pledging to keep schools and businesses fully open. Jenner spent much of the summer in Australia filming a reality TV show and drew heat for her apparent lack of understanding when it comes to the fundamentals of running government. Newsom will have to run for reelection next year if he wants to stay in office after his term ends in early 2023. Counties must finish counting ballots and certify their results by Oct. 14. The secretary of state will certify the results on Oct. 22.

Voting officials nationwide are still grappling with a new reality after the 2020 election that includes death threats, conspiracy theories and legal penalties for making what were once regarded as minor mistakes, but on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of attorneys announced an organization aimed at helping them fight back. The Election Official Legal Defense Network is the first organization of its kind aimed at providing pro-bono legal help and advice for election officials who up until a year ago did not really need it. \"It would be better if this wasn't necessary,\" said David Becker, a cofounder of the group and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \"But given the conversations many of us have had with election officials around the country, it's an unfortunate byproduct of the environment we now live in and the election denialism we're now seeing.\" Election officials nationwide describe a shift over the past year in the pressure and adversity that come with their jobs, and they attribute most of that to the pervasive false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen in some way from former President Donald Trump. There has never been any evidence to support that claim, though Trump and his supporters continue to push the conspiracy. Republican-led legislatures across the country have passed restrictive voting bills in response to questions about the vote's integrity. A Trump fundraising email Wednesday morning asked, \"Do you agree cheating in our elections is a serious problem?\" with a link to a donation page. And a survey conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group earlier this year of local election officials found that a third of them had at some point felt unsafe because of their jobs. \"It's been rough,\" Washington state election director Lori Augino told NPR. Augino, who has been the subject of threats herself, says, \"It's been like nothing I've ever seen in my 26-plus years of conducting elections.\" Brian Corley, who runs elections in Pasco County, Fla., said Wednesday during a media briefing about the new legal defense network that he was called an \"enemy of the state\" last year for sending voters a postcard asking them to consider voting by mail during a pandemic. His staff has been subject to dozens of racial slurs. \"Last November just continues,\" said Corley. \"It's like Groundhog Day.\" The new legal group aims to provide a support system for officials and let them know someone \"has their backs,\" said cofounder Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election attorney who represented the George W. Bush campaign. Ginsberg will co-chair the organization with Bob Bauer, who worked as White House counsel in the Obama administration. The group will also provide legal advice related to new voting laws in some states that add steep penalties if election officials make mistakes or get creative in providing access to the ballot box. In Florida, for instance, a new law says an election official could be on the hook for a $25,000 fine if an absentee ballot drop box is left without in-person supervision. A new law in Iowa similarly could mean local election officials face fines of up to $10,000 for \"technical infractions.\" And a new Texas law signed into law this week empowers partisan poll watchers to further affect the voting process. \"What we are seeing developing now is a huge step backwards from a focus on professionalized election administration to a heavy level of political interference in the work of trained election professionals,\" said Bauer. \"Our hope now is to provide [election officials] with a resource I wish they didn't have to have, but one I think they have desperately needed.\"",

            "article_content": "A church that earlier denied the severity of COVID-19 changed its messaging after an outbreak. But another church continues to say mask wearers and the vaccinated aren't welcome at worship services.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Some U.S. political leaders are encouraging people to consult their doctors about the vaccine for coronavirus. Tennessee's governor has encouraged people to talk to their clergy, too. As Paige Pfleger from member station WPLN reports, some local church leaders take that responsibility seriously. Others are spreading misinformation. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH CHOIR) PAIGE PFLEGER, BYLINE: At a recent Sunday service, pastor Travis Fleming stands at the pulpit and prays. TRAVIS FLEMING: We want to be in prayer, certainly, for a number of individuals that have tested positive this past week. PFLEGER: In late July, the coronavirus spread rapidly through the pews at First Baptist Gallatin outside of Nashville. More than 50 congregants who attended a Sunday service got sick. Some were even hospitalized. FLEMING: We had more who have tested positive for COVID in about a 10- to 14-day timeframe than we've had all of the previous 18 months of COVID. PFLEGER: Fleming says it was sobering. The church temporarily paused in-person services. And when they do get back together, he'll ask people to wear masks. The outbreak could have been much worse, but he says they were lucky. Many of his congregants are vaccinated and didn't have serious symptoms. FLEMING: It's obviously also - should be a wakeup call for those who are unvaccinated to say, oh, I don't want to go through that as an unvaccinated person. I need to go ahead and get vaccinated. PFLEGER: Fleming is vaccinated himself. He thinks the vaccine is a gift from God. Still, he has reservations about preaching that from the pulpit. FLEMING: It's a fine line for us as ministers to walk as to how much we say about a vaccine or how much we say for it or against it. PFLEGER: Fleming says it's too divisive. That's the approach many leaders of white evangelical churches are taking. Their congregants are among the most vaccine-hesitant, and the states along the Bible Belt have some of the lowest vaccine rates. But there are outliers who do take a stance at the pulpit, like pastor Greg Locke of Global Vision Bible Church just outside Nashville. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG LOCKE: You will not wear masks in this church. I'm telling you right now, do not get vaccinated. PFLEGER: That's what Locke sounds like when he's preaching from the stage under his red-and-white-striped tent. But later, sitting amid the rows of empty plastic folding chairs, he's more cool-headed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOCKE: People are like, how can you be so sure of yourself? Oh, I'm not sure of myself. I'm sure of the facts. PFLEGER: Where do you get your facts? LOCKE: And the facts embolden me. Well, I can't give up all my sources. PFLEGER: A lot of what he preaches about the pandemic is based on misinformation and conspiracy theories. For example, he thinks that COVID-19 is a flu that's being overblown by the government. Why? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOCKE: Right now, they're trying to cover up a stolen election. PFLEGER: But there's no evidence that's true. And the science has shown clearly that the coronavirus is far deadlier than the flu. Locke put up a vinyl sign facing the street that says, Global Vision is a mask-free church that celebrates faith over fear. He even has a tattoo on his bicep that says fear is a liar. Yet much of what he says seems to stoke that fear he's so against. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOCKE: You get that COVID-19 vaccine, you're going to get sick, or you're going to die, period. PFLEGER: The truth is, in Tennessee, nearly 90% of COVID-19 hospitalizations are unvaccinated people. While Locke's approach has drawn thousands to his church, it's also planted seeds of doubt among other followers, like Paula Greene. PAULA GREENE: I got so upset. I was crying. PFLEGER: When Greene first encountered Locke's sermons on Facebook over a year ago, she liked his preaching style. But that changed as his message went from religious to political, culminating in the service where he said people can't wear masks. Greene has an autoimmune disease and would have to wear one if she attended. GREENE: And I prayed immediately. God, lead me. PFLEGER: She remembers turning off the livestream dismayed. GREENE: We're in a time right now that we are uncertain of, so I'm praying for discernment. Is this somebody that is wrong for me to follow? God has not laid on my heart to watch another service of his. PFLEGER: She says she was searching for a shepherd, not someone who would lead her astray. For NPR News, I'm Paige Pfleger in Nashville.

TV cameras picked up a German cycling official yelling a racial slur during the men's time trial Wednesday at the Tokyo Olympics, prompting an apology from the official and a reaction from at least two of the cyclists involved. Patrick Moster, sporting director of the German cycling federation, apologized shortly after he was recorded using a racial slur while cheering on German cyclist Nikias Arndt. At the time, Arndt was trying to catch rival riders from Algeria and Eritrea. Looking on, Moster shouted, \"Get the camel drivers\" several times, according to Deutsche Welle. Journalist Florian Nass, a commentator on the race for broadcaster ARD, immediately condemned Moster's remarks, saying, \"Words fail me.\" Words did not fail Algeria's Azzedine Lagab, one of the riders Arndt was chasing. \"Well, There is no camel race in #olympics,\" Lagab said, \"that's why I came to cycling.\" He added, \"At least I was there in #Tokyo2020.\" Well, There is no camel \ud83d\udc2a race in #olympics that\u2019s why I came to cycling. At least I was there in #Tokyo2020 After the race, Arndt said via Twitter, \"I am appalled\" by the sporting director's language, calling the slur unacceptable. Arndt added that the remarks fell far short of the Olympics' \u2014 and his own \u2014 values of tolerance, respect and fairness. In his apology, Moster said, \"In the heat of the moment and with the overall burden that we have here at the moment, my choice of words was not appropriate,\" according to a translation reported by Deutsche Welle. He added, \"I am extremely sorry and can only offer my sincere apologies.\" Reacting to the incident, Alfons H\u00f6rmann, president of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, or DOSB, stressed that the national team stands for the same Olympic values Arndt cited. He also pledged to have a personal talk with Moster immediately to discuss the situation, according to a statement from the cycling federation, BDR. H\u00f6rmann has been coping with his own troubles at the DOSB, which has been embroiled in a leadership crisis since an anonymous letter \u2014 widely believed to come from the confederation's staff \u2014 accused him of overseeing a toxic workplace culture. An ethics panel recently recommended elections to choose a new president, and H\u00f6rmann, bowing to pressure, announced he would not run.",

Federal authorities on Wednesday issued a pair of new guidance documents to states and voters to remind them of their responsibilities \u2014 and their rights. The moves are part of the Biden administration's push to demonstrate it is on guard amid new voting restrictions proposed and enacted by Republican-led states across the nation \u2014 and as Democratic-led federal voting legislation has stalled in Congress. \"We are keeping a close eye on what's going on around the country,\" said a Justice Department official, who requested anonymity to brief reporters. \"If they're going to conduct these so-called audits, they have to comply with federal law.\" The first document makes clear that states are required to preserve election materials, such as ballots, without damage or destruction, for 22 months following a federal election. That's a heightened concern for U.S. authorities after Arizona lawmakers hired a private contractor with no election-related experience to perform a review. In May, the Justice Department sent a warning letter to Arizona's Republican state Senate leaders, who initiated the review, explaining the state's duties under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and warning that a plan to have contractors go door to door to question voters could run afoul of other laws that prohibit voter intimidation. The leader of Arizona's state Senate replied that the proposal to ask residents about their voting history was on hold \u2014 but it's recently been floated again. Since its letter to Arizona officials, the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department has had conversations with other jurisdictions, the DOJ official said. The official wouldn't comment on any open investigations in Arizona or elsewhere. Former President Donald Trump has been exhorting Republican state officials to perform audits of the 2020 election, baselessly claiming the vote was rigged. His attorney general said there was no widespread fraud last year, and his cybersecurity czar called the election \"the most secure in American history.\" In other guidance, authorities also want to make clear that states that reverse changes they made to accommodate voters during the pandemic will get no \"safe harbor\" from the Justice Department if the backsliding is motivated by discrimination or has a discriminatory effect. \"We didn't want to sort of give jurisdictions or think jurisdictions should have a safe harbor to say, 'Because we ran our voting system this way before the pandemic, we're free to go back to that,' even if going back to that has a racially discriminatory impact or even if going back to that is, in part, motivated by racial reasons,\" the official said. The Justice Department official continued: \"You should not assume if you abandon the practices that have made it easier for people to vote, that abandonment is not going to get scrutiny from the Department of Justice.\" In June, the department sued the state of Georgia, saying its controversial new election measure is intended to restrict ballot access to Black voters. But this month the U.S. Supreme Court imposed new roadblocks for authorities who want to use the remaining tool to police discrimination in voting under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. Experts said the court's ruling in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, which gives states new leeway to restrict some voting access, will complicate the Justice Department challenge and many others. Earlier this week, the Civil Rights Division weighed in with a statement of interest in a separate case the NAACP filed against Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who's defended the new law. The federal lawyers said the NAACP is advancing plausible allegations of discrimination when it claims Georgia is making it harder to cast early and absentee ballots and when it \"bars efforts to reduce the discomfort of voters waiting hours in lines prevalent in heavily minority precincts on Election Day.\" Those amount to \"sizeable\" burdens, more than mere inconvenience, the Justice Department brief said. \"Whether through litigation or the issuance of official guidance, we are using every tool in our arsenal to ensure that all eligible citizens can exercise their right to vote free from intimidation, and have their ballots counted,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement Wednesday.",

There's an inescapable tension in the upcoming Democratic primary for Ohio's 11th Congressional District. On the one hand, there are voters making personal, locally informed decisions about whom to support. DeWayne Williams, for example, says he will support Nina Turner, a former state senator and co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign. \"[She's] definitely got my vote, you know, my family vote. You know, my mom, a couple of older people have supported her throughout the years,\" said Williams, who got to talk to (and fist-bump) Turner through his car window at a gas station. Turner had come to campaign in the rain, during a religious organization's gasoline giveaway. And then there are people from outside the district, like David Crow, who was just down the block from the gas station, blasting funk music from a van decorated with progressive slogans (\"Healthcare is a human right\") and a cutout of Turner's head. Crow is originally from Seattle, and had gotten the van in 2015 to support Sanders.\u200b \"I've actually worked my way up to where I'm actually a full-time activist at the moment,\" he said. \"What I call myself is the 'road crew for the revolution.' \" It's not unusual for congressional elections to be fueled by outside actors \u2014 national parties, activists, political action committees. But between Turner's preexisting political celebrity status, the way the race mirrors internal Democratic Party fights, the high-profile endorsements, the money pouring into the district, and the simple fact that few other congressional elections are underway right now, this one Democratic primary has made the 11th district feel awfully crowded as Election Day approaches. There are 13 Democratic candidates on the ballot to replace Marcia Fudge, a former Ohio representative who became President Biden's housing secretary this year. Turner was the early front-runner, bringing in more than $2 million in the first few months of the year. But in recent months, the local Democratic Party chairwoman, Shontel Brown, has very much made it a two-person contest. And in this solidly blue district, the Democratic primary winner will likely hold the seat. Ohio 11th district candidate Shontel Brown is seen during a campaign stop at Angel Falls Coffee shop in Akron on July 14.\n                \n                    \n                    Mike Cardew/USA Today Network via Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ohio 11th district candidate Shontel Brown is seen during a campaign stop at Angel Falls Coffee shop in Akron on July 14. Many voters in the district have a keen sense of the seat's history \u2014 like the fact that Black women have held it since 1999. Some, like Iris Johnston, a former Cleveland school principal, invoked the district's past representatives in the process of explaining their votes. \"I grew up with Stephanie Tubbs Jones, so I knew her as an individual, and I think Shontel has more personality than any other candidate that's running,\" Johnston said at a candidate forum where she saw Brown speak. Johnston said her top issue is local public safety and policing. Several voters also talked about personally knowing or having met Brown and Turner over their years in politics. In addition to being a state senator, Turner ran for secretary of state in 2014. Brown, meanwhile, has been a local city council member and is currently on the Cuyahoga County Council. But Turner also brought national recognition into the race, from her time on the Sanders campaign. And that means her statements from that time \u2014 like her sharp criticisms of Biden \u2014 have become a key attack point for Brown, who stresses themes of cooperation and bipartisanship on the trail. All of this has helped the contest become much more than a local race. It can also be seen as a microcosm of the national Democratic Party, with its conflicts between liberal and moderate, outsider and establishment. Those political axes are also apparent in some voters' explanations of their choices. John Newman spoke about his top issue, just after he voted early.\u200b \"Medicare for All is a real big one for me, because I just don't believe that we can just watch people just die. I just don't understand,\" he said. He also associated Brown with the Democratic establishment, something he referred to as \"corrupt.\" Johnston, for her part, referenced Democratic politics in supporting Brown. \"I see it turning that way, more and more progressive, because you got the more radical Democrats that want things done right away, and everything can't get done right away,\" she said. \"We have to take baby steps before we can run.\" Brown has her own help from outside the state in trying to win the seat. Mike Insel and two other young men, all of them from Maryland, had been out canvassing for Brown.\u200b \"I like that she's pro-Israel,\" said Insel, who identifies as Jewish. \"I like that she's not trying to be a member of the Squad,\" he added, referring to the progressive group of Democratic U.S. House members. Outside groups have been fueling this race. One PAC, the Democratic Majority for Israel, has bought ads supporting Brown and opposing Turner, who has tweeted in support of Palestinians and criticized Israel. Solidarity is a verb \u270a\ud83c\udffe https://t.co/Kupgdtuqey The Congressional Black Caucus PAC has also backed Brown. Meanwhile, progressive PACs like the Working Families Party have supported Turner. A slate of progressive politicians are also backing Turner \u2014 Sanders, of course, as well as members of the Squad. Brown has an array of establishment endorsements, including House Majority Whip James Clyburn and Hillary Clinton \u2014 not to mention Fudge's mom. Today, Marcia Fudge\u2019s mother endorsed Shontel Brown for Congress #OH11 https://t.co/5Ts6b3VpUB In interviews, both candidates resisted the framing of this race as liberal versus moderate, or as anti-establishment versus establishment. \"What people are asking about, they're not asking about who's moderate and who's progressive; they're not asking people to lay out their Democratic bona fides,\" Turner said. \"They really want to know who is going to go to Congress and fight to change the material conditions.\" Brown said that political stances can be subjective. \"If you ask someone that's a little bit farther to the right, they may say I'm a progressive,\" she said. \"If you ask someone who's a little more further to the left, they'll say I'm a moderate.\" And yet, the candidates do invoke those dynamics on the trail, in the swipes they take at each other. While taping a podcast with a local businesswoman, Turner used the words of path-breaking former politician Shirley Chisholm. \"I am an unbought and unbossed woman. And sometimes that offends people, something that it does. People are bumping up against me right now because I don't play by the rules,\" she said. \"I'm gonna write the rules. I'm not going to play by your rules. And these are the same people who don't understand that unless you bump up, change does not happen.\" Brown, meanwhile, digs at Turner for her past outspokenness, with Brown casting herself as a consensus-builder.\u200b\u200b \"If you're looking at someone who has been more focused on headway than headlines, then yes, I think those are the things that make me different from the other candidate,\" she said in an interview. For all the national attention, this could be a low-turnout race \u2014 a special election, in early August, during a pandemic, and also competing for attention with an upcoming Cleveland mayoral race. Not that it's going to quiet down. Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are scheduled to campaign for Turner. Clyburn will be going to the area this weekend for Brown.",

His departure leaves the city asking what he accomplished and what it wants in its next leader.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, may soon trade one metropolis for another - New Delhi. President Biden has nominated him to be ambassador to India. And if confirmed, Garcetti would depart office more than a year ahead of schedule. KPCC's Libby Denkmann reports on the mayor's unfinished business here. LIBBY DENKMANN, BYLINE: Homelessness - that's issue No. 1. The population of unhoused people in Los Angeles has escalated to record numbers under Mayor Garcetti's watch. Nathaly Medina is an attorney with the Eviction Defense Network. She's just come out of the Stanley Mosk Superior Courthouse in downtown LA. NATHALY MEDINA: This is one of the first days of trial. We haven't called the jury yet. DENKMANN: She says in the face of pandemic-era holds on federal, state and local evictions for non-payment of rent, landlords got creative. Harassment cases and illegal lockouts have multiplied. MEDINA: Oh, a lot of cases having to do with parking, right? They take away a parking spot, and then the tenant parks in the parking spot, and so they're violating their lease. DENKMANN: For Medina, it's an example of the way LA leaders like Garcetti have allowed low-income Angelenos to shoulder the brunt of COVID-19. MEDINA: I think it's a travesty that Mayor Garcetti is leaving now. His promises have been just completely been unmet. NURY MARTINEZ: No, I don't think it's fair. I think, you know, there's criticism from both sides on this issue. DENKMANN: City Council President Nury Martinez will become the temporary acting mayor once Garcetti steps down. Soon afterwards, the city council is expected to vote to appoint an interim mayor to complete the rest of the term through 2022. Martinez points out that the city recently passed an ordinance to allow tenants to sue landlords for many types of harassment. And city residents facing financial hardship because of the pandemic can apply to have their rent debt wiped away. MARTINEZ: So at every step of the way, we're trying to fill these gaps. DENKMANN: When Garcetti first took office in 2013, he pledged to be a pro-business Democrat and usher in prosperity after the Great Recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: These times demand a back-to-basics mayor, focused above all on our economy and on jobs. DENKMANN: The worsening housing crunch that would feed a massive growth in homelessness was barely on the radar. This year, Garcetti budgeted nearly $1 billion to get people off the street - nearly seven times what he allocated in his first term. Another issue that's come to dominate Garcetti's agenda - reckoning with police reform and accountability in the wake of George Floyd's murder. ISAAC BRYAN: The Garcetti administration fell short on some things that the community in Los Angeles still needs a lot of close attention paid to. DENKMANN: Democratic Assemblyman Isaac Bryan says the mayor failed to adequately address racial justice advocates' calls to redirect funding from the LAPD towards alternatives, like mental health care and community-based conflict intervention. Last summer, the mayor backed a $150 million cut to police spending. But Garcetti's latest budget increased LAPD funding by about 3%. BRYAN: We have to start investing in the kinds of systems of care and opportunity that uplift from the bottom and don't exacerbate those root conditions. And we need a mayor who understands that. DENKMANN: Garcetti's ambassadorship confirmation could take several months to grind its way through the Senate. The free-for-all mayoral primary is set for next June, with the general election in November. Whoever wins will face the same entrenched problems of homelessness and LAPD funding. And just like Garcetti eight years ago, they'll have to restore LA's economy, this time after an historic pandemic. For NPR News, I'm Libby Denkmann in Los Angeles. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

Adams has won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. NEW YORK \u2014 Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams has won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City after appealing to the political center and promising to strike the right balance between fighting crime and ending racial injustice in policing. A former police captain, Adams would be the city's second Black mayor if elected. He triumphed over a large field in New York's first major race to use ranked choice voting. Adams' closest vanquished rivals included former city sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia, who campaigned as a technocrat and proven problem-solver, and former City Hall legal advisor Maya Wiley, who had progressive support including an endorsement from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Andrew Yang, the 2020 presidential candidate known for his proposed universal basic income, was an early favorite but faded in the race. Voting in the primary ended June 22. Early returns showed Adams in the lead, but New Yorkers had to wait for tens of thousands of absentee ballots to be counted and for rounds of tabulations done under the new ranked choice system. Under the system, voters ranked up to five candidates for mayor in order of preference. Candidates with too few votes to win were eliminated and ballots cast for them redistributed to the surviving contenders, based on the voter preference, until only two were left. The city's first experience with the system in a major election was bumpy. As votes were being tallied on June 29, elections officials bungled the count by inadvertently including 135,000 old test ballots. Erroneous vote tallies were posted for several hours before officials acknowledged the error and took them down. The mistake had no impact on the final outcome of the race. A New York City Board of Election staff member counts absentee ballots in the primary election on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mary Altaffer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A New York City Board of Election staff member counts absentee ballots in the primary election on Friday. Adams will be the prohibitive favorite in the general election against Curtis Sliwa, the Republican founder of the Guardian Angels. Democrats outnumber Republicans 7-to-1 in New York City. Adams, 60, is a moderate Democrat who opposed the \"defund the police\" movement. \"We're not going to recover as a city if we turn back time and see an increase in violence, particularly gun violence,\" Adams said after three people including a 4-year-old girl were shot and wounded in Times Square in May. \"If Black lives really matter, it can't only be against police abuse. It has to be against the violence that's ripping apart our communities,\" he told supporters the night of the primary. But Adams is a study in contradictions who at different times has been a defender of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a registered Republican and a Democratic state senator thriving in a world of backroom deals. Adams speaks frequently of his dual identity as a 22-year police veteran and a Black man who endured police brutality himself as a teenager. He said he was beaten by officers at age 15. Adams became a police officer in 1984 and rose to the rank of captain before leaving to run for the state Senate in 2006. While in the police department, he co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, a group that campaigned for criminal justice reform and against racial profiling. After winning a state Senate seat from Brooklyn in 2006, Adams made an impression with an impassioned speech favoring same-sex marriage rights in 2009, two years before New York's state legislators passed a marriage equality bill. Adams also weathered a few controversies, including a 2010 report from the state inspector general that faulted his oversight of the bidding process to bring casino gambling to the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. Adams had accepted campaign contributions from a politically connected group bidding for the gambling franchise. Adams was elected in 2013 as Brooklyn borough president, his current job. Adams is a vegan who credits a plant-based diet with reversing his diabetes. He has a 25-year-old son, Jordan Coleman, with a former girlfriend. His current partner is Tracey Collins, an educator who holds an administrative job in the city's public school system. Journalists raised questions during the race about where Adams lived. He was born in Brooklyn, walked the beat there as a cop, owns real estate there and represented it in the state Senate. But he slept in his office in Brooklyn Borough Hall for months during the pandemic and opponents noted that he shares a place with his partner in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Adams gave reporters a tour of a basement apartment in Brooklyn that he said was his primary residence. Adams can be a charismatic speaker but has also said cringe-worthy utterances, such as his 1993 suggestion that Herman Badillo, a Puerto Rican-born politician, should have married a Latina instead of a white, Jewish woman. Speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event last year, Adams complained about gentrifiers moving to the city from elsewhere. \"Go back to Iowa.

Eight years after carving the heart out of a landmark voting rights law, the U.S. Supreme Court put new limits on efforts to combat racial discrimination in voting.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt York/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maricopa County, Ariz., elections officials count ballots on Nov. 4 in Phoenix. Eight years after carving the heart out of a landmark voting rights law, the U.S. Supreme Court put new limits on efforts to combat racial discrimination in voting. The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday gutted most of what remains of the landmark Voting Rights Act. The court's decision, while leaving some protections involving redistricting in place, left close to a dead letter the law once hailed as the most effective civil rights legislation in the nation's history. The 6-3 vote was along ideological  lines, with Justice Samuel Alito writing the decision for the court's conservative majority, and the liberals in angry dissent. At issue in the case were two Arizona laws: one banned the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a relative or caregiver, and the other threw out any ballots cast in the wrong precinct. A federal appeals court struck down both provisions, ruling that they had an unequal impact on minority voters and that there was no evidence of fraud that would have justified their use. But on Thursday, the Supreme Court reinstated the state laws, declaring that unequal impact on minorities in this context was relatively minor, that other states have similar laws and that states don't have to wait for fraud to occur before enacting laws to prevent it. Just because voting may be \"inconvenient for some,\" Alito wrote, doesn't mean that access to voting is unequal. In evaluating what the Voting Rights Act requires, said Alito, courts should look to what the voting rules were in 1982, when the relevant provision of the law was enacted. Back then, he observed, almost all voting was in person and on Election Day. And \"the mere fact that there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.\" \"Justice Alito was trying to turn back the clock on voting rights many decades,\" said Richard Hasen, a leading expert on voting rights and law professor at University of California Irvine. \"I think it's fair to say that all of the major paths to challenging voting rules in federal court have been severely cut back.\" Election law expert Richard Pildes, of NYU Law School added that the court could have upheld the Arizona laws in a narrow way, as the Biden administration had suggested, but the conservative court majority swung for the fences. In his majority opinion, Justice Alito wrote that laws likely do not violate the law when they  are like laws that existed forty years ago or like laws that exist today in many states. But, Pildes said, access to the ballot has expanded in recent decades. \"Very early voting began in the mid-2000s, and the move to no-excuse absentee balloting began kind of earlier than that,\" said Pildes. \"That's a very significant development that's really made the process much more accessible to more people.\" Writing the dissent, Justice Elena Kagan accused the majority of \"yet again\" rewriting the Voting Right Act, a law, she noted, was designed to bring about \"the end of discrimination in voting.\" \"Never before has a statute done more to advance the nation's highest ideals,\" she said. \"Few laws are more vital in the current moment. Yet in the last decade this Court has treated no statute worse.\" The Voting Rights Act \"confronted one of this country's most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy,\" wrote Kagan. \"That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this court.\" The landmark law, widely hailed as the most effective piece of civil rights legislation in the nation's history, was reauthorized five times after its original passage in 1965, but for all practical purposes, all that is left of it now is the section banning vote dilution in redistricting based on race, and the ban on intentional discrimination, which generally applies to only the most egregious forms of discrimination. Eight years ago, the court by a 5-4 majority gutted the law's key provision, which until then required state and local governments with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get  federal approval prior to making  any changes in voting procedures. When that provision was struck down by the court in 2013, the only protections for voting rights that remained in the law were in Section 2. Though Section 2 has largely been used to prevent minority vote dilution in redistricting, importantly, it does bar voting procedures that \"result in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" So the Arizona case was viewed as particularly important because it was the first time the court dealt with a claim of vote denial under Section 2 and how to evaluate it. \"This Court has no right to remake Section 2,\" Kagan wrote in her dissent. \"Maybe some think that vote suppression is a relic of history \u2014 and so the need for a potent Section 2 has come and gone ... But Congress gets to make that call.\" Arizona Republicans and the Republican National Committee argued that both laws were needed to prevent fraud. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there was no record of fraud and that there was evidence these two provisions ended up denying many minorities the right to vote. The appeals court noted, for instance, that ballot collectors were needed in some large, rural and remote parts of the state. It pointed, for instance to the Navajo Nation, an area the size of West Virginia, where there are few post offices or postal routes, and where people without cars often have no way to send their ballots without collectors picking them up. The high court, however, rejected the lower court findings \u2014 and reaction to Thursday's opinion was along partisan lines. President Biden, in a statement, said he was \"deeply disappointed in today's decision by the United States Supreme Court that undercuts the Voting Rights Act.\" \"After all we have been through to deliver the promise of this Nation to all Americans, we should be fully enforcing voting rights laws, not weakening them,\" he said. \"Yet this decision comes just over a week after Senate Republicans blocked even a debate \u2013 even consideration \u2013 of the For the People Act that would have protected the right to vote from action by Republican legislators in states across the country.\" The ruling will now add pressure on Democrats in the Senate to try to find a way to enact a new voting rights law. \"This decision,\" said Debo Adegbile, a longtime civil rights lawyer, \"makes a powerful argument that Congress must use the full force of its powers to protect minority voters and keep the path to the ballot box open.\" But voting rights advocates are caught between a Supreme Court hostile to voting rights and a Republican party that has abandoned its one-time support for voting rights. \"We've seen a sea change in the Republican Party's attitude towards the Voting Rights Act,\" said professor Hasen. \"As the Republican party becomes more reliant on white voters, it has less of an incentive to support any renewed voting rights protections.\" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said on Twitter: \"We are fighting against the most concerted state-based effort to undermine Black voting strength since the Civil Rights Mvmt. And in that context, the Supreme Court has again, & w/abandon, shredded a core provision of the Voting Rights Act.\" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who defended the state law, said on Twitter, \"I am thankful the justices upheld states' ability to pass and maintain commonsense election laws, at a time when our country needs it most.\" Arizona, of course, has been ground zero for former President Donald Trump's claims that the election was stolen, and a Trump-inspired audit has taken place there. The attempt to undo the certification of the election results has been widely discredited, even by some Republican officials, and is meaningless because the state's electoral votes were long ago certified for Biden. The court's decision could play an important role in next year's midterm elections and elections thereafter. Many Republican-dominated states have passed laws far more problematic than the two at stake in Arizona. Indeed, the U.S. Justice Department, in a statement, said: \"The department remains strongly committed to challenging discriminatory election laws and will continue to use every legal tool available to protect all qualified Americans seeking to participate in the electoral process. The department urges Congress to enact additional legislation to provide more effective protection for every American's right to vote.\" Thursday's decision complicates the department's decision to sue the state of Georgia over its new voting law, alleging that the measure is intended to restrict ballot access to Black voters. The two laws at the center of Thursday's case are not unusual. Other states have enacted limits on absentee ballot collectors, especially when fraudulent practices have been uncovered. Although the 9th Circuit found no evidence of fraud in the Arizona election system, problems with absentee ballot collection systems have occurred elsewhere. Perhaps the most prominent example came in 2018 in North Carolina when a Republican vote collection and tampering scandal resulted in a new congressional election being ordered for one district. In the wake of Trump's false allegations that Democrats stole the 2020 election, many states, particularly those controlled by Republicans, have sought to change voting laws in a way that critics say is aimed at curtailing the right to vote, particularly among minorities. Last month, the Brennan Center for Justice reported that 22 new voting laws had been enacted and 389 proposed in 48 states just since the 2020 election. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill, H.R.1, that would have set federal standards and overridden voter suppression provisions across the country, but in the Senate, opponents blocked consideration of the bill. The laws that the court ruled on Thursday are not unique, and some Democrats consequently thought that challenging them risked a decision that would make it harder to challenge other restrictions in the future. But former Democratic Party Chairman Tom Perez maintained that the situation in Arizona was different because of the huge rural areas without Postal Service. At the same time, GOP lawyers defending the laws candidly admitted during the oral argument in the case that the Republican Legislature's motive in enacting the Arizona voting restrictions was less anti-fraud and more political. Not having such restrictions \"puts us at a competitive disadvantage,\" lawyer Michael Carvin said on behalf of the GOP. \"Politics is a zero-sum game, and every law they get through an unlawful interpretations of Section 2 hurts us.\" Still, the court's decision is likely to increase pressure further on Biden and congressional Democrats to pass voting reform legislation. Those efforts have stalled, both because of Republican opposition as well as a lack of support from Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who says he believes the legislation under consideration is far too sweeping. Manchin has proposed his own compromise version of the measure, but it's unclear if he can get 10 Republicans to sign on to that proposal. Under current rules, Democrats need all 50 of their own senators as well as 10 Republicans to pass the measure.",

Trump won over many white conservative Christians by wrapping their traditional priorities in with his own particular cultural fixations.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump attends a worship service in Las Vegas when he was a presidential candidate in 2016. Trump won over many white conservative Christians by wrapping their traditional priorities in with his own particular cultural fixations. When Ronald Reagan accepted the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, he ended his speech with a pious request. \"I'll confess that I've been a little afraid to suggest what I'm going to suggest \u2014 I'm more afraid not to \u2014 that we begin our crusade joined together in a moment of silent prayer,\" he said. It was the preface to a presidency that would help make white evangelicals the staunchly Republican voting bloc they are today. Fast-forward to a 2015 campaign event, when Republican consultant Frank Luntz worked to pin down soon-to-be-President Donald Trump on a simple question of faith: \"Have you ever asked God for forgiveness?\" Luntz asked Trump twice, before getting this answer: \"I'm not sure I have. I just go and try and do a better job from there. I don't think so.\" Trump benefited from the white evangelical support that Reagan helped solidify, but he also presided over a country that, religiously, looks far different from the one Reagan took over after 1980. Trump's presidency is one early case study in how the Republican Party \u2014 which has long associated itself with conservative Christian values \u2014 may attempt to deal with a country that's less and less religious. In fact, the U.S. recently passed a religious milestone: For the first time, a majority of Americans are not church members, Gallup found this spring. Over the last decade, the share of Republicans who are church members fell from 75% to 65%, according to Gallup. That's a solid majority but also a sizable fall. The key bloc of white evangelicals is also shrinking as a share of the population, while the share of religiously unaffiliated Americans grows. This makes religion one key part of a looming, long-term demographic challenge for Republicans, says Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. \"Republicans clearly have a stronger hold among the religiously affiliated, especially evangelical Protestants. And consequently, any decline in evangelical Protestant affiliation is not good news for the GOP,\" he said. The upshot, to Ayres, is that a party still deeply entwined with conservative Christianity and, particularly, white evangelicals will eventually have to win over more Christian conservatives \u2014 for example, among the growing Hispanic electorate \u2014 or make gains among substantially less-religious groups, like young voters. A change in tone For now, it's fair to say that in the Republican Party, overtly religious rhetoric is being replaced by broader culture war issues, Ayres said. \"While religiosity may be declining, people attracted to culturally conservative causes may not be \u2014 cancel culture, TV shows and movies that exalt more left-wing values, that cast aspersions on right-wing values,\" he said. That dovetails with another trend in American politics \u2014 of people increasingly centering their identities on their partisan affiliations. It's a trend that can give pastors headaches that have nothing to do with whether church attendance is rising or falling. Christian Gaffney, pastor at Expectation Church in Fairfax, Va., says congregation members have pushed back when he has preached about things like masks, as well as race. Gaffney said that conflict arises for him when congregants center their lives on their partisan identities rather than their Christian beliefs. \"I think it goes back to the idea of culture wars \u2014 the idea that everything is so polarized \u2014 and because there's this trajectory of polarization, Trump kind of gives a lightning rod for one of those poles, one of those sides to really rally around and adhere to,\" he said. \"My job as a pastor is to show people it's not about rallying around either side; it's about rallying around the person Jesus Christ.\" Though he considers himself conservative, Gaffney said that right-leaning congregation members have accused him of being \"liberal\" when he has questioned Republican orthodoxy. Christianity vs. Christian culture Gaffney's church has been growing. But on the whole, the shrinking American Christian church may, counterintuitively, tighten the bond between the Republican Party and conservative Christianity. \"These kinds of data about the shrinking share of the population of white evangelicals or declines in church membership actually intensify the relationship [between the GOP and conservative Christians],\" said Sarah Posner, author of two books critical of white evangelicals' politics. \"As those numbers shrink, the demography is not in [the GOP's] favor. And so intensifying their relationship becomes ever more important, in terms of winning elections and so forth,\" she said. Through statements like saying he had never asked for forgiveness, as well as infamously referring to the biblical book typically called Second Corinthians as \"Two Corinthians,\" Trump showed that he didn't have the churchgoing bona fides of rivals like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who invoked God regularly at his campaign events. Indeed, Trump early in the 2016 primaries appealed more to Republicans who identified as Christian but weren't regular churchgoers. More observant Republican Christians preferred Cruz. But Trump did eventually win over stauncher Christian conservatives. In the process, he wrapped more traditionally conservative Christian issues like abortion in with his own particular cultural fixations, such as race and grievance politics. At this point, Posner added, Christianity and politics can be so muddled together on the right that they can be hard to separate. \"There is an entire constellation of organizations and media and social media and other ways of getting these ideas, ideas about what it means to be a Christian, what it means to be an American, what it means to be an American Christian, what it means to be a patriot, what it means to fight the left or cancel culture,\" she said. Jackson Avery, president of the College Republicans at George Mason University and a Christian himself, said he doesn't hear his fellow young Republicans talking a lot about their faith, but he nevertheless thinks maintaining a Christian identity is good for the party. \"I don't think the Republican Party saying, 'We are not the party of not only the Christians, but atheists' \u2014 I think that drives away more people. You know, you only need enough percentage to win,\" he said. He believes that the GOP won't hit its Reagan-era heights again but also suggests it may not need to, at least in the short term. \"There's this idea where like they go back to Ronald Reagan, where he gets like 60% of the popular vote,\" Avery added. \"Republicans will never, never get that, at least in our lifetimes. I don't think so.\"",

Support for Black Lives Matter surged after protests following George Floyd's death. Activists charge that disparaging posts targeting BLM are part of an overall effort to undermine the movement and its message. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd died under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and protests erupted worldwide. Support for Black Lives Matter \u2014 the movement that actually began as a hashtag in 2013 \u2014 surged. To this day, posts on social media continue to call for racial justice and an end to police brutality. But also online are posts riddled with disinformation, including those specifically targeting BLM.  Activists charge that those disparaging posts are part of an overall effort to undermine the movement and its message. One post, for example, falsely claims the government has identified it as a terrorist group. Another that circulated widely claimed that BLM activists had badly beaten a group of elderly white people. That post was debunked by fact checkers who found the photos were of South Africans and had been online for years. It was removed, however Jorden Giger, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in South Bend, Ind., says there's still plenty of disinformation online designed to create confusion and distrust. \"Like reports circulating that BLM is going to vandalize businesses in downtown areas, that we are targeting specific, you know, white communities, those kinds of things,\" he says. \" It makes our supporters say, 'OK, I don't want to get involved in that.' Right? So when those kinds of lies and when the disinformation just goes unchecked, you know, folks will believe it, if you don't get ahead of it or respond to it appropriately.\" Giger says that's why BLM launched an effort to stop disinformation and urges people to submit details about suspicious posts or stories to the Black Lives Matter website. WinBlack/Pa'lante, a nonpartisan group created after the 2016 presidential election, also monitors disinformation aimed at people of color. Hundreds of organizers across the country formed a digital war room during last year's election. They tracked bots that automatically send out scripted disinformation, often from Russia or other foreign governments trying to sow discord in the U.S. They tracked what are known as digital blackface accounts that steal images to masquerade as Black people and spread disinformation. Ashley Bryant, one of the co-leaders of WinBlack/Pa'lante, says they also found conspiracy theories about Black Lives Matter. \"That went from George Floyd not being dead to, you know, George Soros funding protests and the full out attacks on BLM where there's foreign actors, there's fake accounts pretending to be Antifa \u2014 all to actually just build this violent narrative around BLM,\" she says. Deen Freelon, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina who studies digital politics, points to specific instances of disinformation about Black Lives Matter protesters engaging in violence. \"There was a false story about Black Lives Matter allied protesters setting fires in Oregon. So connecting to the wildfires there,\" he says. \"Also claims that Black Lives Matter is white-led and there has been some Spanish language disinformation.\" Freelon says Twitter has been vigilant about rooting out state-sponsored disinformation from foreign actors. Facebook says it's taken several steps, too, including working with nonpartisan and independent fact checkers to root out the spread of fake stories. Information proven to be false can be removed for violating social media standards. That's not the case when it comes to posts online that are technically considered an opinion-- that's harder to combat. \"Examples there include things like the notion that BLM is anti white, which, of course, is an opinion, that it is a hate group,\" Freelon says. \"That it's somehow anti-family, that it is morally equivalent to far-right groups, and then there are some things that kind of blur the line between fact and opinion.\" Critics of Black Lives Matters, like Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, says its the movement's supporters that are getting duped. \"I feel that Black Lives Matter is one of the greatest sources of disinformation,\" says Gonzalez, who is the author of an upcoming book on the organization and Marxism. \"They have good Americans, good Americans, well intentioned Americans who do not want to see racial injustice, and rightly so, putting up signs on their lawn about Black Lives Matter,\" he says.  \"They (BLM) have manipulated the good nature of many people who think what they're doing, in my view, is trying to promote a philosophy that is not going to be good for this country, will destroy this country and will destroy our way of life.\" And then right-wing pundits such as Rudy Giuliani, Candace Owens and Carol Swain amplify often baseless anti-BLM messages to wider audiences. On a Fox News talk show last July, Giuliani said, \"Black Lives Matter wants to come and take your house away from you. They want to take your property away from you.\" Patrisse Khan Cullors is one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter Movement.\n                \n                    \n                    Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Patrisse Khan Cullors is one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter Movement. On a YouTube show the following day, Swain said, \"They (BLM) are using Black people to advance a Marxist agenda.\" During her Twitter video post, Candace Owens described BLM protesters as \"far left crazy Antifa thugs who know exactly what they're doing.\" Patrisse Khan-Cullors, one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter, responds to some of that on her YouTube channel. \"I need to set the record straight. Am I a Marxist?\" she asks. Khan-Cullors explains that she does believe in Marxism but laughs at online comments that say she's pushing a communist agenda. \"I am working on making sure that people don't suffer,\" she says. \"I am working to make sure that people don't go hungry and these comments I've received have been incredibly hurtful. It means that some people aren't taking the work of BLM seriously.\" Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, says some of the disinformation surrounding Black Lives Matter could be from the old-style, anti-civil rights playbook of the 1960s. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover and segregationists repeatedly used disinformation in an attempt to besmirch that movement. \"So opponents characterized activists as lawbreakers or as violent when overwhelmingly they were nonviolent,\" Brown-Nagin says. \"Also Martin Luther King Jr. and members of his inner circle were said to be communists or communist sympathizers.\" Just as the civil rights movement of past years, Black Lives Matter has seen its support both rise and decline after months of protest and the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin. While polls show a large majority of African Americans continue to back the movement \u2014 overall support has dropped from record levels seen after Floyd's death. How much of that loss is due to disinformation is difficult to measure but what's certain is the battle over controlling what people believe about Black Lives Matter and its influence is ongoing.",

The banner reads \"Lapid or Netanyahu.\" Spray paint on Netanyahu's portrait reads, \"Go home.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Oded Balilty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption An election campaign billboard for the Likud party shows its leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left), and opposition party leader Yair Lapid, in Ramat Gan, Israel, days before that country's election in March. The banner reads \"Lapid or Netanyahu.\" Spray paint on Netanyahu's portrait reads, \"Go home.\" JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday tapped centrist opposition figure Yair Lapid to try to form a new government, sparking potentially weeks of political negotiations that could break Israel's cycle of inconclusive elections and lead to the end of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's record-breaking uninterrupted 12-year tenure. But there are \"many difficulties\" to forming a new government, Rivlin acknowledged, leaving open the possibility of an unprecedented fifth election in the span of two years. Netanyahu spent a month trying to form a right-wing governing coalition following March elections, but it required the support of an Arab Islamist party, which one of his ultranationalist Jewish political partners refused to accept. After Netanyahu failed to assemble a parliamentary majority by a midnight deadline late Tuesday, nearly half the parliament gave its support to Lapid, a 57-year-old former journalist and finance minister who has served in the opposition for the last six years. Lapid said he would seek to form a unity government of ideologically diverse parties, ending \"two years of political paralysis\" in which Netanyahu struggled to win a new term after four inconclusive elections. \"A unity government isn't a compromise or a last resort. It's a goal, it's what we need,\" Lapid said in a statement. He is offering to share power with the right-wing Naftali Bennett, a religious Jew and former defense minister, even letting him serve as prime minister first in a rotation. Such a government would require Jewish parties from the left, right and center to cooperate and to accept the support of an Arab party as well. One of Bennett's party members has rejected the notion of cooperating with the left wing, and Bennett, a former entrepreneur, must weigh the risks of upsetting his voters with such a broad coalition. \"It now depends if Bennett is serious about change,\" said veteran political consultant Ayelet Frisch. \"Almost all the details [of the coalition] have been finalized. The ministries have already been divided between the parties.\" Yohanan Plesner, president of the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute think tank, said the parties' common desire to unseat Netanyahu could outweigh differences of ideology. He suggested such a government would not weigh in on sensitive questions such as the power of Israel's Supreme Court or the future of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, but rather would focus on the post-pandemic economy. \"I think we are on the way there,\" Plesner said. Netanyahu tried to delegitimize that option. \"The truth is simple. This will be a dangerous left-wing government, a lethal combination between a lack of a path, a lack of capability and lack of responsibility,\" he said in a videotaped statement. If Lapid does not succeed in forming a government within a month, Israel's parliament, the 120-member Knesset, will have three weeks to suggest a prime ministerial candidate. If no candidate wins the support of the majority of the parliament, Israel would hold yet another election in several months. Sami Sockol in Jerusalem contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "The death toll in the pandemic continues to rise in India. Dozens of people have died in a stampede in Israel. Examining Kamala Harris's role in these first 100 days of the Biden administration.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: There was a time early in the pandemic when you'd hear people say at least the virus isn't spreading fast in India yet because the population there's so dense. That would be really bad. That is happening now, and it is indeed very bad. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: India broke its own record on Friday. It reported 386,000 new coronavirus cases in a day. The number of deaths is considered unreliable, but we know it's a lot. Crematoriums are so overloaded that crews in Delhi are converting a crematorium meant for dogs into one for people. MARTIN: NPR India correspondent Lauren Frayer is with us this morning from Mumbai. Lauren, thanks for being here. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So as we keep saying, the situation in India just keeps getting worse. Just describe to us the problem at this point. How bad is it? FRAYER: Yeah. I mean, just staggering case numbers more and more every day and deaths, almost certainly an undercount because whole towns here have virtually run out of test kits. People are dying at home unable to get care. We're still seeing severe shortages of ICU beds, medical oxygen, antiviral drugs. Crematoriums are overwhelmed, and social media has become this just flood of desperate pleas. Let me just play you an example. This is a young woman named Lavanya Sharma (ph) in Delhi, and she posted this clip of herself on Twitter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAVANYA SHARMA: Both my parents are COVID positive, and my mother urgently needs a ventilator. No one is there to help me. Please help. FRAYER: You can hear the desperation in her voice. And strangers come to one another's rescues on social media. Lavanya posted an update afterwards saying she actually got an ambulance for her mom. But it shows the breakdown of the health system here. And that is why the U.S. State Department is now telling Americans to leave India as soon as they can. MARTIN: India is actually one of the largest producers of COVID-19 vaccines, though, right? So how is their own vaccination campaign going? FRAYER: Yeah. About 10% of people here have had one dose. Less than 2% of the population have gotten both. Vaccine centers where I am here in Mumbai just shut down today abruptly for lack of supply. Theoretically, tomorrow, eligibility is supposed to open up to anyone over 18. But so many states have already said they don't have vaccines. And this is a big embarrassment for India because, as you said, it's the world's biggest vaccine maker. India had been exporting vaccines; now it's importing them. The first batch of Russia's Sputnik vaccines is supposed to arrive tomorrow. MARTIN: So the U.S. and other countries are sending aid in the form of oxygen, PPE and raw materials to help make vaccines. Is that enough? FRAYER: I mean, it's a massive relief effort, but the challenge is speeding all of that aid to the neediest patients. And India has supply chain problems. I mean, the tanker trucks haven't been communicating well with the oxygen warehouses, local governments. I mean, people are getting sick everywhere. They're lacking staff and coordination. India is notorious, though, for spending less on public health than most other countries. And so we're seeing the problems. I mean, every morning, we hear of dozens of patients dying in hospitals. They managed to get hospital beds, and they're dying because their oxygen is running out there while oxygen is arriving in the airport nearby. MARTIN: Is the population locked down there, Lauren? FRAYER: We are. I'm under lockdown here in Mumbai. It's really strict. You're not allowed to even go out for a jog. But it's a state-by-state issue. So Prime Minister Narendra Modi was 10 days ago holding election rallies in parts of the countries that were not under lockdown. Now we're seeing spikes of infections there. The government's reasoning for not imposing a nationwide lockdown is that lockdowns are painful. The economy shrank 24% last spring under lockdown. And so it's really a last resort. MARTIN: NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai. Thank you, Lauren. FRAYER: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Israelis were just starting to turn the corner from the coronavirus pandemic, getting back to normal life, and then they awakened today to news of a horrible accident. INSKEEP: Crowds gathered for a Jewish religious festival in northern Israel and something panicked the crowd. In the stampede, at least 44 people died. MARTIN: NPR's Daniel Estrin is with us from Jerusalem. Daniel, this happened late last night in Israel. What details can you share at this point? DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Well, it happened on an annual Jewish holiday, Lag B'Omer. This is when ultra-Orthodox Jews come in enormous numbers to the tomb of a revered rabbi and mystic from the second century. This is in the Galilee in the mountains of northern Israel. So we're talking about a huge complex with stairs and walkways leading to areas where there are big bonfires. Local media are estimating about 100,000 people there last night. And what happened was there were enormous crowds squeezed into one passageway. One eyewitness who spoke from his hospital bed on local television said that around 1 a.m., crowds were pushing into each other, trying to get through. People were getting hot. The floor was getting slippery. And then suddenly, dozens of people just collapsed into each other, fell on the ground, and then more people collapsed onto them. He found himself in a pile of people screaming, people reciting a Jewish prayer that's traditionally recited before one's death. This eyewitness said it took a long time for police and paramedics at the site to just untangle the piles of people. And it's being described as Israel's biggest mass casualty civilian disaster not counting wars. MARTIN: How was it that so many people were allowed to gather? I mean, I know Israel is doing better on the pandemic front, but still. ESTRIN: Right. I mean, that is the big question being asked here. Big crowds were expected. It's the largest annual public event in Israel where hundreds of thousands usually attend over the course of a couple days. What happened was that people were not allowed to attend last year because of the pandemic. This year, after the vaccination campaign and the low infections, the event was allowed to happen. It was going to be the first mass gathering in Israel since the pandemic. But the focus this year was on COVID safety. So police were limiting the number of bonfires, limiting the number of people who could attend each bonfire, figuring out how to get in only the vaccinated or people who took COVID tests. But apparently, there was just so much excitement about this event that didn't take place last year. And because the event this year was one day instead of two days, that may have been what led to these crowds happening at this more limited event. So there is still a lot of finger-pointing this morning. An investigation has been ordered up looking at whether police failed here. MARTIN: A lot of questions, too, I imagine, from people. I mean, it just - it hasn't happened that long ago, so I imagine people are trying to contact their loved ones. ESTRIN: Yeah. This is - I mean, people are looking for answers. And first of all, there have been safety concerns at this big annual event for a long time. But it feels like we're still in this chaotic situation. I mean, overnight, kids at the site were lost trying to match parents with kids. The cellphone service was not working. This morning, authorities still trying to identify bodies. MARTIN: NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting from Jerusalem. Thank you, Daniel. ESTRIN: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: There was a pretty remarkable moment on Wednesday night. President Biden entered the House chamber and spoke to the women behind him, making history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well, Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President. (CHEERING) BIDEN: No president has ever said those words from this podium. No president has ever said those words. And it's about time. INSKEEP: Yeah, the vice president and speaker of the House sit behind the president at any joint session of Congress. And this is the first time both of those offices are held by women. Kamala Harris is the first female vice president, the No. 2 of a man who was himself vice president once upon a time. So what has her role been in these first 100 days? MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe with us. Hi, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: All right. I'm going to quote John Nance Garner because why not? He was FDR's former vice president, and he said that the vice presidency, quote, \"wasn't worth a warm bucket of spit.\" How one does in the job depends a lot on how much space a vice president is given, right? How much space does she have? How is Harris defining her role? RASCOE: She's really embraced and celebrated the historic nature of her position. Harris and her supporters say she's expanding the view of what normal looks like. But as John Nance Garner said, it is a complicated role because you're not the No. 1. You're the No. 2. And part of the job for a vice president is to not outshine the president. So Harris hasn't done a lot of attention-grabbing things yet in her job, but Biden and Harris have made clear that they are partners. Here's Harris in an interview with CNN earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: He and I are in almost every meeting together, have made almost every decision together. I'm not going to talk about our private conversations, of course, but I can tell you that it is often the case that, as I will ask his opinion about things, he will ask my opinion. RASCOE: And the spotlight is much more on Harris than a typical vice president because of her identity, of course, but also because of Biden's age and questions about whether he will run again. MARTIN: And, of course, not only is Kamala Harris a woman, she's also a person of color. How is she using her role to talk about race? RASCOE: Her words carry a lot of weight. She obviously has a lived experience, but she hasn't been the White House spokesperson on race. The White House is trying to talk about, you know, weaving equity into every policy and action. I spoke to Glynda Carr, who is president of Higher Heights for America PAC, which is focused on getting progressive Black women elected. She dismissed the idea from some critics that Harris may not be impacting policy. Here's some more of what she had to say. GLYNDA CARR: People are discounting the significance and the leverage and influence she can have being the first and last person in the room to help shape President Biden's thoughts on budget policies and policy innovations. RASCOE: Carr said she believes that Harris is at her best when she's out meeting with people and that she will be a big asset to the Biden administration when she can do more of that. MARTIN: I mean, specifically, she's been given a responsibility for a tough problem working with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries in Central America to talk about migration. How has she managed that? RASCOE: She's tasked with the root causes of the surge of migration that won't be fixed overnight. The White House has stressed that she's not in charge of the border, but that's a nuanced point that might be difficult to convey to the general public, that she's just over the diplomacy. MARTIN: All right. NPR White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe with a look at Kamala Harris' first 100 days in office. Thanks, Ayesha. RASCOE: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

President Biden said the guilty verdict against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin \"can be a moment of significant change\" for the United States as it grapples with systemic racism. Biden and Vice President Harris addressed the nation on Tuesday, after Chauvin was found guilty of murder for the death of George Floyd during an arrest last year. \"It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see [systemic racism],\" Biden said from the White House, calling American racism \"a stain on our nation's soul.\" The jury, on its second day of deliberations, found Chauvin guilty on all three charges: second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Biden said the verdict is \"a step forwards,\" and that such a verdict in a case of police violence is \"also much too rare.\" Biden urged Americans to confront the issues raised by Floyd's murder. \"'I can't breathe.' We can't let those words die with him. We must not turn away, we can't turn away,\" he said. The president watched the verdict with Harris and staff in the private dining room, according to the White House. Afterward, he spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Biden said thanked him for his collaboration through the trial. Biden, Harris and first lady Jill Biden also spoke with Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, from the Oval Office. In video of the phone call shared by the Floyd family's attorney, Ben Crump, Biden is heard saying, \"Nothing is gonna make it all better but at least, God, now there's some justice.\" \"We're going to get a lot more done,\" Biden pledged. He referenced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress and added, \"that and a lot more.\" President Biden and VP Harris call the Floyd family after the GUILTY verdict! Thank you @POTUS & @VP for your support! We hope that we can count on you for the police reform we NEED in America! \u270a\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/cg4V2D5tlI Harris told the family, \"This is a day of justice in America,\" adding, \"We really do believe that with your leadership and the president that we have in the White House that we're going to make something good come out of this tragedy, OK?\" Floyd died last Memorial Day after Chauvin, then an officer for the Minneapolis Police Department, knelt on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds as Floyd lay facedown, crying for help with his hands cuffed behind his back. Biden \u2014 who won the 2020 presidential election in part on promises to help heal the inequities plaguing racial minorities, including issues of police bias \u2014 has thus far done little to address police violence. His team has instead pointed reporters to his support of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which has passed the House of Representatives but has a tougher fight in the Senate, rather than executive actions. Harris, in her remarks following the guilty verdict, boosted the legislation as part of Floyd's legacy. Harris vowed that the bill, which she helped author, would \"hold law enforcement accountable and help build trust between law enforcement and our communities.\" Harris, who is the first woman of color to serve as vice president, acknowledged the longstanding inequalities of the criminal justice system, but said Chauvin's guilty verdict was a step in the right direction. \"A measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice,\" she said. \"This verdict brings us a step closer. And the fact is we still have work to do. We still must reform the system.\" NPR's Dana Farrington and Roberta Rampton contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "The Minneapolis area is making preparations for a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges in the death of George Floyd. A verdict is expected this week.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Minneapolis area is making preparations for a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges in the death of George Floyd. A verdict is expected this week. When Joe Biden offered his condolences to the loved ones of George Floyd in a video address that played at Floyd's funeral service last year, he posed a question. \"Why, in this nation, do too many Black Americans wake up knowing they could lose their life in the course of living their life?\" Biden asked. Biden, then his party's presumptive presidential nominee, urged the country in that speech to use Floyd's death as a call for action to address systemic racism. \"Now is the time for racial justice. That's the answer we must give to our children when they ask why,\" Biden said in the video. \"Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.\" As the jury deliberates in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged in Floyd's death, the looming verdict could be the first significant flashpoint over race and policing in Biden's presidency. On Tuesday, Biden confirmed that he had spoken with Floyd's family and that the family is \"calling for peace and tranquility, no matter what that verdict is.\" \"I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict, which I think it's overwhelming in my view,\" said Biden. \"I wouldn't say that, lest the jury was sequestered now and not hear me say that.\" The conclusion of the trial could compound a moment of intense pain over police killings in the United States. Biden is expected to speak after the verdict, and the president may try to heal the soul of a divided nation. But he also appears caught in a double bind. Biden has pledged to help end the epidemic of Black men being killed by police, but aside from the policing overhaul bill named for Floyd that is currently stalled in Congress, Biden does not yet appear to have a clear agenda to deliver on his promise of making real change in policing in communities of color. At the same time, the president has presented himself as an ally of the law enforcement community. \"The question for those in power is not about how much more talking or how much more coming together we need to do while Black people are being killed,\" said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change. \"And there's always questions about whether or not there will be any level of accountability for it. This is not a time for more conversations. This is a time for action.\" Biden met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the Oval Office last week after the prosecution rested its case in Chauvin's trial in Minneapolis. That meeting also came amid protests and outcry after a police officer in Brooklyn Center, Minn., killed a Black man during a traffic stop. Law enforcement officials have said that then-officer Kim Potter, who has since resigned, mistook her handgun for a Taser when she fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, last week. Ahead of the meeting with Black lawmakers, Biden referred to the killing of Wright as \"that god-awful shooting\" resulting in Wright's death, as well as the uncertain verdict in the trial over Floyd's death. \"But we're in the business, all of us meeting today, to deliver some real change,\" he said. President Biden meets with members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the Oval Office of the White House on April 13.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden meets with members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the Oval Office of the White House on April 13. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., was one of the lawmakers in that meeting, and she later said that the president constantly weighs the impact of his words. \"We have been very much made aware of these issues in the Black community, but for him to acknowledge them and to share with us his understanding was very, very powerful and hopeful,\" she said. Over the course of his career, Biden has spoken about race and racism in America in stark terms. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., described the president's plain-spokenness as one thing that drew him to Biden. \"He's put forward the kinds of proposals that maybe don't go as far as I would put them, but he is really doing things that demonstrate forward movement on some very controversial issues.\" Clyburn said. \"I think he's been plain-spoken when it comes to things like voting and voting rights.\" But the way in which Biden initially spoke about the killing of Wright raised questions. Biden initially referenced the body camera footage that shows the final minutes of Wright's life and said that it remained a question whether the shooting had been an accident. \"That remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation,\" Biden said. \"But, in the meantime, I want to make it clear again: There is absolutely no justification \u2014 none \u2014 for looting, no justification for violence.\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who has publicly pushed back on Biden's response, said it \"tears at the fabric of my very soul ... because the instinct is to assume that the person who was killed did something wrong and may have deserved it.\" Bowman said that Biden and other white leaders need to demonstrate their empathy to understand how Black people feel when seeing another Black person killed by police. \"We need to see the same urgency and feel the same urgency from the president when it comes to Black lives and from all of us as elected officials, as leaders,\" Bowman said. \"Do we value Black life more than we value property?\" The video of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck in the final moments of his life ignited protests around the world and spurred a racial reckoning that changed the course of the presidential campaign. Biden was elected after naming systemic racism as one of four major crises facing the nation. And voters put him into office along with Kamala Harris, the nation's first Black and first Asian American vice president. \"What we need to hear from President Biden and Vice President Harris is that they will do everything in their power to address this pressing crisis in this country and that it will be a central organizing policy push,\" said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People. She warned that if the White House does not directly address these issues, many people who turned out for Biden and Democrats in 2020 may not do so again. \"I think at this point where the constant barrage and news of the violence and dehumanization of Black people, of brown people, at the hands of government employees \u2014 police \u2014 there's a sense that something must be done,\" she said. But Biden has also projected himself as an ally of police, leaving him facing pressure on two fronts. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, has known Biden since he was a senator. Pasco has been meeting with administration officials, despite the fact that the Fraternal Order of Police supported former President Donald Trump in the November election. \"He still has enough credibility in the law enforcement community, and I believe credibility in the civil rights community, to ideally position him to at least try with the potential for success to get everybody together on issues,\" Pasco said of Biden. But Derecka Purnell, a lawyer and activist, sees Biden's relationship to law enforcement and commitment to police funding as the core of the issue. \"That Joe Biden has pledged to give more money and more resources to the police in 2020 during the largest protests in history that happened to be against police violence is not so much of a disconnect, but continuity, given his long legacy and commitment to funding and supporting different policies that are harmful to Black people in this country,\" Purnell said.",

            "article_content": "Mayor-elect Tishaura Jones says race will no longer be an afterthought under her incoming administration.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Roberson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mayor-elect Tishaura Jones says race will no longer be an afterthought under her incoming administration. Voters in St. Louis last week delivered a historic victory for Tishaura Jones, the first Black woman elected mayor and the latest triumph for progressive candidates in the St. Louis region. Amid unrest at local jails, surging gun violence and a pandemic that has disproportionately hurt people of color, Jones said race will no longer be an afterthought in the mayor's office. \"We are done avoiding race and how it holds this region back,\" she told NPR's All Things Considered. The current city treasurer, Jones ran on a progressive platform \u2014 calling for a \"reimagining\" of public safety and promising to close the Workhouse, one of the city's pretrial detention centers that has come under fierce scrutiny for inhumane conditions. After being sworn in April 20, she intends to shut down the Workhouse within 100 days. Voters on Tuesday also fueled a progressive flip of the Board of Aldermen, and recent years have brought a wave of progressive candidates into office, including St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush and Ferguson Mayor Ella Jones. In discussing her second run for mayor (Jones ran unsuccessfully in the 2017 mayoral election), she brought up her 13-year-old son. Jones recalled the two talking about what, exactly, the mayor does. \"I said, 'The mayor is over the police and trash and firefighters,' and named all the departments,\" Jones said. \"And he said, 'Oh, you'll be over the police? That means I'll be safe.' And that statement just hit me like a ton of bricks because I shouldn't have to run for mayor in order for my son to feel safe.\" After a campaign that did not shy from conversations about race and policing, Jones is determined to bring that focus to the mayor's office: \"We have not had the opportunity to have those difficult and tough conversations about the systemic racism that permeates every policymaking decision in our region and in our city.\" In the interview, Jones was critical of the city's police union. Jeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, responded to Jones' comments by directing NPR to a statement made after last week's election: \"We congratulate all of yesterday's winners and we commit to continue to partner with them or anyone else willing to do the hard work of making this city a better, safer place to live.\" The following excerpts from the interview have been edited for length and clarity. On \"reimagining\" public safety and how to get all parties to engage in good faith I think our city is shifting. I definitely feel a shift in the air, and we are moving towards having these conversations. I think also our business community is keenly aware of the racism and hyper-segregation in our region that holds us back. Because there are people that I've met, who have relocated to St. Louis who say that, you know, \"I've never experienced racism until I moved to St. Louis.\" I've also put the police union on notice several times during the campaign that they have to get rid of [St. Louis Police Officers Association business manager] Jeff Roorda if they want a seat at my table. They're in the middle of negotiating their collective bargaining agreement. And if they want to negotiate in good faith, they cannot have him at the table because he has profited off our pain; he continues to gaslight racism in this city and in this region. We have to remove some of the bad actors if we're going to ever move forward. On the recent surge of gun violence in St. Louis and nationally I agree totally with President Joe Biden that we need to declare gun violence a public health crisis. In 2013, our state legislature drastically relaxed gun laws that made it easier for people to get access to weapons. As a result, the number of Black and brown deaths from gun violence has skyrocketed. This is a public health crisis. I also feel like poverty is one of the biggest drivers to gun violence and violence, period, in our region. So, how can we address poverty through workforce development programs, through matching people up with opportunities, and opportunities to thrive, not just survive? On recent unrest in St. Louis jails, and her promise to close one We have two facilities. City Justice Center downtown, as well as the Workhouse which is just in the north part of the city. And I remain committed to closing the Workhouse in the first 100 days and making sure we stabilize the situation at the jail downtown. Now, the other part of that is making sure the U.S. attorney and our local court system, our state court system, start to move people through the system. You know, these facilities were not meant to hold people for hundreds of days. These are all pretrial detainees. The one thing we have to remember, and I'm the daughter of an ex-felon, these are people's fathers, mothers, cousins, brothers \u2014 these are people first. On how she'll know whether she succeeded in the role My north star is to build a St. Louis where everyone is able to succeed, no matter their skin color, who they love, how they worship or what ZIP code they live in, or any identity they hold. And in the St. Louis that we're going to build, police will not be the only answer when we dial 911. Youth will be at the center of our planning. Our tax revenues are going to fix our leaky civic systems, and their government will be open to them. That's how I know I will have succeeded.

            "article_content": "Calls for police reform after George Floyd's death proved politically tricky for Democrats. For Republicans, inheriting Donald Trump's mantle is a difficult poiltical maneuver.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: George Floyd's death was a flashpoint for a summer of unrest, calls for racial equity and an end to police brutality. Defund the police became a shorthand for an array of police-reform proposals and, in an election year, a political football. That election has come and gone, but the issues remain, so we'll turn now to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So we don't know the outcome, of course, of Derek Chauvin's trial, but we have had some time to digest sort of the political implications of police reform. Donald Trump, the former president, said he wanted to look at policing and, quote, \"how we can do it better and how we can do it, if possible, in a much more gentle fashion.\" Joe Biden called for more funding for police reform. Where does the public stand on this? LIASSON: In polling, the public has repeatedly shown support for police reform and opposition to the idea of, quote, \"defunding the police.\" This is a very fraught issue for Democrats. Republicans were able to take that slogan, defund the police, which only a handful of Democratic candidates, mostly in safe blue districts, actually supported - Joe Biden did not - and Republicans were able to attach it to Democrats in general. And since the election, there's been this raging debate among Democrats about whether and how much defund the police hurt frontline Democrats in swing districts. But since the election, as you said, we're not hearing from Democrats talking about defunding the police. What we're hearing a lot about is how best to do police reform. That seems to be the focus for now, at least until the next election season. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This weekend, a gathering of Republican leaders and big donors in Florida, including a stop at Mar-a-Lago, where we know a former president may live. Is that a sentimental visit or proof that Donald Trump is still wearing the ring to kiss if you want to be a who's who in the Republican Party? LIASSON: No. It's - Donald Trump has a firm grip on the Republican Party. According to reports, his remarks at Mar-a-Lago to those big funders were all about his enemies, his Republican enemies. He called Mitch McConnell a dumb son of a bitch and a stone-cold loser. He attacked McConnell for not voting to overturn the election results. He said he was very disappointed in Mike Pence, his vice president, who also refused to decertify the Electoral College results. So this just shows you how difficult it's going to be for Republicans to move beyond Trump and how what the Republican Party stands for is still defined almost exclusively by what Trump wants. And it's not just that you have to go and kiss the ring to be in his good graces; you have to kiss the ring to avoid Trump endorsing your primary opponent if you're a Republican. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we should note that some of that language was not very family friendly. LIASSON: No. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No. Trump was one of a kind, wrote his own rules. So then what do you make of his two home-state politicians who really want to inherit his mantle, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the now embattled Congressman Matt Gaetz? LIASSON: Well, Ron DeSantis is doing a little bit better at positioning himself to inherit the Trump mantle, although he'll get a lot of competition from people like Mike Pompeo and Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz. But Matt Gaetz, who's embroiled in a sex scandal, has been trying to use a pretty brash Trumpian strategy to deal with it. He went to Mar-a-Lago this weekend. He gave a speech to a group called Trump Women for America First. He attacked the lying media. He said he'd been smeared. The big question is, will this kind of strategy work for him the way it worked for Trump? In other words, is Trump the only Republican politician who can bluster his way through a sex scandal? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's talk about infrastructure because, actually, Biden wants Republican votes on Capitol Hill, if he can get them. So how much do you think that's going to work out? LIASSON: Well, I think there will be infrastructure investment in the end, maybe not as much as Biden is asking for. Biden and the cabinet secretaries that he has tasked to push his infrastructure plans have all said repeatedly they want bipartisan support. They want to compromise with Republicans. Biden has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White House tomorrow to talk about this, even though Democrats are also continuing to make plans to pass infrastructure bills with Democrats' votes only in the Senate if necessary, under something called reconciliation. But you also have moderate Democrats, including Joe Manchin, who's the key to passing anything Biden wants with 50 Democratic votes in the Senate. They've said they want to scale back some of Biden's pay-fors, the tax hikes he wants to use to pay for infrastructure investment. And Republicans right now seem almost universally opposed to this. And remember; Biden needs 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass the bill under regular order. That's a very, very heavy lift. So we don't know how long and hard he'll try to look for bipartisan support or whether Republicans will work with him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you very much. LIASSON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Minneapolis police chief and other members of his department have testified that former officer Derek Chauvin's restraint of George Floyd was excessive and that it violated the department's policies on use of force. \"I think it's amazing to see police officers willing to cross that blue wall of silence and be willing to speak up about Derek Chauvin's actions,\" says Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and activist in Minneapolis. \"But I'm not sure yet if this is going to create a paradigm shift within the institution of policing or if this is just being seen as an isolated incident.\" Levy Armstrong is among those in her community and around the world who have been closely watching Chauvin's trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death last May. \"It is very traumatizing at times, especially when the bystander videos play over and over again,\" Levy Armstrong says in an interview Wednesday with NPR's Morning Edition. \"It can be very difficult to watch. There are people in our community who refuse to watch because of the emotional and psychological impacts that they experience,\" she adds. Those impacts include \"a great deal of stress and anxiety surrounding watching what happened to George Floyd and hearing him say 'I can't breathe' nearly 30 times,\" she says. \"Not to mention the anxiety that's created from watching the bystanders plead with the Minneapolis police officers to release George Floyd.\" Levy Armstrong says the trial is having an impact on people's everyday lives. \"It comes out in terms of folks not feeling at ease as the trial is unfolding,\" she says. \"Difficulty that people may have when they're going into work and trying to have normal workplace conversations, knowing that this trial is in the backdrop. And also thinking about the racial dynamics that are connected to this trial.\" Levy Armstrong hopes the high-profile trial will mean that \"officers will be more willing to intervene when they see their fellow officers engaged in misconduct or abusing someone out on the streets,\" she says. But she remains skeptical of the trial's outcome, given the history of juries often failing to convict police officers around the country. \"I think that it's a long shot in terms of thinking about whether justice will be served in this case and whether there will be a conviction,\" she says. \"I think that so many of us in Minneapolis are outraged about what happened to George Floyd,\" Levy Armstrong says. \"We are hoping that in this case, an officer will be convicted for what he did. Beyond that, I think that people are cautiously optimistic in terms of what the future holds. They're watching. They're sharing information. And my hope is that it leads to results in terms of transforming the way that policing happened in Minneapolis.\" Milton Guevara and Steve Mullis produced and edited the audio version of this story.

            "article_content": "As Boston Mayor Marty Walsh joins the Biden administration, the city will have its first female mayor and its first non-white mayor, Kim Janey.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: For the first time ever, Boston is being run by a woman, Kim Janey. Boston's City Council president became acting mayor when Marty Walsh resigned to become labor secretary. Adam Reilly of member station GBH says she'll bring the mindset of an activist to the role. ADAM REILLY, BYLINE: Kim Janey will govern a city of almost 700,000, but a few years ago, she was elected to the city council with just 5,000 votes. That's not a knock on Janey, who represents 1 of 9 districts. Still, she's not a household name. So I asked her, what should people who aren't familiar with you know? KIM JANEY: You know, my very first school that I went to was a community school that was started by Black parents and activists who were deeply concerned that Black children were not being well served or educated in Boston public schools in the 1960s and '70s. REILLY: Before second grade, Janey's parents moved her into Boston school system, where she was told she'd have to repeat first grade. Her parents said no and prevailed. JANEY: That was such an important lesson for me to see them stand up for their child. REILLY: At 11, she was bused across the city from her predominantly Black neighborhood to a mostly white one as part of a court-ordered plan to desegregate Boston's schools. JANEY: We had rocks thrown at our buses and racial slurs and police escorts and the whole nine. Inside that school, you know, we were kids. And we were friends with each other, regardless of what neighborhoods we lived in. REILLY: Later, Janey went to high school in a suburb through a program aimed at giving kids from the city expanded opportunity. At 16, she became a mother and had to go to work right after graduation. JANEY: It also meant that people would write you off. And so I had to work extra hard to make sure that my daughter had the opportunities that I wanted for her. REILLY: Janey got a job in data entry and went to community college. She transferred to Smith College but left to care for her grandfather after her grandmother died. She got out of what she calls a dysfunctional, abusive relationship. And eventually, she became a community organizer, most recently with Massachusetts Advocates for Children, where she pushed to reform Boston schools. JOHN MUDD: Kim is an extraordinarily strong woman. She is deeply respectful of people of all kinds. REILLY: John Budd hired Janey at Mass Advocates, where she worked for nearly two decades. MUDD: We were about empowering people - parents, community members, church members - to make the institutions that represent them respond to their real needs. REILLY: Now, those same people will be pushing Janey to deliver. It won't be easy, especially in a pandemic. But Janey says, given Boston's deep inequities, that can't be an excuse. JANEY: Pre-COVID, there's a life expectancy gap of 30 years from Grove Hall to Symphony Hall. It's not enough to go back to normal. I've been a broken record on this. We're not looking - I'm not looking to go back to normal. I want us to go better. REILLY: For now, Janey isn't saying whether she'll seek the mayor's job permanently - if she does, she'll have competition. The field already includes three other city councilors, all women of color and men of Puerto Rican and Cape Verdean descent. Whatever Janey decides, though, her impending promotion will be historic. JANEY: My city is going to have its first woman mayor. How incredible is that? My city is going to have its first Black mayor. Wow. And then I think, oh, wow, that's me (laughter).

            "article_content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the running for yet another term as votes are counted in Israel's fourth election in two years.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Voting is over in Israel, and now, the counting is underway. The results will determine the new parliament and whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu serves another term. The right-wing leader has served for 12 years straight. He's managed to hold onto his office through three other elections in just the last two years. And this time, he's being credited by many for Israel's fast rollout of the coronavirus vaccine. NPR's Daniel Estrin joins us now from Jerusalem. Daniel, let's just start with the mood. What are you hearing from voters? DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Voters are tired, Audie. This was the fourth election in the last two years here, and voter turnout was a bit lower this time. In previous elections, there was a real sense of anticipation and even excitement about a neck-and-neck race. And today, I heard none of that. I heard pessimism from voters who want change, who do not like Bibi Netanyahu - that's Netanyahu's nickname. This is Ronit Harpaz. RONIT HARPAZ: I'm very disappointed from the government. And we hope that we don't need to be here another time and vote again. We don't want vote again. I think that Bibi will win again, and I don't want this. ESTRIN: Here's a Netanyahu voter, Daniel Tzafar. DANIEL TZAFAR: I think it will be a long journey. Probably Bibi will win, but for him to build a coalition to work with everybody is going to be a long journey. ESTRIN: So there is no clear winner yet. Netanyahu is expected to win the most seats in parliament, but he'll still need to build a coalition with other parties to get a majority. CORNISH: Daniel, fourth election now in two years. The last one was just a year ago. How unusual is this? I mean, what is this cycle of elections? ESTRIN: Yeah. Israel is really in deadlock. And it all comes down to Netanyahu. He has been on trial for corruption, and not enough parties have been willing to join a government with him. On the other hand, the opposition has just been too weak and too divided to come together and unseat him. And that's why we've seen this deadlock. Last year, Netanyahu had to share power with his centrist opponent, and that opponent was supposed to take over, actually, as prime minister later this year. Instead, Netanyahu forced these new elections so he would get another chance to stay prime minister. And what could help him this time are the vaccines. Many Israelis, no matter what their political affiliation is, give him credit for securing COVID-19 vaccines early, and Israel leads the world today in vaccinations per capita. CORNISH: Looking ahead, what direction could this election take this government in terms of policy? ESTRIN: Well, the government, no matter what happens, is going to be fairly right wing or very right wing. And it depends. I mean, the left wing is very small in Israel, so we're looking at a few options. If Netanyahu wins a majority, he would partner with ultra-nationalists, with the hard right, with Jewish religious parties. They would strengthen Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. President Biden does not support settlements like Trump did. Now, if the opposition somehow manages to form its own government, it would also be heavily dependent on right wing parties. This vote will all come down to how the small parties come out. It's a very, very tight election, Audie. CORNISH: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks for your reporting. ESTRIN: Thank you very much, Audie. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOMBOX'S \"MIDNIGHT ON THE RUN\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

JERUSALEM \u2014 For the fourth time in less than two years, Israelis voted Tuesday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to maintain his grip on power after a record-breaking 12 consecutive years in office. Indicted over alleged bribery and fraud, he has refused to resign, polarizing the country between diehard supporters and enraged opponents, and sparking a political gridlock that has led Israel to hold elections more frequently than any other major democracy. Netanyahu no longer has former President Donald Trump's policy gifts and preelection boosts. Instead, a world-leading COVID-19 vaccination drive and a quick reopening of the economy ahead of this weekend's Passover holiday has brought Netanyahu a surge of admiration that he hopes will carry him to victory. \"We went from slavery to freedom,\" retired postal worker and Netanyahu voter Herzel Guetta said while vacationing in Jerusalem after a long period of lockdowns, borrowing a phrase from the Passover story of the biblical exodus from Egypt. \"He really cared.\" Even Israelis who want to unseat him give Bibi, Netanyahu's popular nickname, credit for convincing Pfizer to choose Israel to host an early vaccine rollout, vaccinating more Israelis per capita than any other country. \"He came out as a genius with corona. He opened up the economy with concerts. He proved himself with vaccines, one of the highest vaccination rates in the world,\" said Shani Segalovich, 20, eating lunch in a Jerusalem market. \"I want change, but I have a feeling Bibi will win.\" Polls predicted a tight race, with Netanyahu having a slight advantage over his rivals to form a hard-right government  of Jewish religious parties, far-right ultranationalist and anti-LGBTQ factions. Such a government would favor strengthening Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which the Biden administration and most countries oppose as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. It could also seek to limit the power of the judiciary, which Netanyahu has alleged is conspiring to oust him through his corruption trial, and could pass laws helping the prime minister evade prosecution.

If Netanyahu does not manage to form a majority coalition of 61 out of 120 lawmakers in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, pollsters warn of yet another stalemate, leading to unprecedented fifth elections. That's because the alternative to a Netanyahu-led government is an ill-fitting collection of malcontents. They include former right-wing allies of Netanyahu, left, center and Arab parties, all of whom oppose Netanyahu but have little else in common, disagreeing on everything from ideology to who among them should lead. Netanyahu has gained momentum in part because he has splintered his opposition. Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief of staff, posed the most credible challenge to Netanyahu's grip on power in the last three elections, but most of his supporters abandoned him last year when he agreed to join Netanyahu in what was billed as an emergency pandemic-focused government. But Netanyahu preferred new elections rather than uphold an agreement to let Gantz take over as prime minister after 18 months. Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel \u2013 who make up about 20% of the country \u2014 voted in record numbers against Netanyahu last year and helped block his path to a right-wing government. But an LGBTQ rights debate and other disagreements within the Arab community shattered the joint coalition of Arab parties, and has helped Netanyahu court some Arab voters. \"I believe his legal situation will force him to lean towards the Arabs, and take the Arab votes, and he will advance projects for the Arabs in Israel,\" said Naji Amer, a retired doctor in the Arab city of Kufr Qassem, who is voting for the United Arab List, an Islamist party that might be willing to partner with Netanyahu. What could tip the scales in Netanyahu's favor is the fate of two small parties in the anti-Netanyahu camp, the leftist Meretz and centrist Blue and White, which polled dangerously low and were at risk of not winning enough votes to make it into parliament. \"It's enough that one of them is not going ... to pass the threshold for Netanyahu to be able then to have a majority government,\" Israeli pollster Camil Fuchs said. Election officials also warn there could be attempts to delegitimize the results of the vote. Netanyahu's son Yair, a fierce ally of his father's who has promoted false conspiracy theories online, has questioned the impartiality of a member of Israel's elections commission and claimed the committee \"stole\" a recent vote. Israel does not allow mail-in ballots or absentee voting, but in this election, it permitted ballot boxes to be set up in retirement homes for older people so they were not exposed to crowds at polling stations. Israel also set up free shuttle service to designated polling places for COVID-19 patients and quarantined Israelis. There were even drive-through polls. Those votes are sent to the main elections committee headquarters in Jerusalem to be counted, which officials expected to slow down the final tally. The committee said it expected to finish counting only by Friday afternoon, just before the government shuts down for the Jewish Sabbath and Passover holiday. No one party is expected to win a majority of seats in the Knesset. Instead, Israel's president must choose a candidate to negotiate with other parties to form a majority coalition. Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and blockaded Gaza Strip do not have voting rights in Israel, but they have noted Netanyahu's campaign vows to legalize retroactively unauthorized Israeli settlement outposts, more than 100 of which dot the hills of the West Bank, where Palestinians want independence. \"Although we consider these elections an internal affair, all their electoral campaigns were at the expense of our land and our people, and the parties are competing for more land and more settlements,\" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in a statement. \"We condemn these frenzied campaigns against our land, our sanctities and our people, and we demand that the world act to stop all these procedures.\" A printing house in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, whose workers are mostly Palestinian noncitizens, printed ballots for the election.",

Ralph Northam said in a statement. Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam announced an executive action on Tuesday that allows tens of thousands of felons to recover their voting and other civil rights upon release from prison. The move applies immediately to an estimated 69,000 Virginians who have completed their sentences, including ex-convicts who remain on supervision. And it comes as the state prepares for gubernatorial and legislative elections on June 8. \"Too many of our laws were written during a time of open racism and discrimination, and they still bear the traces of inequity,\" said Northam said in a statement. \"We are a Commonwealth that believes in moving forward, not being tied down by the mistakes of our past. If we want people to return to our communities and participate in society, we must welcome them back fully\u2014and this policy does just that,\" he added. Under current law, anyone convicted of a felony in Virginia loses their civil rights, including the right to vote, serve on a jury, run for office, become a public notary, and carry a firearm. The state constitution gives the governor sole discretion to restore civil rights, with the exception of firearms rights. Prior to the executive action, only former inmates who had finished serving \"active supervision,\" including probation or parole, were eligible to have their voting rights restored. Now, eligible people can apply to get those rights restored. As NPR member station VPM reported: \"The Virginia General Assembly approved a constitutional amendment last month that would automatically restore the voting rights of people who served out their jail or prison sentence. But in order to amend the constitution, lawmakers have to approve the measure again during the next general assembly session and put it before voters in a referendum.\" Northam's office touted the action as the latest bipartisan move to restore civil rights over the last decade. That includes streamlining the application and eliminating the waiting period and the prerequisite that court costs and fees be paid prior to having one's rights restored. \"With today's announcement, Governor Northam has restored civil rights to more than 111,000 people since he took office,\" the statement reads.",

The U.S. Supreme Court seemed ready on Tuesday to uphold Arizona's restrictive voting laws, setting the stage for what happens in the coming months and years, as Republican-dominated state legislatures seek to make voting more difficult. Since the November election, and President Trump's false claims that the balloting was rigged, Republican-run state legislatures have raced to pass new laws that would curb the modern-day expansion of the right to vote. Many of these laws likely will be challenged in court, and on Tuesday the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could set the parameters for which of those restrictive laws survive, and which don't. The Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965, makes it illegal for states to enact laws that result in voting discrimination based on race. Eight years ago, the conservative court, by a 5-to-4 vote, gutted one of the two major parts of the law. Now, it is the other major section that is in the conservative court's crosshairs. Tuesday's case involved two Arizona laws. One bars the counting of provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct. The other bars the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a family member or caregiver. State Republicans and the Republican National Committee argued that both laws are needed to prevent fraud, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. It found no record of ballot fraud, but it did find evidence that the two laws make voting more difficult for minorities who often live in huge rural areas without a nearby post office or mail route. Tuesday's Supreme Court argument focused on what standard the court should use to determine whether these laws, or others like them, result in unconstitutional discrimination against minority voters. And the justices' questions appeared to be plucked straight from the headlines. Justice Elena Kagan, on the liberal side of the court, led off, quizzing Republican lawyer Michael Carvin with a series of hypotheticals that sounded very much like some of the laws proposed by the GOP since the November election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Suppose, Kagan said, that \"a state has long had two weeks of early voting and then the state decides that it's going to get rid of Sunday voting\" during those two weeks, and suppose the evidence is that Black voters cast their ballots on Sunday 10 times more often than white voters. \"Is that system equally open?\" she asked. \"I think it would be,\" replied Carvin, because \"Sunday is the day we traditionally close government offices.\" Kagan clearly found that answer wanting, since, as she observed, states don't usually have Saturday hours either but they do for early voting, just as they have in the past for Sundays when Black voters often go to the polls from church. Turning to another hypothetical, Kagan posited that a state says \"we're going to have Election Day voting only, and it's going to be from 9 to 5. And there's plenty of evidence in the record that voters of one race are 10 times more likely to work a job that wouldn't allow them to vote during that time period. Is that system equally open?\" Carvin said it would seem to be. Kagan persisted: \"What about 9-to-3 or 10-to 4?\" \"These are all hypotheticals that have never existed in the real world,\" Carvin protested. To that, Kagan replied, \"It doesn't seem so fanciful to me.\" Conservative Justice Samuel Alito had similarly tough questions for the other side. Suppose, he said, that a state has a two-week early voting period, and minority groups claim it should have been 60 days. Lawyer Jessica Amunson, representing Arizona's Democratic Secretary of State, replied that such an expansion is not required by the Voting Rights Act. The Act looks with suspicion on a measure that cuts back on previous voting rights, but it doesn't require a broad expansion. Alito followed up with a different hypothetical about how a ballot must be filled out. \"You have to ... fill in a little box to vote for a candidate,\" but some voters instead put a check mark next to the box, \"and it can be shown that there's a statistical disparity with respect to voters who don't actually fill in the box but make a check mark\" instead. Amunson suggested that this hypothetical likely wouldn't wash either. \"You would have to show that this is, in fact, imposing a ... discriminatory burden on the minority voters\" \u2014 a burden that it is not imposing on non-minority voters, she said. Chief Justice John Roberts and several other conservative justices pointed to a 2005 report issued by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker that cited ballot collection as presenting a particular potential for fraud. Amunson reiterated that there was no record of fraud in Arizona's absentee vote collection, but, she said, there is a record of racial animus by the legislators who introduced the bill to ban the practice.",

            "article_content": "FBI's director will testify before Senate panel about the insurrection. Georgia House passes bill that would limit absentee and early voting. House panel investigates health care provider One Medical.  NOEL KING, HOST: FBI Director Christopher Wray will testify before Congress today about the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Capitol Police were overrun that day by a larger and more violent crowd than they expected. And that raises questions about how well U.S. agencies were tracking domestic extremists. The FBI director was often praised for keeping the bureau independent during the Trump administration. But Christopher Wray will face questions today before a committee chaired by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin. DICK DURBIN: What did he know and when did he know it and who did he tell? I mean, those are questions which had been raised in other hearings, but he is the man of the hour. KING: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales will be watching today. Good morning, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: OK, so we heard Dick Durbin lay it out pretty clearly, but what do you think the thrust of the questions will be today? GRISALES: Yes. As you heard Durbin say, lawmakers want to know what the FBI knew and what was shared. We heard testimony last week from leaders guarding the Capitol and they agreed on a few elements, one being there were intelligence failures and, two, white extremists played a large role that day. KING: Beyond Wray's testimony today, the FBI is still working the January 6 insurrection as a case, right? GRISALES: Right. The FBI has played a key part here. About 280 people have been arrested, and more than 300 have been charged. But, of course, there are still some outstanding cases here, such as who planted the pipe bombs close to the Capitol that day and the assailant behind the death of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. KING: And so do you think Wray will be asked much about domestic terrorism beyond just what went on on the 6? GRISALES: Yes. This is a crucial focus for congressional Democrats investigating the Capitol siege. Does the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have a blind spot when it comes to these extremist groups? I talked to Durbin about this. He says domestic terrorism in the form of religious and racial-based hate groups have become a major threat to America. Let's take a listen. DURBIN: I want to know if we're - our intelligence operations have taken this into consideration in establishing their priorities. GRISALES: His judiciary panel is also conducting a larger probe on domestic terrorism. And Durbin wants to know if resources are in the right place to defend against these extremist groups. Last week, the panel's Democrats sent a letter to Wray raising concerns the FBI has minimized these threats. In a House hearing late last year, Wray defended the FBI's approach and also stressed the bureau investigates violence, not ideology. And he made these remarks in the wake of the racial justice movement. But today will be a real test of whether he can still stand by those words. KING: There are still more hearings to come this week. Who else will we be hearing from? GRISALES: Right. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold its second hearing in its insurrection probe tomorrow, focused on the military's role that day. Senators will hear from D.C. National Guard Major General William Walker. He was a central figure in this hourslong delay to get the military to the Capitol the day of the insurrection. A House panel will also hold a hearing later this week to expand the Capitol security budget. And by week's end, we're expecting a review led by retired Lieutenant General Russel Honore ready to be completed. And this is all part of a larger effort to get to the bottom of what went wrong, what failures allowed the Capitol attack to happen and addressing a lot of unanswered questions that remain from that day and how to ensure it never happens again. KING: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia. GRISALES: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Georgia's House of Representatives has approved a bill with new restrictions on voting. INSKEEP: It's a response to President Biden's win in the 2020 election. Donald Trump, you will recall, sought to overturn that Democratic vote with false claims about it. Trump's allies said at the time that they would use the falsehoods to shape future elections. And now Republicans in many states are legislating as if the falsehoods were true, including in the key state of Georgia. A sponsor of the bill that passed yesterday said he wants to restore voter confidence after many voters believed Trump's claims. KING: Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting has been all over this story. Good morning, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: How would this bill change voting in Georgia? FOWLER: So House Bill 531 is a 66-page measure that passed basically along party lines. It cuts back on in-person early voting options by making things uniform across Georgia's 159 counties. That's an issue because counties here are very different sizes with vastly different populations that vote in different ways. Now, primarily, this would curb back weekend voting, mandating one Saturday and then the option of adding an additional Saturday or Sunday. But that would harm Souls to the Polls events on days where we see more Black people voting. And it would cut back on absentee ballot drop boxes. One Republican even falsely said that was the most inconvenient way to cast a vote-by-mail ballot. KING: In the debate before this vote yesterday, did legislators talk explicitly about which voters would be disenfranchised by this bill? FOWLER: Absolutely. There were a number of impassioned Democrats that denounced attempts to restrict access to the polls, highlighting the fact that additional barriers like this end up hurting lower income voters, older voters and nonwhite Georgians in particular. Here's Representative Jasmine Clark. She's a black Democrat from Gwinnett County. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JASMINE CLARK: The numbers are clear. HB 531 is textbook voter suppression. This bill reduces, restricts and limits every single aspect of our election. FOWLER: And it was a big rainy day, and the virus is still present. But there were a number of protesters outside the Capitol as well. KING: And how about the Republicans supporting the legislation? How did they respond to Jasmine Clark, who we heard there? FOWLER: Well, Republicans talked about the lack of confidence and these controversies over 2020 voting in Georgia, again, even though they don't really have much merit because Georgia had those recounts and audits, and Republican officials said that the election was secure. Here's Representative Alan Powell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALAN POWELL: The system is flawed because the counties run the system. One hundred and fifty-nine counties run the election system. FOWLER: Beyond the controversy over early voting hours and this lack of confidence, many Republican suggestions deal with election administration and processes they think need tightening up after record turnout. And of course, this does follow an election that saw big swings in how people voted - you had more people voting by mail due to the pandemic - and how the state voted, which turned blue in both U.S. Senate seats. KING: OK, so now this bill goes to the Republican-controlled state Senate. What are they likely to do with it? FOWLER: Well, the Republican Senate has their own omnibus now that would completely end no excuse absentee voting and make more dramatic changes. But there's still a long way to go because Governor Brian Kemp, who you'll recall Donald Trump blasted for failing to intervene in the 2020 election, still has yet to weigh in. KING: Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler. Thanks, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: Late last night, Congress launched an investigation into the health care provider One Medical. INSKEEP: This after an NPR investigation found the company administered COVID-19 vaccines to ineligible patients. Some of those patients had close connections to company leadership. One Medical denied it knowingly vaccinated ineligible patients, but NPR obtained internal company communications that contradict this. KING: NPR investigative correspondent Tim Mak broke this story and joins us with a follow on his exclusive. Hey, Tim. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Hey there. KING: Just remind us quickly, what is One Medical? MAK: So One Medical is a primary health care provider that is publicly traded and valued in the billions of dollars. Their business model is to provide tech-driven primary health care for members who usually pay a $200-a-year annual fee. KING: OK, so now a congressional committee is going to investigate them. And what will they want to know about this company? MAK: Right. This is the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, and it's chaired by Congressman Jim Clyburn. He's looking for evidence that the company intentionally distributed vaccines to ineligible patients across multiple states, which is actually one of the conclusions of an NPR investigation we published a week ago. One of the committee's concerns is that there should be an equitable distribution of vaccines, one that prioritizes those most at risk rather than the wealthy or well-connected. The committee's giving this company two weeks to provide documents about their practices. KING: One Medical usually gets its vaccine doses from public health departments. That's the standard. Is that still going to happen now that there's this shadow cast on the company? MAK: So there are still public health departments that are providing COVID vaccines to One Medical, but we actually reached out to every local jurisdiction where they do business. We found that eight local jurisdictions that states and counties have cut the company off from vaccine allocations or are not planning to work with them any more in the future. San Francisco County, for example, made the unusual move of not only halting the supply of vaccines to the company but demanding back 1,620 doses. San Mateo County said it had done an investigation and found that One Medical had vaccinated 70 individuals who were ineligible. It, too, halted the allocation of vaccines to the company. So these are just two examples of that situation occurring. KING: But really big examples. When your story first came out, One Medical denied that it knowingly vaccinated people who were not eligible. Do they still deny it? MAK: One Medical has said that the situation is the result of misunderstandings and that it was working with local partners to address concerns. After I approached them about the news of this new congressional probe, they said that they are, quote, \"confident that we will be able to clear up these misunderstandings.\" CEO Amir Dan Rubin made no apologies in a call with investors last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AMIR DAN RUBIN: Regarding the stories, we strongly refute these gross mischaracterizations. Any assertions that we broadly and knowingly disregard eligibility guidelines are not true and in contradiction to our actual approach. MAK: But the communications obtained and published by NPR suggest the company was aware. Medical providers across multiple states were sounding the alarm internally about One Medical's lax oversight over eligibility requirements. KING: NPR investigative correspondent Tim Mak. Tim, thanks for your reporting. We appreciate it. MAK: Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF DISTANT.LO'S \"TOO OFTEN\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

J.E.B. Stuart in Richmond, Va. The statue was one of several that were removed by the city in 2020 following nationwide protests against systemic racism. A report released Tuesday found that 168 Confederate symbols were removed across the United States in 2020, virtually all of them following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. Only one of the symbols was removed prior to Floyd's death, when Virginia renamed Lee-Jackson Day in April as Election Day. The figures are an update to the 2019 Whose Heritage? Public Symbols of the Confederacy, an annual survey conducted by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center. The full 2020 survey will be released later this year. The SPLC said 94 of the Confederate symbols removed in 2020 were monuments, compared to 54 monuments removed between 2015 and 2019. The SPLC found 2,100 public Confederate symbols remain, 704 of them monuments. The SPLC began tracking the number of Confederate symbols in 2015. That year, a white supremacist fatally shot nine Black worshippers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. The shooter, Dylann Roof, has since been found guilty on 33 counts of federal hate crimes and sentenced to death. The massacre sparked discussion and, in some cases, reconsideration of Confederate flags and symbols across the South, starting with South Carolina lawmakers voting to remove the flag from statehouse grounds. Communities increasingly looked beyond flags, the SPLC said, to reexamine statues, monuments, city seals, street names and even state holidays. A renewed push to remove Confederate monuments came in 2017, after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly when a speeding car plowed through a crowd of counterprotesters. Critics argue that removing or renaming tributes to Confederate figures amounts to erasing history, the SPLC points out. But many historians \u2014 and public opinion polling \u2014 reject this concept, saying it's time for the symbols to go, and possible to engage with this period of history in other ways. More recently, the nationwide reckoning with racism and police brutality, sparked by Floyd's killing in May, prompted waves of protests across the country over the summer and a push to reexamine the legacy of racial injustice in the United States. Dozens of Confederate monuments were removed or replaced in the weeks and months that followed, either by local decrees or forceful protesters. Still, many remain standing. An NPR investigation found that while some 60 Confederate monuments came down across the U.S. between May and October, localities moved to protect 28 of them during that same period, from Delaware to Florida to Arizona. Virginia's statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed from the U.S. Capitol in late December after more than 100 years, to be replaced by a statue honoring civil rights activist Barbara Johns. Lee's statue was not present weeks later when a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the building, some individuals carrying Confederate flags.",

Fulton County employees, as well as election workers around the country, are still grappling with the emotional and psychological trauma they suffered as a result of Trump's disinformation campaign about the 2020 election, and it may have lasting consequences for recruiting and retention in the vital, but often under-appreciated field. Online threats led to real world dangers. Law enforcement were posted outside the homes of some election officials. To feel safer, at least one official's family moved in with in-laws. In more disturbing cases, election workers heard strangers knocking at their front doors, and menacing voices on the other end of the phone who uttered racial slurs and promised hangings. Before Trump's disinformation campaign began in earnest, election departments around the country were already battered as they struggled to handle the myriad repercussions of the pandemic. In the Fulton County office, 62-year-old Beverly Walker died from the virus. Walker had worked at the county for two decades, where she had a reputation as a maternal figure, thanks in part to her goodie drawer filled with tea, coffee, and snacks. \"It was just so unexpected,\" said coworker Shaye Moss, \"and just so fast, and just so crazy.\" Moss took Walker's death hard. Walker was a close friend and mentor to Moss, who invited Moss over for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Things got more challenging for the Fulton County election team in the weeks ahead of the November election. 23 workers in the county's warehouse tested positive for COVID-19, and the department barely got all the voting equipment delivered before the polls opened. \"We coming for you\" Trump falsely claimed victory in Georgia on election night, even though Fulton County alone had yet to count tens of thousands of mail-in ballots. Reporters and partisan observers flocked to the counting center. With all the attention came conspiracies. Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Jr. retweeted a 30-second video of a temp election worker in Fulton named Lawrence Sloan. In the video, a narrator falsely claimed Sloan threw away a mail-in ballot, attracting at least five million views, along with racist comments, and calls for Sloan to be identified and arrested. Soon after Sloan saw the video and the comments, he stepped outside Fulton County's mail-in ballot operation for a break but got scared when he saw Trump supporters protesting outside. \"Even if it's not about me, I'm standing outside, and they know what I look like,\" Sloan remembered. \"Every second that goes by, more people are going to see this. Me just being here is automatically just not the best.\" He left the scene, and stayed with friends for the night, changing his appearance so he wouldn't be recognized. As Georgia's recount of the presidential votes wound down, Trump and his allies focused their attacks on the Fulton County elections department, where all the staff, except for the director, are Black. Fulton County election worker Shaye Moss was singled out, along with her mother, in conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies.\n                \n                    \n                    Megan Varner/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fulton County election worker Shaye Moss was singled out, along with her mother, in conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies. Rudy Giuliani spun a conspiracy that targeted Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who had helped out as a temp worker. He compared them to drug dealers. \"They should have been questioned already. Their places of work, their homes should have been searched,\" he said at a virtual hearing organized by Republican state lawmakers in Georgia. Calls came in to Moss's old phone, which her son was using. \"He will answer it, and they'll just call him all kinds of racial slurs, and saying what they're going to do to him,\" Moss said. A stranger knocked on the door at Moss's grandmother's, where Moss used to live, and said they were there to make a citizens' arrest. Moss's grandma called her, frantic. \"She was just yelling on the phone, like 'No! Stop! You cannot come in here! Stop!' So, I just had to call the police, and this happens all the time,\" Moss said. Strangers also appeared at the home of Ruby Freeman, Moss's mother. Pizza deliveries showed up that Freeman hadn't ordered, and she told police she received at least 420 emails and 75 text messages, including one that read: \"We know where you live, we coming to get you.\" Moss oversaw the most public part of Fulton County's mail-in ballot operation, and she blames herself for the threats and harassment targeting her and her family. \"I'm the one that told my mom that we was hiring, we needed help. I shouldn't have gotten my family involved at all. I should have just stayed in the office like everybody else,\" Moss said. \"Always just trying to help and do the most, and be available, but I'm always the one getting s****d on in the end, every time.\" Trump mentioned Freeman's name 18 times on a now infamous call leaked to reporters, during which he pushed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to illegally alter the election results. The call is cited in the article of impeachment approved by the U.S. House. \"I'll take on anybody you want with regard to Ruby Freeman, and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady I'm sure. But Ruby Freeman, I will take on anybody you want,\" Trump said. Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron speaking to reporters on Nov. 5, 2020.

Barron now questions the meaning of his job after the disinformation campaign launched against his office. \"I just feel like I have a role in this that doesn't matter anymore.\" Fulton County's elections director, Rick Barron, and other employees in the department were also targeted with threats and harassment. When they listened to their phone messages at work, voices called them \"scumbags,\" \"lowlifes,\" and \"crooks.\" Callers pledged to shoot up the office. \"I don't know what we do these days. Is it firing squad? Is it hanging for treason,\" said one anonymous caller in a message to Barron, \"Boy, you better run.\" Employees spotted people taking photos of their license plates in the parking lot, and a drone flying nearby. Barron worried about his daughter's safety. \"The people that are contacting you aren't the people that you're worried about, but for everyone that's contacted you, there's going to be some of these nuts; you're never going to hear them coming,\" Barron said. Lasting consequences Election workers were targeted with harassment and threats in every state won by President Biden, and in some states former President Trump won, according to Jennifer Morrell, a partner at The Elections Group, which consults with state and local election departments. Morrell said the threats, and a feeling of helplessness in the face of disinformation, are pushing election officials to leave the field. \"People who do this job do it because they believe in it, because they have strong convictions when it comes to exercising democracy and serving,\" she said, \"but we're certainly seeing an exodus.\" Morrell is especially worried election departments may struggle to recruit the thousands of low-pay temp workers necessary to pull off elections every two years if those potential workers are worried about being threatened. \"I'm horrified to think that this could be the new norm,\" Morrell said. \"I think it's really important that we talk about it, and figure out how do we stamp that out.\" When Morrell talks to local election officials, she hears frustration. They tell her about politicians who are undermining the very system that put them in office, and sometimes even undermining the idea of democracy itself. Thoughts like these have been weighing on Barron especially after pro-Trump extremists stormed the U.S. Capitol. \"I don't know if you want to call it an existential, internal crisis I'm having,\" he said, \"I just feel like I have a role in this that doesn't matter anymore.\" The 2020 general elections were some of the most well run in Fulton County's history, Barron said, but Trump and his allies made them feel like a disaster.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election had a big impact on election workers in the Atlanta area. Many are traumatized by the effect his lies had on their lives.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: As his time in the White House came to a close, former President Trump became obsessed with one office in downtown Atlanta and the people who worked there. The Fulton County elections department was a target of conspiracy theories by Trump and his allies, and that led to threats. Johnny Kauffman with member station WABE in Atlanta spent months reporting inside the department. He brings us this story about the trauma suffered by local election workers due to Trump's disinformation campaign. JOHNNY KAUFFMAN, BYLINE: Fulton County's woes started months before November and the presidential election. In April, an election worker died from COVID. Beverly Walker was 62. Known for her goodie drawer filled with tea and snacks, she worked in the department for two decades. Walker was a close friend and mentor to Shaye Moss. SHAYE MOSS: Miss Beverly let me come to her house every year - every Christmas, every Thanksgiving. KAUFFMAN: Aww. MOSS: Yup. KAUFFMAN: That must have been so hard when she passed. MOSS: Yes. Very. It's very, very hard. It's just so unexpected and just so fast and just so crazy. KAUFFMAN: And then just weeks ahead of the November election, COVID hit the Fulton County elections department again. Twenty-three warehouse workers tested positive. Fulton barely got all the voting equipment out before the polls opened. Still, Election Day went smoothly. But late that night, Trump falsely declared victory in Georgia. Thousands of mail-in ballots still needed to be counted in Fulton, and reporters and partisan observers flocked there. The elections director, Rick Barron - he didn't sleep for 36 hours straight. We talked right after the press conference when he announced they finished. RICK BARRON: Did you notice? I almost lost it up there for a second. KAUFFMAN: What were you thinking? BARRON: I don't know. I think when I said something about Beverly dying or, you know, we had a staff member die and - I don't know. Maybe it was a sense of relief too because, I mean, it was stressful worrying about whether that was going to happen to anybody again. KAUFFMAN: Trump and his allies eventually zeroed in on Fulton County, where, except for Barron, all the staff are Black. Rudy Giuliani spun a conspiracy that targeted Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who had helped out as a temp worker. He compared them to drug dealers. Calls came in to Moss' old phone, which her son was using. MOSS: And he would answer it, and they're just calling him all kinds of racial slurs and saying what they're going to do to him. KAUFFMAN: A stranger knocked on the door at Moss' grandma's, where Moss used to live. The strangers said they were there to make a citizen's arrest. Moss' grandma called her, frantic. MOSS: She was just yelling on the phone, like, no, stop. You cannot come in here. Stop. And so I just had to call the police, and this happens all the time. KAUFFMAN: Strangers appeared at Ruby Freeman's house too. That's Moss' mom. Pizza delivery showed up that Freeman hadn't ordered. She told police she received at least 420 emails and 75 text messages. One read, we know where you live; we coming to get you. Moss oversaw the most public part of the county's mail-in ballot operation, and she blames herself for what happened. MOSS: Because I feel like it's all my fault - like, all my fault. KAUFFMAN: Why? It's not your fault. Why do you think that? MOSS: Because I'm the one that, you know, told my mom that we was hiring, we needed help. You know, I shouldn't have gotten my family involved at all. I should've just stayed in the office like everybody else, always trying to help and do the most and, you know, be available. But I'm always the one getting [expletive] on at the end every time. KAUFFMAN: Trump mentioned Ruby Freeman's name 18 times on a now-infamous call leaked to reporters. On the call, Trump pushed Georgia officials to illegally alter the election results. It's cited in the article of impeachment approved by the House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I'll take on anybody you want with regard to Ruby Freeman and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But Ruby Freedman (ph), I will take - Freeman. I will take on anybody you want. KAUFFMAN: Other Fulton County election workers were also harassed, and it wasn't just there. It happened in every state Joe Biden won and in some Republican states too, according to Jennifer Morrell. She's a consultant with The Elections Group. It's a company that works with state and local election departments. Morrell said the threats and a feeling of helplessness against lies and conspiracies - it's pushing election officials to leave the field. JENNIFER MORRELL: People who do this job do it because they believe in it, because they have strong convictions when it comes to exercising democracy and serving. But we're certainly seeing an exodus. KAUFFMAN: When Morrell talks to local election officials, she hears frustration. They tell her about politicians who are undermining the very system that put them in office, sometimes even undermining the idea of democracy itself. That's been weighing on Fulton County's elections director Rick Barron, especially after pro-Trump extremists stormed the U.S. Capitol. BARRON: I mean, there are days where I just have this - it feels like a - I think the nation is just - has completely lost its way. And I've lost faith in it. And it's like, what is the point of my job anymore? I don't know if you want to call it an existential, internal crisis I'm having. I just feel like I've got a role in this that doesn't matter anymore. KAUFFMAN: The 2020 general elections were some of the most well-run in Fulton County's history, Barron said. But Trump and his allies made them feel like a disaster. For NPR News, I'm Johnny Kauffman in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF PSALM TREES' \"CALL WHENEVER\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Biden is calling for unity to address each of the nation's concurrent crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, race relations and climate change. It won't be easy because as he settles into office, Biden also inherits a country that is deeply divided. Democrats and Republicans live in very different worlds and get their news and information from very different places, cordoned off by ideology and worldview. Bringing America together when the trials it faces are, in many cases, the most dire they've been in recent history will prove difficult. And Biden is not shying away from bold initiatives, many of which Republicans are sure to disagree with. Here's a look at six numbers that highlight the challenges Biden now faces: Americans are the most pessimistic they have been in decades about the direction of the country. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, 75% of Americans polled said they think the country is heading in the wrong direction, the highest since 1992. On the heels of Biden's win, Republicans' negative outlook, in particular, has increased significantly. Loading... Nine in 10 Democrats disapproved of the job Trump was doing, but 8 in 10 Republicans approved. Now, 7 in 10 Republicans don't think Biden was legitimately elected. So bringing Americans together is going to be an immense challenge for Biden. More than 24 million Americans have contracted COVID-19 and more than 400,000 have died, a number once unthinkable. That number is only climbing. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that more than 566,000 Americans will be dead from the coronavirus by May 1. Even with universal mask-wearing and a rapid vaccine rollout, at least 500,000 are projected to have died by then. Loading... Biden has called for all Americans to wear masks for the next 100 days, something three-quarters of Americans support, per the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. He is also looking to ramp up vaccine distribution, which Americans agree should be his top priority in combating the virus. Biden has set a goal of 100 million shots in arms in 100 days. So far, about 17.5 million doses have been administered, though only over 2 million people have gotten their second shot and some 20 million more doses have been distributed but not yet administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Biden has an added challenge: convincing people in communities of color and, especially, Republicans to take it, even when there are enough vaccines for everyone. COVID-19 politics are real, as Trump downplayed the importance of wearing masks and the threat of the virus overall. \"We are in a national emergency,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It's time we treat it like one.\" The impacts of the pandemic on the economy have been severe. About a third of Americans say they or someone in their household has lost wages or a job because of the pandemic. Loading... In April of last year, the economy shed almost 21 million jobs, as Americans went into lockdown. That situation started to recover some, as things opened up more, but as the spread of the coronavirus got worse this winter, the economy began faltering again, losing 140,000 jobs in December. Loading... Currently, unemployment stands at 6.7%, down from a high of 14.7% in April of last year. That's an improvement, but for context, the 14.7% was the highest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping statistics in 1948. The 6.7% would have been the worst since March 2014 \u2014 pre-pandemic, when the country was recovering from the Great Recession. Biden's economic plan starts with dealing with COVID-19, including money for schools and money for states and local municipalities to make up budget shortfalls. Beyond that, he wants to do a lot of things. He wants to reverse the Trump tax cuts but is pledging not to raise taxes for anyone making below $400,000 a year. He wants to raise the top tax bracket as well as corporate taxes; issue penalties for companies that move jobs overseas; increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour (equivalent to a yearly income of only $15,000) to $15 an hour, or $31,000 a year; and make it easier to join a union. He also wants to expand the child tax credit, has a plan to offset some costs of child care and would cancel $10,000 in student loans right away because of the pandemic, plus more for a commitment to community service. And he wants to invest $1.3 trillion in infrastructure over the next 10 years. Just 36% of Black Americans and 46% of whites say relations between whites and Blacks are at least somewhat good, according to Gallup. Both figures are the lowest since Gallup began tracking the question 20 years ago. Overall, a majority of Americans, by a 54%-to-44% margin, said relations between Blacks and whites were bad. These figures started to decline at the end of the Obama presidency and further nosedived under Trump, who stoked racial divisions. Loading... For his part, Biden, who was elected with a diverse coalition, is aiming to take on the issue. \"We can deliver racial justice,\" he said in his inaugural speech, \"and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.\" And he wasted no time in addressing it. In one of his first executive orders, Biden ordered agencies to \"root out\" systemic racism and reversed a Trump order declining various diversity and inclusion trainings. Biden also dissolved Trump's 1776 Commission, which claimed \"the left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools.\" It was an apparent rebuttal to the New York Times' 1619 Project, which examined how slavery shaped American society in the 400 years since the first slaves were brought to the American colonies. The Trump administration called it \"toxic propaganda.\" That's how much damage was caused in the U.S. in 2020 by 16 climate-driven disasters, which cost $1 billion each, as of October. The average yearly number of these disasters, ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to prolonged heat waves, has quadrupled in the last three decades, NPR's Rebecca Hersher and Lauren Sommer report. This has also been the hottest decade on record, and last year was just two-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit cooler than the hottest year ever \u2014 2016. The Earth continues to warm. The planet is now about 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 100 years ago, near the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. And it only continues to climb. Loading... While 2 degrees doesn't sound like much, as Hersher and Sommer reported: \"Climate scientists say even small changes in average temperature translate to large increases in extremes. Drought and heat feed a vicious spiral, drying out soils and plants which then lead to hotter air temperatures around them.\" The West has seen heat waves and earlier-than-normal wildfires, some of which have displaced millions of Americans. And it has seen record temperatures. Palm Springs, Calif., as of October, had experienced 147 days above 100 degrees, a record. Phoenix saw 145 days above 100 degrees in 2020, also the most ever. And all of the top five years of 100-degree-plus days there are in the 21st century. On his first day, Biden rejoined the Paris climate accord, which Trump pulled out of. He appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry to be the first-ever U.S. climate envoy, a post Biden made Cabinet level. He wants to invest $2 trillion in renewable energy and retrofitting infrastructure; put the U.S. on a course to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050; and incentivize Americans to move away from using cars where possible and more toward public transportation. Republicans argue that these initiatives would mean drastic changes to the economy, result in job losses in certain sectors and negatively impact energy companies' bottom lines. That's the average favorability rating from four of the United States' closest allies: the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan. It's the lowest in at least two decades, rivaling only when the U.S. was engaged in the Iraq War. Views of the U.S. among allies declined under Trump, and Biden is setting out to repair those alliances. Loading... \"The Biden foreign policy agenda will place the United States back at the head of the table, in a position to work with its allies and partners to mobilize collective action on global threats,\" Biden wrote of his foreign policy approach in Foreign Affairs. \"The world does not organize itself. For 70 years, the United States, under Democratic and Republican presidents, played a leading role in writing the rules, forging the agreements, and animating the institutions that guide relations among nations and advance collective security and prosperity \u2014 until Trump.\"",

The insurrection was just the latest chapter in America's ongoing battle over race, writes NPR host Sam Sanders. There is a lie some Americans tell themselves when America is on its worst behavior: \"This isn't America!\" or \"This isn't who we are!\" or \"We're better than this!\" You heard versions of this lie again this past week after armed insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol on urging from President Trump, attempting to undo the results of last November's election. Even in the halls of Congress, after the broken glass was cleared and U.S. senators and representatives were allowed back into their chambers from undisclosed locations, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska came back to this refrain: \"Our kids need to know that this isn't what America is.\" We are a country built on fabrication, nostalgia and euphemism. And every time America shows the worst of itself, all the contradictions collapse into the lie I've heard nonstop for the last several years: \"This isn't who we are.\" In the final weeks of Donald Trump's presidency, we are still collectively struggling over whether to treat his term and the reaction to it as an aberration or as a continuation of an American way of life. So much of it feels unprecedented: the emergence of the Trump-led Twitter news cycle, the abandonment of political norms we thought were etched in stone, the seemingly never-ending protest movements sprouting up in reaction to it all. It all feels new. But it is not. The images from the Capitol this past week made that clear: a noose hanging outside the building. Inside, insurrectionists carrying a Confederate flag. Members of the mob wearing T-shirts that read \"Civil War.\" Our current troubles \u2014 and our current administration \u2014 are both just the latest chapters in America's ongoing battle over race. Trump's presidency has always been about race and reacting to a nation more diverse than it has ever been. We've been reminded of that time and again since he announced his candidacy. So how can anyone still say, \"This is not who we are\"? Why do we continue to hear that same lie as the worst of America rears its head? Once you see it as such, it all makes a lot more sense. Remember, Trump began his ascent to political power on a racist lie: birtherism. He launched his campaign for the presidency calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists. His first major policy initiative was travel restrictions on Muslim-majority nations that felt a lot like a travel ban on people with darker skin. His supporters cited \"economic anxiety\" as their motivation, but they were driven by racial animus. Former KKK leader David Duke endorsed Trump twice for president. Trump's presidency has always been about race and reacting to a nation more diverse than it has ever been. We've been reminded of that time and again since he announced his candidacy. So how can anyone still say, \"This is not who we are\"? Why do we continue to hear that same lie as the worst of America rears its head? I see glimpses of who we are every day and, at the same time, a deep discomfort with that reality. That lie permeates my industry, the media. There would have been a time, several years ago, where if I had attempted to write this essay using words like \"racist\" or \"lie,\" I would have been told to rewrite it. Urged to soften the tone. To maybe not make it all about race. This is not an indictment of NPR; the entire industry did it. Much of the industry still does. Even this past week, there was hand-wringing about what to call the rioters storming the U.S. Capitol and how to describe their insurrection. But I'd be wrong to say it's only the media that nurtures the lie. Our audiences do as well. As a Black NPR host, I am often talking to mostly white audiences about race. By and large, listeners are happy to go where those conversations lead, but regularly, a loud minority shows that it actually wants no part of such discussions. Listeners send emails wondering whether I ever talk about anything but race. Others suggest I may actually have it all wrong, invoking some version of \"not all white people.\" A recent example came after an interview with an Asian American author, tracing the long history of discrimination against Asians in this country. Several white listeners wondered why other groups just didn't \"work hard\" the way their own white ancestors did. And then another listener wrote they didn't consider themselves \"the least bit racist,\" but called all Asians \"manipulative and dishonest.\" The lie is all around us. So when weeks like the one we just experienced happen, some yell the lie even louder, to our detriment. What would happen if we decided to be more honest about race the next time our nation found itself at a racial flashpoint? What might be lost? What might be gained? It's hard to know, because I've never seen us, collectively, do it before. But I know that history only yells louder each time we refuse to listen. And no lie, no matter how often it's told, can keep the truth at bay. Sam Sanders is a correspondent and host of the NPR podcast It's Been a Minute With Sam Sanders.

Hours after congressional lawmakers certified his Electoral College victory affirming he will be the next president, Joe Biden took to social media to express what countless others have before him. If the largely white, pro-Trump insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol had been Black Lives Matter protesters, there would have been a starkly divergent law enforcement response than what played out Wednesday afternoon. No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protestors yesterday that they wouldn\u2019t have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol. We all know that\u2019s true \u2014 and it\u2019s unacceptable. \"No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protestors yesterday that they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol,\" Biden tweeted Thursday. \"We all know that's true \u2014 and it's unacceptable.\" Images of throngs of people, some carrying Confederate flags and others dressed in tactical gear, who were allowed, largely unobstructed, to pillage the Capitol, have been shown on a seemingly constant loop on cable news through Thursday evening. On social media some have posted images comparing Wednesday's scene in the nation's capital to one that took place in June following the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The two scenes looked \u2013 and played out \u2013 differently. The pro-Trump supporters that descended on the Capitol were met with light resistance and it was hours before law enforcement regained control. A more aggressive, more militarized approach was used against social justice demonstrators last summer - comprised largely of people of color - who showed no threat of taking any federal building by storm. They've killed us for less! \"They've killed us for less!\" the official NAACP Twitter account proclaimed after the storming of the Capitol. Former first lady Michelle Obama said she, like so many others, was experiencing \"so many emotions\" after watching Wednesday's chaotic scenes play out. \"It left me with so many questions-questions about the future, questions about security, extremism, propaganda and more,\" Obama said in a statement. Like all of you, I\u2019ve been feeling so many emotions since yesterday. I tried to put my thoughts down here: pic.twitter.com/9xzRvrpk7y She asked, what if the rioters looked like people who attend Ebenezer Baptist Church, the historic Black church in Atlanta where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once served as co-pastor, and is now led by Senator-elect Raphael Warnock. \"I think we all know the answer,\" Obama continued, referencing how the Black Lives Matter demonstrations this summer prompted millions to reexamine their assumptions on race. \"And yet, in city after city, day after day, we saw peaceful protesters met with brute force. We saw cracked skulls and mass arrests, law enforcement pepper spraying its way through a peaceful demonstration for a presidential photo op.\" Obama was referring to the haunting scene in June that took place not at the Capitol, but Lafayette Square, just outside the White House. Federal agents aggressively cleared a pathway so President Trump could walk through the crowd and pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church. Trump's photo-op took place after he referred to Black Lives Matter demonstrators as \"thugs\" and chastised governors for allowing protests to erupt in cities across the country, imploring them to call in the National Guard to \"dominate the streets.\" Hoping to avoid a repeat of the fiasco from this past summer, the lighter, less militarized law enforcement presence early on Wednesday was by design. As NPR's Greg Myre reports, ahead of Wednesday's demonstrations Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the Metropolitan Police Dept. would be the lead law enforcement agency and it would coordinate with federal law enforcement during the protests. Myre adds that a limited number of D.C. National Guard troops, 340, were requested by Bowser to assist with traffic flow, while local police were to handle law enforcement. Asked Thursday for her response to what happened at the Capitol, the D.C. mayor characterized it as \"a failure.\" Washington lawmakers have called for a full investigation into the actions of the U.S. Capitol Police whose mission is to protect the U.S. Congress and the Capitol building. On Thursday evening Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said he would resign from his post on Jan. 16.

Still Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, who teaches African-American Studies at Princeton University, said on NPR's All Things Considered Thursday if the protesters had been demonstrating for police accountability rather than to overturn a free and fair election, she fears they would have been \"brutalized.\" \"I think that is obvious that if the protesters were Black or if the protesters were, you know, protesting police brutality, a U.S. war or something like that, that they would have been brutalized,\" Taylor said. She adds that many on the political right like to talk about conservatives being the party of law and order, but scenes like Wednesday prove that to be hypocritical. \"We saw that completely turned on its head yesterday at the Capitol,\" she said.",

Earlier in the day, the president has urged his backers to head to the Capitol. A woman was shot and killed during the assault, according to Washington, D.C., police. Her identity has not been made public.

But for two months, Trump has falsely and continuously claimed the election was stolen from him, and dozens of fellow Republican allies had planned to object to slates of electors from various states they considered contested. Lawmakers were debating an objection to Arizona's results \u2014 a swing state Trump lost narrowly \u2014 when the sessions were recessed as the Capitol Police attempted to put the complex on lockdown.

Trump urges peace but doubles down on election falsehoods On Twitter, Trump asked people to remain peaceful. He then posted a video on social media, asking the rioters to go home \u2014 but not before reiterating his baseless claims about the election being stolen and saying: \"You're very special.\" Twitter and Facebook acted to remove the video, and Twitter said it locked Trump's account for 12 hours. His response to the violence came a few hours after he spoke to thousands of supporters outside the White House, in which he repeatedly denied the results of the election, claiming without evidence it was rigged against his campaign. \"This election was stolen from you, from me, from the country,\" he said in the earlier remarks.

Federal and local authorities scrambled to send forces to help secure the Capitol after it was overrun by the pro-Trump extremists. Reinforcements were also being deployed from Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. Law enforcement eventually gained control of the scene, ushering people out of the Capitol. The House sergeant at arms informed lawmakers and staff after 5 p.m. that the Capitol had been cleared. Washington, D.C., instituted a 12-hour curfew that went into effect at 6 p.m. ET Wednesday. \"The President bears responsibility\" Many Republicans, who spent the summer castigating the mostly peaceful protests against racial police violence, had previously encouraged demonstrations calling to overturn the democratic election results. But current and former politicians from both major parties condemned the breach of the Capitol, with Democrats and many Republicans blaming Trump and his allies for inciting the mob through their repeated claims of a stolen election. The Democrat Biden said of the attack on the Capitol: \"It's not protest; it's insurrection.\" And he urged the president to \"go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege.\" \"History will rightly remember today's violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation,\" former President Barack Obama said in a statement. \"But we'd be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise. For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth \u2014 that this was not a particularly close election and that President-Elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20.\" Credit:  Alexandra Moe/NBCUniversal Former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said he was \"appalled\" by the actions of some political leaders since the election and called the \"mayhem\" at the Capitol \"a sickening and heartbreaking sight.\" \"This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic \u2014 not our democratic republic,\" Bush wrote in a statement released Wednesday evening. \"The President bears responsibility for today's events by promoting the unfounded conspiracy theories that have led to this point,\" Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said in a statement. \"It is past time to accept the will of American voters and to allow our nation to move forward.\" Sen.

Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, in a statement described the Capitol as being \"ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.\" He continued: \"Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the President's addiction to constantly stoking division.\" Other Republicans who pledged to object to electoral vote slates refrained from implicating Trump, focusing instead on quelling the violence of his supporters. \"Those storming the Capitol need to stop NOW,\" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on Twitter. \"The Constitution protects peaceful protest, but violence\u2014from Left or Right\u2014 is ALWAYS wrong. And those engaged in violence are hurting the cause they say they support.\" \"You did not win\" Despite the violent breach, Congress resumed its session Wednesday night. \"To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,\" Vice President Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, said as he gaveled the proceedings back in. \"Violence never wins, freedom wins. And this is still the people's house.\" Earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to members that the \"shameful assault\" on democracy wouldn't \"deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.\" The attack on the Capitol convinced some GOP senators, including Steve Daines of Montana and Mike Braun of Indiana, to withdraw their objections to electoral votes. Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who just lost her reelection bid, said she will no longer object to the state's results. \"The events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now in good conscious object to the certification of these electors,\" she said. Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., wrote on Twitter that the Electoral College ballots had been \"rescued from the Senate floor. If our capable floor staff hadn't grabbed them, they would have been burned by the mob.\" NPR's Deirdre Walsh, Kelsey Snell and Brian Mann contributed to this report.",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Here in Washington, Congress is expected to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election tomorrow. Starting today, far-right groups and supporters of the departing President Trump are converging in Washington, D.C., to protest the results of the free and fair election. Mikaela Lefrak of member station WAMU reports. MIKAELA LEFRAK, BYLINE: This is the third time in less than two months that Proud Boys and other far-right activists rally in D.C. The protesters have a permit from the National Park Service to gather at the Lincoln Memorial and a plaza near the White House. City officials are prepared for the crowds to spread throughout downtown D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser recognized their right to protest but urged Washingtonians who might disagree to stay away. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MURIEL BOWSER: We're asking D.C. residents and people who live in the region to avoid confrontations with anybody who's looking for a fight. And the best way to do that is to avoid the area. LEFRAK: D.C.'s most prominent resident, President Trump, tweeted that he will be at tomorrow's rally. Trump's support of the protesters and unfounded claims of voter fraud have D.C. leaders concerned that this week's crowds will be large. Bowser has called in the National Guard to assist with crowd control this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOWSER: We will not allow people to incite violence, intimidate our residents or cause destruction in our city. LEFRAK: Violence broke out during both of the previous Proud Boys protests. In December, more than 30 people were arrested, and eight police officers were injured. Demonstrators also damaged property at four Black churches and burned a Black Lives Matter banner. Yesterday, D.C. police arrested Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio on charges of destruction of property as he returned to Washington, D.C., for this week's rallies. Counterprotesters were involved in the clashes last month, but Bowser says the out-of-town demonstrators at the past pro-Trump rallies came here looking for a fight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOWSER: This is serious business. The will of American people through a fair and just election is being questioned and violence is being incited. LEFRAK: The city has shut down a number of downtown streets for the next two days. Some businesses are also temporarily shuttering, including a hotel and bar that was a gathering place for Proud Boys during the last rallies. During the December protests, four people were stabbed nearby. Police Chief Robert Contee is trying to drive home one message to people coming into the city to protest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT CONTEE: Firearms are not permitted. I repeat, firearms are not permitted. LEFRAK: Contee says he's been made aware of some protesters' plans to bring guns into the city. Even with a concealed carry license, it's illegal to bring a firearm within a thousand feet of any permitted demonstration or areas under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, like the National Mall. Contee is also concerned about the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike this summer's racial justice protesters, many of the far-right activists have not worn masks while demonstrating in D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CONTEE: There are going to be a lot of people here. We certainly anticipate that. And when we have a lot of people that are in our city, the chances for people to get sick, namely my officers and other residents, we just want to be very careful with that. LEFRAK: Despite the health concerns, Bowser says police won't be focused on arresting people who violate the city's mask ordinance. She says officers' main priority over the next two days is to curb violence and property destruction and keep people out of immediate danger. For NPR News, I'm Mikaela Lefrak in Washington.

The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol has issued a subpoena for Clark. The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol issued a subpoena Wednesday for an ex-Justice Department official who had promised to pursue former President Donald Trump's false election fraud claims. The official, Jeffrey Clark, was a key figure in a recent Senate report detailing Trump's attempts to enlist the department in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump had considered replacing his acting attorney general at the time, Jeffrey Rosen, with Clark, who was in a lower-ranking position. \"The Select Committee needs to understand all the details about efforts inside the previous administration to delay the certification of the 2020 election and amplify misinformation about the election results,\" Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. \"We need to understand Mr. Clark's role in these efforts at the Justice Department and learn who was involved across the administration.\" In a letter, the select panel is directing Clark to produce records by and to testify on Oct. 29. Among the details from the recent Senate Judiciary Committee report, Clark had proposed delivery of a letter to Georgia state lawmakers and others to push for a delay in certifying election results, the House select committee noted. Clark also recommended holding a press conference announcing the Justice Department was investigating allegations of voter fraud despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. Those plans were rejected by top leaders at the department. The new subpoena comes a day before deadlines begin for four former Trump officials to appear before the committee. The panel issued its first round of subpoenas several weeks ago to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, political strategist Steve Bannon, former Trump White House deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino and Kashyap Patel, who was chief of staff to former-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Bannon and Patel are due to testify Thursday, followed by Meadows and Scavino on Friday. However, it is unclear whether any of them will comply. The committee has said Meadows and Patel are in talks with the panel. But Bannon has already said he would not be cooperating, pointing to executive privilege as a shield allowing him to skip the demands, the committee said last week. \"Mr. Bannon has indicated that he will try to hide behind vague references to privileges of the former President,\" a statement from Thompson and the ranking committee Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said last week. A statement issued Wednesday via Erica Knight, a spokeswoman for Patel, confirmed that talks with the panel are ongoing, but didn't say if he will ultimately testify. \"I am continuing to engage with the Committee, and placing a high priority on keeping matters confidential for safety reasons,\" the statement read. Patel has received death threats after his subpoena was issued, Knight said. Trump has directed the four former administration officials to protect certain conversations and records from the investigation as a result of executive privilege. On Wednesday, a spokesman for Trump, Taylor Budowich, rejected reports that Trump directed the four not to comply outright with the committee's subpoenas. Rather, he directed related queries to his recent tweet saying executive privilege protects certain conversations and records from being shared with the panel. \"President Trump has instructed individuals to honor conversations and documents covered by executive privilege to the extent permissible by law,\" Budowich said in the Oct. 10 tweet. The latest efforts come after the panel in recent weeks issued subpoenas for the right-wing Stop the Steal group and nearly a dozen other organizers behind the rally that preceded the deadly attack on the Capitol. Those followed requests to dozens of social media and tech companies to preserve and turn over records, along with several federal agencies. The panel has said it has since received \"thousands of pages of documents.\"",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol voted Wednesday evening to refer former Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark for criminal contempt of Congress. The panel said Clark, who had promised to pursue baseless election fraud claims, shirked his legal obligation to answer questions tied to the deadly insurrection. The nine-member committee, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously in favor of the referral. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in remarks ahead of the vote: \"He chose this path. He knew what consequences he might face if he did so. This committee and this House must insist on accountability in the face of that sort of defiance. We must honor the oath we took to support and defend the Constitution.\" Ahead of the vote, Thompson said Clark had requested the chance to come in and appear before the panel to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Thompson said the committee will allow it on Saturday, but they were still moving forward with the contempt referral. The move complicates the path forward, however. A panel vote would typically send the measure to the full House for a vote. If the chamber approved it, the referral would then be sent on to federal law enforcement to potentially pursue charges. But the House may now be looking at an extended delay to resolve its next steps for Clark. For now, the referral marks the second such case for the committee, after referring ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon in October for defying a subpoena outright. Three weeks after the House approved the referral, Bannon was indicted by the Justice Department and is now fighting his contempt of Congress charges. Clark and his attorney have not responded to requests for comment. In Clark's case, he appeared with his attorney before the panel in early November, but said he was immune from answering their questions because of various arguments of legal privilege. For example, Clark refused to answer questions about former President Donald Trump and his efforts to get the Justice Department to investigate false 2020 election claims, according to a deposition transcript. The committee has also noted that Clark's former DOJ supervisors have appeared before the panel. After that Nov. 5 meeting with the committee, Thompson said he rejected Clark's claims, and noted he had a short window to reconsider or face the consequences. Clark was a key figure in a recent Senate report detailing Trump's attempts to enlist the Justice Department in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The report said Clark proposed delivery of a letter to Georgia state lawmakers and others to push for a delay in certifying election results and recommended a press conference announcing the DOJ was investigating allegations of voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. \"We've been clear and consistent throughout: Willful defiance of the committee will have consequences,\" California Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, a member of the panel, said ahead of Wednesday's meeting. \"We've shown that with Mr. Clark, we've shown that with Mr. Bannon, and we're not afraid to exercise it.\" Members of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

On Tuesday evening, the panel released more than a dozen exhibits in its contempt report for Clark, including the first publicly released transcript that shows his attorney rejecting responses on his client's behalf because of executive privilege. Clark attorney Harry MacDougald repeatedly told the panel his client would assert executive privilege and other immunity with respect to his testimony and documents. \"We do not intend to answer any questions or produce any documents today,\" MacDougald told the panel at their Nov. 5 meeting. MacDougald went on to say that Clark could also claim immunity through law enforcement and attorney-client privileges, as well as other legal shields. \"Mr. Clark finds himself in a position of having worked for a president who has asserted executive privilege, giving him a letter asserting executive privilege,\" MacDougald said. \"And therefore, as his lawyer, I can't allow him to be exposed to the risk of guessing where that line is going to be drawn. And so, for now, we are standing on executive privilege.\" Since he declined to answer the panel's questions, Clark faced challenges in his previous privilege claims, several legal analysts said. Jonathan Shaub, a University of Kentucky law professor and a former attorney at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, noted the Justice Department already authorized Clark to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee (Clark ultimately did not agree to be voluntarily interviewed in that case). Clark was a member of the Justice Department on Jan. 6 and not the White House, where executive privilege claims can protect presidential advisers. It's also unclear if Trump directly told Clark not to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel as he did with former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other advisers, Shaub said. After some back and forth with the committee, Meadows has since said he'll appear before the committee to answer questions. For Clark, his attorney claimed Trump directed him not to cooperate in a letter, which was attached to a series of immunity claims shared with the panel. However, the committee disagreed, arguing Trump in fact greenlighted Clark's testimony in that same Aug. 2 letter \u2014 sent on Trump's behalf by attorney and former Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins. MacDougald also confirmed he and his client were in receipt of a July letter from the Justice Department indicating that executive privilege does not apply to his immunity claims. Norm Eisen, a former House impeachment lawyer, noted that by Clark at least declining to testify in person, he bought himself more time on a contempt referral than Bannon. \"Now, Clark to his credit showed up,\" Eisen said. \"When you show up \u2014 unless you have a legally valid reason not to answer questions \u2014 you have to answer the questions. And he didn't.\" Eisen noted that Clark was somewhat in a similar boat as Meadows.",

            "article_content": "Some news coverage of the latest 2020 census results may have led you to think the white population in the U.S. is shrinking or in decline. The actual story about the country's biggest racial group is more complicated than that. And it's largely the result of a major shift in how the U.S. census asks about people's racial identities. Since 2000, the forms for the national, once-a-decade head count have allowed participants to check off more than one box when answering the race question. While the 2020 census results show fewer people checking off only the \"White\" box compared with in 2010, there was an almost 316% jump in the number of U.S. residents who identified with the \"White\" category and one or more of the other racial groups. Their responses boosted the size of a white population that includes anyone who marked \"White.\" Loading... The new census numbers also show that the more broadly defined white population did not keep pace with the rise in the numbers of people identifying with other racial groups over the past 10 years \u2014 with one exception. Loading... Some recent analysis of the new census data, however, has homed in on a more narrowly defined group with falling numbers \u2014 people who only marked the \"White\" box for the race question and did not identify as Hispanic or Latino (which is not a racial category according to federal standards). \"There are a lot of complications involved with how we categorize race, including the white population,\" says Jennifer Richeson, a psychologist at Yale University who studies racial identity. \"Why are many of us so interested in watching what's happening with this specific group of non-Hispanic white Americans? It's puzzling to me that we are so concerned about it.\" For decades in the news media, a population the bureau recently described as \"White alone non-Hispanic\" has become synonymous with the white population of the United States. But the country's ever-changing ideas about race and ethnicity are continuing to push academics, policymakers and other members of the public to reassess whiteness and the census data used to redraw voting maps, combat racial discrimination, guide federal funding and inform research and planning for the next 10 years. Here are other reasons why the story the 2020 census results tell about the white population is not as straightforward as you may think: The Census Bureau has to follow an official definition of \"white\" that is set by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. It says anyone with \"origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa\" should be categorized as white in federal government data about race. Still, census data is not necessarily a reflection of every U.S. resident's family tree. This information is produced through how people report their racial identities themselves, and they may have different concepts of who is \"white,\" which can be influenced by notions of white privilege, skin tone and other complicated factors. Richard Alba, a sociologist at The Graduate Center of The City University of New York who has advised the bureau about statistics on racial and ethnic diversity, argues for a broad definition of whiteness when analyzing census data, especially as more children are born to one parent who identifies as white and another who does not. \"Sometimes they think of themselves as mixed. Sometimes they think of themselves as members of a single group, and often that group is white,\" says Alba, who has written about how the descendants of Catholic, Jewish and Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Europe assimilated into mainstream U.S. society. \"I don't see how we can claim that white is a single thing at this point. Perhaps we should say white represents a spectrum more than it does a well-defined group.\" Nowadays, some people who once checked off only the \"White\" box on forms may feel \"more comfortable giving a more nuanced answer\" about their origins, says Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University who studies white identity, because \"there'll be very little social cost to it.\" \"For whites, there's almost something that I think is attractive, almost chic in some ways where you can claim, 'Well, yeah, I'm part Native American. Yeah, I'm part Asian,' \" says Gallagher, who adds that for many, whiteness is still defined by proximity to Blackness. \"What trumps everything typically is the darkness of your skin color. Racism is still very much alive and well.\" Some data crunchers have used historic terms to describe the 2.6% drop in what the bureau has called the \"non-Hispanic white alone\" population (that is, people who checked off only the \"White\" box and did not identify as Hispanic or Latino) \u2014 the supposed \"first\" time this group has not grown in the more than two centuries since the country's original count. But comparing race data from the 2020 census with data from earlier counts can be a bit like comparing \"apples and oranges,\" notes Ann Morning, a sociologist and demographer at New York University who has served on one of the bureau's committees of outside advisers. \"It's true that 'White' is the single race category that has always been with us since our very first census in 1790. But in fact, other ways in which we have shaped the census actually have an effect on that white count,\" Morning says. \"It's not just a straightforward line over time in measuring that population.\" The way the census has asked about race and ethnicity has shifted decade to decade. Until 1960, every person's racial identity for the U.S. census was determined by a government worker. In 1970, the bureau asked a sample of households about \"Mexican,\" \"Puerto Rican,\" \"Cuban,\" \"Central or South American\" and \"Other Spanish\" origins before asking the entire country about their Hispanic origins beginning with the 1980 census. The bureau has warned data users that because of changes to how the race question was asked, as well as how responses were processed and categorized, for the 2020 count, comparisons with 2010 numbers \"should be made with caution.\" There could be \"unexpected differences,\" the bureau has said, that may not necessarily be just the result of demographic shifts. Some of the bureau's changes for the 2020 census may have increased the number of people recorded as identifying with the \"White\" category and at least one of the other racial categories. Last year's census, like the 2010 count, may have also overcounted the \"non-Hispanic white alone\" population. Many people tracking far-right, white racial extremism have been concerned that misleading headlines about the new census data showing a \"declining\" white population in the U.S. could generate propaganda. \"I think the worst way in which these data can get used, and have gotten used, is by white nationalists who parrot things like, 'Our group is being wiped out. We are under threat,' \" says Richeson, the Yale psychologist who has studied how white people in general react to changing demographics. A narrative of a shrinking white population, Richeson and other researchers have found, tends to foster angst among white people about the future of their political representation and whether their \"fortunes might be in jeopardy.\" While this kind of anxiety represents a disconnect with the reality of the vast racial disparities in wealth and health, Richeson is concerned that it could fuel more extreme forms of political gerrymandering to manipulate election outcomes or lower support for government efforts to increase racial equity. \"We still live in a society where white Americans, no matter how you count them, continue to have political dominance and economic dominance,\" Richeson says. An almost 53% drop in the number of Latinos checking off only the \"White\" box compared with in 2010 caught the attention of many demographers. While it's unclear how much of the shift is the result of changes to how the bureau asked about race and how it sorted through the responses, some researchers are wondering whether racial identities among many Latinx census participants are undergoing a sea change. \"It suggests that perhaps that was an illusion that either demographers or others had that the Latinos that were identifying as white were firmly attached to that racial category,\" says Rogelio S\u00e1enz, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Texas at San Antonio whose research has focused on Latinos and racial identity. The 2020 census results also show a significant rise in Latinos identifying as multiracial, contributing to an 8% increase from 2010 in the number of Latinos identifying with the \"White\" category. Tom\u00e1s Jim\u00e9nez, a sociologist at Stanford University who studies how immigration patterns and policy have influenced Mexican Americans' identities, says the racialized politics during former President Donald Trump's administration helped set the stage for a generational shift that was also driven by the growing prominence of second-generation Latinos whose parents immigrated to the United States. \"Older people who came up in the middle of the 20th century were taught that Hispanics were white and that there might be a benefit to claiming whiteness,\" Jim\u00e9nez says. \"The U.S.-born individuals who are now answering the census have been socialized in an era of anti-immigrant, anti-Latino national politics. They are checking the census boxes with a different sensibility.\" While white people still make up more than 50% of the country, the Census Bureau's news conference and press release about the new race and ethnicity data avoided describing that population as the \"majority.\" The week before releasing the latest 2020 census results, the bureau revealed in a blog post that it's moving away from using the concepts of \"majority\" and \"minority\" when analyzing the country's diversity. How to classify certain groups has \"become more complex and contested in recent decades, especially as many people may not identify with certain population groups even if that is how they are classified and tabulated per federal standards,\" according to the blog post. Morning \u2014 the NYU sociologist and former member of the Census Bureau's National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations \u2014 sees the change as a response to criticism the bureau faced after releasing a demographic projection in 2008. By 2042, the bureau announced more than a decade ago, \"non-Hispanic, single-race whites\" would make up the minority and all other groups would become the new majority in the United States. Some demographers and other academics have warned the bureau to steer away from that kind of framing, which, Morning says, could be seen as \"scaremongering\" among segments of the white population who feel anxious about demographic shifts. The federal government, however, still uses this type of classification for data used to enforce civil rights laws. According to guidance that the Office of Management and Budget released in 2000, a person identifying with the \"White\" category and with \"one minority race\" should be \"allocated to the minority race.\" Nonetheless, in the coming decades, this way of classifying the country's racial groups may become obsolete. \"Given the trends that we're seeing, it's quite likely that in our lifetimes, no one racial group will be in the majority in the sense of having more than 50% of the population,\" Morning says. \"At that point, it won't even really make sense to talk about majorities or minorities.\"",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump is suing the the National Archives and the House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol to try to block the release of documents.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Donald Trump is going to court to try to block the release of information about his final days as president of the United States. A committee subpoenaed multiple records the ex-president does not want them to see. This House committee is asking what Trump was doing and saying when a mob tried to block the ceremonial certification of Trump's defeat in the presidential election on January 6. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is following the story. Ryan, good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What's the ex-president's lawsuit say? LUCAS: Well, it's challenging the January 6 select committee's efforts to get records from the Trump White House - things like White House communications, calendars, schedules. Lawmakers on the panel say they need these materials to understand what Trump was doing in the days leading up to January 6 and then on the day itself. The committee has requested presidential records, which are held by the National Archives, as well as materials from the Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and other executive branch agencies. Now, the lawsuit alleges that the House committee's request is too broad. It says it's almost limitless in scope. It says this is a, quote, \"vexatious, illegal fishing expedition\" and that the committee doesn't have any legitimate legislative purpose for these documents, and therefore, it isn't entitled to them. The lawsuit also says that a lot of the information in question here is covered by one form of privilege or another, whether it be attorney-client privilege or, in many cases, executive privilege. INSKEEP: You have just touched on a couple of legal terms there - legitimate legislative purpose. That would be the motivation, the legitimate motivation, for a House committee to subpoena documents. But then you said executive privilege, which has been brought up again and again over the years. What is it? LUCAS: Well, in short, it's the idea that the president can keep private certain documents, discussions, deliberations with senior advisers about official duties. It's something that presidents from both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have invoked over the years, and the office of the president has an institutional interest in protecting it. INSKEEP: Yeah, and presidents from both parties, as you say, have insisted upon this. Whoever is in the White House at the time normally has a very strong view of their right to executive privilege and an assertion of executive privilege, but in this case, the existing president is not insisting on it. LUCAS: That's right. That's right. The White House says that Trump abused his office, tried to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, and such actions shouldn't be shielded by executive privilege. The Biden White House did something similar earlier this month when it announced that Biden would waive executive privilege over some Trump records that these House investigators have asked for. It said the House investigation is unique; it's extraordinary. In essence, this is an instance in which the country would benefit from disclosure. Now, in this lawsuit, Trump's lawyers heartily disagree. They take aim at the Biden administration over this decision. The lawsuit says waiving privilege is, quote-unquote, \"myopic,\" and it says Biden's decision is just a political maneuver to maintain support with his backers, and it says the decision by the Biden administration isn't based on any discernable legal principle. Now, for its part, the House committee unsurprisingly disagrees. It says executive privilege is not absolute, and it says Trump's lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct the committee's investigation. INSKEEP: We're talking with NPR's Ryan Lucas about this House committee. It is, of course, a Democratic majority on the committee because Democrats have the majority in the House. There are a couple of Republicans also on the committee, although many Republicans have refused to have anything to do with it. And this committee is also seeking evidence from former Trump advisers, including one who is also making a claim of executive privilege - Steve Bannon. How does the lawsuit relate to Bannon's effort to avoid testifying? LUCAS: Well, Bannon was one of the first people subpoenaed by the committee. Bannon, of course, left the administration well before January 6, but he remained in touch with Trump. And the panel says it's interested in conversations Bannon had with Trump in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack and a meeting with Trump allies the night before. Bannon refused to comply with the committee's subpoena. In doing so, as you noted, he cited executive privilege, which is something that Trump encouraged. Bannon didn't show up for a planned deposition last week, and so this evening, the select committee is planning on voting to refer Bannon to the Justice Department for a criminal contempt investigation. INSKEEP: Suppose they do that - what happens next? LUCAS: It goes to the - well, the Justice Department has to decide on prosecution or not. And that's something that often, in these sorts of cases, it does not do. INSKEEP: Ryan, thanks so much. LUCAS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas.

            "article_content": "NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro and Barbara Sprunt break down the Republican led efforts in the U.S. to discourage educators from teaching critical race theory in grade-level schools.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: It may be time for summer break. Schools are closing, but there's a lot of agita still about textbooks and lesson plans. Here's some tape from Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Critical race theory is racist. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: These theories that are not based in fact. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: CRT is racist. It is abusive. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Critical race theory is the newest manufactured wedge issue, and it's following a pattern we've seen with others recently. A cultural squall pops up, gets amplified on cable news and turns into a political storm. NPR's Barbara Sprunt is going to take us through how an obscure academic theory now has parents laying siege to school board meetings. And she joins us now. Hi, Barbara. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Good morning. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We need to start with what critical race theory is and what it is not. SPRUNT: Because they are very different things. In the late '70s, early '80s, legal scholars developed an academic approach that examines American institutions and laws through the lens of race and racism. So it's been around for decades, and it's used in postgraduate studies. But many Republicans and right-wing media have co-opted this term, and they're using it as a catch-all way of describing basically any conversation about race or racism that makes white people uncomfortable. So conversations about white privilege, having dialogues about anti-racism - these have all been branded falsely as critical race theory. GARCIA-NAVARRO: In September of 2020, President Trump issued the executive order on combating race and sex stereotyping, which President Biden has rescinded. Trump's EO didn't actually mention critical race theory then, even in the sections specifying what shouldn't be taught in the armed forces or at federal agencies. It has been mentioned a lot on Fox, though. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) CHRISTOPHER RUFO: It's absolutely astonishing how critical race theory has pervaded every institution in the federal government. And what I've discovered is that critical race theory has become, in essence, the default ideology of the federal bureaucracy and is now being weaponized against the American people. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Now, that's Christopher Rufo on September 2, 2020. Talk to us about his role in all this. SPRUNT: Yeah. So Rufo is a central player in this. He's a former documentarian, and he's the one who called on Trump to issue that executive order you just mentioned. And this all started in July of 2020. A Seattle city employee sent Rufo an antibias training that they did at work, and Rufo essentially saw it as a political opportunity to manufacture a culture war issue. And he's been transparent about that. I mean, he tweeted in March of this year that, quote, \"the goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think critical race theory.\" And he added that he's rebranding the theory and driving up negative perceptions to turn it toxic. And, I mean, it's worked. I mean, you can go on Twitter and type in critical race theory, and you'll see videos of hundreds of parents at school board meetings with signs saying, stop critical race theory, even as the superintendents are saying, hey, this is not something that we teach. Saying critical race theory is being taught in schools is like saying electrical engineering is being taught in K-12. It's just not happening. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But when you talk to conservative lawmakers, what are they saying? SPRUNT: Well, the overall argument is that talking about race and racism leads to more division in an already very divided country. Byron Donalds is a Republican congressman from Florida, and he told me recently that, look. It's important to teach the full history of the country, but he thinks that the approach just further divides Americans. BYRON DONALDS: As a Black man, I think our history has actually been quite awful. I mean, that's without question. But you also have to take into account the progression of our country, especially over the last 60 to 70 years. SPRUNT: You'll also hear some Republican lawmakers and media outlets say, you know, this theory is unpatriotic. It tells white people that they're racist, you know, just for being white, when, of course, the actual theory itself is about institutions, not individuals. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right. It's about the systems that are in play and how that has actually created more difficulties for Black and brown people. But there is an actual legislative movement on this. It's not just people talking about critical race theory. They're actually legislating about it now, right? SPRUNT: That's right. I mean, this is something where perception has led to actual movement in legislatures. Republican lawmakers in nearly two dozen states have proposed legislation that would limit how teachers can talk about race and racism in the classroom. Now, just like you pointed out earlier, that Trump's executive order on this didn't actually mention critical race theory, that's the same thing that you're seeing here on the state level. Only a handful of these bills explicitly mention critical race theory, but they're moving forward regardless. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we've discussed, critical race theory is a technical term. It's sort of a framework for graduate programs. So money isn't being spent on it in public grade schools, you know, teaching it to young people. But that doesn't seem to stop people getting upset. SPRUNT: Exactly. I mean, this is a perfect culture war issue. Unlike issues like taxes or foreign policy, this is something that strikes people at their very identity. And that's what makes it an effective political strategy, to be honest. I spoke with Christine Matthews. She's the president of Bellwether Research and a public opinion pollster, and she says there's evidence that Republican voters have been responding much more to culture issues and that this issue could impact turnout in next year's midterm elections. CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: I think it's just one more addition to the culture war that the Republicans really want to fight. And Republicans are wanting to make this about othering the Democrats and making them seem as extreme and threatening to white culture as possible. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I guess that brings us right back to the right-wing media ecosystem because it's easier to conflate anything related to race with critical race theory, especially if you don't understand what it is. SPRUNT: Exactly. And from a messaging perspective, critical race theory is easy to use and is being used as an umbrella term to cover all sorts of white grievances about how society is talking about anti-racism, you know, particularly in the year following the murder of George Floyd. And Matthews says that talk news can really keep this issue top of mind for voters, even though the midterms are over a year away. MATTHEWS: That's the job of Fox News - is to keep these cultural, polarizing topics front of mind. And so for the base and for the people that, say, Fox News reaches, they can keep it alive if they want to. SPRUNT: And it seems like they want to. A study from Media Matters, a left-leaning nonprofit, recently found that nearly 1,300 mentions of critical race theory were on Fox News over a 3 1/2-month period. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. SPRUNT: Another, you know, important factor in this is the role of social media. Experts I spoke with said this is just another prime example of something that gets posted on Facebook and just takes on a life of its own. And if that's where people are getting their information, their news, they're going to be getting a lot of misinformation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thank you very much.

            "article_content": "An NBC News analysis finds at least 165 local and national groups are trying to disrupt or block lessons on race and gender. NBC reporter Tyler Kingkade explores who is waging this fight, and why.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. A battle in the culture war is being fought over critical race theory, which many conservatives say is being taught in K-12 schools. Critical race theory, CRT, examines the impact of systemic racism on American laws and institutions and is taught in some university programs. But K-12 teachers and schools that address racism in American history or America today have been accused of indoctrinating students by teaching CRT. There are now at least 165 local and national groups that are trying to disrupt or block lessons on race and gender, according to an NBC News analysis. These groups are being reinforced by conservative think tanks, media outlets and law firms. The tactics include disrupting school board meetings, ousting liberal school board members and harassing parents who support teaching about equity issues. Legislation has been drafted to ban teaching CRT. Tuesday night, at a school board meeting in Loudoun County, Va., a fight broke out, a man was arrested, and the meeting was shut down. Two-hundred-sixty people had signed up to speak. Many were protesting the teaching of critical race theory in the schools. Yesterday, at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, was asked a challenging question by Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from Florida, about teaching CRT in service academies. Milley forcefully pushed back. Yesterday morning, I recorded the interview we're about to hear with Tyler Kingkade, who has been investigating the people and the money behind this anti-CRT movement and their tactics and larger goals. He's a national investigative reporter at NBC News. He focuses on vulnerable populations, civil rights issues, education, sexual harassment and assault cases and the treatment of teens in traumatic situations. Tyler Kingkade, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with the basics. What is critical race theory? TYLER KINGKADE: Hi, Terry. Thank you for having me. Critical race theory is really a legal academic concept that was developed in the '70s and '80s. Derrick Bell is considered the father of the concept. Kimberle Crenshaw is often one of the most frequently credited scholars responsible for honing it in the 1980s. And essentially, a short way to boil it down is it's a way of studying systemic racism and its impact on society and how it permeates many aspects of society. It's a way of looking at things. And instead of - for example, you could have a debate about raising the tipped minimum wage and stick to whether it will cause food prices to go up, whether restaurants would close if they couldn't afford it, or you could debate it and talk about the fact that we have a tipped minimum wage as a result of a bargain during the New Deal to get Southern segregationist members of Congress not to block the regular minimum wage. And so looking back at those racial implications, either at the creation of a law or at the way it's handled or addressed currently. GROSS: So my understanding is that critical race theory started at the university level, and I think it actually started in law schools. But the big debate now is really being waged on the local school level - grade school. So how is critical race theory being defined by its opponents? KINGKADE: Right. So you have a situation where virtually all school districts confronted about this are saying, we don't teach critical race theory. It's not part of our curriculum. But opponents are using critical race theory as really more of a catchall to include anything teaching students about systemic racism, any mention of white privilege, and, really, the definition that they're using has expanded to include anything related to equity, diversity and inclusion. They tossed in terms like social-emotional learning. These are not things that the average person maybe gives a lot of thought about, but these are very commonly used terms in K-12 schools across the country. So what they'll do is they've highlighted, in many cases, examples of perhaps a diversity workshop for employees, a lesson for students. They'll point to things that are said during the lesson and say, this is an example of critical race theory and that it's teaching students that they are either oppressors or the oppressed and that America is basically racist at its core, and there is no redeeming value to our country. GROSS: Are the critics of CRT being taught in the schools - or what they define as CRT being taught in the schools - are they basically denying that racism has been woven into American history? KINGKADE: I would say, to an extent, they are. I've talked to a lot of parents on the side of opposing critical race theory, and many of them have told me they don't believe that systemic racism exists. I've had conversations with parents who say they don't think that they have any sort of white privilege, though they are white. I think when you get down to it, when you drill into these conversations, there is a fundamental disagreement between the parents who are getting involved and advocating against critical race theory and the way that anyone who would study critical race theory - again, like in the academic world - there's a fundamental disagreement in how they see the world. GROSS: So, you know, one of the objections to the teaching of critical race theory in K-12 schools - and you refer to this - is that it's divisive. It teaches divisive concepts. What are some of the things that are considered to be divisive concepts? KINGKADE: Well, I just - even the notion of talking about white privilege is seen as divisive or, you know, it gets back to talking about the issues at the heart of the Black Lives Matter movement, about whether Black people, people of color, are disproportionately harmed or mistreated by police. Those are issues that I think people see as ongoing and therefore unsettled and not something that we should be teaching to K-12 students. And what educators would say is, look, this is what's going on in the world. These kids know what's going on. I mean, even elementary school kids - they see what's on TV. They hear what parents are talking about, and they need some sort of frame of reference to understand these issues. So we can't just ignore them and say, well, we haven't come up with a solution to police brutality or we haven't come up with a solution to systemic racism, so let's just not talk about it for now. I mean, educators are saying, no, we - if we want our kids to be prepared to talk about them, to address them as they become of age, we need to start teaching them when they're young. GROSS: The objections to the teaching of critical race theory kind of date back to the protests last summer over the police killing of George Floyd. So what's the connection? KINGKADE: Yeah. So last year, especially during the summer, a lot of educators were searching for ways to talk about what was going on and also evaluating what they had taught already and whether they could do a better job talking about our nation's history with racism and not just boiling it down to we had slavery, the Civil War and then Jim Crow, but we passed the Civil Rights Act, and here we are today. I think, like, that's what (laughter) a lot of Americans have gone through in their education. And so very early on, educators were really taking the lead and saying, I want to do more - to do my part addressing this. And before there were these widespread demonstrations against critical race theory, last fall, I was noticing a lot of teachers getting in trouble or getting subjected to complaints from parents because they displayed a Black Lives Matter banner or because they tried to teach about what the Black Lives Matter protests were about. And they would say, look, I'm supporting Black Lives Matter as a movement, as a statement, not as an organization. There was one teacher I wrote about in Burlington, Wis., which is very close to Kenosha, which had a police shooting of a Black person last year, and that resulted in protests. And the teacher there was like, these kids are seeing what's going on. They're hearing about what's happening from their parents. I need to teach them just some basics about what's going on. But parents were upset that the mere inclusion of Black Lives Matter in any form in the classroom was something they objected to. So I would say this argument against critical race theory and this activism we're seeing here in the spring is something that was really boiling starting last year. And it just took a while before it kind of manifested itself into what we're seeing today. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. He's been reporting on how the right has mobilized against the teaching of critical race theory, the study of systemic racism, leading to the ousting of school board members accused of supporting teaching it and the drafting of legislation to ban teaching it. You've been reporting not on reflective conversations between adults who disagree about how racism should be addressed in the schools. You're reporting on pretty aggressive tactics on the local levels, and school boards seem to be under attack in some areas by opponents of CRT. Describe some of the tactics that have been used against school boards and school board members. KINGKADE: In a lot of these, they are getting to be pretty aggressive. And most of these disputes that we've seen and looked at are taking place in smaller towns or in suburbs. So this is not happening generally in the center of large cities. It's happening in places where everyone knows everyone. And so it gets very personal very quickly. We talked to folks in one town in Cumberland, Maine, where one of the lead activists against critical race theory has put up photos of school board members on his front lawn, billboard-sized photos, and then allegedly booby trapped them so that no one would take it down and displayed Christmas lights over them. We've seen - in Loudoun County, Va., they just announced that they're going to be driving around a mobile billboard on one of those small trucks with a school board member's face on it as part of their efforts to get that school board member recalled. The money is being raised at the local level in Texas as well. There's been school board races where they've attracted, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars, which may not sound like a lot, especially in what we think of when we think of how much is spent on politics. But in a small school board race, you know, it doesn't take a lot of money to have a lot of impact. And so this is very quickly becoming something that's not of scale that school boards have dealt with before. GROSS: There's been threats of violence in Nevada. KINGKADE: Yeah, in a lot of school districts in Nevada, in Arizona, in many others, they've had to move to - back from in-person school board meetings, back to remote meetings because of security concerns. They've added extra security guards and metal detectors in school board meetings that have never had those before. It's really frightening some of the people. I've also talked to people who have advocated for equity curriculum or have, you know, been part of anti-racist groups who have faced death threats and harassment online, leading them to install extra security cameras in their homes. There's a school district in Missouri where I've talked to folks that they had to - the school district actually hired security to patrol two administrators homes just because of the volume and the nature of the threats that were coming in. Again, all of it is tied in some way to this disagreement over how schools are talking about racism, gender identity and sexuality issues. GROSS: So you mentioned that some school board members who are seen as supporting teaching CRT and who aren't, like, opposed to it - that they've been vilified, and they're actually physically afraid. They need security. What are some of the things happening at school board meetings now? KINGKADE: This week in multiple states, in Texas, in Virginia, in California, there have been crowds that arrive at these school board meetings carrying signs, making noise, chanting stop CRT before a school board meeting even starts. There have been complaints - I've heard from school board members that they're getting people coming in from out of their district that have no children in their district and no connection to the schools but are still showing up to speak about critical race theory. And there have been school board members that have told me that they've had to ask for police escorts to their vehicle when they leave the building, or they've - you know, the whole school board has elected to have remote school board meetings again instead of going back to in-person. There's just a lot of fear right now because people don't know where this is leading. And this is something that has caught a lot of emotion. It's caught a lot of energy in such a short time that school administrators and school board members are worried that someone could take it too far. And they just don't know. GROSS: The Nevada Family Alliance proposed putting body cameras on teachers to make sure that they weren't teaching critical race theory. What was the reaction to that? KINGKADE: Yeah. That idea of putting body cameras on teachers is something that, as you said, has been proposed in Nevada by a conservative group. That's also something that's gained steam on certain corners of social media - on Facebook, on YouTube, where conservative commentators have said, let's put body cameras on teachers. And I think, really, the idea of that is sort of reflective of what has been going on over the last year. A lot of this activism really started as parents first got upset about schools remaining closed or remaining on remote learning. And a lot of parents will say that gave them a chance, also, to overhear what was being taught in their classes, to capture video of school lessons that before would have been in a classroom of, you know, 20 to 30 students and the teacher and nobody else. And they're saying, look; now that we've seen what's behind the curtain, we need to make sure that we never miss something again. But it's something that I don't know has a lot of backing to actually make that a reality. I would imagine it would take either action by the school boards and the school districts themselves or action by state legislatures, and then a lot of funding. But it's - I think it just represents the nature of where these conversations are going, and also just reflects - the idea of putting a body camera on a teacher also says that they don't trust the teacher. I mean - and I think, like, that's another difference here. It's not just them saying, we think the bureaucrats or the administrators running the schools are not to be trusted. But in many cases, the parents simply don't trust the teachers either. GROSS: One of the goals of this movement seems to be to oust liberal school board members. How many school board members have been ousted already by the movement? KINGKADE: So far, there's only been a handful. But according to research that we've gotten through Ballotpedia, which is a website that tracks a lot of this, there have been more school board recall initiatives and petitions launched so far in 2021 than any previous year that they've tracked going back two decades. And it's - in many cases, they're not just trying to pick on a single school board member, where that is what researchers say often would happen in the past when they try to recall school board members. They're going after ousting the entire school board. And this is happening in communities that lean blue, that lean red, that are solidly blue, solidly red. This is not something that's only a red-state phenomenon or something where conservatives outnumbered in a blue state are rising up. This is really happening across the board. GROSS: So another thing that's been happening to school boards is that many school boards feel like they are under attack because the conservative groups are demanding that the school boards make records public, like hundreds or thousands of records. And for a little school board, that can be really hard to do. It's time-consuming. It could be expensive. Talk a little bit about that. KINGKADE: Yeah. This is an interesting phenomenon. And it's one that - you know, I'm a reporter. And I file a ton of records requests. It's a very common part of my job. I'm all for open government. But this has been something that's been promoted a lot of times by activist groups, especially some of those that are organizing at the national level, to say, fill out records requests. And submit them to your school district. And ask for these materials. That is really what's been driving a lot of the outrage and drives a lot of media stories about this. This is a tactic that we've seen especially in Rhode Island, where several school districts have been inundated with records requests. In one case that got a lot of coverage in South Kingstown, R.I., a woman filled out more than 200 records requests within just a couple months. And these are not just records requests looking for, you know, tell me all the curriculum you're giving on, you know, racism lessons or lessons about American history as it pertains to racial divides. They're asking for everything from 10 years of emails with superintendents to 10 years of harassment complaints. These records requests have asked for all the reading lists for English classes from seventh through 12th grade. And this was filed by a parent whose child is just about to enter kindergarten. Initially, the school board said, this is going to take over 300 hours. It's going to cost you, the requester, close to $10,000 to fulfill because, you know, every school district is mostly allowed to charge for their time processing the records requests. And this is a relatively small school district. So they would have to reassign people to deal with this. And they're saying, this is coming at a time when we're finishing out a crazy year disrupted by COVID and trying to give kids a normal prom and just finish out, you know, one, hopefully, last school year that is disrupted by a pandemic. We just don't have time for this volume of records requests. But then when they push back and say anything about how cumbersome it is, it became a controversy because then it's seen as if they are trying to hide something. GROSS: Let's take another break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. We'll talk more about the conservative movement opposing the teaching of critical race theory after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN BATISTE TRIO'S \"KINDERGARTEN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. We're talking about the new conservative movement that has mobilized against the teaching of critical race theory. Critical race theory is the study of systemic racism, but this movement has included the study of equity issues, about equality, under this umbrella. This movement has led to the ousting of school board members accused of supporting teaching critical race theory and the drafting of legislation to ban teaching it. Kingkade has been investigating the people, money and strategy behind this movement. Prominent Republican figures are rushing in to support the parent activists who are protesting the teaching of what they describe as critical race theory. Why are Republican figures rushing in to support this? Do they have larger goals? What are their goals? KINGKADE: Yeah, there are absolutely larger goals at play. I think there are a lot of people in conservative activist circles and in Republican circles who see this as their chance at another Tea Party-like wave. There has just been a transfer of power at the national level. There's a lot of people who feel frustrated that their side lost, and they're looking for a place to channel that. And at the same time, this is really something that, I think, gives folks who get engaged with this a little ownership in it. Like, this is their school board, their school district. Like, they feel like they are the ones to make a difference. And so school boards are typically nonpartisan. I mean, these are not races where school board members, you know, run for their (laughter) nomination with the Democratic or Republican Party, but they are still elections. And so I think there is a sense - that has been, you know, explained by Steve Bannon, former Trump advisor, for example - that they can get people engaged here at the local level, get them involved in the process and then they'll be energized to propel Republicans in midterm elections as well. GROSS: Yeah. Let me let me quote what Steve Bannon said on a podcast. He said, \"the path to save the nation is very simple. It's going to go through the school boards.\" So expand a little bit more about what it would mean to have conservative-leaning school boards, what it would mean for conservative politics and politicians. KINGKADE: Yeah, and to an extent, like, conservatives have already tried to get on school boards and have been on school boards. In some of these cases, these are school districts that already have people who self-identify as Republicans. But, you know, you can go back and look at a lot of debates over what kind of textbooks will be used in school boards. You know, they can have some influence - if not directly on the curriculum as the school board, then over the superintendent - in limiting what is taught or what is approved to be displayed in school districts. For conservatives to win at, you know, getting more school board members ousted, I think it would energize a lot of folks. I would also say, you know, Steve Bannon compared this to the Tea Party wave. I mean, we are not the ones who came up with looking at this like Tea Party 2.0. That's been something conservative activists point out. If you look at scenes from school boards, whether it's this week or going back a couple months, a lot of these scenes look very similar to what we saw in 2009, 2010, when the Tea Party wave started, and folks were confronting members of Congress over the debate of the Affordable Care Act. And this is something that I do think really does have the chance to result in a Tea Party-like wave. GROSS: Trump, when he was president, weighed in on critical race theory, too. He issued an executive order - I think this was last September - ordering the Office of Management and Budget to stop funding training on CRT for federal employees, and he called the training a propaganda effort. What was he trying to do? In what way was the Office of Management and Budget funding the training of CRT? KINGKADE: This was in an order that President Trump gave after hearing about some of these trainings on Fox News. There's a conservative activist named Christopher Rufo who takes credit for inspiring this executive order because he reported last fall about how there were some trainings going on with federal contractors that subjected people to talk about their white privilege and, the way he saw it, as blaming white people for problems. President Trump took this on. I mean, Trump is known for someone who takes on a lot of these race issues with sort of a, you know - people liken it to dog-whistle politics. And so from President Trump's view, it was a step he could take, without getting members of Congress involved, to strike at a culture war issue. And at the time, you know, this was a couple months before the election. Perhaps it could rile up his base, to get people motivated to think we've got to keep Trump in because otherwise this is the kind of thinking that will wash over in a potential Biden administration. President Biden, upon taking office, immediately revoked this order banning how certain diversity training can be taught. But this was something that President Trump took action on with regard to federal agencies and federal contractors to limit how they can do these sort of diversity and anti-racism trainings for employees. GROSS: So there has been legislation drafted on the state level to ban the teaching of critical race theory in schools. How far has that gotten so far? KINGKADE: Yeah, so a handful of states have already passed some version of a ban on either critical race theory or the teaching of divisive concepts in schools. And this is something we found in our reporting, that conservative groups, like The Heritage Foundation, which is a think tank, have been hosting calls between activists leading some of these on-the-ground parent groups and conservative lawmakers to talk about the different bills, the different legislation that they've been pushing through. Republicans have also taken a step forward in other ways. For example, in Florida, the State Board of Education voted to ban it, so it didn't take a vote by lawmakers. In Montana, the attorney general issued an opinion that effectively banned or limited how critical race theory or divisive concepts can be taught in schools. And it's really unclear how these laws are going to play out. I mean, very few of them have been on the books for, you know, more than a month. So I think a lot of schools and a lot of, you know, teachers are just waiting to see, like, well, what does this mean? What can I talk about then? - because a lot of school districts said to begin with they weren't teaching critical race theory. And suddenly, this ban has passed. So what does it mean that they can't talk about it if they don't think they were teaching it to begin with? GROSS: There's a group called ALEC, which is an acronym for the American Legislative Exchange Council. And what they do is draft model legislation that can be used - conservative model legislation that can be used by states as a template. How has ALEC gotten involved in this fight about CRT? KINGKADE: Yeah. So ALEC, like the Heritage Foundation, is one of the groups that have been hosting webinars, especially over the winter between the election and the inauguration of Biden, to talk about critical race theory. And so this predates this wave of activism we've seen confronting school boards, where they were getting together and talking about how critical race theory was infiltrating schools and what needed to be done to stop it. And essentially, that's one of the ways that you can look at how this sort of gestates before it reaches local parents, who then show up at school boards to talk about it. The idea of a webinar can sound sort of, you know, dry and kind of an academic or kind of a nerdy approach to these things. But, you know, those videos then get shared. They get uploaded to YouTube. They circulate on Facebook. And as a parent, you know, in whatever town gets upset about something they hear the school is doing as it relates to gender or race, you know, they go looking for what's going on. They find these. And then they go, ah, it's critical race theory. This is what they were talking about a few months ago. This must be what I'm seeing as well. GROSS: All right, let's take another short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GERALD CLAYTON'S \"ENVISIONINGS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with NBC investigative reporter Tyler Kingkade. He's been reporting on how the right has mobilized against the teaching of critical race theory, the study of systemic racism, leading to the ousting of school board members accused of supporting teaching it and the drafting of legislation to ban teaching it. Who are some of the people, what are some of the groups that are backing the opposition to the teaching of critical race theory in the schools? KINGKADE: Yeah. So one of the first groups that sprouted up around this started last summer. It's called No Left Turn in Education. It was started by a mother living in a suburb of Philadelphia who was upset with some anti-racism lessons taught to elementary school students in her town, in her district. She wrote a letter to the superintendent saying that these were not appropriate for kids their age and that this was woke indoctrination. She was upset. She got a little bit of media coverage and then ended up going on Tucker Carlson in September. And she told me that after that appearance on Tucker Carlson, the group that she had started, No Left Turn in Education, shot up from fewer than 200 followers on Facebook to 30,000 within just a day. And she told me that, really, Tucker Carlson started her movement. She said, quote, \"he doesn't know it, but he did.\" And this is something that has kind of been how many of these other groups developed. They would start within a district and then get some media attention, and then more people would flock to join their cause. Another group that started from the top, at the national level, is called Parents Defending Education. And they've taken the approach of really going more through the teaching route, teaching parents how to become activists, how to file records requests, how to submit tips that Parents Defending Education can then share with reporters and then gen up more media attention to this issue. So there have been a handful of different groups that have taken similar approaches, though, of coordinating activists and helping them link up with other parents or giving them resources or sort of a toolkit, an explainer of how to become an activist at their local level within their own school district. GROSS: And, of course, conservative media has played a big role in amplifying the anti-CRT message. We mentioned Tucker Carlson. What else has been happening on conservative media that is making this into a really big conservative issue? KINGKADE: Yeah. This is something that has been mentioned, at this point, as of mid-June, over 1,300 times on Fox News within the past few months. There is coverage daily on Fox News. And Fox News is really the biggest platform for this. But a lot of the right-wing media have been focusing on this for months. So - you know, websites like The Daily Wire, Breitbart, Washington Free Beacon. They cover everything from the parents organizing against the school boards to individual lessons or videos that leak and they get a hold of and they can highlight as an example of what they think is too ideological or too far left of teaching to kids. GROSS: And other conservative outlets have been amplifying the message, too. And just this week, right-wing talk show host Michael Savage was on the right-wing news site Newsmax. And he said that the teaching of what he describes as critical race theory in schools is, like, exactly what was done to the Jews in Germany. And it's the road to the death camps for white people. And then the co-host of the show, Steve Cortes, had earlier say, I'd prefer to call it anti-white racism because, let's face it, no matter what flavor this takes or what shape this takes, the goal always is to shame white people. So this is becoming a big national issue. Do you think conservatives are hoping this will affect the vote during the midterm elections, that it will be a hot-button issue that drives people - that drives conservatives to the polls? KINGKADE: It is definitely something that people in conservative, in Republican circles think is going to help them in elections. This is something that aides to Republican campaigns have said is something they see as an issue they can paint all Democrats with. And I think it really remains to be seen. There's been some polling out already just within May and June that looked at this issue and Americans' approval or disapproval of it. Some of the polling, though, has found a really large percentage of Americans still don't know what critical race theory is. And I think that's one of the things here that's going on is, like, there's a rush to define it, to associate critical race theory with a negative implication before anyone else can hear about it and say, well, I've heard about critical race theory and I don't really care about it, I don't mind it. But if you can introduce it, and this first time a parent hears about it, they hear about something bad happening, then maybe they'll remember that later when it's brought up as just sort of a key word that they listen to on the campaign trail in - later in 2021 for some states like Virginia, or in 2022, when we have midterm elections in Congress. GROSS: It's such a confusing issue for some people because what's being taught in the schools isn't critical race theory, because critical race theory is something that pertains to the university level. It's, you know, it's an academic pursuit. It's not something you're going to learn in kindergarten or sixth grade or seventh grade. But the idea of racism and equity is something that is being introduced in schools. But that's not the language that the opposition is using. They're not saying we're against children learning that there's racism in American history. So do you think that the way this conservative movement is positioning and describing CRT is misleading? KINGKADE: Yes, certainly. I've talked to many parents at this point who said when they first heard the word equity, they thought it meant the same thing as equality. And only later did they find out a different definition of equity. And the way they look at it is equity, which is something that you'll hear in many companies, in many school districts as a goal, as something that they may even have someone hired to focus on, the parents against critical race theory will say equity means everyone gets the same grade or that a child who is Black or Latino is going to get a better grade just because of their race. And that's just simply not it. I mean, equity is something that has already become a dirty word in many school districts, even though if a child has dyslexia, they will get extra tutoring to make sure that they can finish reading an assignment. And it's not so that they get an automatic A grade. It's so that they can finish the assignment just like the rest of the class. That's really what equity is. But then when equity is discussed within the confines of race or class, then it becomes something that parents see as associated with critical race theory and something that they think is inherently wrong. GROSS: Well, Tyler Kingkade, thank you for your reporting. And thank you for talking with us on FRESH AIR. I really appreciate it. KINGKADE: Thank you so much for having me, Terry. It's been great to talk. GROSS: Tyler Kingkade is an investigative reporter with NBC News.

            "article_content": "The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is moving forward to hold former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in contempt of Congress after he stopped cooperating with them.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Former Trump White House chief of Staff Mark Meadows could soon face criminal charges. That's because he's defying the Democratic-led House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The committee voted tonight to recommend a contempt of Congress charge against Meadows. Ahead of that, they released a report that the lawmakers say show he played a key role in trying to overturn President Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Trump. Joining us to discuss this is NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales. Welcome back, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi there. CORNISH: This comes after Meadows was one of the first witnesses actually - right? - who was subpoenaed, and he was also starting to cooperate. So how did things kind of turn south? GRISALES: Yes. This began in late September. And Meadows did start to cooperate initially last month, turning over information from his personal account - so about 6,600 personal emails and 2,000 text messages. But then he reversed course the day before his deposition was set for last week. And he also sued the committee, saying executive privilege prevents him from cooperating further. And yet this was all happening as his book about his time in the White House was released, ramping up the committee's arguments that he cannot claim executive privilege. CORNISH: What's known about these emails and text messages that were turned over to the committee? GRISALES: So before this criminal contempt referral vote, the committee prepared a 51-page report, plus more than a dozen exhibits detailing their case against Meadows. This includes a sneak peek into some of those emails and text messages that he turned over to the panel and they want to ask him about. Among them is an email by Meadows sent the day before the attack, saying the National Guard will, quote, \"protect pro-Trump people\" on January 6. Another involves a series of text messages with members of Congress, including one with an unnamed senator where Meadows says Trump, quote, \"thinks the legislators have the power, but the VP has the power, too,\" referring to then-Vice President Mike Pence and his ability to reverse the election's result. They also refer to an effort to get state legislators to appoint a new slate of pro-Trump electors instead of the Biden electors. And finally, there were also emails from Meadows to the Trump Justice Department leaders there weeks before the attack, claiming the incidents of voter fraud that should be investigated. But, of course, those were not substantiated. CORNISH: At this point, the committee is moving ahead on a criminal contempt of Congress charge, as we mentioned in the introduction. What exactly does that mean? GRISALES: This is similar to an obstruction of a law enforcement investigation, but in this case, it's Congress. Meadows claimed executive privilege shielded him per a directive he received from former President Trump. Now, this is the third contempt referral case for the committee after ex-strategist Steve Bannon and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. By the way, Clark's contempt referral case is now pending a new appearance before the committee later this week. Bannon, however, is fighting an indictment on this. And we should note Meadows was subpoenaed at the same time, but Bannon outright defied the panel, while Meadows and his attorney bought time by engaging with the committee and turning over some documents. But Bannon's case could be a preview to the next steps for Meadows. Bannon is now facing two counts for contempt of Congress, so up to a year in jail for each plus fines - each count, that is. And hours before the vote tonight, Meadows' attorney George Terwilliger said this was a, quote, \"rush to judgment\" and, quote, \"unwise, unfair and contrary to law.\" CORNISH: Next steps? GRISALES: After the panel's action, it heads to the House floor and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Once she gets that vote in favor of the contempt referral, which we are expecting, she can then refer it to the U.S. Attorney's Office, and it will be up to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute. It's a tall order after Bannon, for example, because Meadows did try to cooperate at one point. CORNISH: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thanks so much. GRISALES: Thank you.

The White House is authorizing the National Archives to share a set of documents with the Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. Former President Donald Trump has said he plans to fight subpoenas from the panel for four former officials in his administration by using executive privilege, which is a right traditionally asserted by a White House to keep deliberations confidential. Separately, the committee indicated Friday that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon is not planning to comply with the subpoena it issued to him two weeks ago, citing his \"vague references to privileges of the former President.\" President Biden determined that asserting executive privilege was \"not warranted\" for the first set of documents gathered by the National Archives, Psaki said. She said that the panel's requests for documents would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and said Biden believes that reaching a \"complete understanding\" of what happened on Jan. 6 is of the \"utmost importance.\" In a letter to the National Archives, White House counsel Dana Remus said the documents \"shed light on events within the White House on and about January 6 and bear on the Select Committee's need to understand the facts underlying the most serious attack on the operations of the federal government since the Civil War.\" \"The conduct under investigation extends far beyond typical deliberations concerning the proper discharge of the president's constitutional responsibilities,\" Remus wrote in the Oct. 8 letter, a copy of which was obtained by NPR. In September, the select panel issued subpoenas to four former Trump administration officials: Bannon; former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; the Trump White House's former deputy chief of staff for communications, Dan Scavino; and Kashyap Patel, who was chief of staff to former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. The panel gave the four a deadline of Thursday to reply to a request for documents. The subpoenas also call for them to sit for a deposition next week. In a statement Friday, the committee's chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and its vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said: While Mr. Meadows and Mr. Patel are, so far, engaging with the Select Committee, Mr. Bannon has indicated that he will try to hide behind vague references to privileges of the former President. The Select Committee fully expects all of these witnesses to comply with our demands for both documents and deposition testimony. The committee has declined to comment on Scavino, who was not mentioned in the panel's statement on Friday. However, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., another member of the committee, told NPR that the panel has yet to receive any \"written communication\" from any of the four witnesses as of yet, including Scavino. \"Though the Select Committee welcomes good-faith engagement with witnesses seeking to cooperate with our investigation,\" Thompson and Cheney added in their statement, \"we will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral.\" While congressional subpoenas cannot be dismissed outright, if they're fought it could lead to an extended legal battle. Friday's statement followed a new wave of subpoenas on Thursday for a right-wing group, Stop the Steal, and several of its members, including far-right activist Ali Alexander. The panel is seeking testimony and records from Alexander, listed in the subpoena as Ali Abdul Akbar, and Nathan Martin. Both are connected to permit applications for the rally that preceded the deadly attack on the Capitol. The committee has also issued a subpoena to the Stop the Steal group, seeking records. \"The rally on the Capitol grounds on January 6th, like the rally near the White House that day, immediately preceded the violent attack on the seat of our democracy,\" Thompson said in a separate statement. \"Over the course of that day, demonstrations escalated to violence and protestors became rioters. The Select Committee needs to understand all the details about the events that came before the attack, including who was involved in planning and funding them. We expect these witnesses to cooperate fully with our probe.\" The panel said a group, under the name of One Nation Under God, in December 2020 submitted a permit application to the U.S. Capitol Police to hold a rally on Jan. 6 on \"election fraud in the swing states.\" However, a vendor listed on the permit application told police the group was actually tied to Stop the Steal, Alexander and Martin. When a Capitol Police official followed up with Martin, he rejected having any details on the rally, leaving the vendor \"shocked,\" the panel said. The committee said Alexander made references in public statements to the need for violence. For example, at a Dec. 19, 2020, event, Alexander said that violence had not been used \"yet.\" There, he also lauded several members of Congress, including Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who was at the event. As the committee has ramped up its work, it has issued several other requests. Last week, the panel issued subpoenas to 11 individuals who played a role in organizing the rally before the siege. Among the people served were Maggie Mulvaney, the niece of former Trump adviser Mick Mulvaney, and Trump's 2016 campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson. In August, the committee issued orders to 35 social media and communications companies to preserve relevant records, and the panel asked eight federal agencies to turn over relevant documents while also seeking details from 15 social media companies on the spread of disinformation ahead of Jan. 6. The panel has said it has received \"thousands of pages of documents.\" Republicans have painted the committee, which is mostly made up of Democrats, as nothing more than a partisan exercise.",

Russia expert Fiona Hill warns that American democracy is under attack \u2014 from within. In November 2019, Hill became one of the key witnesses at then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment hearing, where she condemned the false narrative that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election, and described the Trump administration's parallel policy channel in Ukraine to get dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. Hill worked in the Trump White House as the top Russia expert. She watched Russian President Vladimir Putin manipulate Trump, she says, and observed as Trump increasingly resembled the authoritarian leaders he admired, including Putin. \"Trump himself was a massive counterintelligence risk, because of his vulnerabilities and the fragility of his ego,\" Hill says. After her testimony at the impeachment hearing, Hill received death threats. \"I stopped answering my telephone, switched off the answering machine, got some security cameras,\" she says. \"I was advised to seal up the mail slot on my door to make sure nobody put a pipe bomb or a packet of powder through it.\" Hill grew up in the coal country of northeast England, the daughter of a miner. By the time she graduated from high school in 1984, the mines had closed down. At her father's urging, she moved to the U.S. in 1989. She became a U.S. citizen in 2002. Ultimately, I was on my own. ... I was advised to seal up the mail slot on my door to make sure nobody put a pipe bomb or a packet of powder through it. Fiona Hill Hill's new memoir, There Is Nothing for You Here, takes its title from the words her father used when he encouraged her to leave England. In her time in the U.S., Hill says she has seen the country take progressively \"darker turns,\" including the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \"The United States is teetering on the edge of violence here. We're already, I think, in a cold civil war,\" she says. \"We've got a chance now to turn this around. But if we don't take it, we're heading down that autocratic path that we've seen in other countries.\" There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the 21st Century, by Fiona Hill\n                \n                    \n                    Mariner Books\n                    \n                \nhide caption On her decision to work in the Trump administration The irony is that just before I'd been offered the job, I'd taken part in the Women's March. ... I'd gone around the White House in the protest march and then found myself called in to ask if I would take the position, and I resolved to do it because it was obvious that we were acutely vulnerable. ... I was, of course, I think, in retrospect, somewhat naive about how much one could actually get done in that domestic context. I kind of thought that more people would be fully appreciative of the national security crisis that we had on hand and realize that for, sadly, a rather lot of people around Trump and for Trump himself, this was all just a big political game and one for personal benefit. On how in her second meeting with him, President Trump called her \"darlin' \" and assumed she was a secretary In the moment, I wish I would have been able to say, \"Sorry, sir, Mr. President, are you speaking to me? I'm Fiona Hill, the senior director for Russia and Europe.\" I actually kind of have to say that I hoped that one of the guys in the room sitting much closer would have actually said, \"Mr. President, this is your Russia adviser.\" But of course, by this point, it was all too late and nobody helped me out. Nobody said who I was. ... Leaping up and looking like deer in the headlights was probably not the best professional move I've ever made, but in the moment, I was just somewhat startled. After that, I made sure that that wasn't going to be the case again. Let's just say I was not prepared well for that moment. I also have to say that I do think that the other men in the room were quite startled by it and also didn't know how to react. On the scrutiny she faced about her appearance in the testimony Immediately, the team of lawyers said, \"Well, we'll need to have someone to do your hair and your makeup, and we'll need to kind of figure out how you look on the day.\" And I felt, \"Really? Do they do this for men as well?\" I mean, it immediately brought back decades of memories as a professional person going all the way back actually to school and my childhood about the fixation that people have about how you dress and how you look. ... I always thought when I was younger, like \"God, I'm not going to be 14 forever, and eventually this won't matter.\" And you get to be 54 and it still matters, particularly if you're a woman. On how Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a strident Trump supporter, came to her testimony uninvited and stared at her to try to intimidate It was clear that it was intended to be witness intimidation. It was kind of like a middle-school or even grade-school staring contest. And I'm quite a bit older than him. And let's just say I went to a pretty rough school. I can hold my own. And he was also basically making it very clear that I was nothing. He was kind of looking me up and down ... like, \"Oh, this middle-aged woman here, who does she think she is?\" And after doing the staring contest for a period of time, and I didn't drop my gaze, he then proceeded to pick up a couple of newspapers and peruse [them to signal] that I was nothing, that I shouldn't be paid attention to. So it was quite obvious, it was glaringly obvious what he was up to. It also made it seem like a game, which I, of course, didn't consider it to be. ... It helped make it clear that this was going to be the tone, in part, for these hearings. That again, this was a political circus where I thought it was deadly serious and was trying to get across the fact that this was an issue of national security. We couldn't have the privatization of national security. Our democracy was under assault from the outside \u2014 but now, clearly, from the inside and, in many respects, he prepared me for what was going to happen next.

            "article_content": "The CDC director endorses booster shots for at-risk workers. The House panel probing the Jan. 6 attack issues subpoenas to four ex-Trump officials. The U.S. hosts a summit that will talk about China.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Late last night, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke a split decision between her own agency's advisory panel and the Food and Drug Administration. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This involves a plan for COVID vaccine booster shots for some people. The two agencies agreed on boosters for older adults, residents of long-term care facilities and some people with underlying health conditions. They diverged on the question of workers in high-risk environments. The FDA endorsed boosters for those workers. The CDC's panel of advisers did not. Walensky decided to side with the FDA. INSKEEP: Let's talk about Rochelle Walensky's decision with NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Rob, good morning. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How normal is it for the agency's director, the CDC director, to overturn her own advisers? STEIN: It's pretty unusual. The CDC director usually accepts recommendations from the CDC's advisers. And, you know, Steve, it's the latest whiplash that kind of encapsulates all the mixed signals and intense debate that's been swirling around boosters in the U.S. The committee voted unanimously to endorse boosters for anyone aged 65 and older, beginning six months after they were fully vaccinated. And they also supported a third dose for adults who have health problems that put them at risk. But that's where they drew the line. INSKEEP: OK, so I want to make sure I'm clear on what's going on here. People who've been following the news know that the FDA endorsed boosters for high-risk workers the other day. I thought it was settled. Then we find out that some people at the CDC object to this. In the end, it means nothing. Rochelle Walensky went along with the FDA. But why was it that some experts thought it was a bad idea to give boosters to high-risk workers? STEIN: Yeah, yeah. The advisors really struggled with that one. And at the end of a really long day, the panel narrowly rejected endorsing boosters for people in jobs that might put them at risk, like doctors nurses and teachers. A slight majority said there just wasn't enough evidence to support that. That put that my odds with the FDA, which just hours earlier, had authorized boosters for workers like that. INSKEEP: Well, so we have a situation there where you're saying that what - this was a close decision for some people, then, in a close vote. STEIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The panel was split almost evenly on this question. Six members voted to open up boosters for those folks, but nine voted against it. The opponents basically argued that there simply wasn't enough evidence to support giving boosters to otherwise healthy people no matter what jobs they do. Sure, immunity seems to be waning for older people. And maybe people with health problems are more vulnerable. But so far, all the vaccines are still doing a great job of keeping relatively young, healthy people out of the hospital and keeping them alive. And there may be risks for a third dose, like an inflammation of the heart known as myocarditis, which is rare but has shown up frequently - most frequently among younger men. Here's Dr. Lynn Bahta from the Minnesota Department of Health. LYNN BAHTA: I feel like we're being pulled into an emotional decision. And this is an emotional decision. But we really do have to stay with the science. And I don't think we have the data in younger age groups to make a decision for a booster dose. STEIN: But on the flip side, others argued quite passionately at times that many workers in risky jobs deserve whatever protection they can get, you know, especially health care workers who've been putting their lives on the line every day. INSKEEP: It's really interesting to listen to that argument from what you're saying there, Rob, because you have one person saying, I feel we're being pulled into an emotional decision. And there is, in some ways, an emotional response. STEIN: Yeah, yeah. You know, in a statement released early this morning, CDC Director Walensky - she sided with the argument that workers needed protection, too, in the face of the delta surge. In a pandemic, she said, the CDC, quote, \"is tasked with analyzing complex, often imperfect data and take action that we anticipate will do the greatest good, even when there is uncertainty.\" INSKEEP: NPR's Rob Stein, thanks so much. STEIN: You bet, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Some other news now - the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol issued subpoenas to four former Trump administration officials. MARTIN: They are former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, onetime White House strategist Steve Bannon, former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and Kash Patel, who was chief of staff to the acting Defense secretary the day protesters breached the Capitol building. The subpoenas, which seek documents and depositions, are the first from the Democratic-led panel. More could be on the way. INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales has been following this story. Good morning. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What is it the committee is trying to learn here? GRISALES: The panel says these four former Trump officials - Meadows, Bannon, Scavino and Patel - possess important details related to the siege. And this comes after the committee recently issued its first wave of document requests from federal agencies and social media companies and asked 35 tech and telecom firms to preserve phone records, such as text messages and other communications for these former Trump officials. But this is part of what we've been hearing from this panel for weeks now, that they're serious about getting to the bottom of what happened on January 6. And subpoenas marked the next stage of this investigation. INSKEEP: Is it clear that the committee knows what important details, as they put it, that these folks may have? GRISALES: It is somewhat. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson gets pretty specific in letters to these officials about their roles in the weeks before January 6 and where they need more information. For example, Thompson tells Meadows that Justice Department records show Meadows was in direct communications with top officials at the Department to probe election fraud in several states, as well as officials in various states to request the same many weeks after the election. In Bannon's case, Thompson raises conversations he had in the weeks leading up to January 6 with Trump in a meeting that was held the night before at a hotel just a block from the White House. This is the Willard, where he and Trump allies plotted, essentially, how to stop President Biden from taking office. Thompson says in additional letters that they want to know more about Scavino's attempts to amplify the January 6 rally and for Patel, the former DOD official, how he was intimately involved in the security plans that ultimately failed that day. INSKEEP: So I guess this ultimately gets down to the question of who was engineering this, who was planning this, who was coordinating, if anyone... GRISALES: Exactly. INSKEEP: ...This riot that we saw, this attack on the Capitol. Where's the probe go next? GRISALES: So now we see how these folks respond. Although congressional subpoenas are not something that can be ignored, it's also what could be the beginning of a legal fight if any of these individuals do not want to comply. INSKEEP: Any of the former officials responding yet? GRISALES: Not yet. Former President Trump himself said in a statement that they would fight the subpoena on executive privilege. That said, all four have been given deadlines to turn over relevant documents by October 7, so about two weeks from today. And they'll need to appear before the committee around October 14 or 15. So this is going to be a big legal test for the committee in what appears to be the beginning of these kind of requests. INSKEEP: Claudia, thanks so much. GRISALES: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Claudia Grisales. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Today, President Biden is hosting the leaders of three nations that have something in common. MARTIN: The nations are Japan, Australia and India. And they are all relatively near neighbors of China, and they've joined the United States in what's called a strategic dialogue. It's called the Quad, for quadrilateral - four countries, you see. And it matters because if you put those four countries together, you have immense economic, as well as military power, even when compared with China's growing strength. INSKEEP: NPR correspondent Lauren Frayer covers India and is with us. Lauren, good morning. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I just want to note this is a diplomatic meeting which points to possibly a new orientation of the world. Several U.S. administrations in a row have wanted to more effectively counter China. They are aware they would like some friends in the region to help do that. So how is this going? FRAYER: Well, there have been some stumbles. I mean, this week started off with this diplomatic fallout over Australia buying submarine technology that could be used to patrol waters around China from the U.S. rather than France. France saw that as a snub, recalled its ambassador. Steve, I think you spoke with the ambassador, who talked about a lack of honesty. So from the get-go this week, the U.S. was sort of on the back foot, trying to reassure France, its oldest ally. That came after what many saw as a chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, a lack of consultation with U.S. allies on that. So there are challenges going into this big week of diplomacy. And in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, President Biden said the U.S. is shifting from relentless war to relentless diplomacy. Now, what he didn't mention is actually what is thought to be his No. 1 priority, and that's China. The Biden administration wants to stand up to what it perceives as China's authoritarianism. It wants to counter China's growing influence, wants to ensure free trade in the Indo-Pacific. And so that is basically what today's Quad summit is focused on. INSKEEP: Indo-Pacific is a term that I think most Americans had not heard until recent years when the U.S. began talking of that region or those two regions as one big region kind of aimed at China. But what interests do these four nations really share here? FRAYER: Well, China has had just this incredible economic growth. And that means the balance of power is shifting pretty dramatically. There is a perception that China has become more belligerent. China has built military installations in the South China Sea. The Quad countries see that as a threat to free trade and possibly travel. But there are lots of other tensions. You know, India shares a long border with China. Troops have fought there. Australia has had trade disputes with China. There are islands in the East China Sea that Japan and China both lay claim to. And, of course, as you recall, the U.S. had this trade war with China under President Trump. Now, the thing is you probably will not hear President Biden name China very much today. And that's because all of these countries still trade with China. This is sensitive. China doesn't love the idea of these countries all ganging up and talking about it. INSKEEP: Somewhat like you said with Biden's speech, where he didn't mention China, which was sort of the implied biggest priority. FRAYER: Exactly. INSKEEP: With that said, is this union of four countries actually a defense pact? FRAYER: No. And that's an important distinction. The Quad countries do hold joint naval exercises, but there's no formal defence pact. Actually, India, for example, isn't even technically a U.S. treaty ally. India has been historically resistant to joining alliances. So this is more of a loose strategic grouping. INSKEEP: Are they actually going to announce anything today? FRAYER: We hope so. I mean, they have pledged to produce a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022. We may hear more promises about that. We may hear fresh promises about climate change, reducing coal use, moving towards renewable energy. And also, we may hear about supply chains for critical technology like semiconductors. These are supply chains the U.S. does not want China to be a part of. INSKEEP: NPR's international correspondent Lauren Frayer, thanks. FRAYER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

            "article_content": "NY Times journalist Katie Benner says a division head at the DOJ secretly plotted with the President to oust the head of the agency and join his plan to subvert the results of the 2020 election.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Donald Trump's attempts to subvert the 2020 election results and declare himself the winner are being investigated by the Department of Justice's inspector general, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. My guest, New York Times reporter Katie Benner, broke the story that led two investigations. That article revealed that Jeffrey Clark, the acting head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, tried to get DOJ leaders to falsely claim that investigations into voter fraud in Georgia cast doubt on the Electoral College results. She also reported that Clark had plotted with President Trump to oust the acting attorney general, replace him with Clark and use the Justice Department's power to force Georgia state lawmakers to overturn its presidential election results. Benner covers the Justice Department for the Times and has been continuing to report on these investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the election and what she describes as the former president's desire to batter the Justice Department into advancing his personal agenda. We're going to talk about what has been revealed so far, who else is involved and what the legal consequences might be. Benner won a 2018 Pulitzer Prize for a contribution to the Times' reporting on sexual harassment. Her article was about the culture of harassment in Silicon Valley. We recorded our interview yesterday morning. Later in the day, Benner reported that a former U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Byung J. Pak, had just told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door session that his abrupt resignation on January 4 had been prompted by a warning from DOJ officials that Trump intended to fire him for refusing to say that widespread voter fraud had been found in Georgia. Katie Benner, welcome to FRESH AIR. KATIE BENNER: Thanks for having me. GROSS: Let's start with the story you broke that led to the ongoing investigations into Trump. What was the New Year's Eve meeting about in the Justice Department? And this is New Year's Eve 2020. BENNER: So on New Year's Eve, Justice Department officials met with a man named Jeff Clark. Very few people outside of the department knew anything about him. He was the acting head of the Civil Division. And they wanted to talk to him because they had finally realized that he was trying to work with the president to send a letter to Georgia that would basically imply that the Justice Department felt that the election results in that state were invalid. As you can imagine, they were extremely upset about this. They felt that, you know, one, this wasn't true. The Justice Department's own investigations had not borne this out. And they didn't understand why Jeff Clark had been going around them secretly to have these meetings with the president, which is also a violation of Justice Department policy. The White House and the Justice Department are to communicate only through very official channels, and, you know, the attorney general would be notified. And instead, Jeff Clark had been doing this in secret. So they met to discuss Jeff Clark's behavior - his refusal to hew to the department's conclusion that the election results were valid, his decision to continually contact the White House without permission. And one of those officials - the No. 2 at the department, Rich Donoghue - told Jeff Clark that what he was doing was wrong. Nevertheless, Clark continued to speak to the White House despite the fact that he was not supposed to. And he secretly met with the president again. And this time, it was going to eventuate in the ouster of the acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen, so that the president could put Mr. Clark into his place. GROSS: Yeah, let's talk about that plot a little bit. So tell us more about the communication between Clark and the president and the plot that they came up with to oust Jeffrey Rosen, who was the acting attorney general. BENNER: So we don't know the full details of this, but what we do know is that Jeff Clark was talking to the president. He felt that there was a plan that could be implemented that nobody else in the department wanted to do, which was to send a letter to Georgia, and perhaps other states, falsely saying that the election results in that state were invalid. As you can imagine, former President Trump really liked this plan. And he thought, I finally have a guy I can put at the top of the department who will - as he, in his own words, would put it - would fight for him. He was always accusing the Justice Department of not fighting for him. And he felt he found somebody inside who would do just that - fight for him, fight for him in Georgia, fight for him in other states and overturn the results of the election or at least convince the American public the results were invalid and prolong this, you know, Electoral College process and make it really hard for Joe Biden to become president. GROSS: What did you learn about how Trump planned on ousting Jeffrey Rosen and installing Jeffrey Clark? BENNER: Well, from the point of view of the Justice Department officials who I spoke with, what they understood is that the president was amenable to making this replacement and that they felt they needed to intervene and do something. So Jeff Rosen, the acting attorney general - he reached out to the White House when he found out about this, that he could be replaced. And he said, I need to meet with the president directly to talk about this. This is ridiculous. And this is all happening on January 3. It was a really hectic day. He reaches out to the White House. In the meantime, his deputy, Rich Donoghue, is reaching out to every other head of the department, saying, this is what's going on. You haven't known about it, but it's a real problem. Can we get on the phone to discuss what we as leaders of the Justice Department will do if Trump replaces Jeff Rosen with Jeff Clark? They have an emergency phone call, and at the end of it, all of the top officials of the Justice Department agree that they will resign if this replacement happens, that they feel it would be a disaster for democracy; it would be a disaster for the department, that it would be a disaster for the election and they need to do something to stop it. So armed with that information, you see Jeff Rosen, Rich Donoghue and another department official named Steve Engel walk over to the White House and confront Jeff Clark and speak to President Trump and say, if you do this - if you replace the top of the department with Jeffrey Clark, everybody will resign. And the ensuing chaos will subsume any attention paid to your false claims of election fraud. All the American public will actually be paying attention to is this chaotic mass resignation. And that helps convince Trump not to fire Jeff Rosen. GROSS: So what happened to Jeffrey Clark? How far did he get with Trump? BENNER: You know, we know that he got far enough to convince Trump that he could possibly make a dent in the election result, that he could do something to, if nothing else, undermine the validity of the election result in the minds of the American people. We know that the president really liked Jeff Clark. You know, we see in handwritten notes that have since been revealed by investigators and Congress, that, on a phone call, you know, Trump said to Jeff Rosen and Rich Donoghue, I hear a lot of good things about Jeffrey Clark. I really - I hear that he really understands some options that could be used to, you know, possibly convince leaders in Georgia that the election result isn't valid. And in those notes, Rich Donoghue writes down what the president has said. And he writes down his own response, which is, you should have the leadership that you want, but making Jeff Clark the head of the Justice Department is absolutely not going to change the results of this election. It is not going to change anything. So you saw this sort of foreshadowing in a phone call with Donald Trump that happened just days before this showdown in the Oval Office. GROSS: It's alarming that department officials hadn't threatened to resign en masse that Trump might have succeeded with his plan to oust the acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, and install Trump's own guy, Jeffrey Clark, as the head of the DOJ with the expectation that Jeffrey Clark would carry out Trump's will and subvert the election results and declare Trump the winner - and help declare Trump the winner. BENNER: Yeah, it is alarming. And I think that for the officials inside the department in that key period of time between, you know, New Year's Eve and January 6, they were in complete shock. You know, you saw Jeff Rosen in shock that somebody who had been working for him had betrayed him in this way, somebody, by the way, who he had mentored when they both worked together in private practice at Kirkland & Ellis. You saw Rich Donahue, as you can see from his notes and other emails, just horrified by the fact that the White House refuses to listen when officials continually say these allegations of voter fraud you're bringing to us we have investigated and we have not found evidence to support them. To have that fall on deaf ears, you can see is really disturbing to him. And then when Rosen and Donohue have to tell the other officials, hey, this has been going on the whole time, the president has been trying to use the department improperly, and he found a sympathetic ally in one of your own peers - from our reporting, we saw just complete horror, again, to your point, shock and people feeling that they had no other choice but to perhaps quit their jobs en masse and make a public fuss, make a public statement and raise an alarm that nobody at the Justice Department at the very top of the department had been willing to consider through the entirety of Trump's tenure as president. GROSS: Something that I kept wondering reading your articles was, why didn't Jeffrey Rosen fire Jeffrey Clark? Would he have had the power to do that? BENNER: So Jeffrey Clark was Senate confirmed. And only the president can fire Jeffrey Clark. GROSS: Oh, well, there you go (laughter). I guess that wasn't going to happen. BENNER: But what is so unusual about this situation is that they have this really tense meeting, as you can imagine, late into the evening on Sunday night of January 3. And Jeff Clark comes into work the next day on Monday, January 4, because he's still an employee. In some of the reporting, some of the folks I spoke with, you know, they said there were just these increasingly bizarre situations where, for example, Clark is saying hi to people as though nothing happened. He wants to see if people want to go get lunch with him. There wasn't a lot of appetite for that, but that was sort of one of the very bizarre situations playing out inside of the department after this showdown is that Clark continued, to come to work and he continued to be a part of the department. GROSS: What has Jeffrey Clark admitted so far? And were you able to get a comment from him? BENNER: I'd heard, you know, rumblings inside of the department - this was all after January 6 - when I would be speaking to people and calling them to see what was going on about the January 6 investigations. I heard a lot of, yes, this is really important, but you would not believe what we just lived through over here in this building. And I couldn't figure out what people are talking about. I thought they were talking about January 6, but I kept probing. And then it clearly turned out that there was something else had happened before January 6 that people thought was really disturbing. And it was this activity by Jeffrey Clark. So, of course, in reaching out to him for comment, he did provide comment to The New York Times and other reporters who matched the story. And it said - his comment said, quote, \"all my official communications were consistent with law. There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who are part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations while also distorting any discussions.\" So he doesn't say that the conversations about how the department could have helped overturn the election results never happened. He doesn't say that his conversations with Trump didn't happen. What he is saying is that he feels that they are both legal and appropriate. GROSS: So let me reintroduce you here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Katie Benner, and she reports on the Justice Department for The New York Times. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Katie Benner. She reports on the Justice Department for The New York Times. She's reporting on investigations into Donald Trump's attempts to subvert the 2020 election results and declare himself the winner. This is being investigated by the inspector general of the Justice Department, the Senate Judiciary Committee and investigators in the House of Representatives. These investigations were kicked off by an article she reported last January. So if Jeffrey Clark considers his conversations with Trump privileged conversations, does that mean that he has the right to refuse to testify to any of the people currently investigating Trump's attempts to subvert the election results? BENNER: That is normally what that would mean because every administration has protected the idea of privilege, the idea that communications between the president and top administration officials should be kept secret and confidential because the decisions they make are extremely difficult and that the public does not need to know what goes into those decisions. They want to protect that. They want to protect those conversations, so they protect them for the administrations before them and for their own so that they will always be protected in the future. In this case... GROSS: Is there a but? Yeah (laughter). BENNER: In this case, something different happened several months later. This summer, the Justice Department under Merrick Garland made a very different decision in these conversations about the election between the White House and the Justice Department. What Merrick Garland said - what his department said, rather, because he didn't write this letter, it was a career official, not Merrick Garland. What Merrick Garland's Justice Department said was that because the investigations deal with really inappropriate behavior, privilege does not need to be invoked. The idea of executive privilege, the department argues, is something that's supposed to protect the government and the American people and allow for, you know, all Americans to benefit in some way from this idea of executive privilege. In this case, the department argues that what is being looked at is such inappropriate behavior that it's not right to invoke executive privilege because of executive privilege should not be invoked to essentially just protect the personal interests of the former president. GROSS: So let's talk about the phone call between Trump, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his top aide, Richard Donohue. What was that phone call about? BENNER: Sure. So this phone call takes place on December 27. It is many weeks after the election has been declared for Biden, but Trump is still obsessed with this idea that he can overturn the results or that he can somehow subvert them. So on this phone call, he starts making demands. Why aren't you looking into this? Why aren't you looking to that? And he brings up one theory that, in notes taken by Richard Donohue, the No. 2 at the time, you see Donohue say, OK, this is something we can actually investigate. Trump says, hey, I think more people cast ballots in Pennsylvania than there were registered voters. That seems really fishy to me. Donohue in his notes tells the president, OK, we can look into that fraud claim. The others you've mentioned, we've already looked into it, didn't find evidence, but we will look into that one. But he warns that no matter what they find, the department does not have the power to change the outcome of the election. And then he puts Trump's response in quotes - \"just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and our congressmen.\" So he's saying just say that that it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and to my allies in Congress. You know, Trump doesn't name who those allies would be, but the implication is that if the Justice Department, the nation's top law enforcement agency - still respected, still with a lot of weight with the American public - says that the election was corrupt, that is enough to create a narrative so powerful that Trump can wield it. And he can convince a lot of Americans that, no matter what happens, Joe Biden should not be president. GROSS: So what was the response to Trump's request? BENNER: So you see Donahue quote Trump as well as he can, perhaps because he found Trump's response to be so notable. And then you see in his notes that throughout the conversation he is continually saying we've already looked into this, and based on the evidence, we haven't found support for it. He tries to continue to come back to the evidence again and again. We can only act on the actual evidence developed is something that Donohue writes in his notes. You also see Trump continue to castigate his officials, saying that people are calling their local U.S. attorney's offices to complain about you. Nobody trusts the FBI. People are angry. People are blaming the Justice Department for inaction. He is really trying to do a variety of things. Trump is trying to threaten them. He's trying to say you guys are doing a bad job. He's continually saying other people are upset with you. He doesn't really say he's upset. He says other people are upset with you. And then he also says you guys don't know everything. In one of the quotes and Donoghue's notes, he says, \"you guys may not be following the internet the way I do,\" you know, according to these documents. So he is trying a variety of things. He is cajoling. He is, you know, suggesting that they could just do a better job. And he's also suggesting that they themselves don't need to overturn the results of the election. They only need to say that the results are corrupted and that he'll take care of the rest. He's just trying to get Rosen and Donohue to work with him a little bit. And Rosen and Donohue, in this very lawyerly way, push back by saying again and again we're not seeing what you're seeing. We don't have evidence to support this, and we will not do anything without evidence. GROSS: Do you know what Trump meant when he said, leave the rest to me? What did he have in mind? What - do you think that that was firing Rosen? Or what do you think? BENNER: I think that he understood that once an official body like the Justice Department says that the presidential election is corrupt and cannot be trusted, that that would be a really big deal, and it would throw everything into chaos and everything into disarray. And you can do a lot with chaos and disarray as a politician, any politician can. You know, you can sell your own narrative. You can put forth your own narrative. You can, you know, grab support from voters who might not have believed you before. You just need that official statement. What it really reminded me of so much was the Ukraine phone call that Trump had that led to the first impeachment. And I don't know if you remember this, but during that first impeachment hearing, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was apprised of the phone call, understood that Trump wanted Ukrainian officials to say they were investigating the Bidens - Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Sondland testified it was never necessary for any investigations to be opened. The investigations only had to be declared. That was the most important thing to Trump and his allies. Again, that use of an official statement in order to sow doubts in the minds of the public is something that Trump understood as a really powerful tool. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Katie Benner. She covers the Justice Department for The New York Times. We'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. If you're just joining us, my guest is Katie Benner. She reports on the Justice Department for The New York Times. And we're talking about Donald Trump's attempts to subvert the 2020 election results and declare himself the winner. This is being investigated by the Department of Justice's inspector general, the Senate Judiciary Committee and investigators in the House of Representatives. So another story you reported on is a meeting between Richard Donahue, who was the top official under Jeffrey Rosen in the Justice Department, Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin. What was this meeting about? BENNER: So during this meeting in the Oval Office, Mark Meadows was explaining that the Justice Department needed to look into an unfounded conspiracy theory that is known as Italygate. It's a widely debunked claim that people in Italy use military technology and satellites to remotely tamper with voting machines in the United States and switch votes that had been cast for Trump to votes for Biden. Now, there is nothing that the intelligence community has found to support such a thing. Donahue doesn't say at any point in his notes that they have found anything to support this kind of theory. He does say in his notes that they have an official looking into it. I spoke with different people from the previous Justice Department about that. And my sources say that indeed what they'd done is they did assign an official to kind of babysit the Italygate theory so that they could always be responsive to questions about it and basically say truthfully that they had researched it and not found anything and not found that this was true, they didn't feel that the sources involved were credible, and they could come back with real and better information. But it's a really good example of both how much Trump was willing to believe in terms of conspiracy theories brought to him, how he was willing to embrace them if they - if he felt that they gave him a shot of holding on to the presidency and how he was willing to then push those theories down through his top officials like Mark Meadows to the Justice Department with the understanding that if an agency that had credibility like the department was also willing to support or somehow cosign these theories, he could use that as a way to increase doubts about the election. GROSS: I keep wondering, why didn't anyone in the Justice Department come forward when they knew how Trump was trying to subvert the election results? BENNER: I think this is one of the big questions that investigators are also trying to get to the bottom of. When you think about what was going on in those really chaotic days after the election was declared for Biden, chaotic particularly in the White House and at the Justice Department, what we've seen from reporting from fantastic colleagues at the Times and at The Washington Post is that Trump becomes increasingly desperate, increasingly frantic about how can he make the results different. And that takes us into December. And then he starts pushing on the Justice Department ever more ardently to try to get them to do something, to try to get the Supreme Court to vacate the results, to come out and just say that something was fraudulent or corrupt, whether or not that's the case, to reexamine claims that they've already said they didn't find evidence for. And amid that push, from my reporting, what I've been told is that people were just scrambling to keep their heads above water to fend off these demands. Nobody seemed to stop to think what would the impact be if instead of simply trying to fend off the demands, if instead of simply saying that we're looking into it, to debunk it, you know, for a variety of conspiracy theories, if one of the officials had come out and said, this is what's happening, it is improper, the American public needs to know, followed by either resignation letter or just some sort of declaration - how would that have changed things? I think investigators are very curious about this issue, and that's one of the things that they have questioned, you know, they have asked officials about. I'm not sure what the answer has - you know, I'm not sure how they've answered those questions to investigators. But again, in my own reporting, what I was told is that people had begun to fear that if they left, they were not sure, one, who Donald Trump would install. Would it be somebody actually willing to do what he wanted? And two, that it would just create too much chaos. Now, we can sit here and, you know, agree or disagree that those are good-enough excuses for not publicly declaring what was going on, but that's just what I've been told. GROSS: Have any of the people who worked on behalf of Trump spoken with you recently about these ongoing investigations? BENNER: Another way to look at it, though, is whether or not any of the White House officials involved in those last few weeks of the administration have spoken with investigators, and to our knowledge, they have not. That would include former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. It would include Pat Cipollone, the former White House counsel. We do know that during his nearly seven hours of interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee that Jeff Rosen was very forthcoming about the role that Pat Cipollone, the former White House counsel, played in these final weeks. He felt that Cipollone was both privately supportive of the Justice Department and that in key moments he was willing to push back on Mark Meadows and on Donald Trump. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Katie Benner. She covers the Justice Department for The New York Times. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Katie Benner. She covers the Justice Department for The New York Times. We're talking about Donald Trump's attempts to subvert the election results so that he could declare himself the winner. What are Trump and his lawyers trying to do to prevent people from testifying in the ongoing investigations? BENNER: So that's a really interesting thing. You would have thought that the former president would have sued to prevent people from testifying or he would have made some sort of motion to prevent what could be really damning testimony being given to both the Justice Department inspector general and to investigators in Congress. Instead, he had his lawyer, the former representative from Georgia, Doug Collins, write a letter. And it wasn't a letter to Congress - which can actually make decisions about the investigation - but to write a letter to the witnesses, oddly, that simply said, we think that it's totally wrong for the Justice Department to not invoke executive privilege. We think that waiving it was disrespectful and illegal. However, we're not going to stop you from testifying. If investigators want to speak with other people who don't work at the Justice Department or who haven't already been, you know, asked to speak, then we might change our minds and file some sort of legal brief to stop it. It was a strange letter. It was strangely worded, basically saying you guys can testify, but we will act if other people are called before investigators. So you can imagine that that would include somebody like Mark Meadows. GROSS: So just to clarify, who are they saying could testify, and who would they try to stop from testifying? BENNER: So investigators in Congress - they've asked for the testimony of a few key former Justice Department officials. That would include Jeffrey Rosen, who was the acting attorney general at the time, Rich Donoghue, his deputy, the acting deputy attorney general. They've asked for testimony from a man named Patrick Hovakimian, who had acted as chief of staff to top officials and was knowledgeable about, you know, all of the efforts by Jeff Clark to both subvert the election results and perhaps even become attorney general himself. They've asked for Jeff Clark, and then they've asked for two U.S. attorneys in Georgia to come in. And what Trump said in his letter was this group of officials - I'm not going to stop them from testifying. Even though I think it's totally wrong and outrageous that the Justice Department has said they can, I'm not going to stop them. However, if investigators ask for anyone else, I could change my mind. And you could imagine that the anyone else would be likely to include somebody like Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, who - based on documents, emails, the handwritten notes of Donoghue and our own reporting - shows, you know, that he was deeply involved in all of these efforts to pressure the Justice Department. GROSS: The Justice Department already had some clues about what was happening in terms of Trump trying to overturn the election results a few days before January 6, a few days before the attack on the Capitol. What have you learned about the reaction within the Justice Department after the Capitol was invaded by Trump supporters? BENNER: In the hours after the January 6 attack, I think that the best description for what was going on inside of the Justice Department was a feeling of complete horror. You know, they felt that they had survived what they saw as a coup attempt by one of their own colleagues just days before. They felt that the election certification on January 6 would give everybody the all-clear. They could relax. The January 6 certification would happen. Biden would be officially, officially, officially declared the winner. Nothing could be done to stop it. And then it was just going to be limping through the next 14 days of, you know, whatever requests came from the White House, but they would be able to handle it. Instead, what you saw was this devastating attack on the Capitol. It was an attack on democracy. It was something that was abhorrent to the officials remaining in the building, but also kicked off the very largest criminal investigation in generations within the Justice Department - not just investigating people who would attack the Capitol, but investigating the supporters of the president. So it was also extremely politically fraught. Keep in mind, in the United States of America, we don't investigate political supporters generally. We have free and fair elections instead. We try to depoliticize law enforcement, and instead, they are put in the position of investigating the president's supporters who attacked the Capitol. It's really difficult. GROSS: There's some very incriminating information that has come out so far about what Donald Trump tried to do to nullify the Biden victory and declare himself the winner. So why do you think that it's more likely that other officials would be prosecuted, but not Trump himself? Because if he's the one pulling the strings and if he's the one doing the ask, why would he be not prosecuted? Why wouldn't he be prosecuted? BENNER: I guess the reason I'm hesitant to say that the Justice Department would want to open up an investigation to President Trump first - I guess there are two reasons for that. One is really practical, and the other is a little bit more philosophical, maybe. But the first one is that the Justice Department, as it builds cases traditionally in almost any criminal matter - you start with lower level players, and you work your way up, finding evidence and, based on the evidence, move up the chain higher. So you would start with somebody lower level, who might have just been helping the president in his efforts, figure out through that investigation what you find and whether or not it supports the idea of moving higher toward the president. So that's just a practical matter. And the other is that the very idea of criminally investigating and prosecuting a former president is really much more politically difficult in the United States than I think that, you know, the public has treated it over the last four years. We had an extremely unusual presidency marked by investigations, marked by two impeachments, so constantly marked by accusations of, you know, misdemeanors, high crimes and actual violations of the criminal code. That is not usual, but the public has been primed to believe that the idea of prosecuting a president or a former president is something that can just be done. It is something that is so unusual and we must be so careful about in the United States - truly believe that we have a democracy, we have elections, and we generally have been taught that we don't go after people because of their politics. We don't criminally investigate them or indict them. So to make that distinction is really difficult for the Justice Department. To make the distinction that we are investigating the former president for his actions rather than his political beliefs is going to be a very hard thing to do, and the department's not going to want to take that on unless they feel really certain that they can do that based on evidence. GROSS: You know, in addition to Trump's efforts to overturn the election results, we're also seeing a lot of efforts by Republicans to pass and, in many cases, succeed in having new, restrictive voting laws. We're looking at state legislatures who are passing or trying to pass laws that say they can declare fraud in the state's election results and then choose the electors for the Electoral College themselves. And we're still seeing an ongoing, you know, audit of the votes in Maricopa County, Ariz., in what is an apparent attempt to look for fraud, which has not been discovered so far, in what appears to be an attempt to overturn the election results in that county. So now the Justice Department - it's a Biden administration Justice Department. Merrick Garland is the attorney general. So what is the Merrick Garland Justice Department trying to do to protect voting rights in the U.S.? BENNER: So protecting voting access is one of the very top, top, top goals of the Merrick Garland Justice Department. It's something that Garland feels extremely strongly about. The head of the Civil Rights Division currently is a voting rights expert who has worked throughout her career to expand the right to vote and protect the right to vote. Her name's Kristen Clarke. And Garland, in June, basically announced a multipronged plan to protect voting access that we've seen him very deliberately implement over the subsequent two months. He said he's going to challenge restrictive voting laws. And indeed, the Justice Department did sue the state of Georgia over its recently enacted law, saying that this deliberately will disenfranchise and that it intends to disenfranchise Black voters. It was a really aggressive lawsuit because it says not just that the law does disenfranchise Black voters but that it intends to, and that's going to be a big thing to prove in court. The Justice Department has also sent out letters to, for example, Arizona about the audit that you've mentioned, saying this could violate - potentially violate the Civil Rights Act. One of the things that the Civil Rights Act says is that the documents around an election, including the ballots, need to be preserved for a number of months after the election. And by giving these ballots over to a private company to perform a private audit, it's unclear whether or not the documents themselves have been protected and preserved appropriately in a way that the Justice Department would deem OK. And so it's already sent out a warning signal to Arizona saying, this audit - this could violate the law. And in that case, we would take action. And the department has publicly said that Congress needs to pass voter rights legislation. Merrick Garland has personally said multiple times publicly that Congress must protect the right to vote. They must enshrine it in law because there's really only so much the Justice Department can do. GROSS: Katie Benner, thank you so much for talking with us, and thank you for your reporting.

There's now a clear path for officials from former President Donald Trump's administration to testify before Congress about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the events that preceded it. The Justice Department has notified former government officials that it has consulted with the White House counsel's office and that it \"would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege with respect to communications with former President Trump and his advisers and staff on matters related to the committee's proposed interviews,\" according to a person who has read the letter from department official Bradley Weinsheimer. The decision could clear a path for former Justice Department officials to testify about an attempt to oust then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and replace him with someone sympathetic to the former president's baseless arguments about election fraud in the days before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But the decision also could portend court challenges by Trump and others with whom he talked on Jan. 6, the person said. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, celebrated the decision. \"I am pleased that the Justice Department ... has authorized key officials to provide 'unrestricted testimony' to the Committee without asserting claims of privilege,\" she said in a statement. \"I expect prompt cooperation from these witnesses, and I am committed to getting to the bottom of the previous Administration's attempts to subvert the Justice Department and reverse a free and fair election.\" The House select committee investigating the deadly attack on the Capitol held its first hearing Tuesday. Other congressional panels have their own investigations underway. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the select committee, told reporters the panel will reconvene for another hearing in August. Asked whether subpoenas would be issued for the former president or others who served at the White House on Jan. 6, Thompson said only: \"We will follow the facts.\" NPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.",

Her 2017 memoir, Real American, is the story of her coming to terms with her racial identity.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. Our guest, Julie Lythcott-Haims, is a bestselling author whose work has a lot to say about personal growth. Her 2015 book, \"How To Raise An Adult,\" warns parents about micromanaging their kids' lives, which can prevent them from developing the independence and resilience they'll need as adults. Her 2017 memoir, \"Real American,\" is the moving story of her coming to terms with her racial identity. Her father was a prominent African American physician, her mother a white British woman. Lythcott-Haims' new book is aimed at young people just emerging into the grown-up world. It's a handbook of sorts on adulthood, offering insights and strategies on education and career choices, building friendships, coping with setbacks, staying physically and mentally healthy, managing money and more. It's called \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" Julie Lythcott-Haims is the former dean of freshmen and undergraduate advising at Stanford, where she earned her B.A. She also earned a law degree from Harvard and a master's in fine arts and writing from California College of the Arts. She joins us from her home in Palo Alto. Julie Lythcott-Haims, welcome to FRESH AIR. One of the first things you write is that young people have to embrace fending, as in fending for themselves. What's the idea here? JULIE LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: We're mammals. We're mammals, and our job as mammal parents is to ensure that our young will survive without us. Now, that might not be the answer you were expecting. This is an answer from the field of biology, and I'm not a biologist. Right? But like every mammal parent, it is our imperative to ensure that our offspring can thrive without us. And thrive without us means fend for themselves. So Dave, these are the basics. These are things like look after your own belongings, be able to procure your own food, be able to find shelter for yourself, but also be accountable for your responsibilities. Show up. Be gracious to other humans. Manage your money well. These are the basics that will propel us forward successfully in life. And there are a whole lot of young adults who perhaps have been overmanaged in childhood and haven't had to be responsible for their food or their belongings or their deadlines or their obligations. DAVIES: One of the chapters I really liked is titled \"Stop Pleasing Others,\" which is something, you know, boy, don't we all do. I mean, I don't know how many of us take our first jobs as adults because of things that can be pretty random. Right? I mean, you're - a friend or a relative connected them with an employer. And at some point you don't really think - well, is this what I want to do? You know, when people say, yeah, I realize this isn't exactly my thing here, but I have no idea what I might want to do or be, how do they get started? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Well, the first thing I want you to know is stop pleasing others was the first chapter I was able to write. I struggled with writing it, and finally I found my voice in my way into this book by summoning the deep compassion for folks who feel an obligation to please others and for folks who really don't have any idea what they want to do. So it's in the middle of the book, but it was actually my way into the subject. For folks who have no idea, this is what I say. I say, look, sit with yourself in a quiet moment. Just put down the technology, put down the noise, and try to be with yourself. Listen to what comes up when you say, what would I do if it was just up to me? Listen, what comes up when you say to yourself, what if nobody was judging me? What would I do with this life? Your soul, your spirit, your gut, your mind will start to deliver you some information. Now, your job is to try to listen for that voice and stop listening to the other messages in your mind that are the expectations and judgments of well-meaning others - family, extended family, peers, society writ large. Each one of us, I do believe, has deep within us a sense of what we're good at, what we love, where we feel a sense of connection and belonging. And figuring out what to do for work entails searching for that inner voice. And then, Dave, it entails finding the courage to honor what you hear. And that's, you know, speaking up and saying to family, hey, you know, I think instead of this job, I think I might like to try this. Instead of that graduate school program, I think I'd actually rather try this. And it's feeling the courage of those convictions. And the more you start to articulate it to yourself and to others, the braver you get about crafting your own path and marching down it. DAVIES: One of the intriguing ideas here was that you want us to connect with others. You want us to talk to strangers, make eye contact with them. Why? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Millennials and Gen Z's have been raised with the mantra, don't talk to strangers. We've done that to them. We've delivered an overbroad message around safety that really undermined the development of the skill of interacting with one's fellow humans. So I'm here in this book saying, hey, guess what? You've got to start talking to strangers. Everybody outside of your family begins as a stranger, and humans are everything. There's research that shows that whether you live a long life is a function of how great your relationships are, not whether you have high cholesterol or low cholesterol in mid-life. And so the point is you got to start connecting with people. You got to learn how to be with humans. You need to learn how to advocate for yourself, treat others with respect, ask for help when you need it, offer help to others. Interactions with humans are really the juice of this human experience. And so, yeah, I'm trying to offer a generation of folks who've maybe not built that skill - I'm trying to offer them, entice them toward doing it. Now, I want to be clear, Dave. Some people have trouble making eye contact, and it's really important to say that. This book tries to be deeply inclusive of the entirety of the human experience. So in the pages of the book, as I'm saying, try to make eye contact; it matters, I acknowledge this may be hard for you or next to impossible if you're on the autism spectrum or if you have social anxiety or if, culturally, you're not supposed to look people in the eye. I offer that caveat and then I say, all I'm saying is, if you can, it does reap some benefits. DAVIES: You know, your first book, \"How To Raise An Adult,\" warns parents against overmanaging their kids' lives. But there's one area in this book where you kind of lean the other way, and that is in the area of mental health and the growing prevalence of a wide range of, you know, conditions, disorders, diagnoses that affect young people. What do you want young adults and their families to know here? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: First and foremost, that having a mental health difficulty, challenge, disorder is normal. One in two 18-year-olds these days have a diagnosis of a mental health difficulty or a learning difference. In the past, we would have asterisked such things near the back of a book. Oh, hey, if you have a struggle, go to Page 359. No, I'm putting the fact that many, many, many of us contend with various situations, as I call them in the book - I'm putting that center of the page. There's nothing wrong with you. This is a normal aspect of the human condition to struggle in some way, shape or form with stuff. So I want any reader who is dealing with something, whether it is a diagnosis or there isn't a diagnosis for it, but something is clearly up, I want that reader to feel seen and supported and normalized, as I am trying to do for every single reader. DAVIES: Yeah. Well, and you confess that your own son, Sawyer, who was diagnosed with ADHD early, struggled and there were ways that you probably should have been more attentive to it. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Yeah. Dave, I've raised Sawyer here in Silicon Valley, Palo Alto, - really bright kid and just was rooting for him to be magnificently successful in the hardest classes. And he got a diagnosis of ADHD and anxiety when he was in the fourth grade. And I think in hindsight, my husband and I didn't quite understand what that meant. He seemed to be so smart and capable and kind and lovely and had good friends and was doing just fine. And we really failed to deeply understand the diagnosis. And, boy, did those chickens come home to roost. As I say in the book - and I have my son's permission to share this - he really got into a downward spiral when he got to college. When the scaffolding of home and high school was taken away, this kid began to really struggle. And that's when my husband and I finally bought all the books on ADHD and anxiety. When our son came home from college, Dave, he saw the books stacked on our desks. He saw that we had flagged them up with Post-it notes. And he looked at me and he said, Mom, I saw the books. And my heart started to beat rapidly because I thought, oh, no, he's going to feel like we're pathologizing him. We're reading up on our son and his diagnoses. And I felt really fearful. And my son looked at me with a smile. And he put his hand on my shoulder. And he said, Mom, thank you for taking an interest in understanding who I am. And so I put that story in the book, Dave, because - and I say in the book, if you need somebody to read this page, flag it, because I have made that mistake as a parent. And if there's anything I can do to be of use to others, I mean, that's, I think, my metapurpose in being a writer and being an author and trying to put my stories on the page and other people's stories on the page, to help readers have an easier time of it. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Julie Lythcott-Haims. Her new book is \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF VITO LITURRI TRIO'S \"JUST A DREAMER\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Julie Lythcott-Haims. Her new book is \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" We'll also talk about her 2017 memoir called \"Real American.\" Your memoir, I have to say, this is a really powerful read. And it's a coming-of-age story. A lot of it is about wrestling with racial identity. Let's just talk about your family. Tell us about your father first. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: My father was born in the Jim Crow South in 1918. He would have been 102 if he was still alive. He emerged out of that incredibly racialized environment, went to college at Bates, went to med school at BU, became the first Black professor at a medical school south of the Mason-Dixon Line in the 1950s, went off to West Africa to help eradicate smallpox, became the assistant surgeon general of the United States under President Jimmy Carter. And I'm the product of his second marriage to my mother, a white British lady. DAVIES: Right. And they met in Africa. How did she get there? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Well, my mother left England as a 22-year-old. She was fleeing a difficult circumstance there and got a teaching job in Ghana teaching math and science to nursing students. My father was a diplomat doing this work around public health in Ghana. And they met at a party. And they sat on a couch and talked for hours and fell in love. And they were together from that night until the night that my father died in 1995. DAVIES: You were born in Nigeria, right? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: I was. They moved from Ghana to Nigeria. And that's where I was born. Yeah. DAVIES: Yeah. And you came to the States when you were young. You lived in Manhattan for a while, then to a community in - I guess, near Palisades, N.Y., right? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Right. DAVIES: Do you remember as a child noticing differences in the way white people reacted to your father from your mother? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Absolutely. I remember being 3 or 4, walking down a sidewalk in our town, holding my daddy's hand. And a white man walked toward us with a sneer on his face, such an angry look that it frightened me. It looked to be the face of a snarling dog. But it was simply a man. And I gripped Daddy's hand for reassurance. And I looked up at him. But he didn't look down at me. He just gripped my hand tighter and pursed his lips and kept walking. And I think, in some ways, being a kid of a white person and a Black person allowed me to A/B test of racism or interactions with strangers. Nobody looked at my mother with that snarling, angry face. They looked at her sometimes with pity and disdain. But there wasn't the anger when she was holding my hand. And I couldn't have called it racism when I was 4. But I knew I was meant to be afraid, and I was. DAVIES: Wow. That memory stays with you from the age of 4. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Absolutely. DAVIES: Wow. You write that in kindergarten or maybe first grade, you say you were learning that something might be wrong with you. And kids would ask - what are you? - and express surprise that your mom was white. And you would mention this to your parents. What did they say? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: You know, my parents were choosing to raise me in white communities. And that was a decision my dad made. He was, as I said, a product of the Jim Crow South. He was determined to be unfettered by racism. He had experienced seven years of freedom in West Africa as a Black man, where his skin color did not hold him back. And now he had returned to the United States. My parents tried to reassure me that you are Black. You are beautiful. Every parent of a mixed-race child is told tell them they're Black because the world will see them as Black. And they need to grow up proud of that identity. And so my parents were there with that rhetoric. But I didn't understand it. I had this white mother. And it was clear to me that the world valued her more than my Black daddy. So I was wondering as a 7-year-old, why isn't Mommy using her whiteness to rescue me and Daddy from this pit it appears we have fallen into because of our skin color? DAVIES: The pit being what? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: The pit of unworthiness. I mean, by 7, I think I had consumed enough media, enough messaging. I was preferring white dolls. I was preferring white stories. I mean, I was, like, any - it sounds so awful to say this. I mean, I'm now this 53-year-old, self-loving Black woman. But I'm dipping back into those early stories and trying to tell the truth of them, which is I knew by 7 that something was wrong with Blackness. And I thought, I have this white mother. So maybe we're a little better since we have this white family member. DAVIES: You write that your mom was the Blackest white lady you knew, maybe even the Blackest person you knew - in what way? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: So Mom was this 22-year-old who left England for West Africa and was embraced there by Ghanaians and by Nigerians, really came into her own in West Africa and moved to America with my father in 1969. And for the first time then, as a 30-year-old, discovered American racism. The dresses she wore were made of fabrics she'd bought in West Africa. So my mother had a consciousness around Blackness, around Blackness being beautiful. And she was bringing that into our home in America, trying to raise this Black, biracial daughter of hers to be self-loving. She was saying all the right things. She was putting up posters of Black girls and women in my childhood bedroom. She was bringing me \"A Snowy Day\" by Ezra Jack Keats, the first children's book to feature a Black character. And yet I felt it was performative. I knew something was wrong with Blackness. I had been taught that. And I felt a growing annoyance. Here's my white mother trying to tell me I'm Black. She didn't know what to do with my hair. My hair was this mess of tumbleweed. There weren't products then. And she didn't know how to deal with Black hair either. And so I just felt odd. I felt like an other. DAVIES: There are so many moments that you describe in the book where you run up against white racism, you know, in small moments, subtle ways, I mean, I guess what people often call microaggressions nowadays. I want to get you to share one little story with us. This is - you were in fifth grade. And there was this teacher, Mr. Polanski (ph), right? And there was a question of, are you going to get into the gifted and talented group in the grade? Tell us the story. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Polanski is a pseudonym, as you might expect. Yes. I was in fifth grade at Lake Anne Elementary School in Reston, Va. This is when Daddy had just gotten his position as assistant surgeon general for the Carter administration. So my best friend Susie (ph) gets pulled into gifted and talented. This was a predominantly white school. Susie is white. And Susie and I are best friends. And Susie is very smart. And I also know that I'm smart. And I know Susie's not any smarter than I am. So she gets pulled into gifted and talented. And it looks awesome. She gets to do cool projects and puzzles. And I'm a little jealous. So I go home to my mom and I say, you know, Susie got pulled into this new thing they have called gifted and talented, question mark. And my mom looks back at me sort of - question mark. And she says, that doesn't sound right. I mean, yes, Susie should be there, but why not you? And so she goes to Polanski and she talks about it. But Polanski is not persuaded. And so my mom escalates to the principal. And this is where my mother's privilege as a white woman, as a very educated person herself, shows up and is of use to me. And she insists that I be tested. And they do test me. They give me an IQ test. And they mail the results to our house. And Mom thinks I'm not watching when she opens the envelope and reads it and squirrels it away in a drawer. And I get put in the gifted group soon after. And then shortly after that at a - in an assembly for our whole grade, Mr. Polanski says to nobody in particular, to the entire room before the assembly starts, he just folds his arms across his chest and he announces, apparently, all it takes to be gifted is for your parent to meet with the principal. And I knew he was talking about me. And I knew he was talking to me. But, Dave, I had peeked at the letter from the district, which said I was in the 99th percentile. Damn, I wish I didn't have tears in my voice right now because I'm 53. And I'd like to be over this hurt, this sleight that I experienced in the fifth grade. And in the fifth grade, I sat there and looked at Polanski. And I didn't say this out loud. But in my head, I uttered a very silent F you because I knew what he was doing. And I learned in that moment, some teachers are not going to see what I'm capable of because of my race. They're not going to see it. And I am going to have to prove, prove, prove myself every single time. DAVIES: It's remarkable because, you know, when you're in fifth grade, you're - what? - 10, 11? You could be crushed by that, you know? Is he right? Or I resent my mom coming to see the principal. You didn't. You said, up yours. Yeah. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: (Laughter) Yeah. Yeah. No. You know, I wasn't crushed. That is, it fueled me. It gave me a velocity that said, you better make sure this doesn't happen to you again. But I was crushed in a different sense. I learned more about humans. I learned that some humans are unkind and disrespectful. I lost a bit more innocence about how humans can be. DAVIES: And you still feel that harm today? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Well, you know what? I think I feel it. I feel it in my bones because it's there. But I also know it's still happening today. So part of what I think I'm expressing, if subconsciously, is a whole lot of empathy for any kid in a classroom today who is marginalized or unseen because of some aspect of their identity. And that's why my book aims to be so inclusive of all readers, right? I don't want a single person to read this book and feel, oh, wow, she only wrote this for white people. She only wrote this for straight people. She only wrote this for Christians. She only wrote this for highly educated people. I mean, I've just gone to some lengths to put a whole lot of people in the pages of \"Your Turn\" because I've lived a life of being unseen and marginalized. DAVIES: We're going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Julie Lythcott-Haims. Her new book is \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" Her 2017 memoir is called \"Real American.\" We'll talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN BATISTE'S \"KINDERGARTEN\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. We're speaking with author Julie Lythcott-Haims about her new book, \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult,\" and her 2017 memoir, \"Real American,\" which deals with her childhood, growing up and coming to terms with her racial identity. Her father was a prominent African American physician, her mother a white British woman. Lythcott-Haims is also the author of the bestseller \"How To Raise An Adult.\" I guess you were 10 when you moved to the Washington area, where your father went to work for - in the Carter administration as an assistant surgeon general. You moved to northern Virginia, where there was some diversity among your friends and mates and classmates. But after Ronald Reagan won the election in 1980, your dad was out of a job, and he got an academic post in Wisconsin. And you moved to a suburban neighborhood outside Madison where, as you describe it, you know, the middle school and high school were overwhelmingly white. And, you know, what's awful about this is that, in adolescence, when you're a teenager, maybe more than any other time in our lives, we - you know, there's such peer pressure, and we really just want to fit in, right? I mean, you - be what other people are - around us are like, and that was just so impossible for you. You know, you're living in this world surrounded by all these white kids. And of course, there are - I mean, you said, essentially, in the paper that the only Black people you saw on a regular basis were your family. On the other hand, there were a lot of media images of African Americans. And I'm wondering kind of how all that affected you and your sense of yourself. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Yeah, I think the media was this pingpong. It was either the stereotype of Blackness that was routinely showing up in the news about us being violent or lazy or - you know, just all of these stereotypes. And on the other side, there was \"The Cosby Show.\" \"The Cosby Show\" debuted while I was in high school. And as problematic as the legacy of that show may be, it was a lifeline for me as a Black kid growing up in the cornfields of Wisconsin, where everyone and everything was white, and I was searching for clues about how I was supposed to think and talk and what I was supposed to care about. It was a touchstone to Blackness. Now, of course, it was an upper-middle-class family, which was also our status. I mean, it was a very privileged Black family, which I - well aware is not the typical Black experience. Nevertheless, it did mirror my experience. So the media became this push-and-pull. I was trying not to be, never to be, the stereotypical Black person, constantly trying to prove my worth, prove my smarts, prove that I wasn't trying to steal from somebody in a store, you know, or that I wasn't bad. I was desperately running from the stereotype and running toward this sort of model, this idealized version of Blackness. DAVIES: There's one other incident in high school that I have to ask you about, and that was your 17th birthday and the locker decoration that your dear friend Diana made. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Yeah. Dave. Oh, Dave (laughter). Let me set the scene. I am a senior. I am the only Black student in the school, although a Black freshman will move in in the ensuing months and will be beaten up in a bathroom. But I don't know that yet. It is my 17th birthday. I have been elected president of the student council. I'm on the pompom team. I'm on the state championship concert choir. I'm popular. I have friends. And I'm now president of the student body, and I'm feeling kind of like I own the place. You know, I'm feeling good, and I'm smart, and I'm doing well. I'm achieving. And I've dressed up for my 17th birthday. I've put on a beautiful dress and high heels and spent extra time on my makeup. And I know that Diana will have made me a beautiful locker sign - five sheets of white paper taped together down the length of this 5-foot locker with imagery and words cut out from magazines. And I know she's going to do this 'cause this is what we do for each other. I've just done it for her birthday. And I'm delighted just anticipating it. I walk into school. I see it. People are saying, happy birthday. I'm smiling and saying, thank you. And I look at the sign, and it's gorgeous. And Diana is there, and we're just - you know, we're best friends, and we're just admiring what she's done, and we're laughing. And I put my backpack in the locker, and I grab a couple of books for my next couple of classes, and I go to class. And at some point later that morning, somebody came by and wrote the N-word three times on my birthday sign. They were so ignorant they only spelled it with one G. But I knew what they meant. And I was so ashamed that it happened. Now, this sign was cluttered with beautiful imagery and language. So it wasn't - it didn't stand out. It wasn't a glaring set of N-words. It was tucked into the white space between all of the pictures and words that Diana had put on this sign. And so when I saw it, my mouth went dry. I saw it as people were - you know, in the passing time between classes. And I just pressed my back up against the locker so no one else would see. And then the bell rings. Everybody's gone. And I race over to the office. And they all know me there because I'm the student council president, and they don't bat an eyelash over the fact that I'm not in class - Julie must be up to something good. And I ask for a black Magic Marker, and they give me one. And I race back to my locker, and I go to those three iterations of this shameful word, and I cross them out, time and time again. And I'm done. And the sign stays up all day. And I take it home, and I put it in my scrapbook on the blank page next to my homecoming tickets. And right before folding this sign up and closing it into the scrapbook, I take a scissors and cut out these three black boxes that are now lids on top of the N-word, and I throw them in the trash. And though they were in the trash, they were also embedded in my psyche. DAVIES: Did you tell anyone? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: I didn't tell anybody. DAVIES: Anybody? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: I didn't tell anybody. By anybody, I mean nobody. I didn't tell my parents, Diana. I had a boyfriend at the time; I didn't tell him. I didn't tell the school. I didn't tell even myself again that it had happened until I went back to school at age 44 to get an MFA in writing to try to develop the craft and the confidence to write books. And I was in a poetry class where I wrote the polyvocal poem, a poem in seven voices, trying to reflect the voices around me in high school. And this person who wrote the N-word on my locker was one of the seven voices. So I buried it from age 17 until age 44. But you know what? I spent many of those decades simply trying to never be called the N-word again, trying to be the model \"Negro,\" air quotes, who would just be smart and be capable and be articulate and be this, that and the other so that that would never happen to me again. And that was, really, the beginning of this self-loathing that I describe in the memoir, \"Real American,\" where I'm - we would call it internalized oppression. That's a more formal term. But I was so self-loathing, so ashamed to be the person who had been called the N-word. I didn't feel any agency around speaking up for myself or asking for help. I think I also wasn't positive that help would come. DAVIES: You know, if that were to happen today - I mean, one can't be sure - but I could readily imagine that it would be a media story, and there would be outrage and, you know, action by the school. I don't know what would have happened had you done it then. But you were - as you said, you were accomplished. You were popular enough to be class president. I have to believe you would have gotten a lot of support, and there would have been a lot of outrage on your behalf. Did any of that even cross your mind? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: No. And I do want to just say, I was student council president, which is different than class president. I don't want to take the due from the person who had that role. But, no, it would be different today. In so many places, it would. But what I say to educators today when I talk about this is, if one caring adult had thought to themselves in advance to say to me on my arrival at the school, hey, Julie, you look really different from most of the kids here. Let's face it. You come from a really different background. Should anything ever go down, please know that I'm here. Please don't hesitate to come knock on my door. If one - one - teacher had said that to me, I think maybe I would have felt less alone in that school and in that moment. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Julie Lythcott-Haims about her 2017 memoir called \"Real American.\" She also has a new book which offers advice to young people entering the grown-up world. It's called \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with author Julie Lythcott-Haims. Her new book which offers advice to young adults entering the grown-up world is \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" We're also talking about her 2017 memoir called \"Real American.\" You were accepted to Stanford. And you write that college, you hoped, would be your chance to make Black friends, even learn how to, quote, \"be Black,\" unquote. And, you know, when you got there, during student orientation, you saw a flyer to a welcome event sponsored by the Black Community Services Center. There was a kind of an African American-centered dormitory, and a lot of kids stayed there. You decide to go. What was the experience like? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: I walked up to this dorm lounge. I could see through the window a whole lot of Black and brown kids who seemed to already know each other. There was laughter. There was just sort of a relaxed vibe, and I longed for that. But I also felt instantly like an outsider. I thought, how do these kids already know each other? Aren't we all freshmen? And I just worried. I worried I don't have what it takes to interact with Black kids. I don't know Black kids. I don't know how to be Black. They're going to know I have a white mother. They're going to know I grew up in white spaces. I just - that internalized oppression was just shouting at me, you don't belong, you don't belong, you don't belong. I knew I wasn't white, but I was also pretty sure by that time of life that I wasn't Black, either. It looked like this enticing treehouse in the woods, and I was climbing the ladder and, you know, wanting to be let in but couldn't even bring myself to knock at the door. I mean, I did go in, but I just felt really out of place. I thought they were rejecting me. In hindsight, what I can tell you is I was showing up with such a look of, I don't belong, I'm afraid, I'm afraid you won't like me, I'm afraid I'm not Black enough - I was showing up with that vibe oozing out of my pores, probably screaming out of my eyes, that the looks that I saw as rejection from the Black community, from students in the Black community that I was encountering, were really this sort of internalized self-rejection. And I know that because once I became this self-loving Black person who was no longer ashamed to be so light-skinned and have this white mother, the Black community was there to embrace me, and folks said, hey, we've been waiting for you all along (laughter). Welcome. DAVIES: It took a long time to get there, I know. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: It did. But boy, was it the most loving embrace I've ever experienced. DAVIES: There's a painful section here, which - I'm just going to read this, where you write that - much later, you write that what you now know to have been true of yourself in childhood and young adult - (Reading) One, I hated being Black. Two, I was afraid of Black people. Three, I tried to be what white people valued. I will just tell readers that the journey to your coming to a different perspective on all this is fascinating reading. And we won't have time to go through all of it here. Is there a moment that you could share that was important in that journey? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Yeah. So what you've just shared is probably the most vulnerable writing I have ever put to page and published in a book. And I felt it was essential because it was my truth and because it was the pivot point for me. I said those things out loud before putting them in the pages of a book. I said them to my executive coach at Stanford. I'm now - I've been a corporate lawyer. I've been - I'm a university dean at this point. I'm working with an executive coach who's helping me be more effective in the workplace. And I admit to her these three things that you've just listed, and I am probably sobbing in the most ugly way as I say these things 'cause I feel, first of all, that I'm the only person who's ever felt this way about my own people, and I'm so ashamed. And then what happens is - it's like I've released it from me. I realize that this racism, this internalized oppression that made me feel those things, had had a clamp on my heart, on my psyche. And what I've effectively done is - it's been like a bully that's been holding on to me and that I finally turned around and faced it and said, stop it. And when I had the guts to say that out loud to someone I trusted and to myself, I made the bully run away. And that self-loathing self-loathing was replaced within an instant by self-love. And the best way I can describe it to you is the next day I came to work - and I'm working on the Stanford campus; I know tons of people. There are a lot of Black folks on the campus, folks I've known for quite some time - students, faculty, staff. And it's like every Black person got a memo saying, will you smile at Julie today? And I think what was happening was I was finally smiling at myself. I was finally this self-loving Black person saying - you know what? - it's not about what white people think. I am a person who's worthy of being treated with dignity and kindness. Black people are amazing humans. And I was saying that to myself. So now as I'm walking through the world and encountering Black folks, my eyes are saying the same thing to them, which is why I'm getting smiles back. It was the most beautiful transformation. And I know listeners may have a hard time understanding, and yet I know there are listeners nodding their heads with understanding because if you have been a member - if you are a member of a marginalized group and you have felt that degree of internalized oppression, you know what that feels like, and you are longing for that liberation. And it is available to you when you just turn and face what has been done to you and decide - you know what? - I am in charge. I'm not going to let them define how I feel about myself. DAVIES: Your father died several decades ago, I guess, right? You were in your 20s. You did talk to your mom about some of these issues and the difficulty that you had growing up in this white community and this white high school. Can you tell us about that conversation? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: My amazing mother, Jean Lythcott - 82 years old. And we've chosen to conjoin our lives, live together, to try to afford living in Silicon Valley. And so we are a part of each other's daily lives. And for that reason, as I have come to this place of self-love as a Black woman and come to terms with an upbringing that was quite flawed in many ways - although I know my parents are doing their best in choosing to raise me in predominantly white, almost exclusively white communities at times, it harmed me. And I have needed them to know. The person I need to take it up with is Daddy. I think Daddy is the parent who probably should have known better. But as I've said, I couldn't. I didn't even know to have this conversation. I didn't have this consciousness before he died. So I've taken it all out on my white mother, which I say with a chuckle, but also with a lot of compassion. Mom was the only parent here as I was doing this work, and boy, did I go at it with her. And to her credit, all my mother has ever wanted is for her Black daughter to love her Black self. She has wanted that for me since I was born. And so she has this profound delight that I have arrived at this place. And what she will say to me through tears is, I was doing the best that I could. And I am able to say through tears, Mom, I know you did. I know you are doing the best you could. So we have had that reckoning. And it wasn't one conversation. It was many conversations. Mom began quite defensive. And of course, that just fueled my anger. And we've now moved through that and gotten to a place where we can accept that we've lived very different life experiences. For a while, my mother, I think, felt, you know, I married your father; I've given birth to you. You know, I am white, but - I am not that typical white person. And I've said, yes, but, mom, when the Ku Klux Klan is marching, you know, in the streets of Charlottesville, Va., they're coming for people who look like me, not for people who look like you. Your whiteness shields you from that. Even though you love Black people in the deepest part of your bones, you are not Black. And we do have different experiences, and I really would like for you to acknowledge that. It doesn't mean you love me any less, but please don't purport to have the same experience I do. That's been an important conversation. I think that's a conversation any white parent who's got multiracial kids or transracially adopted kids of color, that white parent needs to understand, you know, you can have compassion - and you must - but you are not walking the same path as your children. DAVIES: Yeah. And how did your mom respond to that point? LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Beautifully - absolutely beautifully. She's incredibly emotionally intelligent as well as fiercely intellectual. And she understands it on all levels. And she's doing the work. You should see her. She's part of the League of Women Voters here in Palo Alto. She's doing a lot of anti-racism work in our local community. She's an educator. She cares deeply about the experience of kids of color in the public schools because she was my parent, and she knows what I went through. And she is still fiercely advocating for the right of Black and brown children to be fully seen and supported and heard and cherished in the classroom. DAVIES: Well, Julie Lythcott-Haims, it's been great talking to you. Thank you so much for speaking with us. LYTHCOTT-HAIMS: Dave, thank you so much. What an honor and a pleasure. Thank you. DAVIES: Julie Lythcott-Haims' new book is \"Your Turn: How To Be An Adult.\" Her 2017 memoir is called \"Real American.\" Lythcott-Haims is also the author of the 2015 bestseller \"How To Raise An Adult.\" Coming up, John Powers reviews the first English translation of \"Lady Joker,\" a crime novel that sold a million copies and spawned a movie and TV series in Japan.

A day after lawmakers shared an explosive series of text messages sent to Mark Meadows during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, the Democratic-led U.S. House voted to hold the former Trump White House chief of staff in criminal contempt of Congress. The Tuesday evening vote, cast almost completely along party lines, triggers a series of steps to send the referral to the U.S. attorney's office, leaving the Justice Department to decide whether it will pursue a prosecution in the case. If so, Meadows could face up a year in jail for each contempt, plus fines. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chair of the select committee investigating the Capitol riot, said Tuesday that it was a \"difficult matter\" to move forward with the referral, especially as Meadows is a veteran House member from North Carolina. But as a former lawmaker, Meadows should have been more aware of the consequences for defying a subpoena, Thompson argued. \"There was a steady stream of communication between certain members of Congress and Mr. Meadows about matters central to our investigation,\" Thompson said on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"We have questions about those communications. We will pursue those questions and we won't let the facts be buried by a coverup.\" Most Republicans who spoke on the House floor Tuesday rejected the committee's claims, saying it was an illustration of a partisan attack tied to former President Donald Trump. \"Mark Meadows is our former colleague, he is a good man and he is my friend,\" said Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan. \"This is as wrong as it gets. You all know it. But your lust for power, your lust to get your opponents is so intense, you don't care.\" Meadows initially cooperated with the panel, turning over thousands of private emails and text messages, but reversed course last week. A day before he was due to appear for a Dec. 8 deposition, Meadows said he would no longer be cooperating, triggering the committee's criminal referral process. \"How we address Jan. 6 is the moral test of our generation,\" the panel's ranking Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in floor debate. \"It is very sad to see how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are addressing this issue. Mr. Meadows has refused to testify about non-privileged material, he is contempt.\" On Monday, Cheney shared a litany of text messages she said Meadows received during the Jan. 6 siege. From Fox News personalities to Donald Trump Jr., they all urged Meadows to get then-President Trump to end the violence, she said. On Tuesday, she read another series of text messages sent by unnamed Republican lawmakers to Meadows: \"It's really bad up here on the Hill,\" read one message, Cheney said. \"The president needs to stop this ASAP,\" read another, she said. \"Fix this now,\" Cheney read of yet another Republican member text message to Meadows. During floor debate, additional select panel members read more text messages from unnamed lawmakers to Meadows, including one saying they needed an \"aggressive strategy\" to overturn the election results. Thompson told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the lawmakers in the messages may be identified later, and didn't rule out potential discussions with them at a later date. \"At some point they will be [named], but it's a little premature to do it right now,\" he said. Thompson has noted that of the more than 300 witnesses who have appeared before the panel so far, three were the targets of subpoenas issued by the committee. The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas. Additionally, the panel has also received more than 30,000 documents, and nearly 250 tips, Thompson has noted. On Tuesday, Meadows, through his attorney, rejected claims he \"stopped cooperating.\" Attorney George Terwilliger said in a statement that Meadows could not appear before the panel and violate executive privilege claims retained by Trump. \"He has fully cooperated as to documents in his possession that are not privileged and has sought various means to provide other information while continuing to honor the former president's privilege claims,\" Terwillger said in a statement. Terwilliger noted the committee's use of personal messages Meadows turned over to the panel as part of a larger effort to pursue a contempt referral against him. \"What message does that duplicity send to him as well as to others who might be inclined to consider cooperating in good faith to the extent possible?\"  Terwilliger argued. Meadows has also sued the committee in an effort to block enforcement of subpoenas it had issued. President Biden waived executive privilege in Meadows' case, which supersedes any other claims, the committee argues. The issue of executive privilege is also at the center of a Trump lawsuit, which the former president hopes will be heard by the Supreme Court after losing a ruling before an appellate court. Meadows' book covering his time in the White House, The Chief's Chief, was released last week, complicating his executive privilege claims. Late Sunday, the committee released a 51-page contempt report on Meadows along with more than a dozen exhibits documenting the panel's exchanges with Meadows since he was among the first witnesses subpoenaed. The report noted that during a short window when Meadows was cooperating, he turned over to the committee about 6,600 pages of records from his personal email accounts, plus about 2,000 personal text messages.",

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., vice chair of the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, speaks during a meeting on Capitol Hill Monday. Prior to a unanimous vote to refer Mark Meadows for contempt of Congress charges, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the ranking Republican on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, read a series of text messages she said Meadows received during the Capitol attack. In the messages, several figures, including Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, urge Meadows to get then-President Donald Trump to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol. Cheney said Meadows, who was Trump's White House chief of staff during the siege, turned over the materials before he stopped cooperating with the panel. Her full remarks, as well as the remarks of the committee chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., are below: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here to address a very serious matter, contempt of Congress by a former Chief of Staff to a former President of the United States. We do not do this lightly.  And indeed, we had hoped not to take this step at all.  For weeks, we worked with Mr. Meadows' counsel to reach an agreement on cooperation.  But shortly before his scheduled deposition, Mr. Meadows walked away from his commitment to appear, and informed us he would no longer cooperate. We believe Mr. Meadows is improperly asserting executive and other privileges.  But this vote on contempt today relates principally to Mr. Meadows' refusal to testify about text messages and other communications that he admits are not privileged. He has not claimed, and does not have any privilege bases to refuse entirely to testify regarding these topics.  Let me give just three examples: First, President Trump's failure to stop the violence. On January 6th, our Capitol building was attacked and invaded.  The mob was summoned to Washington by President Trump.  And, as many of those involved have admitted \u2013 on videotape, in social media, and in Federal District Court \u2013 they were provoked to violence by President Trump's false claims that the election was stolen. The violence was evident to all \u2013 it was covered in real time by almost every news channel.  But, for 187 minutes, President Trump refused to act when action by our President was required, indeed essential, and compelled by his oath to our Constitution.  Mr. Meadows received numerous text messages, which he has produced without any privilege claim \u2013 imploring that Mr. Trump take the specific action we all knew his duty required. These texts leave no doubt:  the White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.  Republican members of Congress and others wrote to Mark Meadows as the attack was underway: -\"Hey, Mark, protestors are literally storming the Capitol. Breaking windows on doors.  Rushing in.  Is Trump going to say something?\" -\"We are under siege up here at the Capitol.\" -\"They have breached the Capitol.\" -\"There's an armed standoff at the House Chamber door.\" -\"We are all helpless.\" Dozens of texts, including from Trump administration officials, urged immediate action by the President: -\"POTUS has to come out firmly and tell protestors to dissipate.  Someone is going to get killed\" -\"Mark, he needs to stop this. Now\" -\"TELL THEM TO GO HOME\" -\"POTUS needs to calm this s*** down.\" Indeed, according to the records, multiple Fox News hosts knew the President needed to act immediately.  They texted Meadows that: -\"Hey Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home...this is hurting all of us...he is destroying his legacy.\" Laura Ingraham wrote. -\"Please get him on tv. Destroying everything you have accomplished.\" Brian Kilmeade wrote. -\"Can he make a statement?...Ask people to leave the Capitol.\" Sean Hannity urged. As the violence continued, one of the President's sons texted Meadows: \"He's got to condemn this s*** Asap.  The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.\" Donald Trump, Jr. texted. Meadows responded: \"I'm pushing it hard.  I agree.\" Still, President Trump did not immediately act. Donald Trump, Jr. texted again and again, urging action by the President: \"We need an Oval address.  He has to lead now.  It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.\" But hours passed without the necessary action by the President. These non-privileged texts are further evidence of President Trump's supreme dereliction of duty during those 187 minutes.  And Mr. Meadows testimony will bear on another key question before this Committee:  Did Donald Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly seek to obstruct or impede Congress's official proceeding to count electoral votes? Mark Meadows testimony will inform our legislative judgments. Yet he has refused to give any testimony at all \u2013 even regarding non-privileged topics.  He is in contempt of Congress. Second, Mr. Meadows also has knowledge regarding President Trump's efforts to persuade state officials to alter their official election results.  In Georgia, for instance, Mr. Meadows participated in a phone call between President Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger.  Meadows was on the phone when President Trump asked the Secretary of State to quote \"find 11, 780 votes\" to change the result of the presidential election in Georgia.  At the time of the call, Mr. Meadows appears to have been texting other participants on the call.  Again, Mr. Meadows has no conceivable privilege basis to refuse to testify on this topic. He is in contempt of Congress. Third, in the weeks before January 6th, President Trump's appointees at the Justice Department informed him repeatedly that the President's claims of election fraud were not supported by the evidence, and that the election was not, in fact, stolen. President Trump intended to appoint Jeffrey Clark as Attorney General, in part so that Mr. Clark could alter the Department of Justice's conclusions regarding the election.  Mr. Clark has now informed the Committee that he anticipates potential criminal prosecution related to these matters and intends in upcoming testimony to invoke his 5th Amendment Privilege against self-incrimination. As Mr. Meadows non-privileged texts reveal, Meadows communicated multiple times with a member of Congress who was working with Clark.  Mr. Meadows has no basis to refuse to testify regarding those communications.  He is in contempt. Conclusion: January 6th was without precedent.  There has been no stronger case in our nation's history for a congressional investigation into the actions of a former president.  This investigation is not like other congressional inquiries.  Our Constitution, the structure of our institutions and the rule of law \u2013 which are at the heart of what makes America great \u2014 are at stake.  We cannot be satisfied with incomplete answers, or half-truths; and we cannot surrender to President Trump's efforts to hide what happened.  We will be persistent, professional and non-partisan.  We must get to the objective truth and ensure that January 6th never happens again. This week, I expect that roughly a dozen key witnesses will provide testimony on the record in our investigation. We'll hear from many more informally as we continue to gather facts about the violence of January 6th and its causes. That should put us well north of the 300 mark in terms of witnesses who have given us information. Add to that more than 30,000 records, and nearly 250 substantive tips on our tip line. The Court of Appeals here in Washington has ruled, quickly, in our favor regarding the Select Committee's work to uncover relevant information. And day by day, we're getting a clearer picture of what happened, who was involved, who paid for it, and where that money went. So I'm pleased to report we're making swift progress. And before too long, our findings will be out in the open. We will have public hearings. We will tell this story to the American people. But we won't do it piecemeal. We'll do it when we can tell the story all at once, start to finish\u2014not leave anyone guessing and not allowing it to fade into the memory of last week's news. This story is too important. The stakes are too high. We have to do this job right. And that means we have to address the handful of outliers soberly and appropriately. That's why we're here this evening. The Select Committee's report referring Mr. Meadows for criminal contempt charges is clear and compelling. As White House chief of staff, Mr. Meadows played a role in or was witness to key events leading up to and including the January 6th assault on the United States Capitol. Don't let lawsuits or op-eds about executive privilege by Mr. Meadows or his representatives confuse you. It comes down to this: Mr. Meadows started by doing the right thing\u2014cooperating. He handed over records that he didn't try to shield behind some excuse.  But in an investigation like ours, that's just a first step. When the records raise questions\u2014as these most certainly do\u2014you have to come in and answer those questions. And when it was time for him to follow the law, come in, and testify on those questions, he changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn't even show up. Now, this happened the same day his book was published. The same book that goes into detail about matters the Select Committee is reviewing. It also details conversations he had with President Trump and others\u2014conversations we want to hear more about.  He has also appeared on national television discussing the events of January 6th. He has no credible excuse for stonewalling the Select Committee's investigation. My colleagues will get into some of the particulars about what landed us here tonight. But I'd like to take a step back for a moment and think about what it means to stand in the way of the Select Committee's work. A small group of people have gotten a lot of attention because of their defiance. But many others have taken a different path and provided important information about January 6 and the context in which the riot occurred. Anyone who wants to cooperate with our investigation can do so. Nearly everyone has. Our democracy was inches from ruin. Our system of government was stretched to the breaking point. Members and staff were terrorized. Police officers fought hand to hand for hours. People lost their lives. We want to figure out why and share that information with the American people. And either you're on the side of helping us figure out why... or you're trying to stop us from getting those answers. You can parade out whatever argument you want, but really, that's all there is to it. In real life, there aren't a lot of bright-line moments. This is one of them. And if you're listening at home, Mr. Meadows, Mr. Bannon, Mr. Clark, I want you to know this: History will be written about these times, about the work this Committee has undertaken. And history will not look upon any of you as a martyr. History will not look upon you as a victim. History will not dwell on your long list of privilege claims or your legal sleight of hand. History will record that in a critical moment in our democracy, most people were on the side of finding the truth, of providing accountability, of strengthening our system for future generations. And history will also record, in this critical moment, that some people were not. That some people hid behind excuses\u2014went to great lengths to avoid answering questions and explaining what they had done and what they knew. I predict that history won't be kind to those people. What's especially jarring about the referral we're considering tonight is that Mr. Meadows was a member of this body for more than seven years. He was a leading voice in certain corners, even, briefly, the Ranking Member of the Oversight and Reform Committee. It's not hard to locate records of his time in the House and find a Mr. Meadows full of indignation because, at the time, a prior administration wasn't cooperating with a congressional investigation to his satisfaction. Whatever legacy he thought he left in the House, this is his legacy now. His former colleagues singling him out for criminal prosecution because he wouldn't answer questions about what he knows about a brutal attack on our democracy. That's his legacy. But he hasn't left us any choice. Mr. Meadows put himself in this situation and he must now accept the consequences. So I will support the Select Committee's adoption of this report, recommending that the House cite Mark Randall Meadows for contempt of Congress and refer him to the Department of Justice for prosecution.",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Capitol attack has voted to hold Mark Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress, sending to the full House a referral for the former Trump White House chief of staff to face a criminal charge. The Monday night vote was months in the making. Meadows had initially cooperated with the panel and turned over thousands of emails and text messages, but he reversed course last week, saying a day before he was due to appear for a deposition that he would no longer be cooperating with the probe. Ahead of the vote, the panel's ranking Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, read a litany of text messages she said Meadows received during the Jan. 6 siege, urging him to get then-President Donald Trump to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol. Cheney said the messages that Meadows turned over came from lawmakers, Fox News hosts including Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, and even Donald Trump Jr. \"He's got to condemn this s***,\" Trump Jr. wrote to Meadows, according to Cheney. \"The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.\" She said Meadows responded, \"I'm pushing it hard.\" Cheney said Trump Jr. replied again and again, including: \"We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.\" Full @RepLizCheney statement on holding Mark Meadows in contempt, including texts from Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and others: \"These text messages leave no doubt...multiple Fox News hosts knew the president needed to act immediately. They texted Mr. Meadows.\" pic.twitter.com/KxrVMS4CTZ The nine-member committee, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously in favor of the referral. \"It comes down to this: Mr. Meadows started by doing the right thing \u2014 cooperating. He handed over records that he didn't try to shield behind some excuse. But in an investigation like ours, that's just a first step,\" Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in remarks ahead of the vote. \"When the records raise questions \u2014 as these most certainly do \u2014 you have to come in and answer those questions. And when it's time for him to follow the law, come in, and testify on those questions. He changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn't even show up.\" The Democratic-led House is expected to vote on the referral \u2014 and approve it \u2014 on Tuesday. The Department of Justice would decide whether to prosecute Meadows. This week, the panel is due to hear from another dozen witnesses or so, Thompson noted, bringing the count of those appearing before the committee to more than 300. The panel has also received more than 30,000 documents, and nearly 250 tips. Earlier on Monday, Meadows, a former U.S. House member for North Carolina for more than seven years, said through his attorney that the committee's referral was unwise, unfair and contrary to law. The remarks were part of a six-page letter attorney George Terwilliger sent to Thompson and Cheney. Meadows and his attorney went on to argue that a criminal referral of a senior-most presidential adviser declining to testify before Congress would violate separation of powers principles. \"It would ill-serve the country to rush to judgment on the matter,\" Terwilliger said. Last month, Meadows turned over documents and agreed to appear for the Dec. 8 deposition. But he reversed plans on Dec. 7, the day before his scheduled deposition. Also last week, Meadows' book covering his time in the White House, The Chief's Chief, was released, complicating his claims he could not discuss certain conversations with the former president. \"The same book that goes into detail about matters the Select Committee is reviewing,\" Thompson said on Monday. \"It also details conversations he had with President Trump and others \u2014 conversations we want to hear more about.\" Meadows has also sued the committee in an effort to block enforcement of subpoenas it had issued. At the heart of the disagreement is Meadows' claim that executive privilege, a legal shield that protects presidential communications, blocks him from cooperating. Trump directed Meadows after his Sept. 23 subpoena not to share certain documents or conversations as a result of the privilege claim. However, President Biden waived executive privilege in Meadows' case, which supersedes any other claims, the committee argues. Executive privilege is also at the center of a Trump lawsuit, which could get taken up by the Supreme Court. Meadows is the third such referral case for the committee, following ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. Thompson used Monday's meeting to send a message to the three subjects of the referral cases. (A full House vote for Clark's referral is on hold, as he's expected to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege at a committee appearance later this week.) \"And if you're listening at home, Mr. Meadows, Mr. Bannon, Mr. Clark, I want you to know this: History will be written about these times, about the work this committee has undertaken,\" Thompson said. \"And history will not look upon any of you as a martyr.\" Late Sunday, the committee released a 51-page contempt report on Meadows along with more than a dozen exhibits documenting the panel's exchanges with Meadows since he was among the first witnesses subpoenaed. \"Mark Randall Meadows is uniquely situated to provide critical information about the events of January 6, 2021, as well as efforts taken by public officials and private individuals to spread the message of widespread fraud in the November 2020 election and to delay or prevent the peaceful transfer of power,\" the report reads. The report notes that during a short window when Meadows was cooperating, he turned over to the committee about 6,600 pages of records from his personal email accounts, plus about 2,000 personal text messages. The committee said Meadows refused to provide testimony on the documents and a long list of interests for the panel. In all, the panel said Meadows missed three scheduled deposition dates, in October, November and December. In a transcript of Meadows' missed Dec. 8 deposition, a senior committee staffer discusses topics of interest, previewing some of the documents Meadows shared, including a Jan. 5 email from Meadows that said the National Guard would \"protect pro-Trump people\" the next day. The staffer said they also wanted to ask Meadows about his texts with congressional members starting in late 2020, including one exchange involving an unnamed senator regarding then-Vice President Mike Pence. In that instance, Meadows discussed Pence's power to reject election results, saying Trump ''thinks the legislators have the power, but the VP has power, too.\" The panel said they also wanted to ask Meadows about Dec. 12 text messages with a media personality regarding the negative impact of Trump's election challenges on the Senate runoff elections in Georgia and his prospects for reelection in 2024, and Meadows' possible employment by an unnamed news channel. Had Meadows appeared, many of his responses to questions on those topics were likely free of executive privilege claims, members of the committee have argued. \"We are disappointed in Mr. Meadows' failure to appear as planned, as it deprives the select committee of an opportunity to develop relevant information in Mr. Meadows' possession and to, more specifically, understand the contours of his executive privilege claim,\" the committee staffer said in the Dec. 8 deposition transcript. The report also documents other areas of interest for the committee, including Meadows' trip to Georgia to observe an audit of presidential election results; claims of election fraud Meadows forwarded to Justice Department leaders; and text messages encouraging certain state Republicans to send alternate slates of electors. The panel also documents a text from a rally organizer on Jan. 6 saying they needed direction because the event had turned \"crazy,\" as well as Meadows' participation in a Dec. 18 meeting with Trump and others looking for ways to challenge the results, including seizing voting machines.",

Meadows has agreed to provide documents and appear for a deposition before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the U.S. Capitol in February. Meadows has agreed to provide documents and appear for a deposition before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has reached a new agreement with former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows for him to appear for an initial deposition, and the panel says he is cooperating by providing documents. The committee and Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, said on Tuesday that both sides had reached the agreement that included the appearance and the turning over of records. However, the committee warned that it is still weighing taking additional steps against Meadows depending on how cooperative he is with his testimony. \"Mr. Meadows has been engaging with the Select Committee through his attorney. He has produced records to the committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition,\" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chairs the committee, said in a statement. \"The Select Committee expects all witnesses, including Mr. Meadows, to provide all information requested and that the Select Committee is lawfully entitled to receive. The committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition.\" A source familiar with the committee's proceedings told NPR that Meadows is expected to testify sometime next week. \"It's not a deal,\" cautioned Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., one of the panel's lawmakers. \"But it's positive. It's a positive step that he's engaging with the committee.\" Aguilar, who is also vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said Meadows produced documents through his attorney that will be helpful to the panel, and members will go through those and assess his level of cooperation after his testimony. Another California Democrat and panel member, Rep. Adam Schiff, agreed that Meadows' level of cooperation is not clear yet. \"We will reserve judgment about how fully he is complying with the subpoena,\" said Schiff, who is also chair of the House Intelligence Committee. \"But I'm glad he's decided to appear and produce documents and we'll see just how serious he is ... when he does show up.\" Meadows' attorney has repeatedly noted his client's objections to cooperating previously based on claims of executive privilege, which has been waived by the sitting president, Joe Biden, and is at issue in the courts regarding Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Terwilliger said they continue to look for a solution that doesn't breach that concern. \"As we have from the beginning, we continue to work with the Select Committee and its staff to see if we can reach an accommodation that does not require Mr. Meadows to waive Executive Privilege or to forfeit the long-standing position that senior White House aides cannot be compelled to testify before Congress,\" Terwilliger said in a statement. \"We appreciate the Select Committee's openness to receiving voluntary responses on non-privileged topics.\" Lawmakers have warned Meadows repeatedly that they could issue a criminal contempt referral if he does not ultimately cooperate. He failed to show up for a November deposition date, triggering one of those recent warnings. \"Mr. Meadows's actions today \u2014 choosing to defy the law \u2014 will force the Select Committee to consider pursuing contempt or other proceedings to enforce the subpoena,\" Thompson and the committee's ranking member, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in a joint statement after Meadows failed to show up Nov. 12. Still, the panel has not yet acted on that statement in part because lawmakers have faced a bigger legal test with Meadows than they did with former strategist Steve Bannon, who was not working in the Trump administration on Jan. 6. The committee issued a criminal contempt referral for Bannon less than a month after he received his Sept. 23 subpoena \u2014 the same day Meadows received his. But the panel has taken more than twice as long to decide if it'll take similar steps against Meadows. On Wednesday, the committee will meet to vote on a criminal contempt referral for ex-Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. He would mark the second such case for the panel if the referral is approved. On Tuesday the committee released more than a dozen exhibits in its contempt report, including its first publicly released transcript that shows Clark's attorney rejecting responses on his client's behalf because of executive privilege. The moves against Bannon \u2014 and potentially Clark \u2014 may have sent messages to Meadows and other witnesses that cooperation is their best option. \"We've been clear and consistent throughout: Willful defiance of the committee will have consequences,\" Aguilar said. \"We've shown that with Mr. Clark, we've shown that with Mr. Bannon, and we're not afraid to exercise it.\" So far, the panel has interviewed nearly 250 witnesses, according to California Democrat and panel member Rep. Zoe Lofgren. Among them is Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was embroiled in a public feud with Trump over that state's election that went for Biden. Raffensperger met in person with the panel for about four hours Tuesday. In a statement, Raffensperger slammed what he called liberals' focus on Trump, and said conservatives should direct their attention to \"kitchen table issues\" instead. \"I spoke to the January 6th committee to ensure they included the full record of how stolen election claims damage our democracy \u2013 whether in 2016, 2018, or 2020,\" Raffensperger said.",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued five new subpoenas to several ex-Trump allies, including Roger Stone and InfoWars founder Alex Jones. The committee said the subpoenas are focused on the planning and financing of Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 rallies in Washington, D.C., the subsequent march and deadly riot. With this latest wave, the panel has now issued 40 subpoenas in its probe. \"The Select Committee is seeking information about the rallies and subsequent march to the Capitol that escalated into a violent mob attacking the Capitol and threatening our democracy,\" the committee's chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. \"We need to know who organized, planned, paid for, and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organizers had with officials in the White House and Congress.\" The subpoenas, which include demands for records and testimony, were also issued for Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich, Dustin Stockton, and his fianc\u00e9, Jennifer Lynn Lawrence. Both were involved in the rallies, the committee said. Budowich did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stockton and Lawrence issued a joint statement attacking the committee for issuing the subpoenas during the week of the Thanksgiving holiday, but said it was not a surprise and they remain committed to transparency. All the new witnesses were told they are due to turn over documents and testify by mid-December. Before this new wave of testimony and document demands, the committee issued nearly three dozen subpoenas for former Trump officials, advisers and Jan. 6 rally organizers. So far, the committee has met with about 200 unnamed witnesses, who spoke voluntarily, received 25,000 pages of documents and has gotten more than 200 tips through a hotline, said California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the panel. Stone, who was pardoned by the former president for several crimes tied to a congressional probe into the Trump 2016 campaign, participated in \"Stop the Steal\" efforts, the panel said. Through an attorney, Stone said in a statement that he had not been served his subpoena and has not seen the details of what he may be asked to provide. Stone declined having any information related to the attack that took place. \"I have said time and time again that I had no advance knowledge of the events that took place at the Capitol on that day,\" Stone said. \"Any statement, claim, insinuation, or report alleging, or even implying, that I had any involvement in or knowledge, whether advance or contemporaneous, about the commission of any unlawful acts by any person or group in or around the U.S. Capitol or anywhere in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, is categorically false.\" Stone said after his subpoena is served, he'll make a determination on how to proceed after consulting with his attorney. The committee said Stone was in D.C. on Jan. 5 & 6, spoke at a Jan. 5 rally and was scheduled to speak on Jan. 6. He also sought financial support to pay for his security through a Stop the Steal website, lawmakers said. Stone also made remarks he was planning to \"lead a march to the Capitol\" from the Ellipse rally, according to the panel. Before the siege, Stone was a guest at the Willard Hotel, where several prominent Trump allies met in part to plot how to overturn President Biden's election, according to the panel. That hotel meeting and guests are major areas of interest for the committee; Stone joins other subpoenaed guests who were also at the hotel, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, attorney John Eastman, ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn and Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who was later sent to prison and then pardoned by Donald Trump. The panel says its focus on Jones, the controversial Austin, Texas figure, is tied to his help organizing the rally at the Ellipse before the riot on Jan. 6. Jones claimed to facilitate a donation that covered significant funding for the event, and spoke at a Jan. 6 event at Freedom Plaza. Jones claimed he was told by the Trump White House that he was to lead a march from the Jan. 6th Ellipse rally to the Capitol. Jones was also a key figure in the spread of false election fraud claims. Monday evening, Jones issued a statement through his website claiming he was \"trying to stop\" the Capitol riot. Monday's demands comes on the same day the committee and the National Archives responded to Trump's arguments to an appellate court to stop a release of Jan. 6-related documents. Trump appealed a district court ruling earlier this month that would have sent hundreds of pages of records to the committee. The lawsuit came after Biden had waived executive privilege over Trump documents. Last week, Trump's legal team filed a brief before the U.S. Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit arguing a dispute between a former and sitting president highlights the critical concerns over executive privilege. Another ruling in favor of the committee, Trump argued, would have a direct impact on the advice Biden and future presidents can obtain without fear of public disclosure. But the defendants in the case, the committee and the National Archives, slammed those claims. For example, the legal team for the committee said Trump failed to demonstrate how withholding the documents would harm the office of the presidency. \"The only harm that Mr. Trump asserts is that the release of the requested records will compromise the interests of the Executive Branch,\" the committee said in its filing on Monday. But \"that assertion of harm is far outweighed by the surpassing public interest in a complete and timely investigation of the attack on the Capitol, as President Biden has determined.\" With an expedited schedule in place, the appellate court is set to hear oral arguments in the case next week, on Tuesday, Nov. 30.

Trump is trying to stop the release of records to a House panel investigating the riot.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-President Donald Trump speaks during a rally Jan. 6, ahead of the riot at the Capitol. Trump is trying to stop the release of records to a House panel investigating the riot. Editor's Note: A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the document release. A federal judge's ruling earlier this week rejecting Donald Trump's claims to stop a massive document release to House investigators has set the case on a new uphill course for the former president. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the House panel, said the challenge for Trump's legal team now will be to convince a higher court to reverse U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's ruling. \"I thought it was a brilliant and devastating opinion for Donald Trump and his fading hopes of burying the truth here,\" said Raskin, who was also the chamber's lead impeachment manager in the case against Trump earlier this year. \"It was just meticulous on the facts, the statutory arguments and the constitutional arguments.\" Trump's legal team quickly appealed the ruling late Tuesday, which was followed by a flurry of filings by both sides as the case moved to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich tweeted after the decision that the appeal could be the key to a Trump win. \"The battle to defend Executive Privilege for Presidents past, present & future\u2014from its outset\u2014was destined to be decided by the Appellate Courts,\" Budowich wrote. \"Pres. Trump remains committed to defending the Constitution & the Office of the Presidency, & will be seeing this process through.\" Trump's legal team also filed an emergency request with the appellate court on Thursday to stop the transfer of the first wave of documents, set for 6 p.m. Friday, after Chutkan denied that request late Wednesday. Chutkan held late Tuesday that public interest lies in permitting the House committee to study the events that led to the siege at the Capitol and develop legislation to prevent such an event from occurring again. And she said, despite Trump's claims, President Biden has the authority to waive executive privilege. \"Plaintiff does not acknowledge the deference owed to the incumbent President's judgment. His position that he may override the express will of the executive branch appears to be premised on the notion that his executive power 'exists in perpetuity,'\" Chutkan said in her opinion. \"But Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President. He retains the right to assert that his records are privileged, but the incumbent President 'is not constitutionally obliged to honor' that assertion.\" She added the probe was part of a legislative purpose and there was no harm to be shown the document release. Chutkan reiterated that stance in the ruling late Wednesday against Trump's efforts to stop the transfer of records to the committee, adding she would not overrule the court's existing order. Rather, she said Trump could take that issue up with the appellate court. \"This court will not effectively ignore its own reasoning in denying injunctive relief in the first place to grant injunctive relief now,\" Chutkan said. Some supporters of the Jan. 6 panel probe say Chutkan's expeditious decision on Tuesday \u2014 about three weeks after the case was filed \u2014 bodes well for the case to wind its way through the courts in a matter of weeks or months. \"We're off to a good start,\" said Norm Eisen, a former House impeachment lawyer. \"The single most important aspect of the substance of this case is that it's now incumbent on the D.C. circuit, where the appeal will go to move with equal speed. These are not meritorious claims. They are an extension of the 'Big Lie.'\" Raskin also expressed optimism for the next steps in the case, saying anyone who expected a lackadaisical response from the court was in for a rude awakening. \"It's hard for me to believe that any appeals court is going to see any grounds for a stay or in an appeal here,\" Raskin said. \"And you know, the problem Trump has is that all of the equities are on the other side. The underlying issue is a massive attack on the United States Congress, United States Capitol and the American democracy,\" Raskin added. \"He's up against the well established power of Congress to obtain the information it seeks for a clearly established legislative purpose here.\" If Trump continues to fight the release of the documents, the case could continue to wind its way through the higher levels of the U.S. court system, including the Supreme Court. The defendants in the case \u2014 which also includes committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and the National Archives, the custodian of the previous administration's White House records \u2014 are arguing against any further delay in the release of the records. Thompson said in a filing on Wednesday that the speedy enactment of legislation to avert another Jan. 6 attack depends on it. \"If the Select Committee cannot promptly receive the requested documents, it could run out of time to adequately investigate the attack and thoroughly understand its influencing factors,\" Thompson said. \"Congress would thus be less informed and less able to develop and propose effective remedial legislation and other measures necessary to prevent the erosion of our democratic institutions for their timely enactment by Congress.\" Some lawmakers have signaled that they hoped the committee could finish its work as early as the spring. But a political deadline \u2014 the November midterm elections \u2014 could also motivate the committee to wrap up quickly. With only two Republicans serving on the Democratic-led panel, most of the House GOP, led by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, are boycotting the committee's work. With McCarthy and others eyeing a potential takeover of the chamber in 2022, that could also mark the end of the committee's work. Raskin said the panel is already looking at its effort with a deadline by the end of next year, when the current sitting Congress will largely end its charge. \"I believe all of us have the sense this is something we want to accomplish in this Congress,\" Raskin said.",

A federal judge has denied former President Donald Trump's request to block documents from being handed over to a Democratic-led House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. In a ruling issued Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan said the records, which are held by the National Archives, can be released to the panel overseeing the probe into Jan. 6. \"Accordingly, the court holds that the public interest lies in permitting \u2014 not enjoining \u2014 the combined will of the legislative and executive branches to study the events that led to and occurred on January 6, and to consider legislation to prevent such events from ever occurring again,\" Chutkan wrote. She added that Trump \"is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claims or suffer irreparable harm, and because a balance of the equities and public interest bear against granting his requested relief.\" Records from the archives are set to be released to the committee on Friday. Following Tuesday's ruling, attorneys for Trump quickly filed notice of an appeal. Trump had filed suit last month seeking a preliminary injunction to block the records from being released. He called the House panel's request for records a \"vexatious, illegal fishing expedition\" that was \"untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose.\" The former president had claimed executive privilege \u2014 a concept that protects certain documents and conversations from public disclosure \u2014 still applies to a former presidential administration. Trump has also used the same claim of executive privilege to encourage former members of his administration subpoenaed by the House committee \u2014 including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2014 not to cooperate with the investigation. During a hearing in the case last week, Trump attorney Justin Clark argued that not allowing the former president to invoke executive privilege would harm the institution of the presidency. Executive privilege largely sits with the current president, defense attorneys for the Jan 6. committee and National Archives argued. President Biden has said he supports the release of the documents. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighed in Wednesday, saying the district court delivered an \"important victory for the Constitution, the rule of law and the American people.\" Pelosi went on to defend the Jan. 6 panel's work, led by Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and ranking Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming, to ensure that an assault on democracy never happens again. \"No one can be allowed to stand in the way of the truth \u2014 particularly not the previous President, who instigated and encouraged the insurrection.  As the ruling states, 'Presidents are not Kings, and plaintiff is not President,' \" Pelosi said. According to recent court filings, Trump was seeking to block call logs, drafts of remarks and speeches and handwritten notes from Meadows and others. Speaking to CNN Tuesday night, Thompson called Chutkan's ruling \"a big deal.\" The chair of the House select committee in charge of the Jan. 6 probe said Trump should \"man up\" and stop behaving like a \"spoiled brat.\" \"I look forward to getting this information,\" Thompson said. \"I look forward to our investigators going through it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our government was not weaponized against its citizens.\" Since the committee was formed in July and began its work looking into the events leading up to and on Jan. 6., Trump has repeatedly attacked the panel's work. The former president has also continued to promote unfounded claims about election fraud \u2014 a notion that fueled the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the election in favor of Biden.

Flynn has been subpoenaed by a select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued a new round of subpoenas to several ex-Trump administration officials and allies, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and attorney John Eastman, who wrote a memo outlining ways former Vice President Mike Pence could reject Joe Biden's electoral count victory. In all, the panel issued six new subpoenas, including demands for records and testimony. Aside from Flynn and Eastman, subpoenas were issued for former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, ex-campaign manager William \"Bill\" Stepien, former New York Police commissioner and ex-felon Bernard Kerik, and former Trump campaign aide Angela McCallum. \"In the days before the January 6th attack, the former President's closest allies and advisors drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,\" the committee's chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. \"The Select Committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all.\" Thompson went onto say the panel expects all the witnesses to cooperate with their investigation. Lawyer John Eastman stands next to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the Jan. 6 rally in support of former President Donald Trump. Eastman has been subpoenaed to appear before the House panel investigating the riot that followed the rally.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The panel said all six witnesses were involved in efforts to promote false claims of election fraud or overturn the results of the 2020 election. \"All have information that is deeply important to the committee,\" said California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel. Miller, Stepien and McCallum all worked on Trump's 2020 reelection campaign in various roles. The committee alleges the campaign urged states to delay or deny certification of electoral votes. \"These are people who played pivotal roles at the very top of the Trump campaign, who have knowledge about the 'Big Lie' that the election was stolen, or rigged, or fraudulent somehow, that resulted in that violent insurrection,\" Schiff said. \"And in order to do a comprehensive report, we really need to hear from them.\" The witnesses also made public statements that contributed to disinformation efforts, the panel said. For example, the committee noted Miller earlier last year claimed that Democrats would \"steal\" the election, a message echoed by rioters on Jan. 6, and coordinated with Trump and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to say the election was rigged. Miller also joined another newly subpoenaed witnesses Kerik and Eastman along with Giuliani, former strategist Steve Bannon and others for meeting at the Willard Hotel near the White House on the eve of Jan. 6 to plot out plans to overturn the election's results, the panel said. For his part, Eastman also participated in a briefing with nearly 300 state legislators urging them not to put \"some guy who didn't get elected\" in office, the panel alleges. Eastman also spoke at a rally preceding the Capitol attack. Flynn, the panel said, was part of a Dec. 18, 2020, Oval Office meeting that covered the potential for seizing voting machines and invoking a national emergency. Flynn also appeared in media discussing the potentials. Notably, both Flynn and Kerik received Trump pardons in his final year in office. Kerik had been serving time for tax fraud among other charges before his February 2020 pardon, while Flynn was pardoned in December as he faced prosecution for charges of lying to federal investigators. The panel has been working at a rapid clip, now issuing more than two dozen subpoenas targeting another wave of former Trump officials and members of a right-wing group and another tied to other organizers of the rally that preceded the siege. Last month, the House approved a referral for a criminal contempt of Congress charge against Bannon for defying his subpoena. \"We've been moving very expeditiously and the vast majority of people are cooperating,\" Schiff said. \"There are some who are resistant to cooperation. We expect everyone to do their lawful duty. If they get a subpoena, they need to appear, they need to produce the documents that are called for or they'll be referred for prosecution, like Steve Bannon was.\" The subpoenas followed requests to dozens of social media and tech companies to preserve and turn over records, along with several federal agencies. So far, the committee has met with about 150 witnesses, including informal interviews and depositions. The committee has not yet publicly identified those who have cooperated.",

Garland, who had been an appeals court judge for more than two decades before joining the Biden administration this year, told members of the House Judiciary Committee that he is laboring to keep the Justice Department out of politics after four years of chaos during the Trump presidency. \"The Department of Justice has a long-standing policy of not commenting on investigations,\" Garland said. \"I'm going to have to rest on that.\" Democratic lawmakers pushed Garland to defend congressional interests as a criminal contempt of Congress referral for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon makes its way to the Justice Department this week. Citing executive privilege, Bannon is refusing to cooperate with the congressional panel investigating Jan. 6 insurrection, even though he had not worked in the Trump White House for years at the time of the riot. Garland pledged that the acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia would follow the facts and the law, but did not otherwise show his hand on the issue. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., also pressed the attorney general about why the Justice Department decided to weigh in on behalf of Trump in a civil case filed by E. Jean Carroll alleging the former president sexually assaulted her and later defamed her. Sometimes being attorney general, or a judge, Garland replied, \"means taking positions with respect to the law that are required by the law which you would not take as a private citizen.\" Multiple Republican members of the committee focused on a recent memo by Garland that calls on the FBI and other Justice Department officials to monitor  and take action against violent threats made against teachers, school board members and others. GOP lawmakers and conservative media outlets have accused Garland of labeling parents as domestic terrorists and calling for their prosecution. The attorney general said he never used those words in his memo. Rather, he said, the department is trying to prevent violence as threats proliferate against school workers, election staffers and others. \"The Justice Department supports the First Amendment rights of parents to complain as vociferously as they wish,\" Garland said. \"That's not what this memo is about.\" \"Will FBI agents be attending local school board meetings?\" asked Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top GOP member on the panel. \"No, FBI agents will not be attending local school board meetings,\" Garland said. GOP Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana accused Garland of having a potential conflict of interest because his son-in-law co-founded a company that does business with school districts across the nation. But the attorney general forcefully denied any conflict, pointing out that his memo has nothing to do with corporate interests. \"I am exquisitely aware of the ethics requirements,\" Garland said. \"I have followed them and lived with them for 25 years.\" The attorney general batted back queries about the department's ongoing tax investigation of Hunter Biden, the president's son, and whether DOJ might appoint a special counsel to lead that probe. The U.S. attorney in Delaware has been working on the investigation and has remained on the job through the transition into the Biden presidency. Garland also confirmed that current special counsel John Durham is continuing his work on issues surrounding the 2016 election, as his budget for this fiscal year has been approved. Durham has charged two people so far: a former FBI attorney who pleaded guilty and a Washington lawyer who is fighting a single false statements charge. Federal prosecutors have charged 650 people so far in the investigation into the events of Jan. 6, what Garland calls one of the \"largest and most expansive in our history.\" The attorney general said he had heard criticism all over the map from judges and members of the public who argue that DOJ has been too harsh or too lenient on some of those defendants. \"I'm extremely proud of the work prosecutors and agents are doing in this case,\" Garland said. \"They're working 24/7.\"",

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday evening unanimously approved a criminal contempt report against Steve Bannon, an ally of former President Donald Trump's, for defying a subpoena from the panel. The vote sends the measure to the full House for a planned vote Thursday. If the chamber approves it, the referral would be sent on to federal law enforcement for potential charges. The nine-member committee, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, was united in their scathing response to Bannon's refusal to come before the panel. Bannon no-showed for a deposition that was sought last Thursday, and did not turn over documents for another deadline a week earlier. \"Mr. Bannon will comply with our investigation or he will face the consequences,\" the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in prepared remarks to open a meeting to take up the contempt report. \"Maybe he's willing to be a martyr to the disgraceful cause of whitewashing what happened on January 6th \u2014 of demonstrating his complete loyalty to the former President,\" Thompson added. \"So I want other witnesses to understand something very plainly: If you're thinking of following the path Mr. Bannon has gone down, you're on notice that this is what you'll face.\" In the 26-page contempt report, the panel documented its many attempts to make contact with Bannon regarding documents and testimony. Members reiterated that his claim of executive privilege, which says that a president can keep private certain documents or discussions with advisers, did not apply in his case. The panel also shared a series of exchanges with Bannon's attorney, Robert Costello, warning that the former Trump strategist was in \"defiance\" of his subpoena. The move comes the day after Trump himself filed a lawsuit against the committee, saying he still retained executive privilege. Trump had advised Bannon and others that the legal shield protects them from sharing certain conversations and documents. However, the committee's members have argued that protection rests with President Biden, who waived the privilege regarding an earlier document request. They also argued that Bannon's case especially does not apply since he was a private citizen as of Jan. 6 and not part of the Trump administration. The contempt report now heads to the House floor for a vote that's scheduled Thursday on whether to approve the referral, and the plan is expected to win approval in the Democratic-controlled chamber. Following passage, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., could certify the report for the U.S. attorney's office, which can then take it before a grand jury for consideration. Ultimately, these final prosecution steps could involve the highest levels of the Justice Department, including Attorney General Merrick Garland, as such cases are rare. \"It's exceedingly rare for the Department of Justice to charge anyone with contempt of Congress,\" said Daniel Goldman, a former House impeachment lawyer who served during Trump's 2019 case before the lower chamber. \"This is an unusual situation where you have executive branch officials from a previous administration, not the current administration. And it's also incredibly unprecedented, unusual circumstances surrounding a insurrection, riot and effort to overturn a lawful election.\" It's exceedingly rare for the Department of Justice to charge anyone with contempt of Congress Daniel Goldman Goldman also noted that pursuing such a criminal referral was \"not an option for us\" during Trump's 2019 impeachment as the Justice Department would not have followed through on the contempt report. \"Ultimately, this is going to rest on the Department of Justice and whether they're willing to use their authority to enforce these subpoenas,\" Goldman told NPR after the committee announced its plans to pursue the contempt charge. Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, ex-Trump White House deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino and former Defense Department official Kash Patel also received subpoenas in recent weeks. But the panel postponed their depositions for now, with Meadows and Patel recently in talks with the committee, and Scavino seeing a delay receiving his subpoena. The committee has a number of other subpoena deadlines approaching, including ones for the right-wing Stop the Steal group and nearly a dozen other organizers behind the rally that preceded the deadly attack on the Capitol. And the committee issued another subpoena Wednesday for Jeffrey Clark, an ex-Justice Department official who had promised to pursue Trump's false election fraud claims.",

After failing to show for a deposition on Thursday, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol said it would move forward with criminal contempt proceedings against Trump ally and political strategist Steve Bannon. Meanwhile, three other former Trump administration officials will have their depositions postponed, according to a committee aide. \"The Select Committee will use every tool at its disposal to get the information it seeks, and witnesses who try to stonewall the Select Committee will not succeed. All witnesses are required to provide the information they possess so the Committee can get to the facts,\" the panel's chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. He indicated the committee would vote on a contempt report for Bannon on Tuesday evening, following through on its weekslong threat of criminal referrals to the Justice Department for those who don't comply, which could lead to potential fines and jail time. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who sits on the panel, said in an interview with Morning Edition on Friday that Bannon is key to their probe into the deadly attack on the Capitol. \"He was out there immediately before January 6th, on the 5th and the 4th, saying things like there was going to be a cataclysmic battle, all hell was going to break loose,\" Raskin said, who also served as an impeachment manager. \"He clearly knew a lot about what was going to happen in terms of the violent insurrection part of the events of the day.\" Bannon and former Defense Department official Kashyap Patel were requested to sit for depositions on Thursday. Their testimony was to be followed on Friday by those from former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino, a former Trump White House deputy chief of staff for communications. The committee had previously said Meadows and Patel were in talks with the panel, and as a result of those ongoing talks, their depositions will be delayed for a \"short\" period, an aide said. Scavino, who was not served his subpoena until last week, will also have his deposition postponed. Bannon was not expected to cooperate with the panel, citing executive privilege. In an Oct. 13 letter obtained by NPR, Bannon's attorney reiterated that stance to the committee, noting that former President Donald Trump directed Bannon not to produce documents or reveal conversations that Trump wants legally protected. Bannon, who left the Trump administration in 2017, was not part of the White House in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said on Wednesday that Trump instructed the witnesses to honor conversations and documents covered by executive privilege. But committee members have repeatedly expressed skepticism over that claim, noting that executive privilege rests with the current president, not former presidents. \"Mr. Bannon has declined to cooperate with the Select Committee and is instead hiding behind the former President's insufficient, blanket, and vague statements regarding privileges he has purported to invoke. We reject his position entirely,\" Thompson said in his statement. Thompson added that the panel is grateful to the \"many individuals\" who have voluntarily participated in the probe, including several who have met recent subpoena deadlines to produce documents. The committee has a number of other subpoena deadlines approaching, including ones for the right-wing Stop the Steal group and nearly a dozen other organizers behind the rally that preceded the deadly attack on the Capitol. And the committee issued another subpoena Wednesday for Jeffrey Clark, an ex-Justice Department official who had promised to pursue Trump's false election fraud claims.",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued subpoenas to four former Trump administration officials, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and strategist Steve Bannon. Subpoenas were also issued Thursday evening to Dan Scavino, a former Trump White House deputy chief of staff for communications, and Kashyap Patel, who was chief of staff to then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. The subpoenas \u2014 the first the panel has issued \u2014 compel the four to produce sought-after documents relevant to the deadly attack by Oct. 7 and then sit for a deposition the following week, either on Oct. 14 or 15. Congressional subpoenas cannot be dismissed outright, but their issuance could lead to extended legal battles if the four former Trump officials decide to fight the effort. The panel said the four have knowledge of important details related to the siege. \"The Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power, in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend to the House and its relevant committees corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations,\" the committee's chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. In individually addressed letters, Thompson details further why the recipients are believed to have key information for the panel. Thompson tells Meadows, for instance: \"You were the President's Chief of Staff and have critical information regarding many elements of our inquiry. It appears you were with or in the vicinity of President Trump on January 6, had communications with the President and others on January 6 regarding events at the Capitol, and are a witness regarding activities of that day.\" The letter says Meadows also engaged in multiple attempts to contest the presidential election that Trump lost. It says that according to documents obtained from the Justice Department, Meadows was in direct communications with top officials at the agency to probe election fraud in several states weeks after the election. It also says the panel understands that Meadows was directly in contact with state officials to urge such probes as well. In his letter to Bannon, Thompson raises details regarding the strategist's conversations with Trump in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 and a meeting with Trump allies the night before at the Willard Hotel, which is about a block from the White House. Thompson says in additional letters that the panel is seeking information from Patel regarding his knowledge of security preparations ahead of the attack and from Scavino about his efforts to amplify the Jan. 6 event with Trump. Republicans have painted the committee, which is mostly made up of Democrats, as nothing more than a partisan exercise. In a statement, Trump called the panel the \" 'Unselect Committee' of highly partisan politicians,\" adding, \"We will fight the Subpoenas on Executive Privilege and other grounds, for the good of our Country, while we wait to find out whether or not Subpoenas will be sent out to Antifa and BLM for the death and destruction they have caused in tearing apart our Democrat-run cities throughout America.\" Executive privilege is a right traditionally asserted by a White House to keep deliberations confidential. The current White House indicated Friday that President Biden would not use executive privilege on requests from congressional investigators seeking information about Trump's activities on Jan. 6. But then later an official clarified that the Biden administration \"will determine any future questions of executive privilege involving documents and testimony on a case-by-case basis.\" The subpoena requests come about three weeks after the committee issued orders to 35 social media and communications companies to preserve records tied to Trump officials and Jan. 6. Before then, the panel asked eight federal agencies to turn over relevant documents while also seeking details on disinformation spread ahead of Jan. 6 from 15 social media companies.",

During his testimony, Dunn said rioters hurled racial epithets at him and other Black officers.\n                \n                    \n                    Oliver Contreras/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Capitol Police Pfc. Harry Dunn wipes his eye as he testifies during Tuesday's House select committee hearing on the Jan. 6 attack. During his testimony, Dunn said rioters hurled racial epithets at him and other Black officers. The stunning attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters roughly six months ago threatened lawmakers and came close to upending the process to certify the 2020 presidential election. Most members of Congress decried the onslaught in the hours after the Jan. 6 insurrection, but since then the date has become a deeply polarizing moment on Capitol Hill. After Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create an independent commission to investigate the attack, the House established a select committee to lead the probe. The panel's first hearing on Tuesday was emotional as four law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol that day gave firsthand accounts of being overrun, assaulted, and harangued by rioters as \"traitors.\" All described lingering physical and emotional trauma. Some rioters hurled racial epithets at African American officers. The four officers' gripping testimony, accompanied by horrific images from police body cameras played by the Democratic-led committee, did not reveal much new information. But it launched the investigation with a compelling reminder of what was at stake as the seat of the federal government came under violent attack. Several times during the hearing both the witnesses and some of the lawmakers on the dais teared up and struggled to gain composure as they relived that day. Sgt. Aquilino Gonell of the U.S. Capitol Police, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, described the scene on the complex's West Front, where officers were outnumbered by thousands of people wielding bats, flagpoles and other items used to pummel the police. He said he thought to himself, \"This is how I am going to die.\" Another officer, Michael Fanone of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department, called the hand-to-hand combat between police and rioters \"nothing short of brutal.\" Fanone said he was Tased repeatedly and dragged into the crowd as members of the mob took his gun and threatened to shoot him with it. He was visibly angry at lawmakers who have since downplayed the violence that day. Fanone told the panel, \"I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them.\" \"The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful!\" he shouted, pounding the table. Here are four takeaways from the hearing: U.S. Capitol Police Pfc. Harry Dunn said what happened on Jan. 6 was political and that those participating had a mission: \"They literally were there to 'stop the steal,' \" he said, using a phrase former President Donald Trump and his supporters invoked to falsely claim that the 2020 election results were illegitimate. Dunn said he wants the committee to look at why rioters were there that day. \"If a hit man is hired and he kills somebody, the hit man goes to jail,\" he told the panel. \"But not only does the hit man go to jail, but the person who hired them does. There was an attack carried out on Jan. 6, and [someone] sent them. I want you to get to the bottom of that.\" Dunn, a Black officer who has been with the department for more than 14 years, said he was called the N-word after acknowledging to rioters that he voted for Joe Biden for president. Officer Daniel Hodges of the D.C. Metropolitan Police repeatedly used the word \"terrorists\" to describe those involved in the siege, and he defended the term by coming prepared with the U.S. Code definition of domestic terrorism. Hodges said rioters pledged support to Trump as they assaulted officers. He said they appealed to him to join their effort to take the building, and he said they tried to \"convert us to their cult.\" Daniel Hodges of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department watches footage from his body camera during Tuesday's hearing.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool photo/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Daniel Hodges of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department watches footage from his body camera during Tuesday's hearing. Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, one of the seven Democrats on the nine-person committee, revealed for the first time Tuesday how close the throng of rioters came to her and New York Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice. She described how the two lawmakers were holed up in a room in the basement of the Capitol, a location they thought would be the most secure in an emergency. But she said that the two were just \"40 paces\" from where Officer Hodges and others clashed with rioters attempting to breach the West Front entrance. She told Hodges she could hear the screams of those being attacked just yards away. She said that without his bravery, and that of others there that day, \"I shudder to think had you not held that line\" what could have happened to her and others. In the second Trump impeachment trial, earlier this year, the House impeachment managers showed video of then-Vice President Mike Pence and senators being evacuated from the Senate chamber on Jan. 6, minutes before many pro-Trump protesters walked into the chamber. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., made the call to pull all five members he named to the select committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., vetoed two of them \u2014 Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana. Pelosi's move was unprecedented because no leader had blocked another party from installing their members for a select committee, but she argued that the statements and actions from Jordan and Banks made it untenable for her to accept them. The resolution creating the panel gave the speaker the power to block GOP picks. Instead, Pelosi tapped two Republicans, Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger, who both voted to impeach Trump and have been strong critics of the former president. And they both used their platform during Tuesday's hearing to argue that defending the rule of law was more important than loyalty to a political leader. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the House select committee.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Bourg/Pool photo/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cheney, for instance, asked Sgt. Gonell about Trump calling the group at the Capitol a \"loving crowd.\" He retorted that it was \"pathetic\" and that he was \"still recovering from those 'hugs and kisses' that day.\" McCarthy scheduled a press conference ahead of the hearing as a chance for GOP leaders and those he wanted on the committee to do a prebuttal. He said  the panel was a \"sham\" and he and others at the event attempted to blame Pelosi for security failures at the Capitol on Jan. 6. None provided any evidence, and the speaker does not directly oversee the U.S. Capitol Police. The GOP leader's decision not to participate in the select committee meant that the 3 1/2 hour hearing that was carried live by many news outlets did not include any GOP lawmaker defending the former president or raising the security issues Republicans say should be central to its probe. No senior official from the Trump administration has testified in any of the hearings conducted by House or Senate panels to date, and without any allies on the select committee, the former president has no one defending him. Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., didn't rule out subpoenas for Trump and other senior White House officials, telling reporters after the hearing, \"We will follow the facts.\" He indicated that the committee could schedule a hearing next month, even though the House is scheduled to take its regular August recess. Cheney made it clear that getting testimony from those around Trump that day is essential. \"We must know what happened every minute of that day in the White House,\" she said. She has stated recently that Jordan is potentially a \"material witness.\" And McCarthy's telephone conversation with the president that day, a topic that came up during the impeachment trial, could be something the committee wants to hear more about directly from the California Republican. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the panel, told NPR on Tuesday that \"we'll do whatever is necessary to make sure we get the answers, and no one is off the table,\" including the former president or members of Congress. Officer Hodges implored the committee at the end of the hearing, \"I need you guys to address if anyone in power had a role in this, if anyone in power coordinated, or aided and abetted\" what happened that day. The Justice Department, now under the Biden administration, decided Tuesday that former government officials could not invoke executive privilege to avoid testifying about conversations with Trump or his advisers about the insurrection.",

Above: A view of the damaged site.\n                \n                    \n                    Kasim Rammah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A March 21 attack by the Assad regime forces and Iran-backed terrorist groups targeted a hospital in Aleppo, killing six civilians and injuring 15. Above: A view of the damaged site. Abdalhamied Sharaf Aldein, a doctor in rebel-held northern Syria, has survived airstrikes and barrel bombs by the Syrian government, or its ally Russia, while caring for patients in at least eight different hospitals and medical clinics. Now working at a hospital in Bab al Hawa, close to the Turkish border in a part of Syria controlled by the opposition, Aldein says the attacks have become so terrifyingly routine that it's hard to keep an exact count. Sometimes the hospital or clinic where he was working would be destroyed, other times just damaged. \"If we were in the operation room [when the strike hit] we couldn't leave the patient, even if our lives were in danger,\" he says. Health facilities are officially protected from attack under international law and the Syrian regime denies intentionally targeting civilians, including a 2016 statement from President Bashar al Assad saying \"We don't attack any hospital.\" But hundreds of attacks on medical centers and health workers during the Syrian civil war by the regime and its allies have been documented by rights groups, aid organizations and various United Nations bodies, including the World Health Organization. A 'Shocking' Decision In a decision that appalled and angered Syrian opposition groups and international medical organizations, on May 28 Syria was appointed to the World Health Organization's Executive Board, made up of 34 member states. Representatives of these countries hold three-year terms in which they set the agenda for the WHO Health Assembly and help implement WHO policies. \"It was really, really shocking,\" says Houssam al Nahhas, a researcher for the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights, a nonprofit that investigates and documents human rights violations. Nahhas, a Syrian citizen now living in the U.S., says he was tortured in 2012 by the Syrian government after being placed in a regime jail for his work as a health-care provider. A medical student at Aleppo University at the time, Nahhas helped treat people who had been wounded in anti-government demonstrations. Some had bullet wounds from live fire the soldiers sometimes used on the crowd. \"Throughout my detention period, all the torture was focusing on my role as a physician, who I was treating and how I got medical supplies,\" he tells NPR. \"They wanted to know names of the other health-care providers that were working with me.\" Nahhas says Syria's appointment to the WHO executive board damages the organization's credibility. \"During this critical time where the world is working together to beat the COVID-19 pandemic under the WHO leadership, this sends a really bad message to countries and individuals that violating human rights can be a norm.\" Physicians for Human Rights has documented 540 attacks by Syrians government and allied forces since the war began in 2011. It says the regime has killed 827 medical personnel through either airstrikes or shelling, torture that led to death or execution. In the days after the news of the appointment broke, activists posted pictures of medical workers in rebel-held Idlib holding up signs calling for Syria to be removed from the executive board as well as pictures of civil defense workers protesting with slogans that read \"WHO told you that Assad is not a criminal? WHO is Assad?\" The Syrian civil defense group the White Helmets said in a statement that Syria's \"election [to the board] rewards the Assad regime despite its systematic destruction of hospitals and health centres, in addition to a long list of other war crimes.\" Physicians for Human Rights and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a global medical relief organization that has dozens of medical clinics in opposition-held Syria, have written a joint open letter to the director general of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling on him to \"to do everything in your power to overturn the election of Syria to the WHO Executive Board\" and emphasizing that board slots should only be \"reserved for Member States with the highest qualifications and international standing.\" Who Decided Syria Was A Good Fit For The Board? The decision to appoint Syria to the WHO Executive Board was made by the member states of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean group, which comprises 22 countries \u2014 among them Afghanistan, Pakistan and many Middle Eastern states, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia. As such, Tedros does not have direct authority in the selection of the board members. But the letter asks him to at least openly criticize the appointment and take action similar to his revocation of the appointment of Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe as a WHO goodwill ambassador in 2017. That decision followed widespread condemnation of the appointment, given Mugabe's poor human rights record and Zimbabwe's collapsed health-care system. WHO turned down repeated requests for a phone interview with NPR and failed to respond to written questions about whether the Mugabe case is comparable. They did provide NPR with a written statement saying that Syria was appointed per the \"standard process\" in which it was chosen by member states and not the World Health Organization in Geneva. The statement said, \"WHO's mandate is to achieve better health outcomes for all people, including populations in all countries. We are neither equipped nor mandated to find political solutions.\" Article 7 of the WHO constitution says a member state's voting privileges can be suspended by the Health Assembly if the country \"fails to meet its financial obligations\" to the WHO or in other exceptional circumstances.\" This would likely include Syria's allies, such as Russia. In all cases such a move would probably not be palatable within WHO leadership, says Reinoud Leenders, an associate professor at King's College of War Studies. Leenders published a paper on the politicization and distortion of aid in Syria in 2018 which looked at the work of U.N. agencies and other international non-governmental organizations. He tells NPR that WHO has \"collaborated closely\" with the Syrian government. \"Regime incumbents and their relatives have held key positions in the WHO's offices in Damascus,\" he says. And, he adds, they have access to sensitive projects and operations. The Syrian regime tightly controls what access U.N. organizations and other international aid groups have and where in Syria they can operate. Leenders believes WHO and other U.N. agencies have been careful in how they push back against government influence because they fear that doing so will damage their ability to operate in the country. Despite the wide body of evidence of regime attacks on health facilities that directly contravene WHO's mandate, Syria has remained a member state. \"It has not been reprimanded for any of its actions in the World Health Organization or its assembly,\" he says. In fact, even before this appointment to the executive board, Syria was the vice chair of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean group. Syria will be represented on the WHO executive board by the country's health minister, Dr. Hassan Muhammad al-Ghabbash, who has been on the U.K. and EU sanctions lists since 2020. The U.K. and the U.S. have criticized Syria's appointment. James Cleverly, the U.K.'s minister for Middle East and North Africa in the foreign commonwealth and development office, tweeted that Syria's appointment to the WHO executive board \"stands in stark contrast to the regime's consistent targeting of medical facilities & workers. 3 UN bodies found Assad responsible for atrocities against the Syrian people. His regime will now play a role in the governance of the WHO.\" And Jalina Porter, the U.S. State Department's deputy spokesperson, said in a press briefing this month that the U.S. has \"grave concerns\" to see Syria on the board. She said members of the executive board \"have a duty to advance public health and likewise are expected to uphold universal values as well as human rights.\" In theory, all member states, including the U.S., could have sought to stop the appointment to the Executive Board. Any member state could have raised an objection when Syria's nomination by the Eastern Mediterranean group was brought to the Health Assembly and forced a vote over it. No country objected at the time. House Foreign Affairs Committee head Michael McCaul, R-Texas, criticized the decision in a written statement that said the Biden administration had effectively \"tacitly approved\" Syria's election to the executive board. A State Department spokesperson did not directly address the question when NPR asked why the U.S. had not objected to the appointment at the Health Assembly. They said \"no advance notice\" of Syria's nomination to the board was provided by the regional group. How Will Syria Use Its Power? Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, says regardless of how Syria came to be appointed to the WHO board, it \"makes a mockery of the organization.\" The question now, he says, is how Syria could use these powers to its advantage. For example, U.N. investigators have gathered proof of attacks on health facilities and other violations which could one day be used as evidence in the prosecution of war crimes. Lister tells NPR that Syria could potentially use its position to protect itself against investigations like these. \"It [Syria's position on the board] could also help strengthen the regime's hand in pushing back against or even directly influencing the U.N.'s investigations and the results of those investigations into its attacks against hospitals, its blocking of aid delivery and other similar issues,\" he says. For now, Syria is set to hold this position on the executive for three more years. Despite critics' calls for its position to be revoked, it's not clear what the mechanism would be to do that. There is no sign that the member states that put Syria in this position will vote the country out. Aid groups and rights groups hope that public outrage and criticism from states like the U.S. and the U.K. might move the WHO leadership in Geneva to try to force some kind of change. For now, there's no sign that they want to try. Nahhas says the office of the WHO director general acknowledged receipt of the letter Physicians for Human Rights and SAMA sent, but so far, their questions have gone unanswered.",

Kamau Bell has been traveling the country for his TV show United Shades of America. He asks serious questions, but always with a bit of humor thrown in. \"United Shades of America is just Sesame Street for grown-ups,\" he says. The goal of the show is to explore the unique challenges of communities around the United States. The sixth season premieres Sunday on CNN. Bell takes time to explain issues about race, class and privilege. \"I'm going to talk to you about this and assume you don't know,\" he says. \"And if you do know, I'm going to write it in a way that is at least entertaining for you.\" He relates to the idea of being a \"forever student,\" he says \u2013 always ready to Wikipedia anything he doesn't understand. As for whether he seems himself building bridges, Bell says he's not sure. \"I don't know if I'm a bridge builder or a wall-tearer-downer,\" he says. \"Is that a thing?\" 2020 was a crushing year in the United States, but Bell worked through it. \"This is the time when those of us who have a sense of humor really lean into it,\" he says. \"Because how do you get through the world without sort of looking at trying to figure out how to laugh at it? I don't really try to \u2014 it's just how my brain works.\" On whether he struggles to engage with tough issues, day after day I'm in a very privileged position of being able to think about a lot of this stuff and make content about a lot of it, but not actually being on the front lines of it. So, yeah, I sort of go back and forth between feeling like super lucky and also like, didn't I just want to be a comedian? On how he thinks of his own role in this time I see my role as my mother's son and this is how I was raised. And I think there's just a thing that happens \u2014 specifically in the Black community, but also other impacted communities \u2014 where even if I owned, like, an ice cream shop in town, and was successful as a Black person who owned a business, it'd be my job to sort of also try to create more opportunities and represent the Black community and speak out against injustice just as a Black person who owned ice cream shop. But because specifically the work I do is actually talking about all these things, then it sort of becomes even more clear that when I talk about them, I have to be clear about what I'm doing, I have to be clear about who I'm putting on the air, how we're framing these things. And be clear with people that I'm invested in this, because I'm not a journalist, which is why I still hold on to \"comedian\" \u2014 I get to have opinions. On his patience walking people through things I'm not going to act like I'm immune to [being annoyed when people aren't informed]. But I think for this, in my mind, there's a way to do this where I'm happy to explain this to you \u2014 while also feel like [for] the people who already know it, I can sort of go, \"Look, now you don't have to explain it to them.\" Like, I see myself as the go-between. I understand that thing about, like, \"I don't want to explain this to you.\" And so I go, \"Well, look, I'll make a piece of content you can send to that person so you don't have to explain it to them. And you can also just get it off your plate.\" On his adopted hometown of Oakland I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to pursue comedy and I didn't have any idea that it would affect my entire life the way it has. ... [I] lived in Oakland, worked in Berkeley, and did comedy in San Francisco. So I got to see a lot of different parts of the Bay Area from the very beginning. And I got to be in a lot of different kinds of conversations because I was in three very different areas. ... I moved when I was 24, but kind of I did grow up in the Bay Area because those conversations grew me up. On moving around as a kid My Mom lived mostly back East and up North \u2014 Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston. My dad lives in Alabama. So I spent a lot of time in Alabama and I just spent a lot of time moving around as a kid. And then as a comedian, I spent a lot of time traveling around. And I think that has always informed who I am because I'm realizing there are a lot of differences, there's a lot of similarities. But I can also see when I watch Fox News, I know exactly where that's coming from because I've been there. It doesn't seem as foreign to me as it seems to a lot of the people who I know in the Bay Area. On whether he thinks America's divides are bridgeable We live in a time when I feel like we have maybe all collectively forgotten that [the attack on the Capitol on] January 6th happened, you know what I mean? ... That was one of the scariest days that I've ever experienced in this country. My kids watched it because it was on TV and we didn't know what was going to happen. ... I think we live in very dangerous times because we are capable of forgetting things like January 6 and capable of sort of like moving on. We have people in the Congress who encouraged violence on this country and they still are in Congress. ... So for me, I feel like we're at a very dangerous time in this country ... physically dangerous, but also dangerous as like, what happens next?

Federal authorities raided Giuliani's apartment Wednesday, the former New York City mayor's attorney said. Federal investigators in Manhattan executed a search warrant Wednesday at Rudy Giuliani's apartment as part of a probe into the former New York City mayor's activities involving Ukraine, his attorney told NPR. Robert Costello said the FBI conducted the raid at Giuliani's apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan at around 6 a.m. and seized electronic devices. He said the search warrants are connected to an investigation into possible violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act tied to Giuliani's Ukraine-related work. The news was first reported by The New York Times. In a statement late Wednesday, which Costello said was authorized by Giuliani, Costello made unsubstantiated \u2014 and unrelated \u2014 allegations about the president's son, Hunter Biden, whose business dealings have come under scrutiny. \"The search warrants involve only one indication of an alleged incident of failure to register as a foreign agent. Mayor Giuliani has not only denied this allegation, but offered twice in the past two years through his attorney Bob Costello to demonstrate that it is entirely untrue,\" he said in the statement. \"Twice the offer was rejected by the SDNY by stating that while they were willing to listen to anything Mr. Costello had to say, they would not tell Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Costello, the subject matter they wanted him to address.\" The activities of the former mayor and prosecutor, who later became the personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump, was the focus of attention during Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020 related to the Ukraine scandal. Giuliani also played a key role in amplifying falsehoods about the 2020 election and orchestrated many of Trump's attempts to overturn the results. Those efforts led to Trump's second impeachment trial after he left office. The raid amounts to a dramatic change of fortune for a man who made his name as the top federal prosecutor in New York City, pursuing Wall Street insiders who broke the law for personal profit in the 1980s. It is unusual but not unheard of for agents to execute a search warrant against a lawyer because of concerns about attorney-client privilege. Senior Justice Department officials normally have to approve such a move. The search warrant then would have to be approved by a federal judge who would have determined \u2014 based on information presented by prosecutors \u2014 that there was probable cause to believe a crime had been committed and that evidence of the offense was at the location or on the devices authorities wanted to search. In this case, former prosecutors said the search warrant suggests the investigation into Giuliani's activities is at an advanced stage. FBI agents also showed up early Wednesday at the house of Victoria Toensing, a Washington lawyer who worked with Giuliani on Ukraine issues, with a warrant for her cellphone. The warrant mentioned foreign lobbying violations, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement, Toensing's law firm said that Toensing is a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official who has \"always conducted herself and her law practice according to the highest legal and ethical standards.\" \"She would have been happy to turn over any relevant documents. All they had to do was ask. Ms. Toensing was informed that she is not a target of the investigation,\" it said. Federal investigators were known to be scrutinizing Giuliani's business dealings and Ukraine work. Two of Giuliani's business associates have already been indicted on counts that include campaign finance violations and false statements. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of illegally funneling foreign money to a U.S. congressman for help in ousting the woman who was then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Parnas and Fruman also helped introduce Giuliani to influential people in Ukraine as he tried to dig up unflattering information in 2019 for use against now-President Biden and his son Hunter as Biden was launching his presidential campaign. Costello said subpoenas indicate investigators are seeking Giuliani's communications with a long list of individuals, including Parnas and Fruman, as well as the journalist John Solomon, who helped amplify Giuliani's claims tied to Ukraine. Giuliani's involvement took place before, during and then after the core events of the Ukraine affair in 2019 in which Trump ordered assistance be frozen to extract concessions from Ukraine's government. Ultimately the aid was released, and Ukrainian officials did not give Trump the political ammunition he wanted \u2014 but Democrats nonetheless called the exchange an abuse of power and impeached Trump. Hunter Biden's payments by a Ukrainian company at the time his father was vice president have embarrassed the family, but investigators have concluded that no laws were broken. America's former mayor Giuliani, a two-term mayor of New York, rose to international prominence after he steered the city through tragedy on Sept. 11, 2001, when two planes piloted by terrorists crashed into the World Trade Center. His later efforts to win higher office, in the U.S. Senate and the Republican nomination for the White House, floundered. In recent years, Giuliani monetized his reputation for security and policing into lucrative side ventures. But it's his close association with Trump and his financial dealings with foreign governments that drew American law enforcement scrutiny.",

A pop-up window announces its arrival and all that is required of us is to plug everything in before bed. The next morning, rather like the shoemaker and the elves, our software is magically transformed. Last spring, a Texas-based company called SolarWinds made one such software update available to its customers. It was supposed to provide the regular fare \u2014 bug fixes, performance enhancements \u2014 to the company's popular network management system, a software program called Orion that keeps a watchful eye on all the various components in a company's network. Customers simply had to log into the company's software development website, type a password and then wait for the update to land seamlessly onto their servers. The routine update, it turns out, is no longer so routine. Hackers believed to be directed by the Russian intelligence service, the SVR, used that routine software update to slip malicious code into Orion's software and then used it as a vehicle for a massive cyberattack against America. \"Eighteen thousand [customers] was our best estimate of who may have downloaded the code between March and June of 2020,\" Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds president and CEO, told NPR. \"If you then take 18,000 and start sifting through it, the actual number of impacted customers is far less. We don't know the exact numbers. We are still conducting the investigation.\" On Thursday, the Biden administration announced a roster of tough sanctions against Russia as part of what it characterized as the \"seen and unseen\" response to the SolarWinds breach. NPR's months-long examination of that landmark attack \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players from company officials to victims to cyber forensics experts who investigated, and intelligence officials who are in the process of calibrating the Biden administration's response \u2014 reveals a hack unlike any other, launched by a sophisticated adversary who took aim at a soft underbelly of digital life: the routine software update. By design, the hack appeared to work only under very specific circumstances. Its victims had to download the tainted update and then actually deploy it. That was the first condition. The second was that their compromised networks needed to be connected to the Internet, so the hackers could communicate with their servers. For that reason, Ramakrishna figures the Russians successfully compromised about 100 companies and about a dozen government agencies. The companies included Microsoft, Intel and Cisco; the list of federal agencies so far includes the Treasury, Justice and Energy departments and the Pentagon. SolarWinds CEO and President Sudhakar Ramakrishna inherited the attack. He was hired shortly before the breach was discovered and stepped into the job just as the full extent of the hack became clear.\n                \n                    \n                    Demetrius Freeman/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption SolarWinds CEO and President Sudhakar Ramakrishna inherited the attack. He was hired shortly before the breach was discovered and stepped into the job just as the full extent of the hack became clear. The hackers also found their way, rather embarrassingly, into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA \u2014 the office at the Department of Homeland Security whose job it is to protect federal computer networks from cyberattacks. The concern is that the same access that gives the Russians the ability to steal data could also allow them to alter or destroy it. \"The speed with which an actor can move from espionage to degrading or disrupting a network is at the blink of an eye,\" one senior administration said during a background briefing from the White House on Thursday. \"And a defender cannot move at that speed. And given the history of Russia's malicious activity in cyberspace and their reckless behavior in cyberspace, that was a key concern.\" \"The tradecraft was phenomenal\" Network monitoring software is a key part of the backroom operations we never see. Programs like Orion allow information technology departments to look on one screen and check their whole network: servers or firewalls, or that printer on the fifth floor that keeps going offline. By its very nature, it touches everything \u2014 which is why hacking it was genius. \"It's really your worst nightmare,\" Tim Brown, vice president of security at SolarWinds, said recently. \"You feel a kind of horror. This had the potential to affect thousands of customers; this had the potential to do a great deal of harm.\" When cybersecurity experts talk about harm, they're thinking about something like what happened in 2017, when the Russian military launched a ransomware attack known as NotPetya. It, too, began with tainted software, but in that case the hackers were bent on destruction. They planted ransomware that paralyzed multinational companies and permanently locked people around the world out of tens of thousands of computers. Even this much later, it is considered the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history. Intelligence officials worry that SolarWinds might presage something on that scale. Certainly, the hackers had time to do damage. They roamed around American computer networks for nine months, and it is unclear whether they were just reading emails and doing the things spies typically do, or whether they were planting something more destructive for use in the future. \"When there's cyber-espionage conducted by nations, FireEye is on the target list,\" Kevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, told NPR, but he believes there are other less obvious targets that now might need more protecting. \"I think utilities might be on that list. I think health care might be on that list. And you don't necessarily want to be on the list of fair game for the most capable offense to target you.\" Kevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the Russians didn't just attack SolarWinds, they took aim at trust.\n                \n                    \n                    Demetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the Russians didn't just attack SolarWinds, they took aim at trust. The SolarWinds attackers ran a master class in novel hacking techniques. They modified sealed software code, created a system that used domain names to select targets and mimicked the Orion software communication protocols so they could hide in plain sight. And then, they did what any good operative would do: They cleaned the crime scene so thoroughly investigators can't prove definitively who was behind it. The White House has said unequivocally that Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia, for its part, has denied any involvement. \"The tradecraft was phenomenal,\" said Adam Meyers, who led the cyber forensics team that pawed through that tainted update on behalf of SolarWinds, providing details for the first time about what they found. The code was elegant and innovative, he said, and then added, \"This was the craziest f***ing thing I'd ever seen.\" Like razor blades in peanut butter cups Meyers is the vice president for threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and he's seen epic attacks up close. He worked on the 2014 Sony hack, when North Korea cracked into the company's servers and released emails and first-run movies. A year later, he was on the front lines when a suspected Kremlin-backed hacking team known as \"Cozy Bear\" stole, among other things, a trove of emails from the Democratic National Committee. WikiLeaks then released them in the runup to the 2016 election. \"We're involved in all kinds of incidents around the globe every day,\" Meyers said. Typically he directs teams, he doesn't run them. But SolarWinds was different: \"When I started getting briefed up, I realized [this] was actually quite a big deal.\" The attack began with a tiny strip of code. Meyers traced it back to Sept. 12, 2019. \"This little snippet of code doesn't do anything,\" Meyers said. \"It's literally just checking to see which processor is running on the computer, if it is a 32- or 64-bit processor and if it is one or the other, it returns either a zero or a one.\" The code fragment, it turns out, was a proof of concept \u2014 a little trial balloon to see if it was possible to modify SolarWinds' signed-and-sealed software code, get it published and then later see it in a downloaded version. And they realized they could. \"So at this point, they know that they can pull off a supply chain attack,\" Meyers said. \"They know that they have that capability.\" After that initial success, the hackers disappeared for five months. When they returned in February 2020, Meyers said, they came armed with an amazing new implant that delivered a backdoor that went into the software itself before it was published. To understand why that was remarkable, you need to know that finished software code has a kind of digital factory seal. If you break that seal, someone can see it and know that the code might have been tampered with. Meyers said the hackers essentially found a way to get under that factory seal. They began by implanting code that told them any time someone on the SolarWinds development team was getting ready to build new software. They understood that the process of creating software or an update typically begins with something routine such as checking a code out of a digital repository, sort of like checking a book out of the library. Under normal circumstances, developers take the code out of the repository, make changes and then check it back in. Once they finish tinkering, they initiate something called the build process, which essentially translates the code a human can read to the code a computer does. At that point, the code is clean and tested. What the hackers did after that was the trick. They would create a temporary update file with the malicious code inside while the SolarWinds code was compiling. The hackers' malicious code told the machine to swap in their temporary file instead of the SolarWinds version. \"I think a lot of people probably assume that it is the source code that's been modified,\" Meyers said, but instead the hackers used a kind of bait-and-switch. Adam Meyers, vice president for threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, said when he became familiar with the SolarWinds attack, he knew it was a big deal.\n                \n                    \n                    Oscar Zagal Studio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Adam Meyers, vice president for threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, said when he became familiar with the SolarWinds attack, he knew it was a big deal. But this, Meyers said, was interesting, too. The hackers understood that companies such as SolarWinds typically audit code before they start building an update, just to make sure everything is as it should be. So they made sure that the switch to the temporary file happened at the last possible second, when the updates went from source code (readable by people) to executable code (which the computer reads) to the software that goes out to customers. The technique reminded Meyers of old fears around trick-or-treating. For decades, there had been an urban myth that kids couldn't eat any Halloween candy before checking the wrapper seal because bad people might have put razor blades inside. What the hackers did with the code, Meyers said, was a little like that. \"Imagine those Reese's Peanut Butter Cups going into the package and just before the machine comes down and seals the package, some other thing comes in and slides a razor blade into your Reese's Peanut Butter Cup,\" he said. Instead of a razor blade, the hackers swapped the files so \"the package gets sealed and it goes out the door to the store.\" The update that went out to SolarWinds' customers was the dangerous peanut butter cup \u2014 the malicious version of the software included code that would give the hackers unfettered, undetected access to any Orion user who downloaded and deployed the update and was connected to the Internet. But there was something else about that code that bothered Meyers: It wasn't just for SolarWinds. \"When we looked at [it], it could have been reconfigured for any number of software products,\" Meyers said. In other words, any number of other software developers using the same compiler may also be on the receiving end of a cyberattack, he said, and they just don't know it yet. Picking and choosing targets Meyers said it's hard not to admire just how much thought the hackers put into this operation. Consider the way they identified targets. The downside of breaking into so many customer networks all at once is that it is hard to decide what to exploit first. So the hackers created a passive domain name server system that sent little messages with not just an IP address, which is just a series of numbers, but also with a thumbnail profile of a potential target. \"So they could then say, 'OK, we're going to go after this dot gov target or whatever,' \" Meyers said. \"I think later it became clear that there were a lot of government technology companies being targeted.\" The hackers also reverse-engineered the way Orion communicated with servers and built their own coding instructions mimicking Orion's syntax and formats. What that did is allow the hackers to look like they were \"speaking\" Orion, so their message traffic looked like a natural extension of the software. \"So once they determined that a target was of interest, they could say, 'OK, let's go active, let's manipulate files, let's change something,' \" Meyers said, and then they would slip in unnoticed through the backdoor they had created. \"And there is one other thing I should mention: This backdoor would wait up to two weeks before it actually went active on the host. This was a very patient adversary.\" None of the tripwires put in place by private companies or the government seems to have seen the attack coming. Christopher Krebs, who had been in charge of the office that protected government networks at DHS during the Trump administration, told NPR that DHS' current system, something known (without irony) as Einstein, only catches known threats. The SolarWinds breach, he said, was just \"too novel.\" Christopher Krebs, who was in charge of protecting government networks during the Trump administration, said the SolarWinds breach used techniques that were \"too novel\" for the current system to catch.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christopher Krebs, who was in charge of protecting government networks during the Trump administration, said the SolarWinds breach used techniques that were \"too novel\" for the current system to catch. \"Upwards of 90[%] to 95% of threats are based on known techniques, known cyberactivity,\" Krebs explained. \"And that's not just criminal actors, that's state actors, too, including the Russian intelligence agencies and the Russian military. This was a previously unidentified technique.\" And there is something else that Einstein doesn't do: It doesn't scan software updates. So even if the hackers had used code that Einstein would have recognized as bad, the system might not have seen it because it was delivered in one of those routine software updates. The National Security Agency and the military's U.S. Cyber Command were also caught flat-footed. Broadly speaking, their cyber operators sit in foreign networks looking for signs of cyberattacks before they happen. They can see suspicious activity in much the same way a satellite might see troops amassing on the border. Critics said they should have seen the hackers from the Russian intelligence service, the SVR, preparing this attack. \"The SVR has a pretty good understanding that the NSA is looking out,\" Krebs said. \"What the SVR was able to do was make the transition from wherever they were operating from into the U.S. networks. They move like ghosts. They are very hard to track.\" The hackers didn't do anything fancy to give them the domestic footprint, officials confirmed. In fact, they just rented servers from Amazon and GoDaddy. Early warnings There were some indications, elsewhere, though, that something was wrong. In early July, Steven Adair, the founder of a Washington, D.C.-based cybersecurity company called Volexity, saw some suspicious activity on a client's computers. \"We traced it back, and we thought it might be related to a bad update with SolarWinds,\" Adair told NPR. \"We addressed the problem, made sure no one was in our customers' systems, and we left it at that.\" Adair said he didn't feel he had enough detail to report the problem to SolarWinds or the U.S. government. \"We thought we didn't have enough evidence to reach out,\" he said. That was the first missed sign. The second came three months later when a California-based cybersecurity company called Palo Alto Networks discovered a malicious backdoor that seemed to emanate from the Orion software. They move like ghosts. They are very hard to track. Christopher Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency In that case, according to SolarWinds' Ramakrishna, the security teams at SolarWinds and Palo Alto worked together for three months to try to pick up the thread of the problem and walk it back. \"None of us could pinpoint a supply chain attack at that point,\" Ramakrishna told NPR. \"The ticket got closed as a result of that. If we had the benefit of hindsight, we could have traced it back\" to the hack. Palo Alto Networks had agreed to speak to NPR about the incident last month and then canceled the interview just an hour before it was supposed to take place. A spokesperson declined to say why and sent a few blog posts and wrote: \"I'm afraid this is all we have to help at this time.\" \"Just 3,500 lines long\" It was the cybersecurity firm FireEye that finally discovered the intrusion. Mandia, the company's CEO, used to be in the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, so his specialty was criminal cases and counterintelligence. In the intervening years, the kinds of patterns he learned to recognize in special investigations kept appearing in his cyber security work. The first indication that hackers had found their way into FireEye's networks came in an innocuous way. Someone on the FireEye security team had noticed that an employee appeared to have two phones registered on his network, so she called him. \"And that phone call is when we realized, hey, this isn't our employee registering that second phone, it was somebody else,\" Mandia said. Mandia had a security briefing a short time later and everything he heard reminded him of his previous work in the military. \"There was a lot of pattern recognition from me,\" he told NPR. \"I spent from 1996 to 1998 responding to what I would equate to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and there were some indicators in the first briefing that were consistent with my experience in the Air Force.\" He called a board meeting the same day. \"It just felt like the breach that I was always worried about.\" What his team discovered over the course of several weeks was that not only was there an intruder in its network, but someone had stolen the arsenal of hacking tools FireEye uses to test the security of its own clients' networks. FireEye called the FBI, put together a detailed report, and once it had determined the Orion software was the source of the problem, it called SolarWinds. Brown, vice president of security at SolarWinds, took the Saturday morning phone call. \"He said, 'Essentially, we've decompiled your code. We found malicious code,' \" Brown said. FireEye was sure SolarWinds \"had shipped tainted code.\" The tainted code had allowed hackers into FireEye's network, and there were bound to be others who were compromised, too. \"We were hearing that different reporters had the scoop already,\" Mandia said. \"My phone actually rang from a reporter and that person knew and I went, OK, we're in a race.\" Mandia thought they had about a day before the story would break. After that, events seemed to speed up. SolarWinds' chief security officer, Brown, called Ron Plesco, a lawyer at the firm DLA Piper, and told him what had happened. One of the first things companies tend to do after cyberattacks is hire lawyers, and they put them in charge of the investigation. They do this for a specific reason \u2014 it means everything they find is protected by attorney-client privilege and typically is not discoverable in court. Ron Plesco, a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper, has made cybercrimes a specialty of his practice. \"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, [hackers are] watching your email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" he said.\n                \n                    \n                    Kriston Jae Bethel for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ron Plesco, a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper, has made cybercrimes a specialty of his practice. \"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, [hackers are] watching your email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" he said. Plesco, who has made cybercrimes a specialty of his practice, knew that once the story broke it would be saying \"to the world that, ready, set, go, come after it,\" Plesco said. \"So that puts you on an accelerated timeline on two fronts: Figure out what happened if you can and get a fix out as soon as possible.\" The company worked with DHS to craft a statement that went out on Dec. 13. To investigate a hack, you have to secure a digital crime scene. Just as detectives in the physical world have to bag the evidence and dust for prints for the investigation later, SolarWinds had to pull together computer logs, make copies of files, ensure there was a recorded chain of custody, all while trying to ensure the hackers weren't inside its system watching everything they did. \"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, they're watching your email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" Plesco said. \"So they're literally listening in on how you're going to try to get rid of them.\" By mid-January, Meyers and the CrowdStrike team had isolated what they thought was the attack's tiny beating heart. It was an elegant, encrypted little blob of code \"just 3,500 lines long,\" he said. The best code is short and to the point, like a well-written sentence. This little encrypted strip, Meyers thought, might help them figure out who was behind the attack. Little blobs of clues Think of forensic cyber teams as digital detectives looking for patterns. Coding tics can sometimes help identify perpetrators or sometimes forensic teams find small cultural artifacts \u2014 such as Persian script, or Korean hangul. When an elite Russian hacking team took over the electrical grid in Ukraine in 2015, it had more literary aspirations: It sprinkled its malicious code with references to Frank Herbert's Dune novels. That's why CrowdStrike found that little blob of malicious code so intriguing. Plesco shows a timeline of the SolarWinds hack on his computer.\n                \n                    \n                    Kriston Jae Bethel for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Plesco shows a timeline of the SolarWinds hack on his computer. After weeks of working with the code, Meyers convened a Zoom call with leaders at SolarWinds and members of his team from around the world. He shared his screen so everyone could all watch the encryption fall away in real time. He began walking the spectators through the code as it was revealed, like a play-by-play analysis of a game. Meyers kept watching for the big reveal. \"We're hoping it's going to have, you know, variable names or maybe some comments in Cyrillic or Mandarin to give us some clue who wrote this thing,\" he said. But as CrowdStrike's decryption program chewed its way through the zeroes and ones, Meyers' heart sank. The crime scene was a bust. It had been wiped down. \"They'd washed the code,\" Meyers said. \"They'd cleaned it of any human artifact or tool mark. And that was kind of mind-blowing that [they] had the wherewithal to hide anything that a human might have inadvertently left behind as a clue.\" Holy s***, he thought to himself, who does that? Just type \"solarwinds123\" Against such a sophisticated hack, it is easy to suggest this could have happened to just about any software company. But there were some troubling signs at SolarWinds that may have made it a target. Consider its online marketing website. It contained a list of clients, including specific companies and government agencies, that ran its Orion software. While a lot of companies do that, the SolarWinds site was very specific. It was, two cybersecurity analysts told NPR, like a shopping list for adversaries. Ramakrishna pushed back on the criticism. \"Lots of companies do it. That is their badge of honor, saying all these customers rely on my technology,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say that was the reason for why we were targeted.\" Ramakrishna said the hackers were \"a lot more sophisticated\" than that. Shortly after the attack, though, that particular page on the marketing website was taken down. There was another unsettling report about passwords. A security researcher in Bangalore, India, named Vinoth Kumar told NPR that he had found the password to a server with SolarWinds apps and tools on a public message board and the password was: \"solarwinds123.\" Kumar said he sent a message to SolarWinds in November and got an automated response back thanking him for his help and saying the problem had been fixed. When NPR asked SolarWinds' vice president of security, Brown, about this, he said that the password \"had nothing to do with this event at all, it was a password to a FTP site.\" An FTP site is what you use to transfer files over the Internet. He said the password was shared by an intern and it was \"not an account that was linked to our active directory.\" Ramakrishna said it was a password for a third-party site where some of SolarWinds' tools and apps were available for download. Ramakrishna admitted, though, that while the matter was unconnected to the breach, it was a problem to have that kind of password on a site that contained something someone might download thinking it was a SolarWinds product. The SolarWinds attackers were masters in novel hacking techniques. The White House has said Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia has denied any involvement.\n                \n                    \n                    Bronte Wittpenn/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The SolarWinds attackers were masters in novel hacking techniques. The White House has said Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia has denied any involvement. \"We used that as another opportunity to reeducate everybody on password policies,\" he said. \"I do not want to minimize it or be casual about it, but I want to highlight that it had nothing to do\" with the attack on Orion. Ramakrishna inherited this attack. He was hired as the SolarWinds CEO shortly before the breach was discovered and stepped into the top job just as the full extent of the hack became clear. In a way, that has given him an incredible freedom. He can't be blamed for something that happened before he got there, and the changes he's making could be seen in the context of a new man in charge instead of a response to the attack. Shortly after he arrived, he published a long blog post providing what was essentially an 11-point plan to improve company security. \"Armed with what we have learned of this attack, we are also reflecting on our own security practices,\" he wrote in the blog post, adding that his goal was to put in place an \"immediate improvement of critical business and product development systems.\" Ramakrishna said he planned to transform SolarWinds into a truly \"secure by design\" organization with more robust threat protection and detection tools across its network, with a particular focus on where it developed and built software \u2014 the places that the SVR hackers used to break in. He said he would establish privileged accounts and all accounts used by anybody who had anything to do with Orion and the company would enforce multifactor authentication, or MFA, across the board. \"If I come up with an 11-point plan to improve my company's security, one interpretation of that could be that we have learned a valuable lesson from what the hack was,\" said Ian Thornton-Trump, chief information security officer at Cyjax, a threat intelligence company. \"The other interpretation could be, is that there were at least 11 material deficiencies in the actual security we had. I see that the 11-point plan is actually an admission that things were not good in this security house.\" Thornton-Trump used to work at SolarWinds and was on the security team. Thornton-Trump left the company in 2017 because, by his own account, SolarWinds' management (Kevin Thompson was CEO at the time. Ramakrishna wouldn't arrive for another three years.) didn't want to spend enough on security. Thornton-Trump concedes that the hackers who broke into the company were so sophisticated it would have been hard for anyone to defend against them. \"But if you're driving drunk, rolling down the road, and it was raining and you smash up your car,\" he said, \"why are we focused so much on the damage to the car, instead of what actually led up to the series of events that led to the great undoing?\" In other words, does the overhaul of SolarWinds' security practices add up to an admission that something was wrong, or is it simply a responsible upgrade? Ramakrishna said it was both. \"Oftentimes what happens is people conduct investigations, identify learnings and then implement something like this,\" he said. \"Can we do things better? Absolutely. And honestly, even after implementing these 11 things, I'll be looking for the next 11 things to work on because the adversaries are becoming smarter and smarter every single day.\" Ramakrishna said he wonders why, of all the software companies it had to choose from, the Russian intelligence service ended up targeting SolarWinds. \"I've thought about this quite a bit as to why us, why not somebody else,\" he said. \"And that goes on through any investigation. As you think about this, we are deployed in more than 300,000 customers today. And so we are fairly broadly deployed software and where we enjoy administrative privileges in customer environments. So in a supply chain attack like this, the goal will be to try to get a broad swath of deployment and then you pick and choose what you want to do from there.\" Whatever the reason SolarWinds ended up in the crosshairs, the attack revealed the U.S. cyber community's spectacular inability to connect the dots. Not just the early warnings from Volexity or the investigation with Palo Alto Networks, but a simple discovery from a lone cyber researcher in Bangalore suggests that something is not right in our digital world. Bigger attacks \"It's one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time,\" said Alex Stamos, director of the Internet Observatory at Stanford University and the former head of security at Facebook. \"In doing so, they demonstrated not just technical acumen, but the way they did this demonstrated that they understand how tech companies operate, how software companies operate. ... This certainly is going to change the way that large enterprises think about the software they install and think about how they handle updates.\" The adversaries are becoming smarter and smarter every single day. Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds CEO and president Intelligence analysts, already years ahead of the rest of us, are paid to imagine the darkest of scenarios. What if the hackers planted the seeds of future attacks during that nine months they explored SolarWinds' customer networks \u2014 did they hide code for backdoors that will allow them to come and go as they please at a time of their choosing? When hackers shut down the Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and disabled a Saudi refinery with computer code a year later, they showed it was possible to jump from a corporate network to system controls. Will we find out later that the SolarWinds hack set the stage for something more sinister? Even if this was just an espionage operation, FireEye's Mandia said, the attack on SolarWinds is an inflection point. \"We ... kind of mapped out the evolution of threats and cyber,\" he said. \"And we would have landed at this day sooner or later, that at some point in time, software that many companies depend on is going to get targeted and it's going to lead to exactly what it led to,\" Mandia said. \"But to see it happen, that's where you have a little bit of shock and surprise. OK, it's here now, nations are targeting [the] private sector, there's no magic wand you can shake. ... It's a real complex issue to solve.\" The Biden administration is working on a second executive order \u2014 beyond the sanctions \u2014 that is supposed to address some of the issues SolarWinds has put in stark relief. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology in charge of the SolarWinds attack response, is preparing an order that would, among other things, require companies that work with the U.S. government to meet certain software standards, and federal agencies would be required to adopt basic security practices such as encrypting data in their systems. In addition, software companies such as SolarWinds could be required to have their so-called build systems \u2014 the place where they assemble their software \u2014 air-gapped, which means they would not be connected to the Internet. Those elements are all still under discussion as part of the executive order, NPR has learned. Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, is in charge of the SolarWinds attack response. She is preparing an order that would require companies that work with the U.S. to meet certain software standards, and federal agencies would be required to adopt certain basic security practices.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, is in charge of the SolarWinds attack response. She is preparing an order that would require companies that work with the U.S. to meet certain software standards, and federal agencies would be required to adopt certain basic security practices. Another idea starting to gain traction is to create a kind of National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, to investigate cyberattacks in a more formal way. \"When the Boeing 737 Maxes started crashing, there was a government agency whose entire job it was to gather up the facts of all those different crashes and then come up with a theory of what needed to be fixed and then oversaw the fixes that went into that,\" Stamos said. \"We need the same kind of function in the U.S. government.\" The FBI could do its investigation of the cybercrime and some sort of federal agency would look at the root causes of a cyberattack and make the appropriate changes to the way we do things. Mandia said something like that probably needs to exist. \"When you think about the conflict, you have air, land and sea and space and now cyber,\" he said. \"But in cyber, the private sector is front and center. Any conflict in cyberspace, whether motivated by a criminal element or motivated by geopolitical conditions, it's going to involve both the government and the private sector. And that response, because it impacts both, you almost need a triage that both sides, both private and public sector, benefit from similar to the NTSB.\" Mandia envisions a review board for significant incidents where intelligence is gathered and the nation finds a way to defend itself appropriately. Right now, the onus is on private companies to do all the investigations. A Biden administration official told reporters during a background briefing  Thursday that one reason the White House responded so strongly to the SolarWinds attack is because these kinds of hacks put an undue burden on private companies. It's one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time. Alex Stamos, director of the Internet Observatory at Stanford University and former head of security at Facebook A federal review might help with one of the issues that has plagued cyberspace up to now: how to ensure software and hardware vendors disclose hacks when they discover them. Could a review board take the sting out of the reputation damage of admitting publicly you've been hacked? Would it give companies such as Volexity and Palo Alto Networks somewhere to go when they see a problem? Ultimately, the goal is to connect the dots and respond in a way that makes us safer. And the impetus for all of this might be that tainted routine update. That's one of the key reasons SolarWinds decided to go public, Ramakrishna said. \"We went out and published the entire source code because what we wanted people to do, no matter the vendor, whether it could be a competitor of ours or not, is to check your software, make sure you don't have a situation like this, and if there is, clean it up,\" he said. \"So while it was unfortunate that we were the subject of this attack, my hope is, by us learning from it, we can also help the broader community.\" Even so, there are parts of this story that may sound familiar: missed opportunities, hints of a problem that were ignored, the failure of U.S. intelligence officials to connect the dots. Who would have thought a routine software update could launch a cyberattack of epic proportions? \"This was an intelligence collection operation meant to steal information, and it's not the last time that's going to happen,\"  CrowdStrike's Meyers warned. \"This is going to happen every day. ... And I think there's a lot that we all need to do to work together to stop this from happening.\" NPR's Monika Evstatieva contributed to this report.",

Updated at 3:54 p.m. ET President-elect Joe Biden delivered a blistering rebuke of President Trump on Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump mob breached the U.S. Capitol. Biden called Wednesday \"one of the darkest days\" in U.S. history but said: \"I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming. But that isn't true. We could see it coming.\" He said the events were the \"culmination\" of Trump's flirtation with white supremacists and extremists, and years of attacks on democratic institutions, including the media and the justice system. Biden made the remarks (read them in full below) before introducing his choice for U.S. attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, during an event in Wilmington, Del. Garland is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Washington. But he is likely best known as a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court who was refused even a hearing by Senate Republicans after President Barack Obama nominated him to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. Garland also previously served in the Justice Department, leading investigations into the \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski and into the Oklahoma City bombing. \"Entering the Department of Justice will be a kind of homecoming for me,\" Garland said. He echoed Biden's long-stated goals about what the men called the importance of restoring the reputation of the Justice Department, which they and some other critics argue has been tarnished under Trump. Biden, for his part, stressed that he viewed the Justice Department and the attorney general as independent and sought to make a strong contrast with the way he said they'd operated under Trump. Biden also announced he intends to nominate Lisa Monaco to the Justice Department's second-highest post, deputy attorney general. Monaco is another Justice Department veteran, and the first woman assistant attorney general for national security. Monaco also served as White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser under Obama. Biden also tapped Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general. She now heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and was previously assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. The president-elect said he's nominating Kristen Clarke to fill that post in his administration. She is now president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Clarke also served in the Justice Department in the Civil Rights Division and as a prosecutor in the Criminal Division. Biden addressed his intended nominees and the current employees of the Justice Department on Thursday. \"You won't work for me,\" he said. \"You are not the president's or the vice president's lawyers. Your loyalty is not to me. It is to the law. To the Constitution. The people of this nation. To guarantee justice.\" Biden also pointedly noted that Wednesday's attempted insurrection at the Capitol constituted a \"failure to carry out equal justice.\" \"No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,\" he said. \"We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable.\" In a statement Thursday, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said that \"the DOJ is committed to ensuring that those responsible for this attack on our Government and the rule of law face the full consequences of their actions under the law.\" Read Biden's remarks on the Capitol attack: Yesterday, in my view, was one of the darkest days in the history of our nation. An unprecedented assault on our democracy, an assault literally on the citadel of liberty, in the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings: ratifying the will of the people and choosing the leadership of their government. All of us here grieve the loss of life. Grieve the desecration of the people's house. But we, what we witnessed yesterday was not dissent, it was not disorder, it was not protest. It was chaos. They weren't protesters \u2014 don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob of insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It's that basic. It's that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming. But that isn't true. We could see it coming. The past four years, we've had a president who's made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, the rule of law clear in everything he has done. He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He's attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press \"the enemy of the people.\" Language at the time he first used it, I and others said, has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold on to power \u2014 the enemy of the people. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imprimatur of an outgoing president of the United States of America. He's attacked our intelligence services, who dared tell the American people the truth about the effort of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who sworn their allegiance to this nation, many of whom had risked their lives in the service of this nation. He deployed the United States military, tear-gassing peaceful protesters in pursuit of a photo opportunity in the service of his reelection, even holding the Bible upside down. The action that led to an apology from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and an outspoken denunciation of the use of military for domestic political purposes from scores, scores of former military leaders and secretaries of defense, led by Secretary [Dick] Cheney. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges, who would support him no matter what. They were \"Trump judges,\" his judges. He went so far as to say he needed nine justices on the Supreme Court because, because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election. He was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding, instead acted with integrity, following the Constitution, upholding the rule of law \u2014 not just once or twice or three times, but over 60 times. Let me say, over 60 times. In more than 60 cases in state, after state, after state. And then at the Supreme Court, his judges, including people considered, quote, \"his judges, Trump judges,\" use his words. Looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit. Nothing was judged to put this election in question or doubt by any of these judges. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country? Take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by a sitting president of the United States of America. At every level. The judiciary rose to the moment during this election. Did its job. Acted with complete fairness and impartiality, with complete honor and integrity. When history looks back on this moment we've just passed through, I believe it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent an independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude. And then there's the attack on the Department of Justice. Treating the attorney general as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president: \"my generals, my judges, my attorney general.\" And then yesterday, a culmination of attack on our institutions of democracy. This time, the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten elected representatives of the people of this nation, and even the vice president, to stop the Congress from ratifying the will of the American people in a just-completed free and fair election. Trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of a pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast that sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race, that what I believed was at stake \u2014 I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, we're a government of law \u2014 not of men, not of the people, of laws. I said it many times in the campaign. Our democratic institutions are not relics of another age. They're what set this nation apart. They're the guardrails of our democracy. That's why there is no president who is a king. No Congress that's a House of Lords. A judiciary doesn't serve the will of the president or exist to protect him or her. We have three coequal branches of government \u2014 coequal. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people. It doesn't protect the powerful. Justice is blind. What we saw yesterday, in plain view was another violation of a fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only do we see the failure to protect one of the three branches of our government. We also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice. As we used to say in the Senate, excuse a point of personal privilege. A little over an hour and a half after the chaos started, I got a text from my granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, who is a senior in her last semester, the University of Pennsylvania. She sent me a photo of military people in full military gear. Scores of them lining the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Because of protests by Black Lives Matter. She said, \"Pop. This isn't fair.\" No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol. We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The American people saw it in plain view. And I hope it's sensitized them to what we have to do. Not many people know it. When Justice Garland and I were talking we talked about, I think he raised it, the reason for the Justice Department was formed in the first place. Was back in 1870. We didn't have a Justice Department before that, the Cabinet. It was formed in 1870 to enforce the civil rights amendment that grew out of the Civil War \u2014 the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. To stand up to the Klan, to stand up to racism. To take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must again guide and animate its work. So as we stand here today we do so in the wake of yesterday's events. Events that could not more have vividly demonstrated some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation, invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America.",

A bill to study reparations for slavery advanced through a House committee this year but hasn't gotten a floor vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The chained hand of Archer Alexander, who was the last slave captured under the fugitive slave law, is depicted in a statue commemorating the Emancipation Proclamation. A bill to study reparations for slavery advanced through a House committee this year but hasn't gotten a floor vote. Seven months ago, a House committee advanced a bill to study reparations for slavery, after more than three decades of efforts to build support for the idea. But the bill has not been taken up for consideration by the full House of Representatives even though it has the backing of some of the country's most prominent Democrats. \"Since April there has been very little movement on the bill by the leadership in Congress,\" said Kamm Howard, a national co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America. Advocates for reparations are frustrated despite the fact that the proposal faces steep odds of fully passing the closely divided Congress even if the House did take it up. The bill is H.R. 40, and it gets its name from the unmet promise that former slaves would be given \"40 acres and a mule\" as the Civil War drew to a close. It would establish a 13-person commission to study the effects of slavery and racial discrimination in the United States, from before the country's finding to present day. The commission would hold hearings, submit its findings to Congress and recommend \"appropriate remedies.\" It would also consider a \"national apology\" for the harm caused by slavery. The bill's original sponsor, the late Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, first proposed the bill in 1989, and did so year after year for nearly three decades, until he retired in 2017. After that, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas began sponsoring the bill. \"I don't think anyone could argue against the fact that the trajectory of slavery has gone through the centuries, the decades and is in the DNA of descendants of enslaved Africans,\" Jackson Lee, a Democrat, said in an interview with NPR. \"America would do well to try to bring healing and repair, in this time and in this century.\" The bill finally gained political traction among Democrats as the country grappled with race and systemic racism and protests sparked by the killings of Black Americans by police flowed through the streets of U.S. cities large and small over the last two years. The bill has nearly 200 co-sponsors in the House, including members of House Democratic leadership. But it is widely opposed by Republicans and was advanced by the House Judiciary Committee in April with only Democratic votes. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the Judiciary Committee's top Republican, argued that because the committee's members would be appointed by the president, the House speaker and the Senate pro tempore, who are currently all Democrats, the commission would obviously come to a conclusion in support of reparations. \"Spend $20 million for a commission that's already decided to take money from people who were never involved in the evil of slavery and give it to people who were never subject to the evil of slavery,\" Jordan said during the hearing on the bill. \"That's what Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are doing.\" Rep. Burgess Owens of Utah, one of two Black Republicans currently serving in the House, said that the concept of reparations is \"divisive.\" \"Reparation where you take people's money that they've earned \u2014 it's punishment, it's theft, it's judgement,\" he said in the hearing. \"It's saying that because of your skin color, you owe me. That is not the American way. We're not racist people. This American country is based on meritocracy.\" Jackson Lee says arguments like this miss the point. The bill does not prescribe what form reparations should take, a question that is a point of debate among supporters of reparations for slavery. \"It is not the study of getting a check. It is not giving you a check. It is not the bill on a check,\" Jackson Lee said. \"It is to study slavery and develop reparations proposals, which would create, first of all, the platform for understanding.\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman talked about reparations frequently when he campaigned for his New York congressional seat. \"We haven't taken a moment to stop and pause and reflect and look ourselves in the mirror as a country and really be honest with ourselves about how those harms continue to persist,\" Bowman said. A group of advocates has been pushing Democrats to bring the bill up for a vote, arguing that it is deeply popular. \"We are working diligently to basically get them all in a room with us and tell us directly how we can move this bill forward,\" said Nicole Austin-Hillery of Human Rights Watch, one of the advocates calling for a meeting with House leaders. \"They have the power to do it, and we're imploring them to do so.\" Some argue that House leadership has yet to bring the bill up for a vote because they fear a backlash among voters. Democrats are coming off of a series of bruising off-year elections that featured fresh Republican attacks on race and culture. In next year's midterms, Democrats will be defending incredibly slim majorities. \"The Democratic leaders are saying that they are scared if they move this legislation today, that it will hurt their chances of keeping control of the Congress,\" said Howard. A senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the status of pending legislation, said that conversations about the legislation are ongoing, and that Democratic leadership and the White House are working together on the path forward. The aide said that equity is a central priority of the party. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a co-sponsor of the bill, told reporters earlier this year that he hopes that President Biden considers establishing a commission similar to the one called for in H.R. 40 using executive authority, noting that the chances of the bill passing the Senate \"are pretty dim.\" In the evenly divided Senate, legislation requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. A Senate companion bill, sponsored by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, has just 22 co-sponsors, with no Republicans. The idea of Biden establishing a commission on his own has also won the support of some activists, including the Rev. Mark Thompson. \"What sets H.R. 40 apart from all of those other pieces of legislation that 'Manchinema' are blocking, is this\" he said \u2014 using a compound reference to moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. \"H.R 40 is the only one ... that Biden can sign and enact by executive order.\" The White House hasn't said whether Biden would consider creating a commission on his own. \"He supports a number of components of the bill, including the funding and the proposal for a study, which he feels would be the next important step forward and something that he feels would be absolutely correct in addressing ... these moments in history,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in June. Jackson Lee said she's focused on the legislative process and still hopes to get a \"successful result\" in the House, but said that there's a \"great deal of power in the White House and in the presidency.\" \"I think there is certainly a sufficient body of people that would give President Biden a standing ovation if that was the direction that we needed to take,\" she said.",

Texas Republicans have approved redrawn U.S. House maps that favor incumbents and decrease political representation for growing minority communities, even as Latinos drive much of the growth in the nation's largest red state. AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Republicans approved redrawn U.S. House maps that favor incumbents and decrease political representation for growing minority communities, even as Latinos drive much of the growth in the nation's largest red state. The maps were approved late Monday night following outcry from Democrats over what they claimed was a rushed redistricting process crammed into a 30-day session, and one which gave little time for public input. They also denounced the reduction of minority opportunity districts \u2014 Texas will now have seven House districts where Latino residents hold a majority, down from eight \u2014 despite the state's changing demographics. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign off on changes that Republicans approved Monday, redrawing the U.S. House maps that favor incumbents and decrease political representation for growing minority communities.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign off on changes that Republicans approved Monday, redrawing the U.S. House maps that favor incumbents and decrease political representation for growing minority communities. \"What we are doing in passing this congressional map is a disservice to the people of Texas,\" Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia said to the chamber just before the final vote. GOP Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign off on the changes. Civil rights groups, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, sued before Republican lawmakers were even done Monday. The lawsuit alleges that Republican mapmakers diluted the political strength of minority voters by not drawing any new districts where Latino residents hold a majority, despite Latinos making up half of Texas' 4 million new residents over the last decade. Abbott's office did not respond to a message seeking comment. Republicans have said they followed the law in defending the maps, which protect their slipping grip on Texas by pulling more GOP-leaning voters into suburban districts where Democrats have made inroads in recent years. Texas has been routinely dragged into court for decades over voting maps, and in 2017, a federal court found that a Republican-drawn map was drawn to intentionally discriminate against minority voters. But two years later, that same court said there was insufficient reason to take the extraordinary step of putting Texas back under federal supervision before changing voting laws or maps. The maps that overhaul how Texas' nearly 30 million residents are sorted into political districts \u2014 and who is elected to represent them \u2014 bookends a highly charged year in the state over voting rights. Democratic lawmakers twice walked out on an elections bill that tightened the state's already strict voting rules, which they called a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. The plan does not create any additional districts where Black or Hispanic voters make up more than 50% of the voting population, even as people of color accounted for more than 9 of 10 new residents in Texas over the past decade. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman, who authored the maps and leads the Senate Redistricting Committee, told fellow lawmakers that they were \"drawn blind to race.\" She said her legal team ensured the plan followed the Voting Rights Act. The Texas GOP control both chambers of the Legislature, giving them nearly complete control of the mapmaking process. The state has had to defend their maps in court after every redistricting process since the Voting Rights Act took effect in 1965, but this will be the first since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling said Texas and other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need to have the Justice Department scrutinize the maps before they are approved. However, drawing maps to engineer a political advantage is not unconstitutional. The proposal would also make an estimated two dozen of the state's 38 congressional districts safe Republican districts, with an opportunity to pick up at least one additional newly redrawn Democratic stronghold on the border with Mexico, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from last year's election collected by the Texas Legislative Council. Currently, Republicans hold 23 of the state's 36 seats. Following negotiations between Texas House members and state senators, the districts of Houston area districts of U.S. Rep Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who is serving her 14th term, and U.S. Rep Al Green, a neighboring Democrat, were restore, unpairing the two and drawing Jackson Lee's home back into her district. Texas lawmakers also approved redrawn maps for their own districts, with Republicans following a similar plan that does not increase minority opportunity districts and would keep their party in power in the state House and Senate.",

Women's Equality Day is all about celebrating equal rights, but it's important to note that when women first won the right to vote more than a century ago, equal rights weren't so equal. The basics of Women's Equality Day are easy enough to understand: we celebrate it because on August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment was certified, making it illegal to deny citizens the right to vote based on sex. Here's what you might not know: the blanket use of the word \"women\" when discussing what the 19th Amendment changed is misleading. Millions of women \u2014 those who weren't white \u2014 were effectively left out when it came to gaining the right to vote in 1920, despite Black women's involvement in the suffragette movement. Some white suffragettes also viewed it as a great injustice that they did not have the right to vote, even though Black men legally did. What appeared to be a fight for equality on the surface had more than a few racist caveats tacked on, creating a stark contradiction in what suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony were arguing was morally right. \"This history should be a reminder to all of us that selective equality that only affords benefits to a privileged few is simply another form of inequality in disguise,\" Jocelyn Frye, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told NPR. \"Thus, it is critical to have an accurate understanding of the history being commemorated by Women's Equality Day \u2013 so that while we celebrate the progress achieved, we also recognize the inadequacy of this progress, especially for women of color.\" Does that mean it's problematic to observe Women's Equality Day? Speaking to numerous women of color who are voting rights advocates, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. In fact, the question itself might be the wrong one altogether. While gaining the right to vote for white women was a journey that ended in the fall of 1920, it would take other disenfranchised groups decades longer to gain equal access to the polls. Black women were largely prevented from voting due to individual state laws, harassment and violence, and other racist barriers designed to control which groups had political power. The 24th Amendment in 1962 helped to chip away at voting equality by barring states from tying the right to vote to poll taxes, but many people of color did not fully gain the legal right to vote until the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outright barred racial discrimination at the polls. For example, Black men were legally allowed to vote due to the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870, but they faced an extremely difficult time actually exercising that right in practice. But even the Voting Rights Act wasn't full-proof protection for marginalized communities: the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act was a huge factor in combating discrimination based on language, which had played a role for decades in the Latinx community being able to exercise their right to vote. Similar language-based tactics were used against Asian Americans, who had to fight a hard road to first gain citizenship and then vote, Asian Americans Advancing Justice explained in a 2015 report. And although Native Americans got the right to vote in 1924 with the Indian Citizenship Act, several states continued to bar them from voting; they continued to be kept away from the polls for decades. Even today, Native American communities struggle with access due to loopholes involving voting ID laws, according to a 2019 report from the Brennan Center For Justice.

So what does this day mean for every group who was left out of the 1920 victory? It's possible to acknowledge that the 19th Amendment was an important step towards gaining equal voting rights while still acknowledging that what many suffragettes was fighting for wasn't truly fair, Tiana Epps-Johnson, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Tech and Civic Life, explained. \"As a woman of color, I get to hold multiple things at once being true,\" she said. \"There were deliberate choices to exalt the rights of white women in particular in this effort at the expense of the rights of Black women, and that is a part of the history of women's rights that we don't really sit with.\" \"Like a lot of my work in democracy, I'm really fueled by that gap between the stories that we tell ourselves about what is at the heart of our democracy ... about it being for everybody, and the gap that exists in practice between that,\" she continued. \"And I see that there continues to be these gaps today between the democracy of our ideals and that democracy in practice.\" Kat Calvin, founder of the nonprofit Spread The Vote, had a similar view: that we can acknowledge an important moment, if for no other reason than that it played a vital role in reaching a later victory. \"It's not practically true [that all women were able to vote after the 19th Amendment], but it's still a thing we should celebrate,\" Calvin said. \"And we, as Black women, would not have been able to win the right to vote, you know, practically ... if that amendment hadn't passed, so it was a really important moment and an important step for us to be able to get where we needed to go.\" For Frye, it's all about the opportunity to learn and to push forward toward change using the knowledge that we can glean from our nation's complicated history. \"For me, Women's Equality Day is really an opportunity to remind people that equality in words is not the same as equality in practice,\" she explained, adding that the history of the holiday can be a valuable teaching moment. \"The racism that fueled women of color effectively being excluded from the protections of the 19th amendment is the same racism fueling today's voter suppression efforts. These connections become clearer when we take the time to look beneath the historical rhetoric and, instead, create an accurate historical narrative that can inform our present-day actions.\" Members of the National Woman's Party appear in front of their Washington headquarters.\n                \n                    \n                    Library of Congress\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of the National Woman's Party appear in front of their Washington headquarters. The fight for voting equality didn't end on August 26, 1920, or even on August 6, 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was made law. It's not over today, either, advocates agree. \"To view voting equality as a thing of the past is to deny ongoing efforts to gerrymander districts that prevent marginalized communities from fully being able to exercise their opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice,\" Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights attorney, adjunct professor and voting rights advocate, told NPR. \"[It's to ignore] the Supreme Court finding section four of the voting rights unconstitutional,\" she continued, referring to a series of Supreme Court decisions that have left Americans, in 2021, without many of the protections that the Voting Rights Act was intended to provide. The fight for equal voting rights is very much in progress and it's being fought in local election offices, in voting registration drives, in protests and in rallies. And there are things you can do to get involved. Epps-Johnson stressed how essential volunteer poll workers are. OuYang suggested taking action beyond just casting your vote \u2014 learn about and get involved in redistricting, which happens every 10 years and has a powerful effect on all future elections, she said. \"Being informed and being educated is the first step,\" OuYang said. For Calvin, the impact that any one individual can have can't be stressed enough. \"We're in a place now where Congress isn't going to save us. ... It's up to us to look around our family or friends or our neighborhood and say, 'All right, I'm going to make sure that 100 percent of the people in my family vote. What do I have to do to do that?'\"",

The Justice Department calls the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \"the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted by the United States Congress.\" The law put an end to literacy tests, which prevented many people from registering to vote, in a half-dozen states, granted the attorney general the power to send observers to witness elections and gave the federal government the authority to preapprove voting and election changes in places with a history of discrimination. Within a few years of its passage, the Voting Rights Act had paved the way for thousands of Black and brown voters to go to the ballot box. Bipartisan majorities in Congress reauthorized the act five times, most recently in 2006, when then-President George W. Bush lauded the law and pledged to defend it in court. The landmark law has gotten a different reception at the highest court in the land in the last few years. In two decisions, spanning eight years, a conservative majority of Supreme Court justices upended the law's core enforcement powers. The most recent decision, in July, has prompted national marches, including one set to culminate in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington. The rally comes on the heels of House passage of legislation to override the Supreme Court and update the Voting Rights Act. But prospects for the bill are dim in a closely divided Congress. In the years after the Civil War, the United States adopted three constitutional amendments. The 13th Amendment ended slavery and involuntary servitude \"except as punishment for crime.\" The 14th Amendment codified birthright citizenship and promised \"due process of law,\" among other steps. And the 15th Amendment gave Black men the right to vote. For a brief period, Black voters raced to the ballot box, electing officials of their choice to high office. But all too soon, Southern states passed their own laws making it more difficult for people of color to vote, including literacy tests, poll taxes and a horrible campaign of violence. By the 1960s, white voter registration in some states was 50 percentage points greater than Black voter registration. \"Give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with men of goodwill and send to the sacred halls of Congress men who will not sign a 'Southern manifesto' because of their devotion to the manifesto of justice,\" King said in a major address in Washington in 1957. Then, in early 1965, armed state troopers viciously beat a group of nonviolent marchers in Selma, Ala. Footage of those protesters being sprayed with chemicals and clubbed by police batons shocked the conscience of the country and helped then-President Lyndon B. Johnson make the case for the Voting Rights Act. Months later, Johnson signed the act into law. \"What history shows is that sort of federal intervention was the main thing that could affect systemic change to the problem of racial discrimination in voting,\" professor Atiba Ellis of Marquette University told The NPR Politics Podcast for its legal series, \"The Docket.\" President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act into law on Aug. 6, 1965.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act into law on Aug. 6, 1965. In 2013, in a case called Shelby County v. Holder, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that a lot of things had changed, that the world had changed since the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The 5-4 decision effectively derailed the Justice Department's system for preapproving election changes in jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, putting a heavy burden on the federal government to identify any such changes and sue to prevent them from taking effect. The high court ruling prompted states to pass new restrictions on voting. Then, in July, another conservative court majority severely weakened the remaining enforcement tool for the Department of Justice: a provision that gave the federal government the legal authority to challenge voting laws that discriminate on the basis of race, color and language minority status. In Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, Justice Samuel Alito concluded that some inconvenience to voters would not run afoul of the Constitution. His majority opinion also gave states a powerful defense: They could raise concerns about voter fraud to justify their election changes without having to prove any such fraud existed. Lawsuits by the Justice Department and civil rights groups over voting changes in Georgia are continuing in the courts. But it's not yet clear what fate they will meet. Democrats in Congress have been pressing for at least two different voting rights measures that would restore the federal government's enforcement powers at the ballot box. One is named after the late Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat whose beating on \"Bloody Sunday\" in 1965 horrified a national audience and helped push the Voting Rights Act over the finish line on Capitol Hill later that year. But Democrats are facing mathematical challenges. Based on current Senate rules, they need 60 votes, including 10 Republicans, to advance any voting measures. So far, they've been unable to muster them. \"It's a critical moment in the fight for voting rights,\" Mahogane Reed of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund told The NPR Politics Podcast. \"The onslaught of new voting laws is so heavy. Intervention from Congress is absolutely critical.\"",

            "article_content": "Texas Democrats blocked Republicans from passing restrictive voting legislation. With GOP state lawmakers set to take up an election bill in a special session, Democrats are hoping Congress steps in.  NOEL KING, HOST: Republican lawmakers in Texas plan to try again to pass new restrictions on voting. A few weeks ago, their Democratic colleagues walked out of the state Capitol to block a bill. But stopping this upcoming effort could be harder. So voting groups and Democrats in Texas have set their sights on federal voting protections. Here's Ashley Lopez from member station KUT in Austin. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Lorna Ramsey recently attended a voting rights rally in Austin. This is an issue that Ramsey says she cares a lot about. She says she remembers the day in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Voting Rights Act. LORNA RAMSEY: When I heard that, I mean, I chilled. I got a chill. LOPEZ: Justices struck down a provision that required Texas and some other states with a history of racial discrimination to clear voting laws with the federal government. Ramsey is a Black woman, and she's lived in Texas and in the South for a long time. And she says these provisions are still needed today. RAMSEY: I know about the racism. And I know about the voter suppression that's in the area. And I didn't think that we had moved that far. And I thought without clearance, you know, the floodgates were going to open. LOPEZ: Since that ruling, Republican lawmakers in Texas have passed a slew of bills that add more restrictions to voting. They also reinstated a strict voter ID law that had been struck down. But after the 2020 election, Republican leadership said elections in Texas were still not secure enough. A few months ago, Texas's lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, told reporters more safeguards were necessary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN PATRICK: People in America have lost faith in their elections, in the outcome. And we have to resolve that issue in this country and in the state. LOPEZ: Even though there was no evidence of election security issues in Texas during last year's elections, Republicans still filed sweeping legislation that would create a host of new criminal penalties related to voting. And behind closed doors, Republicans added some last-minute provisions that would limit voting on Sundays and make it easier to overturn elections following allegations of voter fraud. JESSICA GONZALEZ: I mean, this is nothing new. Only we just have not seen a bill like this that's so egregious. LOPEZ: That's Democratic State Representative Jessica Gonzalez of Dallas. She says those last-minute provisions were sprung on Democrats. That's why they eventually walked out of the Capitol right before a final vote. And while the bill is dead for now, Texas's Republican governor has already called the legislature back to pass a voting bill. Gonzalez says she hopes Republicans will include Democrats in the process more this time and rethink some of the more controversial measures. GONZALEZ: But overall, I don't expect that it's going to change too much. LOPEZ: And this is why Texas Democrats have been setting their sights lately on getting Congress to pass federal protections for voters. Former Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke has been touring the state, holding rallies and telling Texans that part of the solution to the state's voting restrictions lies in Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BETO O'ROURKE: There is a federal answer to what ails us at this moment. And it's called the For the People Act. LOPEZ: Recently, a group of Texas Democrats visited Washington to make the case to key lawmakers that a federal law would be a lifeline for Texas voters. O'Rourke and others also want legislation that would restore parts of the Voting Rights Act. Lorna says she wants Congress to intervene. RAMSEY: It's shameless what's happening. So it's imperative that the federal government step in and does something. LOPEZ: But that lifeline is looking unlikely. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked consideration of a federal voting overhaul, and Texas lawmakers will reconvene next week. For NPR News, I'm Ashley Lopez in Austin.

Southern Baptists are gathered this week in Nashville, Tenn., for an annual meeting that could prove a turning point as the faithful square off on an array of divisive issues that some fear could drive a wedge into the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. Tuesday marks the first full day for the event in which the voting members of the Southern Baptist Convention could tackle high-profile issues including racial discrimination, gender inequality and sexual abuse. The organization is one of the country's most politically influential. It has long aligned itself with conservative causes, and top evangelicals in the convention enthusiastically backed former President Donald Trump. This week, the Southern Baptist Convention's voting members will choose a new leader \u2014 a decision that could either signal a continuation of the status quo or set the stage for a more conservative ideological shift.

Last week, recordings were leaked of internal meetings that critics have said shows the denomination's top leaders were slow-walking reforms that would address sexual abuse. \"At this point, the SBC's core values are deeply connected with Republican Party politics,\" Greene says. \"I'd use the term 'reactionary' rather than 'conservative' to describe those, particularly with regard to race, gender, and authority.\" In 2018, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, the denomination's flagship institution, issued a report on the role that racism has played in the leadership and how support for slavery helped shape the denomination in its earliest days. The SBC announced last week that it hired Guidepost Solutions, an independent investigation and risk-management firm, to review the group's handling of internal abuse issues. However, during the SBC executive committee meeting Monday, leaders rejected a request by Jared Wellman, a Texas pastor, to amend its agenda to consider expanding the third-party investigation of the leadership's handling of  sexual abuse claims. Wellman's amendment would have required the SBC to appoint an independent task force to receive the full report from Guidepost and relay its findings to the entire convention. Jared Wellman, pastor at Tate Springs Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, on Monday hands out copies of his motion that called for an independent committee to lead a probe of the denomination's handling of sex abuse cases.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Humphrey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jared Wellman, pastor at Tate Springs Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, on Monday hands out copies of his motion that called for an independent committee to lead a probe of the denomination's handling of sex abuse cases. Joe Knott, the executive committee secretary, argued that such a step would violate Baptist policy by handing \"essentially unlimited power\" to an outside party, according to Baptist Press. Knott also said the proposal wouldn't stop sexual abuse. The issue is reportedly not dead, and critics of the move have expressed outrage over the executive committee's inaction. On social media, a group of people who say they faced sexual abuse within the denomination shared an open letter to the leadership demanding change. The majority of the Southern Baptist membership remains white, and it is less diverse than U.S. protestants overall, according to Pew Research Center. When the executive committee voted in leadership elections Monday, Rolland Slade, the committee's first Black chairman, was reelected to a second one-year term without opposition. But little else about the denomination reflects diversity, critics say. Dwight McKissic, a pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, spoke with NPR's Morning Edition last week of his concern with the recent effort within the SBC to ban the teaching of critical race theory at its seminaries. In a controversial move last year, the Council of Seminary Presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention affirmed in a statement that while the seminaries condemn \"racism in any form,\" they agree that \"affirmation of Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality and any version of Critical Theory is incompatible with the Baptist Faith & Message.\" The statement caused a backlash among some Black pastors, causing several to leave. The SBC forbids women from becoming pastors, although some congregations have ordained them. The executive committee punted on an amendment vote to form a task force \"of gender and ethnic background to study the biblical authority and biblical viability of a woman serving or not serving as the SBC president.\" The SBC's Book of Reports for this year's convention \u2014 which contains reports from SBC entities and recommendations from the executive committee \u2014 recommends not making changes to its statement of faith, known as the Baptist Faith and Message, regarding the role of women. \"My optimism is very low that the SBC is going to move on the issue of women preaching, teaching or leading,\" Beth Allison Barr, a history professor at Baylor University, told Morning Edition last week. According to the Book of Reports, the organization will continue to lobby on its conservative political positions, lauding the SBC's recent efforts to join in \"cases against an abortion industry that has attempted to use the pandemic as a pretext for their horrific agenda.\" The SBC's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, also affirmed that it plans to \"continue to work tirelessly to defund Planned Parenthood.\" \"We will do this to protect American taxpayer dollars from the largest abortion provider in the country,\" according to an ERLC statement in the Book of Reports. ERLC said it opposes the Equality Act \u2014 which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit and the jury system. The bill recently passed the House of Representatives but faces an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate. The ERLC has also expressed opposition to the Fairness for All Act, a bill introduced in 2019 that supporters say is aimed at prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity while providing certain benefits and exemptions to religious providers. However, Emory University's Greene cautions that while the SBC's actions are a \"bellwether of the direction of the Christian far right\" and have national significance, the body is \"not representative of U.S. Christianity, U.S. evangelicalism, or even U.S. conservatism, as much as it claims to be all three.\"",

            "article_content": "With Roe v. Wade hanging by a thread, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider a major rollback of abortion rights. It is the second time in weeks that the court's new conservative majority has signaled a willingness to reconsider long-established legal doctrine, this time on abortion, and just weeks ago, on guns. The court said Monday it would review next term whether all state laws that ban pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional. The court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade declared that a woman has a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy in the first six months of her pregnancy when the fetus is incapable of surviving outside the womb. The test case is from Mississippi, which bans most abortions after 15 weeks,  significantly before fetal viability. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative in the country, blocked enforcement of the law, finding it in conflict with Roe v. Wade and subsequent abortion decisions. The Mississippi appeal has been sitting on the court's docket awaiting disposition since last fall, about a month before Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a week before the presidential election. There is no indication of why the court stayed its hand for so long, but the case was listed on the weekly conference for discussion by the justices 17 times before Monday's announcement. Mississippi's law is one of many that conservative states have passed in the last year or more, seeking to eliminate or severely restrict abortion. \"The consequences of a Roe reversal would be devastating,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. It would mean that \"about 24 states\" would have laws banning abortion completely, says the center's litigation director, Julie Rikelman. That includes 11 states \u2014 among them Mississippi \u2014 that \"currently have trigger bans on the books which would instantaneously ban abortion if Roe is overturned.\" Bans on pre-viability, abortion bans have been struck down, until now, in a dozen states since 2019, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Tennessee. In 2016, the Supreme Court let stand similar rulings that struck down a six-week ban in North Dakota and a 12-week ban in Arkansas. That same year, the court struck down a Texas law that made it difficult and expensive for clinics that perform abortions to function. But since then, the composition of the court has changed dramatically, with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a major advocate of reproductive rights; the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a centrist conservative who supported abortion rights; and the addition of three Trump appointees to the court. Bottom line: The court now has a 6-3 conservative super majority, with all six having taken positions hostile to abortion rights at one time or another, and the newest justice, Barrett, the most outspoken critic of abortion before joining the high court. The 6-3 majority means that conservatives can lose one of their own on this issue and still prevail. That wasn't the case as long as Chief Justice John Roberts held the deciding vote. Though he has never been a supporter of abortion rights, his approach has always been to whittle away at Roe, slowly eroding the rights tiny piece by tiny piece. But with Monday's decision to take on the whole question of pre-viability abortion bans, that approach may now be on the way out, and a more direct approach on the way in \u2014 namely overturning Roe. The question that the court has agreed to hear is \"very broad, it couldn't be broader,\" says James Bopp Jr., the longtime general counsel of National Right to Life. This moment, he says, could be \"like Brown v. Board of Education,\" the 1954 decision that reversed course after more than a half century and outlawed racial segregation in public schools. But, Bopp adds, the high court acted gradually in a series of cases that over 16 years built the case for reversing the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision and its doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" He thinks that more likely than an outright reversal of Roe next term, the court will take a major step in that direction, with the final blow to come in a later case. He gets no disagreement on this assessment from abortion rights advocates. \"It does seem to be an inflection point for the future of reproductive rights and certainly the future of Roe,\" says NYU law professor Melissa Murray. Roe and the court's subsequent abortion decisions \"have all confirmed that states cannot prohibit abortion before [fetal] viability.\" But the courts decision to revisit what has been a line in the judicial sand until now, she says, \"puts Roe squarely in the crosshairs,\" she says. A decision to reverse Roe or start down that path, she adds, would have uncertain but enormous consequences not just for the court and its image but also for the political world and the debate about the future of the court. It would also send a signal about other matters. Whatever legislation that Congress passes, whatever executive orders or administrative regulations that the Biden administration might put into effect, \"can always be undone by an inhospitable court,\" Murray observes, adding, \"And I think we're seeing that here \u2014 a more emboldened conservative majority willing to take things up, willing to take fights that I think in the past they might have shied away from. But they're not shying away now.\"",

A new chapter of Merrick Garland's long career in the law has opened after the Senate voted to pave the way for him to serve as attorney general. The 70-30 vote for his confirmation comes five years after then-President Barack Obama nominated Garland to serve on the Supreme Court \u2014 a goal frustrated by Senate Republicans who refused to even consider a hearing for that post. Garland, a moderate judge with deep prosecutorial experience, will soon lead a Justice Department reeling from political scandals and racing to confront the threat from violent homegrown extremists. He has pledged that his first formal briefing and his highest priority will be bringing to justice the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, as well as the people who may have funded and organized that deadly attack in Washington as lawmakers met to certify the 2020 presidential election. During an earlier stint at the Justice Department, in 1995, Garland traveled to Oklahoma City after a bombing at the federal building there killed 168 people. His colleagues credited him with helping to build a meticulous trail of evidence that helped convict Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. That experience, as well as his cool head during a later standoff with the Montana Freemen, could help inform his approach to the current wave of extremism. Garland, who would be the 86th attorney general, has pledged to return the Justice Department to normal order after four years of tumult under former President Donald Trump. That included personal attacks on prosecutors and FBI agents and allegations that Justice Department leaders had used their power to help Trump's allies and hurt his enemies. President Biden has said it will be up to Garland and career professionals at the Justice Department to weigh in on any investigations of Trump \u2014 and to evaluate the ongoing federal tax probe of Biden's son, Hunter. Biden said his administration would work to promote racial justice and eliminate systemic sources of discrimination in the justice system. Biden's picks for deputy attorney general and associate attorney general had their Senate hearings Tuesday. Lisa Monaco, who's in line to become second in command at the Justice Department, won praise from Republican lawmakers. They had more pointed questions for civil rights lawyer Vanita Gupta, who would be the first woman of color to serve as associate attorney general. Garland's grandparents fled anti-Semitism and found a home in the United States. He recounted their experience in emotional remarks at his confirmation hearing last month. \"The country took us in, protected us,\" Garland said as his voice broke with tears. \"And I feel an obligation to the country to pay back. This is the highest, best use of my own set of skills to pay back.\"",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Supreme Court, where conservatives have a 6-3 majority, is to consider a case that could gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a major voting rights case that could give state legislatures a green light to change voting laws, making it more difficult for some to vote. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 \u2014 a law that today is widely viewed as the most successful civil rights law in the nation's history. But in 2013, the Supreme Court gutted a key provision: no longer would state and local governments with a history of racial discrimination in voting have to get pre-clearance from the Justice Department before making changes in voting procedures. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts essentially said that times had changed and that the law, in treating some states differently from others, was unconstitutional. Besides, he said, another provision of the law still bars discrimination in voting nationwide. That provision, known as Section 2, would be sufficient to police discriminatory voting procedures, he noted. Now, eight years later, Section 2 is in the conservative court's crosshairs. Is ballot collection inherently suspect? At issue are two Arizona laws. The first bars the counting of provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct. The second, and more important, provision bars the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a family member or caregiver. Former Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez says that this just isn't practical for many of Arizona's rural voters. \"I don't think you can understand this case without understanding the geography of Arizona,\" Perez explains. \"The Navajo Nation is 27,000 square miles. It's bigger than West Virginia. It's very remote. There's a lot of abject poverty.\" Many people aren't even on a postal route, he observes. \"Some people have to travel an hour or two to get to a mailbox, and so voting requires the active assistance of friends and neighbors.\" That active assistance often involves community and party activists who collect absentee ballots from people who don't have cars so that the sealed ballots can be delivered to a post office or drop box. The Republican-dominated state legislature wants to make such assistance a felony. \"These are Democratic operatives, as part of their get-out-the-vote strategy, [are] handling thousands of ballots,\" says lawyer Michael Carvin, who will defend the Arizona law in Tuesday's oral arguments. He contends that the law banning ballot collection is a legitimate anti-fraud provision. \"The notion that we can have thousands of ballots out there in the hands of Democratic Party operatives and not having one of them tempted to do something wrong strikes me as ridiculous,\" Carvin says. Indeed, while individual voting fraud is rare, there have been significant cases of fraud in the collection and delivery of ballots. Most recently, in 2018, a North Carolina congressional election was set aside because of Republican vote-harvesting fraud. That said, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found no evidence of such fraud in Arizona, and it struck down the ban on absentee ballot collection. The court said the ban violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars voting laws that have an adverse impact on minorities, denying them an equal opportunity to vote, in light of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" The Arizona Republican Party appealed to the Supreme Court, where the case is seen as potentially pivotal for voting rights enforcement. Remember that Section 2 of the Voting Right Act, for all practical purposes, is the only big enforcement tool left. So the standard that the court sets for proving a violation is enormously important \u2014 especially this year, when, in the wake of many false claims about fraud perpetrated by former President Donald Trump, Republican-dominated state legislatures are seeking to pass new and more restrictive laws that would make voting more difficult. The potential to render the Voting Rights Act nearly a dead letter In fact, 33 states have \"introduced, refiled or carried over more than 165 restrictive laws this year,\" says Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. Remember too that Chief Justice Roberts, in striking down the pre-clearance provision of the law eight years ago, highlighted Section 2's importance as the law's alternative enforcement mechanism. But Roberts has long been disdainful of the need for the Voting Rights Act, dating back to his youth as an aide in Ronald Reagan's administration, when he unsuccessfully urged the president not to sign the amended law. Now, decades later, he presides over a 6-to-3 conservative majority on a court that is, at minimum, skeptical about the need for tough voting rights enforcement. The Biden administration has withdrawn the Trump Justice Department's brief, which sided with Arizona Republicans in the case. But the new administration is not siding with Democratic Party arguments either. \"They're in an effort at damage control,\" says law professor Richard Hasen, a voting rights expert at the University of California, Irvine. \"What they're trying to do is prevent the court from making bad law that will apply to more draconian voting restrictions. So this fight is less about whether the Democratic Party loses but how the Democratic Party loses.\" In the past, the Supreme Court established a variety of tests under Section 2 to prevent vote dilution in congressional redistricting, but this is the first time that the court will examine a state law that has been found to disproportionally result in the denial of the right to vote for minorities. And there is every possibility that the high court could make it much more difficult, or practically impossible, to challenge voting rights restrictions in the future.",

A state-level Voting Rights Act is now on the governor's desk. Nearly eight years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, Democrats in Virginia are poised to enact state-level legislation they say would boost voter protections. Backers of the Virginia Voting Rights Act say it's the most comprehensive bill of its kind \u2014 and the first in the South. The legislation cleared a final vote on Thursday and now goes to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. \"As we've seen on other issues, we can't rely on the Supreme Court or the federal level always, and so states have to protect themselves,\" said Democratic state Del. Cia Price, one of two sponsors of the legislation. Price's bill was inspired by portions of the federal Voting Rights Act that were altered by a 2013 high court ruling. Until that decision, the federal government scrutinized proposed changes to voting across nine mostly Southern states, including Virginia, and a handful of other cities and counties with a history of racial discrimination. The Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for election law changes across the South. Republican-led legislatures rushed to pass restrictions that no longer required federal approval. States purged voter rolls, added photo ID requirements, and cut nearly 1,700 polling locations, per one tally. Many states have sought to double-down on restrictive voting rules in the aftermath of the November 2020 election. Democratic state Del. Cia Price is one of two sponsors of the Voting Rights Act of Virginia.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Price's bill builds on the old federal process. It would require local election officials to get public feedback \u2014 or permission from Virginia's attorney general \u2014 before they change voting rules. Voters or the attorney general could sue if they believe the change disproportionately affects a voter \"based on his race or color or membership in a language minority group.\" Any proceeds from the legal actions would go toward a voter education fund. The legislation would require election officials to provide voting materials in foreign languages in districts with substantial populations of people whose primary language is not English. It also would prohibit at-large municipal elections if they have the effect of diluting the voting power of racial minorities. Virginia Republicans have consistently voted against the bill in the state legislature. They've echoed complaints by representatives of local governments who are concerned about the potential costs of litigation and extra workload. \"It is going to make it an unwieldy, incredibly complicated process,\" warned state Sen. Jill Vogel, who's also a GOP election attorney. \"It is a full employment act for lawyers.\" Some local officials \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 have dismissed those concerns. \"It's not like we're changing elections all the time,\" said Justin Wilson, the Democratic mayor of the city of Alexandria. \"Protecting the franchise is probably the most important thing we can do.\" There has been some movement on Capitol Hill in the wake of the 2013 Shelby v. Holder case. Democrats in the House passed legislation in 2019 that would address issues raised by the Supreme Court. It would update the formula used to determine which areas should be covered by so-called \"preclearance.\" But the bill \u2014 now named after the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. \u2014 went untouched in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate. It remains unclear if any Republicans, who almost universally opposed the House measure, would join Democrats to clear the 60-vote filibuster now that Democrats hold a narrow majority. Republicans in many state legislatures have pushed to tighten voting rules in the wake of an election that saw the highest voter turnout in 120 years. Democrats in Virginia have moved the opposition direction, adding optional Sunday voting and making ballot drop boxes permanent. The commonwealth has gone from one of the hardest states to vote in to one of the easiest, after Democrats flipped the legislature in 2019, according to a ranking from researchers at Northern Illinois University. \"I think it's obvious that Democrats want to loosen the rules that assisted them in the last election and that so greatly contributed to undermining confidence in the election,\" Republican Todd Gilbert, the minority leader in Virginia's House, said in a press conference last month. Voting rights advocates say Republicans are harnessing their own false claims about voter fraud to advance restricting voting policies. Judith Browne Dianis \u2014 executive director of the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group that helped craft the Virginia VRA \u2014 said the GOP's push reflects a broader anxiety about the growing clout of nonwhite voters. \"We need every state to pass its own voting rights law,\" Dianis said. California, Washington and Oregon have passed narrower state-level voting rights acts focused on local elections. Virginia had some of the tightest Jim Crow-era voting restrictions in the U.S. State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate who also sponsored the Virginia Voting Rights Act, said the effort reflected broader shifts in what has become a reliably blue state. \"It's poetic justice that we'd be the first state in the South to pass a bill,\" McClellan said.",

A proposed rule from the Trump administration would force banks to offer financing to oil companies, gun-makers and high-cost payday lenders, even if the banks don't want to. The Trump administration is trying to push through a last-minute rule that could force banks to offer loans to gun-makers and oil exploration companies or to finance high-cost payday lenders. The move follows announcements by the biggest U.S. banks that there are some industries and activities they don't want to finance, such as drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or making loans to gun manufacturers who make assault-style weapons. Some major banks have sworn off making those loans.  Now, a Trump-appointed banking regulator is pushing for a rule that considers that an unfair, discriminatory practice. \"It's a very poorly constructed rule,\" says John Court, the head of regulatory affairs at the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the biggest banks in the country. He says the rule is \"clearly hastily conceived and hastily constructed.\" The rule was proposed in November after President Trump lost his reelection bid. And Court says it appears that the Trump-appointed acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is scrambling to enact it before the Biden administration begins next week. Court says many financial firms are getting more focused on environmental, social, and governance \u2014 or \"ESG\" \u2014 issues. \"Among those are racial equality, climate, other issues,\" Court says. \"And this proposal clearly would undercut the ability of a banking organization to achieve or administer any so-called ESG goals that it might have.\" The rule is based on the concept of fair access to credit, which traditionally had to do with preventing racial discrimination. The OCC declined an interview. Acting head Brian Brooks said in a press release that \"fair access to financial services, credit, and capital are essential to our economy.\" But critics say the rule is really about forcing banks to finance firearms companies that make assault-style rifles, or even predatory payday lenders that charge 300% in annual interest. \"Payday lenders not only disproportionately harm people of color, they target communities of color,\" says Rebecca Born\u00e9, a lawyer with the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending. \"So the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language.\" says Born\u00e9. The result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, \"cloaking it in this language of civil rights.\" The main trade group for payday lenders, INFiN, said in a statement that it \"supports steps by the OCC to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule.\" If the Trump administration finalizes the rule before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Court says that would make it harder, but not impossible, for the new administration to undo it. And he says if it comes to it, banks would likely sue to try to stop the rule. \"It's removing the ability to make decisions, it's removing that from the bank and effectively vesting it in a government mandate,\" he says. And Court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society \u2014 whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else. The rule could also be scrapped by Congress through an oversight tool called the Congressional Review Act, especially since Democrats will now control both the House and the Senate.",

            "article_content": "By a vote of 6-to-3 on Thursday the Supreme Court's conservative majority made it far more difficult to challenge voting restrictions throughout the country.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Supreme Court has dealt a blow to the Voting Rights Act. On the last day of the term, the court's conservative justices empowered state control of elections and made it harder to challenge laws that may put minority voters at a disadvantage. The 6-3 ruling comes at a time when many states, especially those with Republican legislatures, are tightening voting laws. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Since its enactment in 1965, the Voting Rights Act has been renewed and amended five times, most recently in 2006, always by huge bipartisan majorities. But as conservatives gained dominance on the Supreme Court, the conservative majority took a wrecking ball to the law. In 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts, who'd been the Reagan administration's point man in opposing the law, wrote the court's opinion gutting the law's most important provision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ROBERTS: Any racial discrimination in voting is too much. But our country has changed in the past 50 years. TOTENBERG: Overnight, gone was the key enforcement provision of the law which required state and local governments with a history of race discrimination in voting to get federal approval in advance for any changes in their voting rules. Within days of the decision's announcement, Republican-dominated jurisdictions began enacting provisions that critics said made it more difficult for minorities to vote. And so, minority groups turned to the other major section of the law, referred to as Section 2, which bars voting procedures that, quote, \"result in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color.\" Yesterday, though, the Supreme Court eviscerated that provision, too, rendering the Voting Rights Act close to a dead letter. Reinstating two Arizona laws that had been struck down by a lower court, the conservative majority said the unequal impact on minority voters was small, that other states have similar laws and that states don't have to wait for fraud to occur before enacting laws to prevent it. Writing for the conservative majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that just because voting may be, quote, \"inconvenient for some\" doesn't mean that access to voting is unequal. And he noted that when this provision of the voting rights law was enacted almost 40 years ago, almost all voting was in person and on Election Day. The unstated inference was that states could do that again now. Election law expert Richard Hasen, who teaches at the University of California, Irvine. RICHARD HASEN: We have a court here that is being less and less protective of voting rights and more and more protective of the ability of states to make it harder for people to vote. TOTENBERG: Normally, that would be a recipe for congressional action, notes New York University election law expert Richard Pildes. RICHARD PILDES: Especially in light of this decision, it would be good for Congress to weigh in and give more specificity to what's banned and what's not banned. TOTENBERG: But that is a tall order in these divided times when Republicans, once avid supporters of the Voting Rights Act, now have largely abandoned it. As Hasen observes, there's been a sea change in the Republican Party. HASEN: As the Republican Party becomes more reliant on white voters, it has less of an incentive to support any renewed voting rights protection. TOTENBERG: Indeed, while the U.S. House, controlled by Democrats, has passed a bill establishing national voting rights rules, the Senate has refused to even consider it. And with President Trump falsely claiming that the presidential election was stolen from him and a widely discredited audit of the election results in Arizona still going on, the divisions have only deepened, as professor Pildes observes. PILDES: People worry about two things. One is they worry about every individual's right to vote, even if it doesn't have a dramatic overall effect potentially on elections. And people are very concerned that we have had a lot of close elections. And margins that are small can turn out to be significant. And this goes back to Bush v. Gore.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in today for Terry Gross. Our guest today, Heather McGhee, has a new book about the importance of recognizing and fighting racism in America. But it isn't just an argument that racial discrimination is morally wrong and unfair, even deadly to people of color. The heart of McGhee's case is that racism is harmful to everyone, and thus we all have an interest in fighting it. Drawing on a wealth of economic data, she argues that when laws and practices have discriminated against African Americans, whites have also been harmed. When people unite across racial and ethnic lines, she argues, there's a solidarity dividend that helps everyone. Heather McGhee is the former president of the progressive think tank Demos, where she spent much of her career. She holds a BA in American Studies from Yale and a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. She currently chairs the board of Color of Change, a nationwide online racial justice organization. Her new book is \"The Sum Of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" She joins me from her home in Brooklyn, N.Y. Heather McGhee, welcome to FRESH AIR. HEATHER MCGHEE: I'm so glad to be with you. DAVIES: You worked at the think tank Demos for a long time. Then you went and got a law degree and came back to it. And you write in the introduction that you were in love with the idea that information in the right hands was power. And you would do research. You would craft legislation. You'd talk to members of Congress and their staffs hoping to make change. And you write that getting to some of the ideas that motivated this book came from your discovering the limits of research and facts. Just share with us that journey. MCGHEE: Well, I have always been animated by core questions about our economic dysfunction in America, why it was that people so often struggled just to make ends meet. I was born on the South Side of Chicago. I saw what happened when the good factory jobs and the good public sector jobs started to leave. And it felt like we could do something about this. We could, in many ways, have nice things, right? Universal child care and health care and reliable infrastructure and well-funded schools in every neighborhood. And the data was saying it would be in our economic interest to do it. So I did spend about 15 years in economic policy trying to make the case for better economic decisions. But ultimately - and I started having a hunch that I was sort of using the wrong tool. And I think the election of Donald Trump really, with a majority of white voters, to me was a wake-up call. And I decided that ultimately, the facts and figures and reliance on a sense of economic self-interest was not actually going to be enough. I had to get at some deeper questions in this country. It wasn't that I had the wrong numbers. It was that I had the wrong deeper story about status and belonging, about competition, about deservingness, questions that in America have always turned on race. DAVIES: Right. You write in here that when we ask people their opinions about, you know, racially neutral policy proposals or at least theoretically neutral proposals like raising the minimum wage or expanding public health care alternatives or even action to prevent climate change, people's opinions were affected by whether they thought that the demographic changes in the United States threatened the status of white people. That seemed to change the way people viewed everything. This was sort of an important realization, wasn't it? MCGHEE: It was. I mean, it was - it's a really astonishing set of data. The psychologists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson did this study. And then there's been a whole host of other ones to basically show that there is a predominant zero-sum mindset that's predominant among white Americans, more than among Americans of color, that basically is threatened by the idea of demographic change, that on a gut level feels like that is not in their own interest and that makes them want to pull away from some kinds of policies that are actually, you would think, in their economic interest, right? The majority of people making under $15 an hour are white. The majority of people without health care are white. We all live under the same sky and are all going to be vulnerable to climate change. And yet making race salient, as, of course, Donald Trump did and Trumpism does, makes people more - white people more conservative. It's this zero-sum idea that progress for people of color has to come at white people's expense. DAVIES: Well, you take us through some fascinating historical turns on how racism, discrimination, even slavery obviously was harmful to the enslaved and victims of racism but also harmed white people. And you write about a fascinating book published in 1857, you know, when slavery was still in effect in the South. And this book was by a white racist Southerner named Hinton Rowan Helper who looked at the effect of slavery on white people in the South. What story did he tell? MCGHEE: So I myself am the descendant of enslaved people. And so I am going to be the last person to minimize the sheer brutality and dehumanizing force that was American chattel slavery. And yet at the time of the debates about abolition among white Americans, one of the most powerful voices was a white Southerner who was an avowed racist. And he wrote a book that basically said that slavery was benefiting the plantation class, but it wasn't benefiting the white majority in the South. And he saw that it was shortchanging the public development of the infrastructure in Southern states. He compared the number of schools, libraries and other public institutions that had been set up in free states versus slave states. In Pennsylvania, he counted 393 public libraries - in South Carolina, just 26. In Maine, not a very populous state, 236 libraries - in Georgia, just 38. And the tally was similar everywhere he looked. So I read Helper's book. I also read some studies about how today we know that many of the poorest places in America are in the South. But what's interesting about it is we can draw a connection between the disinvestment in the original sort of founding centuries of America and the disinvestment during Jim Crow, where you really had an unwillingness among the elite to, you know, build schools in every neighborhood, to create robust public infrastructure everywhere. And that is relating to poverty today, not just among Black people, but among white people as well. DAVIES: Yeah, it's a fascinating correlation. And, you know, I guess one might argue that, well, you know, the South was an agrarian economy. It simply generates, you know, less in the way of economic productivity. And so that's - might be part of the answer. Why did - what was it that prevented the planter (ph) class from providing libraries and schools to the white people? MCGHEE: They didn't need to. I mean, really, the reason why wealthy people invest in the communities around them is because they need to to make the community livable for themselves, but also to attract and retain the people on whom their profits depend, whether it's workers or customers. But in the slave economy, neither was strictly necessary, right? So the source of plantation wealth was a completely captive and unpaid labor force. Owners didn't need more than a handful of white workers per plantation. And they didn't need or want an educated populace, whether Black or white. And their farms didn't depend on local customers, right? The factories were in the North. And the markets were, you know, in fact, even global. And so there was just a sense that it was a contained system and it wasn't necessary to invest in the public good outside of that system. DAVIES: You also explored the days when, as there were efforts to introduce integration in parts of the South, that local elites, in order to maintain racial segregation, effectively cut off a lot of public investment, specifically the battle over swimming pools. You want to describe that? MCGHEE: Yeah. This to me is really the kind of parable at the heart of the book. It's what's illustrated on the cover. In the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the United States went on a building boom of these grand resort-style swimming pools. These were the kind that would hold hundreds, even thousands, of swimmers. And it was a real sort of Americanization project. It was to create a, like, bath-temperature melting pot of, you know, white ethnic immigrants and people in the community to come together. It was sort of a commitment by the government to a leisure-filled American dream standard of living. And in many of these public pools, the rule was that it was whites only, either officially or unofficially. And in the 1950s and '60s when Black communities began to, understandably, say, hey, it's our tax dollars that are helping to support this public good, we need to be allowed to swim, too, all over the country, particularly in the American South but in other places as well, white towns facing integration orders from the courts decided to drain their public swimming pools rather than let Black families swim, too. Now, I went to Montgomery, Ala., where there used to be one of those grand resort-style pools and where effective January 1, 1959, not only did they back a truck up and pour dirt into the pool and pave it over, but they also sold off the animals in the municipal zoo. They closed down the entire parks and recreation department of Montgomery for a decade. It wasn't until almost 1970 that they reopened the park system for the entire city. And I walked the grounds of Oak Park. Even after they reopened it, they never rebuilt the pool. And that, to me, felt like this just tangible symbol of the way that a population taught to distrust and disdain their neighbors of color will withdraw from public goods when they no longer see the public as good. DAVIES: So the result was that in those communities, you'd had - you know, the elites had private clubs and private pools, but poor and working people of all races simply didn't have the public amenities. They were gone. MCGHEE: That's exactly right. You started to see suburban backyard pools and these membership-only swimming clubs. In Washington, D.C., you saw over 100 new membership-only swimming clubs after you had pool integration. It's a small thing, and yet I began to see examples of the drained pool everywhere, in the way we withdrew from funding public education, in our inability to win universal health care, in the way that we have not innovated around the kinds of public resources that we all need, whether it's universal child care or broadband or high-speed rail. We've withdrawn from the sense of what we could do together in the wake of integration. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Heather McGhee. Her new book is \"The Sum Of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE INTERNET'S \"STAY THE NIGHT\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Heather McGhee. She is the past president of the progressive think tank Demos, currently the chair of the board of Color of Change, a racial justice online organization. We're talking about her new book, \"The Sum Of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" You tell a story of how the U.S. government took a lot of steps in the mid-20th century to create a middle class, effectively a white middle class. Let's talk about this. One of the tools was the GI Bill, which provided assistance for education and home financing for returning military personnel after World War II. A lot of returning GIs, but this was not race-neutral in its implementation, was it? MCGHEE: No, it wasn't. Like so much of the system of the social contract that really created the middle class in the middle of the 20th century, it ended up being filtered through racial segregation. It ended up being devolved down to local administration, which meant that Black GIs, even though they tried to take advantage of the benefits, were, you know, shunted off to vocational schools because they were not allowed in the South to go to the mainstream, you know, land grant colleges. It meant that the, in many ways most significant piece, the Veterans Administration home loan benefit was completely denied to Black service members' families because the Veterans Administration adopted the, at that point, two generation old practice of redlining, drawing lines, which is what the federal government did, around Black neighborhoods and saying these are risky. Just because it's Black people, these are risky. And so we're not going to backstop any loans that banks might give to communities in this neighborhood. DAVIES: Right. So this had an important generational effect, right? Because those GIs coming back and their families benefited from education and investments in homes, which, you know, built up some assets for those families. And Black Americans were really left behind. And over the generations, that made a huge difference, didn't it? MCGHEE: There's something so powerful about wealth. And the word wealth connotes, you know, diamonds and yachts. But we're really talking about a little bit of home equity, the fact that you grew up in a house that your parents owned, even if it was not a very expensive house, the fact that your aunt or uncle may have had some GM stock or a CD that they gave you, you know, when you turn 18. It's this kind of intergenerational wealth which was really created by public policy that, from the New Deal through the civil rights movement, was explicit about wanting to create middle class security and just as explicit, often, about wanting to make sure that the benefits of that went to white people only with racial covenants, for example. The federal government created suburbs by investing in the highway system and subsidizing private housing developers but demanded whites-only clauses in housing contracts to prevent Black people from buying into them. Social Security excluded the job categories that left most Black workers out. You could even consider the New Deal labor laws that encouraged collective bargaining to be a government subsidy to create a white middle class because many unions kept their doors closed to people who weren't white until the 1960s. And so you had this sort of big social contract. And that's really what we see. It's not just a drained pool in this nice-to-have recreational facility. It's the kinds of policies that shifted dramatically in the late 1960s, '70s and early '80s to bring us the inequality era. And that's where we are today. DAVIES: There was also a major public investment in public colleges and universities and community colleges - right? - which made it cheaper for a lot of people to go to school. I mean, I went to school in the '70s at the University of Texas. And the tuition was low. And my family couldn't afford to send me any other way. Well, they didn't send me at all. I worked my way through it. But that was possible. It was doable. That was when colleges - most college students were white. Over time, that changes. And then we see a different attitude towards the public investment, right? MCGHEE: It's really one of those issues that I felt was important to include in the book. Back when the public was 90% white and the students who were going on to college were mostly white and, actually, mostly male, government picked up the tab, whether it was state governments funding the costs of their public colleges, like where you went, the University of Texas. And that was, roughly, about six out of 10 dollars would come from the states. And then the rest translated into tuition bills, which often a federal grant, whether it was a GI or the Pell Grant, which was much more generous two generations ago, would pick up the rest. And so you really could get a minimum wage job over the summer and work your way through college. At Demos, we once did a report showing where every member of Congress went to college and what it cost then and what it costs now just to remind the decision-makers, most of them white, that there's something drastic that changed. And it's not that young people became less industrious or less willing to sacrifice. It's that government walked away from the deal. And it really was around the same time that the college-going population became more diverse and that this conservative, anti-government ethos kicked in in our politics. And that has a lot to do - the social science is now very clear - with these racialized ideas of who is the public and what they deserve. And so you started to see this privatization of public colleges. So now the majority of states rely on tuition dollars for the majority of the costs of college. And we shifted at the federal level from grants to loans. DAVIES: Tuition is higher. Student debt is far more burdensome. And I think the critical point here is that when this change was made, it affected more white students than Black students in the end, didn't it? MCGHEE: Absolutely. I mean, 63% of white students have to borrow now, right? This is the majority of white students are caught in this new system, which is just no way to run a country, right? We know that student debt is delaying homeownership, even marriage. It's making it harder for graduates with debt to save for retirement. And, of course - I want to be clear about this - like every aspect of systemic racism, it hits the target first and worst. Black students, because of the intergenerational racial wealth divide that we talked about, have to borrow more in order to go to college, come out owing more and then, because of discrimination in the labor market, end up having a harder time paying it back and, therefore, end up paying more. But the majority of white students are also in debt. This is the way, I think, that systemic racism works in an interconnected society. It hits the target. And it also distorts economic policy decision-making for everyone. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you again. Heather McGhee chairs the board of the online racial justice organization Color of Change. Her new book is \"The Sum Of US: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" She'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MCCOY TYNER AND BOBBY HUTCHERSON'S \"ISN'T THIS MY SOUND AROUND ME?\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Heather McGhee, past president of the progressive think tank Demos. Her new book makes the case that racial discrimination in the United States has been harmful to white Americans as well as people of color. \"The book is The Sum Of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" So we were talking about how government policy created a middle class in the mid years of the 20th century. And it was, essentially, a white middle class because there were exclusions for African Americans - assistance to homeownership and college education, retirement security, et cetera. It changes kind of in the '70s. And we do know that in the '60s, there were civil rights legislation. Some barriers came down. There was the Fair Housing Act in 1968. Is there a connection here between the growth of the civil rights movement and the assault on some of these racial barriers and the demonization of government among conservatives? MCGHEE: There is, Dave. And I really wanted to untangle this knot because, as someone who spent a career in politics and policy where, really, the specter of the white moderate - right? - the typical white moderate in the center that we have to sort of hew towards, it's always trimmed the sails of policy ambition, right? We can't get too far out of the center. And the center is defined as this sort of white center-right moderate. But I was shocked to learn that in the '50s, the majority of white people believed in an activist government in a way that is even more radical than today's average liberal. According to a really authoritative, every-four-year survey, 65% of white people in 1956 thought the government ought to guarantee a job to anyone who wanted one and provide a minimum standard of living in the country. And then, between 1960 and 1964, white support for these big government guarantees for everybody cratered, went from nearly 70% to 35%. And it stayed low ever since. The Black support for this - these kinds of guarantees has stayed high throughout the data set. So I wanted to know what happened. Was this, like, a fluke in the data? I mean, it was just such a dramatic shift. So it turns out that - you know, what happened between '60 and '64? What happened is that you saw white Americans watch the march on Washington for jobs and freedom. They saw Black activists actually demanding those same kinds of economic guarantees that was part of the set of demands. You saw Kennedy start to speak about civil rights and make promises on civil rights. And then, you know, just a few years later, when Johnson signed the civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, he knew. He said that this was when he was going to sign away, you know, the South by signing these bills, but - I'm paraphrasing - politically. But what he didn't know was that he was going to sign away the entire white vote for the rest of history, including the last election, right? That was the last election in which a majority of white people voted for what had suddenly become the party of civil rights. DAVIES: You know, one of the points you're making in the book is that racism hurts everybody, and when whites and Blacks or whites and people of color manage to work together, it's better for everybody. And, in fact, reducing discrimination should yield benefits for everybody. And so taking us back to those years in the '60s, when, for example, you know, the Voting Rights Act, which really did open up voter registration to a lot of places in the South where it had been closed off by poll taxes and literacy tests, et cetera, was there a benefit for working-class and middle-class whites in those states where there was a different kind of racial balance in the voting population? MCGHEE: I mean, this is the thing, right? It's this zero-sum idea that progress for people of color has to come at the expense of white people. But that zero-sum idea is a lie. It's a lie that has been aggressively sold, I believe, to white Americans by people who are very vested in the economic status quo and in keeping the concentration of wealth and power very narrowly held. And so you really see that in Southern politics, what V.O. Key called the sort of, you know, stranglehold of the plantation politics, where it was sort of one-party rule. And politicians before integration in the South didn't really have to appeal to a broad base about - you know, with promises of a better quality of life. They could just sort of market white supremacy and say, defensively, vote for us because we're going to keep the racial order. And so when the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act got rid of things like the poll tax, you actually saw a resurgence of civic life in the South that impacted and freed up poor white people as well. DAVIES: So there, you saw more public investment in schools, perhaps, and libraries and roads and the kinds of things that improve lives? MCGHEE: Exactly. So what you started to see was instead of running on white supremacy - right? - and running on segregation, candidates had to run on things that would actually benefit people's lives to get their votes, right? I tell the story of Governor Albert Brewer, who ended up facing off George Wallace. But it was a race where he tried to put together a sort of new fusion coalition that was going to be the white middle class, newly enfranchised Black Alabamians and working-class whites outside of the kind of Black Belt. And in order to sort of give the promise of what this new politics could be, he called a special session on education and passed 29 bills to say that - you know what? - we actually need to educate our people, because pre-civil rights Alabama was a place where, you know, about half of the state's citizens had no more than an elementary school education, right? It was a place where the inequality and racism really had drained the pool. And so you started to see these big investments, things like universal kindergarten in these states in the South, because politicians had to actually compete for Black people's votes and for white people's votes on issues other than just segregation. And you started to see people realize, actually, there are these things that unite us. We all want good education for our kids. DAVIES: You know, when we saw the Reagan revolution happening in the 1980s and you saw conservatives embracing, you know, deregulation for businesses, generally suspicious of government, regarding it as inefficient and unresponsive - you know, Reagan saying, the words you never want to hear are I'm from the government, and I'm here to help. And this - it was an effective sales pitch. And, of course, one way of looking at it is that, you know, for elites, for economic elites, for wealthy individuals and corporations, they want to cut taxes, and to cut taxes, what you want to do is cut the size of government. So there's a fit there. And it's not necessarily per se a racist idea. However, when you're selling it, it seems, I mean, it was very convenient to make the beneficiaries of a bigger government welfare moms, people in the inner city. And so there ended up being a distinctly racial appeal to the political pitch, wasn't there? MCGHEE: There was. And, you know, it's often subtle, although, of course, in recent times it hasn't been very subtle at all. But, you know, there's that famous Lee Atwater quote from towards the end of his life where he really just lays it out. He explains how you go from explicitly racial appeals in the 1950s, and then it started to backfire because the civil rights movement has been effective, right? You don't actually want to call people the N-word. You don't actually want to make your political case for segregation and Jim Crow. And so then it becomes more subtle. You say, in his words, stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. And you're getting abstract. Now, he says, you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things. And a byproduct of them is Blacks get hurt worse than whites. He says, we want to cut this is much more abstract than the busing thing and a hell of a lot more abstract than, he says, the N-word, the N-word, right? It's this idea that once the government sort of moves in a really incredible short period of time from the enforcer of the racial hierarchy - right? - the one drawing the red-lining maps, the entity that is creating the laws to segregate to, you know, in a very short time, that government moves from the enforcer of racial hierarchy to the upender. It's a core betrayal. And what the right was able to do was say, you know, the government's no longer on your side. It's on the side of these undeserving people of color, these people you've been taught to distrust and disdain. And so you should trust the market, right? Turn to the market. Turn to individualism. Turn to the wealthy for your, you know, sense of identity and trust and your sense of how you're going to succeed in life, right? It's no longer going to be New Deal universal benefits. It's going to be, you know, the market. And that was Reagan's story. And that zero-sum idea that undergirds it is really still so animating in the right-wing language around makers and takers and taxpayers and freeloaders. It's animated in our debates over health care. The Affordable Care Act is still unpopular among the majority of white people. Support for the Affordable Care Act has never gone over 50% among white people. The anti-government conservative ethos that holds the conservative and moderate wings of our politics together really still has a racialized narrative around who belongs and who deserves - that is what holds it together. DAVIES: And yet more white people would benefit from the Affordable Care Act than Black people in raw numbers, right? MCGHEE: That's right. That's exactly right. The majority of the uninsured are white people. I talk to folks in Texas where they refuse to expand Medicaid, where, you know, the rural hospital system is absolutely being decimated. You have this devastating story of a little - of a toddler who choked and her parents couldn't get to a hospital in time because their local, you know, county hospital had closed. And I talked to a, you know, white rural guy who said it's this gut-level rejection of Medicaid and Obamacare and all that it represents. And yet, of course, it's the majority of white people who are going without. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you again. We're going to take a break here. We are speaking with Heather McGhee. She chairs the board of the online racial justice organization Color of Change. She is the past president of the progressive think tank Demos. Her book is \"The Sum Of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone And How We Can Prosper Together.\" We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Heather McGhee. She's a past president of the progressive think tank Demos. Her new book makes the case that racial discrimination in the United States has been harmful to white Americans as well as people of color. The book is called \"The Sum Of Us.\" You write about the subprime lending practices in the 1990s that, you know, in some ways ultimately led to the 2008 financial crash. And there was a narrative here that, you know, these were subprime mortgages, cheap mortgages being pushed on people who probably shouldn't be buying homes and these were irresponsible borrowers making bad decisions. You looked at this and found it's a pretty different story, didn't you? MCGHEE: That's right. In fact, leading up to the crisis, the majority of subprime and therefore more expensive loans were, A, going to people who had credit scores that would have enabled them to get prime or cheaper loans and, B, weren't for new homeowners. They were existing homeowners being aggressively marketed refinance loans that often ended up stripping equity and ending up in foreclosure. And the first targets for these kinds of toxic loans were Black homeowners. DAVIES: Right. You know, I remember this. This was described as predatory lending by a lot of activists in the 1990s. And they asked the regulators, you need to do something about this. What happened? MCGHEE: The experience of being one of the ignored and unheeded and outmatched few who were trying to raise the alarm about this really forever shapes my understanding of economic policy. What happened was, in many ways, these regulators and these lenders, there was a lot of greed, right? People were making money hand over fist. If you could get someone to pay 9% on a six-figure loan versus 5%, that basically doubles your money. That's huge, but it was also a little bit of racism too - right? - this age-old stereotype about Black people being risky, not being good with money. It's a tidy justification for denying Black people the opportunity to make money. And so it was a lot of greed, obviously, but it was also a lot of racism. DAVIES: A lot of these people are essentially hustled, talked into these complicated mortgages. Many of them are foreclosed upon. And then, of course, the mortgages get bundled into these complicated securities that are sold on Wall Street, one of the things that contributed to this huge crash in 2008 and of course, the irony here is that a racially targeted marketing campaign which takes advantage of African American people. When the crash comes, what's the effect on working and middle class white people? MCGHEE: It was devastation. When the crash finally came, everybody felt the pain. There were 8 million jobs lost, nearly $19 trillion in lost household wealth. In many ways, so many families that lost property value and houses still haven't recovered from the Great Recession. This is one of the most costly examples of racism ultimately costing everyone. DAVIES: One of the things you write was that this had an enormous impact on the family assets of African American families. You said the - shrank the wealth of median African American families by more than half between 2005 and 2009. That is an astonishing number. MCGHEE: Yeah. It's - this is the chapter that is the most - that is closest to my heart, that I get the most emotional about. I share a story of going to Cleveland in 2007 and taking a walk with some community activists who were showing how nearly every home on the street in the neighborhood of Mount Pleasant was no longer in the hands of the rightful owners, had been the victim of subprime mortgage refinances and then foreclosure. And I remember so vividly just being totally overcome with just the weight of the history of it all, you know, I mean, to really see Black people who finally got their shot at the American dream that was denied so systematically for so long, people who, you know, so many of these were, you know, elderly Black folks who had finally been able to buy a house. And, you know, think about, like, their parents and grandparents in many instances had been, you know, subject to Jim Crow or even were enslaved people. And this machine of racism and greed had just sort of mowed down the neighborhood. And I remember running around the corner, excusing myself and then just falling to my knees and sobbing because it just felt like, why are we so doomed to repeat these mistakes again? And, you know, I had that moment in 2007. And then, of course, a year later, I'm actually in law school, and I see Lehman Brothers is going into bankruptcy - right? - the company on Wall Street that had invested the most in mortgage-backed securities right at the end of the bubble. And it wasn't until I was writing this book that I learned that Lehman Brothers, the original brothers Lehman, were slaveholders who made their money in the Confederacy, running cotton behind the cotton blockade during the war and setting up the cotton stock exchange and just how tied up it all is. DAVIES: Heather McGhee, thank you so much for speaking with us. MCGHEE: Thank you, Dave. It's great. DAVIES: Heather McGhee is the past president of the progressive think tank Demos.

            "article_content": "F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's last apartheid-era president, has died at the age of 85. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993, but always remained a divisive figure.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: South Africa's former president, F. W. de Klerk, has died at age 85. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for his role in bringing an end to white minority rule in South Africa. But as the last leader of the apartheid era, de Klerk always remained a divisive figure. NPR's Eyder Peralta brings us this remembrance. UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in non-English language). EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Frederik Willem de Klerk's statue is right in the middle of Cape Town's bustling waterfront. It's not far from his home. It's near a Ferris wheel where buskers and dance troops are set up for passers by. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PERALTA: A bronze de Klerk stands right in between two other Nobel laureates, Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Twenty-nine-year-old Masakona Eriel, who is walking with friends, stops in front of the Klerk statue. News reports, he says, are calling him a former president - but that's incomplete. MASAKONA ERIEL: He's a former apartheid president. That's it. That's all I know. PERALTA: What he knows is that F. W. de Klerk has spent a career championing apartheid, a white supremacist system designed to dehumanize Black people. Eriel's friends, Awelani Muthadzwi and Dakalo Nedzamba, who were born after apartheid, jump in. Yes, as president, he freed Nelson Mandela, but they are convinced he did it because he had no other choice. He was always pretending. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: But I feel like whatever he did then, it wasn't a bad thing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This guy was pretending all along. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. No. This guy. (CROSSTALK) ERIEL: We need to celebrate now. PERALTA: De Klerk hailed from a prominent Afrikaner family. His grandfather helped establish the National Party, which began instituting racial segregation in South Africa in the 1940s. By the time de Klerk became president in 1989, the African National Congress, South Africa's liberation movement, was decades into an armed struggle. And the National Party's apartheid policies had turned the country into a global pariah. South Africa was being sanctioned and pressured by the world to end white minority rule. In 1990, de Klerk delivered what came to be known as his quantum leap speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) F W DE KLERK: Today, I am able to announce far-reaching decisions. PERALTA: He did it in front of a hostile all-white Parliament. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DE KLERK: The prohibition of the African National Congress is being rescinded. People serving prison sentences merely because they were members of one of these organizations will be identified and released. PERALTA: De Klerk ordered the release of Nelson Mandela. Along with him in 1993, He won the Nobel Peace Prize. And in 1994, he lost the presidency to Mandela in South Africa's first democratic elections. But de Klerk was hounded by questions about his motives. Did he reform South Africa because he was backed against a wall or because he thought apartheid was immoral? Last year, in an interview with the state broadcaster, he caused a national uproar by refusing to call apartheid a crime against humanity. HLONIPHA MOKOENA: He was a man who assumed that he was in control until he wasn't. PERALTA: That is Hlonipha Mokoena, a historian at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research. She says de Klerk gets credit for giving that quantum leap speech. Someone had to do it. But Mokoena says de Klerk's intent was never for Black South Africans to enjoy the freedom and power that they do now. MOKOENA: Part of the reason why he felt comfortable with dismantling apartheid was because he assumed that he would be in power. PERALTA: In the end, he wasn't. But whatever his motivation, de Klerk was a transformational figure whose actions precipitated the implosion of his National Party and the rise of Africa's most vibrant democracy.

            "article_content": "David Zucchino says Wilmington, N.C., was once a mixed-race community with a thriving Black middle class. Then, in 1898, white supremacists staged a murderous coup. Originally broadcast Jan. 13, 2020.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. The American South in the post-Reconstruction era was a land of broken promises and brutal oppression for African Americans, as white leaders stripped former slaves of many of the civil and voting rights they'd won after the Civil War. But in the 1890s, the port city of Wilmington, N.C., was an exception. It had a thriving Black middle class, a large Black electorate and a local government that included Black aldermen, police officers and magistrates. That ended in 1898 with a bloody campaign of violence and intimidation by white supremacists, which our guest, journalist David Zucchino, calls America's first and only armed overthrow of a legally elected government. Zucchino chronicles the events in a new book called \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" It's now out in paperback. David Zucchino is a contributing writer for The New York Times. He's covered wars and civil conflicts in more than three dozen countries and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from apartheid South Africa. I spoke with David Zucchino last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: Well, David Zucchino, welcome to FRESH AIR. This is an amazing story. And it's set in Wilmington, N.C., in the 1890s. It's a coastal city, then the largest city in North Carolina - right? - and remarkable for the status that African Americans held at that city at a, you know - which was a city in the Deep South. Give us a sense of where Black citizens stood in Wilmington then. DAVID ZUCCHINO: Wilmington was really an outlier. It was really a unique city in the South at that time. It was - first of all, it was a majority Black city, and it was probably one of the very, very few major cities in the South that had a Black majority. It was 56% Black. There was a multiracial government at the time where Blacks served in positions of power, and that was extremely rare in the South at that time. There were three Black aldermen. There were 10 Black policemen. There were Black magistrates. There was a daily Black newspaper, which was very unusual in the South. There weren't that many because the white media really dominated. This was, really, more than the white supremacists could bear. They had been in power in North Carolina since Reconstruction but had lost control of Wilmington and the state Legislature in 1894 through a combination of the Populist Party, which was made up of poor whites, abandoning the Democratic Party and going over to the Republican Party and aligning themselves with not only white republicans but Black Republicans, and the Blacks were the ones that had put the Republicans in power. And so that's how they had reached this status in Wilmington with a burgeoning Black middle class, with Black doctors, Black lawyers, Black professionals. It was quite an unusual situation and, again, something that white supremacists were not going to allow to stand. DAVIES: Right. And to remind people who may not remember 19th century politics as well, back then, the Democrats were the party of white supremacy; the Republicans were the ones that African Americans joined and supported. So you had this Black middle class and meaningful representation in government. How did whites handle this? What were race relations like in the city? ZUCCHINO: It was interesting. Take the Black newspaper for example, The Daily Record, white businessmen bought ads in the paper. There were ads in the newspaper that appealed to both Blacks and whites. Blacks worked in white businesses, with the whites clearly in charge but with fairly cordial relations. There was racial segregation at the time, but Wilmington was unusual in that a lot of the neighborhoods were mixed, where you had Blacks and whites living together, even in the working classes, which was, again, a little unusual for a city in the South at that time. DAVIES: Obviously, there were whites who resented this. And a plan arose to retake Wilmington and much of the state from this combination of Republicans and populists which had given African Americans a meaningful role in government. The violence occurred in the November 1898 election, but the planning started months ahead of time. What happened? ZUCCHINO: It started in the spring, when the publisher of The News & Observer, which was the most powerful and influential paper in North Carolina, met with the head of the Democratic Party, a man named Furnifold Simmons. And they came up with a plan to overthrow the government in Wilmington, which was the largest and most important city. But they had a larger goal in mind, and that was to deprive the Blacks of the vote and deprive them of the ability to serve in elected or appointed office ever again. And this plan was hatched over a period of several months during the spring, summer and fall of 1898, leading up to the elections in November. And the way they did this was to set up sort of a military formation in Wilmington, where they had block captains and block lieutenants assigned. They brought in weapons from as far away as Richmond and Baltimore. Whites armed themselves with shotguns and Winchesters. They did not allow Blacks, on the other hand, to buy any weapons. The merchants of the city bought a new rapid-fire Colt machine gun for the state militia. And this was a very important point that people don't realize, that the white leadership had control of two state militias, the Wilmington Light Infantry and the city's naval reserves. These were both state militias that purportedly answered to the governor in Raleigh. They were basically the National Guard of the day. But they were made up of white supremacists, and they were controlled by the white supremacist leadership. And at the same time, the city's merchants would buy guns for poor whites who couldn't afford the guns. So the city was incredibly well-armed and prepared for the day when the leadership had set aside after the election to overthrow the government. DAVIES: Right. So there were clearly preparations for a military assault. But there was a huge effort here also in propaganda, in information, in disinformation, fake news, if you want. Give us a sense of what kind of information was propagated which helped to create the atmosphere for this counterrevolution. ZUCCHINO: Yeah. At the time, newspapers were the king of media. They were really the only media. And The News & Observer in Raleigh was the king of media in North Carolina. And Josephus Daniels orchestrated probably the most effective and impressive disinformation campaign up until that time. It was two-pronged. It focused on telling white voters that Black public officials were incompetent and corrupt and utterly incapable of governing and utterly incapable of having the intelligence to vote and, at the same time, being sexually insatiable and on the prowl for white women. They even used a term for it - it was the Black beast rapist. And Daniels planted these false stories around eastern North Carolina, and particularly in Wilmington, of Black men supposedly attacking and assaulting white women and without any protection from a police force that they said was run by Black policemen. So this was very, very effective, and it was picked up by other papers around the state and particularly the papers in Wilmington. And they incited whites to attack Blacks. And part of the plan was to make sure that Blacks did not register to vote because Blacks outnumbered whites in Wilmington, and they could overwhelm them with sheer numbers. So during the summer, as part of this campaign, the whites created a Red Shirt militia. These were gunmen who dressed in red shirts, went out at night into Black areas and would break into Black homes, yank men out and beat them and whip them and threaten them - threaten to kill them if they registered to vote. At the same time, as part of this campaign, white merchants were told to find out whether any of their Black employees had planned to register to vote or had registered to vote. If they had registered, they were fired. If they hadn't, they were told that they would be fired if they did register to vote. DAVIES: Another thread of stories arose about - stories of a Black insurrection coming. People remembered the Nat Turner revolt, which would have been - what? - the 1830s, right? I mean, many, many years. ZUCCHINO: 1831. DAVIES: Right. But the idea was sold that Blacks were planning an armed revolt, thus justifying arming and, you know, oppressing Blacks. ZUCCHINO: Yes, this was part of the whole newspaper campaign. I mean, day after day, The News & Observer in Raleigh and the papers in Wilmington and papers elsewhere in eastern North Carolina kept warning of a Black revolution, of a Black riot. They would print stories saying blacks were stockpiling weapons, when it was fact that - it was the whites who were stockpiling the weapons, that Blacks were planning to kill white women and white children and take over the city, take over churches, burn them down, burn down white businesses and take over the town. And in fact, some of the whites believed their own propaganda, and they set up safe places for white families to flee when the Black riots started. They set up churches and places of business where they would take white families for protection. And in fact, in the days before the election and before the planned riot - which was two days after the election - a lot of whites sent their families out of the city for fear of this Black uprising. DAVIES: And we should just note here that it wasn't - Blacks didn't run the entire government, but they had allies among populist whites. They had formed this coalition between populist whites and the Republican Party, which allowed them to win these elections, which were, you know, more tolerant of Black participation and Black voting rights. ZUCCHINO: Exactly. And part of the propaganda campaign was really targeted against what they called carpetbaggers, which were northern - white northerners who had come down and scallywags, which were southerners who were called race traitors, and these were people who were in positions of power in the government. The newspapers railed against what they called, quote, \"Negro rule,\" when in fact, only a very, very small proportion of public officials in Wilmington and in eastern North Carolina were Black. Most of the power resided in their Republican white allies. But the white supremacy campaign - and that's another interesting point. They actually called it the white supremacy campaign. I mean, they were proud of it. And they made it very clear that they were going to restore white supremacy as official government policy. DAVIES: David Zucchino's book is \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with investigative reporter David Zucchino. His new book tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and significant representation in local government. Zucchino's book is called \"Wilmington's Lie.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: There was a very influential piece by an African American newspaper editor, Alex Manly, which played a role in all of these events. Tell us about this. Tell us about him, too. ZUCCHINO: Yeah. Alex Manly was a very, very courageous, crusading Black editor. He was, in fact, the grandson of a white governor, in fact, and he could have passed as white, which many people with white ancestors did, but he chose to live his life as a Black man. And he advocated for Black civil rights. And he demanded that the federal government live up to its promises of equality and citizenship and voting rights for Blacks. And he did so through the pages of his paper, The Daily Record. In August of 1898, he responded to a speech that was given by a woman in - a white woman in Georgia, who said the only solution to Black aggression against white women was to lynch. And she said, I - she said lynch a thousand times a day, if necessary. And he felt like he had to respond to that. And I would like to read just a couple of lines... DAVIES: Sure. ZUCCHINO: ...From the editorial he wrote in August. Quote, (reading) \"every Negro lynched is called a big, burly Black brute, when in fact, many of those who have been dealt with had white men for their fathers and were not only Black and burly but were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them, as is very well known to all. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a Black man to be intimate with a white woman than for a white man to be intimate with a colored woman. You set yourself down as a lot of carping hypocrites in that you cry aloud for the virtue of your women when you seek to destroy the morality of ours.\" And as you can imagine, that had an incredible incendiary impact on whites not only in Wilmington, across North Carolina and across the South because the white newspapers reprinted the editorial in full to try to incite whites against Blacks. And in fact, after the editorial ran, there were - the Red Shirts, which was the private militia of the white supremacy movement, wanted to lynch Alex Manly that day. And to show you how premeditated and calculated this white supremacy campaign was, they were ordered by the leaders of the campaign to wait until after the elections in November, three months later, when it would have greater political impact. So Alex Manly did survive up until just before the election, and then the Red Shirts rose up again and wanted to lynch him. He found out about it, and he fled Wilmington and never returned. DAVIES: So November 8 is election day in Wilmington and across the state. What happened in Wilmington? ZUCCHINO: In Wilmington, Blacks tried to summon the courage to go out and vote. And some of them did manage to vote, but a lot of them were intercepted by these gunmen, known as Red Shirts, and either threatened or beaten or intimidated and driven away from the polls. And the Red Shirts also went to polling stations and stuffed ballot boxes with phony Democratic ballots and destroyed Republican ballots. And there were instances in several precincts where the Democratic candidate won with more votes than the number of total registered voters in the district. So it was a complete fraud, and the election was stolen. The Democrats did take over county offices in the counties surrounding Wilmington, and they took back the state legislature. DAVIES: Right. And, of course, the municipal officials, which included some African Americans and their Republican - white Republican allies, were not on the ballot that day. And there was a plan to deal with them, and that really meant constraining the white mobs who wanted to really do violence and burn the Black newspaper. The plan was not to do that on Election Day. What was the plan? ZUCCHINO: The plan was to wait two days until after the election and to use the newly empowered position that they had as a result of winning the election to overthrow the government. And this was very carefully planned. There was a mass meeting of white men the day after the election where they issued something they called the White Declaration of Independence. They said, from now on, Black jobs will be given to white men. There will be no more Black officials in public office or in appointed office. Whites will rule. This is white men's country, and whites will rule it. And then they planned and organized for the next day for the Red Shirts to go out and, first, burn Alex Manly's Record newspaper because as I say, the Red Shirts had been just determined all summer to lynch Alex Manly. And they were given permission to do that that day. Once they burned the newspaper and returned, the smoke and the sound of the fire alarms just terrified Black workers in the city, and they all fled their jobs and went back to their neighborhoods. And some of them congregated in a Black neighborhood that was on the edge of a mixed-race neighborhood. They congregated on a corner. Some of them had managed to grab a few weapons to try to defend themselves, and there was a showdown with the whites who had just returned from burning the Black newspaper. And a huge crowd of white armed men developed and confronted this small group of Blacks on a corner. And after some shouting and yelling back and forth, gunfire broke out. The whites fired first, and the riot began. And for the rest of the day, the Red Shirts and the two state militias rampaged through the streets, chased down Black men, killed at least 60 Black men and, at the same time, came up with a banishment list of some 50 people, Black and white, who were to be banished from Wilmington forever. They rounded these people up and literally ran them out of town on a rail. They took them to the train station and put them on trains and told them never to come back, and not one of them ever did. DAVIES: What about the women and children? The gunfire was directed at Black men. What about their families? What became - what did they do? ZUCCHINO: Black families were so terrified at their men being shot down in the street that they fled. Just hundreds of families just fled to the swamps, to a Black cemetery where they figured whites would not enter, and hid in the woods for several days. This was in November. It was cold and wet at night. There were reports that some babies died during this horrible experience. Once the Black families felt it was safe to come back to Wilmington several days later, in the weeks and months following the coup, more than 2,000 Blacks fled the city. And a Black majority city almost overnight became a white supremacist stronghold. In 1898, the Black population of Wilmington was 56%, and today it is 18%. DAVIES: David Zucchino is a contributing writer for The New York Times. His book, \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy\", is now out in paperback. We'll hear more after a break, and John Powers reviews the new miniseries \"Bloodlands,\" a thriller set in Northern Ireland. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview recorded last year with veteran investigative reporter David Zucchino. His book tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and representation in local government. His book, called \"Wilmington's Lie,\" is now out in paperback. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: This wasn't simply a change of government. It was a radical transformation of the lives of Black citizens. You want to just talk about that a little bit? Some of - I mean, you know, they were successful attorneys and merchants who had real lives and stakes in the community and lots of Black people who were employed in working-class roles. How were their lives affected by this? ZUCCHINO: The leading - the Blacks - the doctors and the lawyers and the funeral directors and the ministers were put on this list to be banished, and they were all confronted in their homes that night, the night of the riot, and told they had 24 hours to get their affairs in order and leave. And they were all put on trains and sent out of town, and not one of them ever came back. There was one man named Thomas Miller, who was one of the wealthiest people, Black or white, in Wilmington. He was a real estate broker, a very shrewd businessman. He owned a restaurant. He had been a deputy sheriff. And he was so successful, he was seen as a threat by the white leadership. And he was dragged from his home by the militia - by the state militia - taken to jail overnight and, the next day, put on a train and driven from the city. And he, like all the others, never came back. This was not only a coup. It was a revolution. I mean, this had reverberations across North Carolina and the South that inspired white supremacists across the South. The effect of the coup and the aftermath was that Blacks did not hold elected or appointed offices in Wilmington or in eastern North Carolina for another 70 years. I mean, after they drove three Black aldermen from office at gunpoint, no Black citizens served on the city council until 1972. The white supremacists also hounded the only Black member of Congress in the country in 1898, a man named George Henry White who was from eastern North Carolina and represented North Carolina in Congress. They hounded him and his family. And he left after the coup, saying, I cannot live in North Carolina and be treated like a man. And from that point on, no African American citizen served in Congress from North Carolina until 1992. So this had major repercussions, and it was indeed a revolution. DAVIES: You know, one little detail which underlined the permanence of these changes were that Tom Miller, this wealthy Black citizen of Wilmington, the real estate broker who was banished from the city, years later asked permission to just come back to attend his mother's funeral. What happened? ZUCCHINO: That, to me, was one of just the saddest episodes in this book. He begged. He wrote a letter to a white colonel he knew in the city who he thought he was a friend and just begged for permission. Just - I just want to come back and bury my mother. She's the oldest living resident of this part of Wilmington. And he was just refused permission. And he wrote this heartbreaking, plaintive letter where he just said he had been treated worse than a dog, that he had done nothing wrong. It was a terrible injustice. It broke his heart, and he died two years later just a broken man. DAVIES: You know, this was an occasion of horrific violence inflicted upon Blacks, and it was a stolen election in that all of these state offices went from Republican to Democratic hands in what were clearly circumstances of corruption and intimidation. But there's a third element of this. I mean, you say that this was America's first and only armed overthrow of a legally elected government, and that's because there were local officials who were not on the ballot; that, even after these horrific events, were technically still in office, legally elected - some of them African Americans. What happened to them? ZUCCHINO: A mob of Red Shirts marched on city hall, led by a former Confederate colonel named Alfred Moore Waddell, at gunpoint, confronted the city councilmen and ordered them to resign. And they had no choice. They did resign. But the amazing thing was that they held an impromptu, quote, \"election.\" And the mob leaders, the people who actually led the riot and had run through the streets killing Black men, were appointed or, quote, \"elected\" to fill their positions on the city council. And Colonel Waddell was, quote, \"elected\" as mayor. So the mob leaders put themselves in charge, and they ran the city for years afterwards. DAVIES: In the civil rights movement, it was the federal government that often was the difference-maker when local whites were in charge and denying Blacks rights. There were efforts to get President William McKinley to intervene, both before these events and then to investigate afterwards. What became of that? ZUCCHINO: Yes. During the whole summer and fall of 1898, George Henry White, the U.S. congressman from North Carolina, met personally in the White House with McKinley and warned him that whites were planning this revolution and that were planning to intimidate and kill Black citizens. Black clergymen met with McKinley and warned him about it. Black ministers in Washington, D.C., held several meetings, mass meetings where they warned of the, quote, \"race war\" coming in North Carolina. After the coup and the massacre, McKinley was approached again by George Henry White. He met with a Black delegation, who told him what had happened and begged him to send federal troops. But in order for federal troops to come in, they had to be requested by the governor. And Governor Russell was besieged in his mansion. He was terrified, and he wasn't about to call in the troops. And at the same time, President McKinley, who was an abolitionist - he was a former Union officer - had campaigned on bringing the nation together. And these events occurred during the summer of 1898 in the middle of the Spanish-American War, and that war had sort of reunited the North and the South 30 years after the Civil War. And I don't think McKinley really wanted to interrupt that sense of nationhood, even though there was a real undercurrent of jingoism there. And at the same time, like any politician, he was running for reelection, and he needed white votes from the South. And now, I don't think he wanted to antagonize whites, so he made a decision to stay out of it, and I could find no record that he made any public comment about the events in Wilmington, before or afterward. DAVIES: As the election approached, through the summer and fall of 1898, you had white militias forming in Wilmington and surrounding communities, violence being inflicted upon Blacks, lots of, you know, incendiary language being thrown around in newspaper editorials. Did this attract national attention? ZUCCHINO: Absolutely. This was known as, quote, \"the race war in the Carolinas.\" And newspapers from around the country sent their white reporters down in the spring, summer and fall of 1898 to cover this race war. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Chicago Tribune, the Washington Evening Star, The Baltimore Sun - all the major papers of the day came down and covered it. And what was really interesting was when these reporters would arrive at the train station, the leaders of the white supremacy movement would meet them and hand out cigars and whiskey and arrange for their lodging. And they would also arrange, essentially, for them, to use a modern term, to embed with them. They took them around the city and filled them with stories of how Blacks were stockpiling weapons in Black churches and were planning to rise up and riot and take over the city. And the newspapers from the North repeated the talking points of the white supremacists almost word for word. So their stories were extremely slanted and even swallowed the white supremacy narrative that Blacks were incapable of voting, that they weren't intelligent enough to vote and certainly were not intelligent or capable enough to hold office and had to be removed. DAVIES: We're speaking with David Zucchino. He's an investigative reporter. His new book is \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" We'll take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with investigative reporter David Zucchino. He has a new book which tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and significant roles in local government. His book is called \"Wilmington's Lie.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: So after this violence in 1898, what measures were - did the white leaders enact to make permanent the denial of voting rights for Blacks? ZUCCHINO: Even before the coup, white supremacists had instituted poll taxes and literacy tests. In poll taxes, you were required to pay a fee in order to register to vote, and this was intended to keep Blacks from voting because so many Blacks were poor. The literacy test was run after whites stole the election. The poll watchers and the people who registered people were now suddenly all Democrats. And they would impose these literacy tests on Blacks and force them to do things like recite from memory the preamble to the Constitution. But the problem was that up to a quarter of all whites in North Carolina were illiterate and so they couldn't pass the literacy tests. And many whites were poor, so they couldn't afford the poll taxes. So the leaders of the white supremacy campaign had been elected to the state legislature, so they passed what they called a suffrage amendment, which contained a grandfather clause, which said that if your grandfather or any descendant had voted prior to 1867, you were exempted from the poll tax and the literacy test. Well, conveniently enough, Blacks did not get to vote in North Carolina until 1868. So essentially, the grandfather clause eliminated almost all Black men in North Carolina because very, very few of them - none of them, in fact - had an ancestor who had voted before 1867. DAVIES: And that clearly discriminatory provision stood for how long? ZUCCHINO: It stood until the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, so for basically 70 years. DAVIES: You know, the name of your book is \"Wilmington's Lie,\" which is an interesting way to set a focus on this; it's not just the events, but how they were remembered over the years. In the decades that followed, how were these violent events characterized by white papers, white newspapers and leaders in the South? ZUCCHINO: Right. The first thing I should remind people is this was unique. There have been many so-called race riots in American history, both in the 19th century and the early 20th century, you know, such as Atlanta in 1906 and Tulsa in 1921. But these were spontaneous, and the spark was usually contact between a black man and a white woman. The coup in Wilmington was completely unique. First of all, it was not a race riot; it was a coup, and it was premeditated. It was calculated and planned for months, and there's never been another case like this in American history. And after the coup, in the years following, the white supremacists were quite proud of what they did, and they bragged openly about it in letters and in diaries and in memoirs. But then gradually, over the years, it was covered up. It was not taught in history books in North Carolina, and if it was mentioned, it was mentioned as part of this lost cause mythology of the South of whites rising up in defense of good government and eliminating incompetent and corrupt Blacks from government. So that's the way it was portrayed for more than a hundred years. I went to high school and college in North Carolina, and not once was this ever mentioned in any history class. DAVIES: Over time, in the late 20th century, attitudes changed, and people began to learn about it and consider the narrative of what happened in Wilmington in 1898. And then there was the approaching 100th anniversary, and that culminated in quite a debate about how these events were to be regarded. How did the community contend with this legacy? ZUCCHINO: The University of North Carolina at Wilmington decided that the time had come to really burrow down and find out what really happened and to educate people about what really happened. And they decided to try to bring whites and Blacks together, including descendants on both sides of people who had been involved in the events of 1898. It was a very, very emotional and painful time, but I believe they did accomplish something. They had several symposiums. They - at one point, on exactly 100 years after white supremacists gave a speech before the election, vowing to choke the Cape Fear River with Black carcasses, they held a joint Black and white referendum where they signed what they called a declaration of Black and white independence. They had church choirs from Black and white churches sing hymns together. They came up with a definition of what had happened. And rather than a race riot, they decided that it was racial violence. The true story was told. But there were still quite a few resentments on both sides. For the whites, there was an undercurrent of, why are we dredging up this ancient history? This happened 100 years ago. Let's just let it die. And obviously, for African Americans, a great sense of loss. Their middle-class community was destroyed and, really, never rebuilt. They had suffered - their families had suffered for generations. There were calls for reparations, which created more friction. But in the end, they created a memorial that was a block from the site of where the first gunshots rang out in 1898. They put up a plaque that told the true story of what had been called a race riot but was, in fact, a coup. So I believe, in the end, they did reach sort of an uneasy accommodation with the events of 100 years earlier. DAVIES: You also spoke with descendants of some of the African American leaders at the time, including Alex Manly. What did you hear? ZUCCHINO: I talked to Alex Manly's grandson, Lewin Manly Jr., who at the time was 85 years old. He's a retired dentist living in Atlanta. And he grew up - he knew his grandfather as a child for a few years. He knew Alex Manly's wife very well, his grandmother. And as he was growing up, he kept hearing these stories about Wilmington in 1898 and how his grandfather was directly involved. His family would not tell him anything. And it really pained him, and it bothered him that he could not get anything out of his family. And he realized much later that this was such a painful and searing experience for the family that they decided they would never talk about it again. Alex Manly did not tell anyone the details of what had happened. He said very little about it. He said he wanted to let the past bury the past, would not talk about it up until his death in the 1940s. His grandson learned the true story of what had happened in 2006. This was when a state commission, which had been appointed to - investigated the causes and the impact of the riot, had spent five years investigating it, and in 2006, came out with a 400-page report that just detailed what had happened. And Lewin Manly read this and was astonished, had no idea what had happened. And when I talked to him, I asked him, you know, can you ever forgive the whites for what they did to your grandfather 120 years ago? And he says, well, I'm not a religious man, and I can't forget, and I won't forgive. I hope they're burning in hell - all of them. DAVIES: Well, David Zucchino, thanks so much for speaking with us. ZUCCHINO: It's great to be with you, Dave. DAVIES: David Zucchino is a contributing writer for The New York Times.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with lawyer Debo Adegbile about how the Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted Section 5 of The Voting Rights Act, lets states pass restrictive voting laws.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: And that case, Shelby County v. Holder, is what we're going to examine today in our series The Right To Vote. As the vice president mentioned, that Supreme Court case has, in part, made it possible for states to enact new restrictive voting laws. So let's go back. Shelby County is in the heart of Alabama, and that's where a Black city council member named Ernest Montgomery initially lost his bid for reelection in 2008, after his district was redrawn to include fewer voters of color. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ERNEST MONTGOMERY: This was about my people. CHANG: But the Department of Justice had a tool at its disposal - sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act. These provisions forced certain jurisdictions to seek what's called preclearance from the federal government before they could redraw maps or make other voting changes. DEBO ADEGBILE: Essentially, it was a protection that was focused on some of the states and jurisdictions that had the deepest and darkest histories of voting discrimination. CHANG: That's attorney Debo Adegbile. He represented Ernest Montgomery when Shelby County leaders challenged the preclearance requirement all the way to the Supreme Court. And in 2013, Shelby County won. In a narrow 5-4 vote, the justices said the formula that determined which jurisdictions needed preclearance was outdated. And Section 5 was essentially gutted. Condemnation from civil rights activists was swift, including from the late Georgia Congressman John Lewis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN LEWIS: Today, the Supreme Court struck a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act. CHANG: Debo Adegbile agreed. His parents were both immigrants from Nigeria and Ireland. And he says, as a child, he came to understand the opportunity that America represents, an idea that he seeks to protect today as a civil rights lawyer. Adegbile has defended Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act twice before the Supreme Court, and I spoke to him about those two cases. The very first time that you did argue before the court to defend the constitutionality of Section 5, this preclearance requirement, was in 2009, a few years before Shelby in a case called Northwest Austin Utility v. Holder. The court left Section 5 intact in that case. What did that case hint to you at the time about what might be coming down the road from the court? ADEGBILE: The case got to the Supreme Court on the 100th day of the Obama presidency. And the context of that case was that we had the first Black president. And our adversaries were raising the question, do we still need this civil rights-era voting protection because so much has changed in the country? And our defense, of course, was that indeed a great deal has changed. But just as a great deal has changed, a great deal remains the same. And one of the things that remains the same is that minority voters face risks, and those risks are different in degree and nature in some parts of the country. CHANG: Can you just talk about, what are the types of discrimination that Section 5 was created to protect against? ADEGBILE: So what we've seen is that the pattern of trying to disadvantage minority voters has taken many forms. What folks in power will do is they will draw the district lines in ways that intentionally try to lessen or dilute the voices of Black or Latinx voters. And so there are extraordinary things that have been blocked and deterred by Section 5 because it required people to be thinking about the fact that they were going to be asked to come forward and make a demonstration that the act or the law was not discriminatory. And so it's a disincentive to do it. CHANG: So when you learned the court's ruling in Shelby, which gutted Section 5, which had for such a long time protected against these forms of discrimination, what were the first thoughts that crossed your mind when you found out what the court decided? ADEGBILE: It's heartbreaking when the Supreme Court acts in a way that is contrary to its precedent and, frankly, when it undermines one of the great civil rights statutes in American history. And it took away an important tool, but it did something else that was really troubling. It sent a signaling effect that the federal government was in retreat from the minority protection principle that the Voting Rights Act represents. CHANG: If I may push you a little bit, in Shelby, Chief Justice John Roberts, in writing for the majority, basically said that, look, there's still Section 2. That still is good law under the Voting Rights Act. And Section 2 bans racial discrimination in voting. How do you respond to that argument that Section 2 is enough protection? ADEGBILE: It's true. Section 2 is in place and it applies nationwide. The reason that we needed Section 5 preclearance is because Section 2 is an after-the-fact remedy. What Section 5 did is it allowed us to attack discrimination before it takes root. CHANG: Well, I understand that shortly after you argued the Shelby case, you had a conversation with the late Georgia Congressman John Lewis. Can you tell me about that? What did he say to you? ADEGBILE: It so happened that the weekend after the Shelby County argument was the time of the annual Edmund Pettus Bridge crossing. And I happened to see Congressman Lewis, and I tapped him on the shoulder to say hello and say hi. He turned around and gave me a bear hug there in the shadow of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And I said to him that I tried to speak truth to power. And he said, you did. You did. And to be embraced by Congressman Lewis at the foot of the bridge where he and so many others were beaten and attacked for the right to vote days after we had been there trying to fight the modern fight for the right to vote was just a very meaningful personal moment. CHANG: Well, as we look forward and consider the effects of the Shelby case, I want to reach back a little bit and play for you something that Ernest Montgomery, your former client, told NPR in 2013. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) MONTGOMERY: I'm not here to air our laundry here in Shelby County, but I know the story. I think we're getting better. But the removing of the legislation would definitely turn back the hands of time. CHANG: Do you think that Ernest Montgomery was right, that the hands of time have turned back? I mean, how much of a step backwards do you think this country has taken on voting rights since Shelby? ADEGBILE: What we're seeing is that there are efforts to make it harder for minority voters to participate in elections. In North Carolina, I think on the day that Shelby County was decided, there was legislation announced that went through systematically to identify all the ways that had increased Black turnout in the Obama presidential election, and one by one, made it harder for each and every one of those paths to be open to minority voters. And so everything that Mr. Montgomery predicted has come true and then some. And we need to continue to fight to not take these losses as permanent. CHANG: Well, what form does that fight take? Where do you go from here? When you think back to what originally motivated you, what your original purpose was when you started doing this kind of work, how do you now try to accomplish the goals of the Voting Rights Act without some of its key provisions? ADEGBILE: I think that the lesson of voting progress in America is a lesson of courage, persistence and strategy. We need the persistence to demand that Congress come back with new legislation and not allow the Supreme Court to have the last word on these things. Congress must take up its role and responsibility. And we need to bring these things together in a strategy that has the right kind of legislation and that is supported by the right kind of grassroots activism and movement so that it will get pushed through. That's the lesson I take from voting rights history, and that's what we need to marshal right now. CHANG: That was Debo Adegbile. He's now a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and a lawyer at the law firm WilmerHale in New York.

When President-elect Joe Biden was asked whether student loan cancellation figured into his economic recovery plan, he declared, \"It should be done immediately.\" \"[Student debt is] holding people up,\" Biden said on Nov. 16, 2020. \"They're in real trouble. They're having to make choices between paying their student loan and paying the rent.\" On the campaign trail, Biden had pledged to cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person. Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again. One year later, while Biden has provided hundreds of thousands of borrowers with debt relief, that $10,000 promise remains unfulfilled. Here's a look at why \u2014 and what he has done. The Biden administration's approach to student loan relief began with improving, extending or expanding a handful of programs that were already on the books. \"We're working really hard to get students the relief that they're entitled to\" through these preexisting programs, Undersecretary of Education James Kvaal told NPR on Friday. While it's not loan forgiveness, Biden extended the pandemic pause on federal student loan payments; that pause is now slated to lift in February. His other actions essentially keep promises the U.S. government had already made to borrowers \u2014 rather than make new ones. For example: Through these efforts, the Education Department says it has discharged or is in the process of discharging roughly $12.7 billion in student debt, affecting more than 638,000 borrowers. While these moves were cheered by borrowers and advocates, they were not without controversy. The top Republican on the House Education Committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, decried the department's PSLF waiver, calling it \"an abuse of executive authority\" and \"too significant of an issue\" to act without Congress. Broader loan forgiveness would be even more controversial. In February, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., responded to some Democrats' demand that Biden forgive as much as $50,000 in student debt per borrower by calling it \"incredibly, fundamentally unfair\" to students who have already repaid their debts. Foxx agrees, telling NPR that borrowers have a responsibility to repay their student debts: \"It's no different than having taken out a loan for a car that you then find you can't pay back or taking out a loan for a home that you can no longer pay for \u2014 or you choose not to pay for.\" Many critics of broad loan forgiveness agree that the cost of college is out of control but insist that canceling student debts would simply address a symptom of the problem, not its cause. \"In fact, Democrats' 'solution' is likely to make things worse,\" Thune said on the Senate floor. \"What incentive will colleges have to restrain tuition growth if they think they can rely on the federal government to subsidize their students' tuition fees through loan forgiveness?\" While many Republicans have resisted calls for debt cancellation, many Democrats and advocates for student loan relief are growing restless. To them, Biden's $12.7 billion in debt relief so far is a rounding error, considering that nearly 46 million Americans have $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. And he campaigned on doing more \u2014 again, $10,000 per borrower. \"That was a pretty clear promise that he made during the campaign,\" says Persis Yu, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. \"And certainly, that is a promise that I think many borrowers are right now waiting for him to fulfill.\" Yu also says keeping that promise would make a huge difference, especially for borrowers already in default. \"Roughly 16 million borrowers would have their entire debts extinguished, and that amounts to roughly two-thirds of the borrowers who are in default.\" \"Crumbs' worth of action.\" That's how Jalil Mustaffa Bishop describes the Biden administration's efforts thus far. The assistant professor at Villanova University studies inequities in higher education. In June, borrower advocates erected signs in front of the White House calling on President Biden to cancel student debt.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Morigi/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mustaffa Bishop says the student loan system badly needs an overhaul, especially \"for groups that historically have been marginalized and had to experience generations of different types of debt traps,\" from sharecropping to subprime mortgages to payday lending. Student loans are no different. Mustaffa Bishop co-authored a recent survey of nearly 1,300 Black borrowers. The report, \"Jim Crow Debt,\" produced in partnership with the Education Trust, unpacks how pervasive racial inequities, including widespread wealth disparities and persistent workplace discrimination, have left many people of color drowning in student debt. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that \"Twenty years after starting college, the median debt of White borrowing students has been reduced by 94 percent \u2014 with almost half holding no student debt \u2014 whereas Black borrowers at the median still owe 95 percent of their cumulative borrowing total.\" Two-thirds of respondents to Mustaffa Bishop's survey said, in hindsight, they regretted having taken out student loans. \"The student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue and we must finally begin to address it as such,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., in a statement roughly one year ago. \"Broad-based student debt cancellation is precisely the kind of bold, high-impact policy that the broad and diverse coalition that elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris expect them to deliver.\" To understand why Biden hasn't pushed for broad student loan forgiveness, it helps to understand how he could, using one of two doors: 1) Congress or 2) executive action. Door No. 1 is less controversial, to be sure, but keying it open requires bipartisan support or, at least, unwavering support from Democrats. Loan cancellation appears to have neither. Consider this: Among the proposals that have been dropped from Biden's Build Back Better agenda is his pitch for free community college. It's hard to imagine Democrats would abandon that, at a cost of roughly $45 billion, but still support spending at least $370 billion on student loan forgiveness. So this door is likely locked \u2014 and maybe boarded up from the inside. That leaves Door No. 2. Much has been written about the president's authority \u2014 through his education secretary \u2014 to simply cancel the debts of millions of borrowers. Here's an NPR primer from nearly two years ago. But Biden doesn't seem eager to try this door. For one thing, he says, it's not certain that canceling student loans with the stroke of his pen would hold up in court, admitting in a February 2021 town hall that \"I don't think I have the authority\" to cancel $50,000 per borrower. And Biden is not alone in his skepticism. \"The president can't do it,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaking to the media in July. \"That's not even a discussion.\" Whether Pelosi's conclusion was driven by facts or political expediency (read: giving Biden cover for not keeping a campaign promise), Biden has resisted acting unilaterally. There's also the matter of cost. Again, forgiving $10,000 per borrower would come with about a $370 billion price tag, according to the Brookings Institution. Forgiving $50,000 per borrower could cost about $1 trillion. \"Why should taxpayers \u2014 70% of whom didn't go to college \u2014 pay back loans for people who have an obligation they haven't fulfilled?\" Foxx asks. (In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that \"From 2010 to 2019, the percentage of people age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher jumped from 29.9% to 36.0%.\") Foxx thinks this popularity question is a big reason behind Biden's hesitancy to act. \"I do think the president maybe understands that broad loan forgiveness is not popular in this country, which is why, I think, he has not gone the route of doing what some in his party want to do.\" But polling suggests broad loan forgiveness would be popular, if done with some nuance. For example, a Grinnell College poll conducted in March found that 27% of respondents supported forgiving all student debt and an additional 39% supported forgiveness \"for those in need.\" In other polling \u2014 from Vox/Data for Progress and the Harris Poll \u2014 a majority of respondents supported broad, if limited, forgiveness. Instead of acting unilaterally, though, this year Biden asked the Education and Justice departments to explore his legal options. The results are still TBD, more than six months later. Since then, the White House has gone largely quiet on loan cancellation. Some advocates \u2014 and many Democrats \u2014 worry that, for whatever reason, the administration is intentionally dragging its feet. Not so, said Kvaal, the education undersecretary, in his interview with NPR. \"Legal authority is not an on-off switch. You need to think about the standards that would be applied, the rationale that we can muster,\" Kvaal explained. \"We are looking very carefully with the White House and the Department of Justice at whether we can cancel loans across the board for everyone, and that's something where deliberations are still continuing.\" There's an argument to be made that Biden is running out of time to broadly cancel student debts. Democrats' majorities in Congress are likely to shrink next year, if not melt into minorities. What's more, the Education Department has said it will require that federal student loan payments, paused during the pandemic, resume as early as Jan. 31. Imagine millions of borrowers navigating a repayment system they haven't used in more than a year and a half. Many will need to speak with their loan servicing company to change repayment options. And two of those companies, which serve roughly 15 million borrowers, are right now transitioning out of the federal student loan business all together. NPR has spoken with more than a dozen student loan experts, including a handful inside the department, who all say they expect this return to repayment to be ... difficult. If broad-based student loan forgiveness is going to happen, it makes all the sense in the world to do it before Jan. 31. Biden's campaign pledge would mean millions of borrowers would have their debts erased, allowing them to avoid this difficult, potentially disastrous payment restart. That doesn't mean Biden has to keep his $10,000 loan forgiveness pledge by then. It just means, if he doesn't, it's hard to imagine broad forgiveness happening anytime soon, if at all.",

A new study from the Pew Research Center breaks down ideology within political parties, including by views on the role of government. The idea that Americans are polarized makes it seem as if there are only two sides in politics \u2014 liberal and conservative, Democratic and Republican. But Americans are far more complicated politically, a new Pew Research Center typology shows in a study that gives a clearer picture of the full spectrum of American political views. Americans are divided not just by party but also within them, enough so for Pew to sort Americans ideologically into nine distinct categories (one more than in its last typology four years ago, with some decidedly different contours). Clear lines emerge when it comes to race, inequality and what the government should do about it. There are also decidedly different views on the role of government overall, economic policy, immigration, religion, the United States' standing in the world and \u2014 for Republican-leaning groups \u2014 former President Donald Trump. What's more, despite surveys having found broad support for a third party outside the two major ones, the study shows that there's no magic middle. In fact, the study finds that the three groups with the most self-identified independents \"have very little in common politically.\" There are also clear implications for control of Congress. While there has been much focus on Democratic divisions between progressive and moderate wings in Congress, the study finds there are more divisions among Republican groups on the issues. But where Republicans have an advantage is having more of a sense of urgency about who is in charge in Washington. The strongest Republican groups more so than the strongest Democratic ones think next year's midterms \"really matter.\" The typology was created using more than 10,000 survey interviews over an 11-day period this past July. A typical national survey has about 1,000 respondents. This is the eighth typology Pew has created since 1987. Here's an overview of Pew's nine categories (to see where you fit, you can take Pew's quiz here): Faith and Flag Conservatives (10% of the public) Committed Conservatives (7%) Populist Right (11%) Ambivalent Right (12%) Stressed Sideliners (15%) Outsider Left (10%) Democratic Mainstays (16%) Establishment Liberals (13%) Progressive Left (6%) Republican-leaning groups largely believe government is doing too much, that everyone has the ability to succeed, obstacles that once made it harder for women and nonwhites to get ahead are now gone, white people largely don't benefit from societal advantages over Black people, that political correctness is a major problem and military might is key to keeping the U.S. a superpower. Two-thirds also think the Republican Party should not accept elected officials who have been openly critical of Trump. They divide, however, on economic, social and foreign policy. On economics, there are splits on whether corporations make a fair amount of profit and if taxes should be raised on the wealthy. They also don't fully agree on which is more important \u2014 oil, coal and natural gas expansion or developing alternative energy supplies. On social issues, they diverge on whether same-sex marriage or abortion should be legal, if government policies should reflect religious beliefs and even whether they feel uncomfortable hearing people speak a language other than English in public places. There are also differences on whether election changes that make it easier to vote would make elections less secure. On foreign affairs, some think the U.S. should take allies' interests into account; others do not. Faith and Flag Conservatives Committed Conservatives Populist Right Ambivalent Right Stressed Sideliners While Democratic-leaning groups generally agree on many issues and say that problems exist when it comes to race and economic inequality, there is an intensity gap about how much should be done about those problems and how radical the solutions should be. Pew notes that in past typologies, it has found cracks among Democratic groups on social issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana, but those no longer exist. Instead, now the divides are about how liberal the party should be. These Democratic-leaning groups believe in a strong federal government, one that should do more to solve problems. They also agree that the economic system unfairly favors the powerful and that taxes on big businesses and corporations should be raised, as should the minimum wage (to $15 an hour). They feel more needs to be done to achieve racial equality, that nonwhites face at least some discrimination, that significant obstacles remain for women to get ahead and that voting is a fundamental right and should not be restricted. When it comes to major foreign policy decisions, they agree that allies should be taken into consideration. Fissures exist with regard to U.S. military power and, to a lesser extent, social and criminal justice, as well as immigration.

Voters decided not to replace the city's police department with a new Department of Public Safety. The election comes more than a year after George Floyd's death launched a movement to defund or abolish police across the country. Voters in Minneapolis have resoundingly rejected a proposal to reinvent policing in their city, 17 months after the killing of George Floyd by police sparked massive protests and calls for change. Approximately 56% of voters rejected a ballot question that would have removed the Minneapolis Police Department from the city charter and replaced it with a \"public-health oriented\" Department of Public Safety. The \"Yes\" campaign conceded defeat in a statement that read, in part, \"We spoke the truth while the opposition, Democrats and Republicans alike, spread lies and mischaracterized our measure to create confusion, distrust, and fear. \" Nationally, the vote was seen as a test of the political movement to \"defund\" traditional policing as it ran up against concerns about rising violent crime. The \"defund\" movement, which called for shrinking police budgets and shifting the money to other social purposes, gained ground in the summer of 2020. A few days after Floyd's murder, most members of the Minneapolis city council appeared at a \"defund\" rally. But as violent crime surged nationally \u2014 and in Minneapolis \u2014 some of those same local politicians backed away from the idea. In 2021, the \"Yes\" campaign, supported by national left-of-center groups such as the ACLU and MoveOn.org, also distanced itself from the \"police defunding\" label. Campaign spokeswoman JaNa\u00e9 Bates framed the amendment as an \"expansion of public safety.\" She said the elimination of the traditional department structure \u2014 and the requirement for a minimum number of police officers \u2014 would give the city more flexibility in how it responds to crime. \"You actually can staff the department the way that meets the needs of the people,\" Bates told NPR in October. \"We wanted to really be centered and focused on the safety of human beings.\" The \"No\" campaign \u2014 \"All of Mpls,\" funded partly by local business interests \u2014 framed the amendment as a leap in the dark. \"It does not present any sort of plan for what will come after,\" says campaign manager Leili Fatehi. \"There's no specificity as to what services [the Department of Public Safety] would provide, what law enforcement would look like, what residents can expect.\" Opponents said it was a dangerous time for that kind of uncertainty as an exodus of police officers left the Minneapolis Police Department understaffed, even as the city endured a near-record spike in gun crimes and homicides. The two sides jousted over whether traditional police officers would be part of the new system. The \"No\" campaign pointed to the language of the charter amendment, which said the new Department of Public Safety \"could\" employ police officers \"if necessary.\" \"Yes\" campaigners called the warnings about the disappearance of police \"fear-mongering.\" \"Police will be part of the city of Minneapolis,\" Bates said during a debate in October. \"There is a state mandate that overrides anything that the city sets up, that requires police officers to respond to a whole series of situations.\" The two sides also argued over the police chief, Medaria Arradondo. An African-American officer who came up through the ranks of the MPD, he's more popular than most local politicians, and minority groups in the city see him as a force for reform. Opponents of the amendment warned that eliminating the office of Chief of Police would mean losing Arradondo, while proponents said there would be no reason he couldn't be kept on in the leadership of the new system. Arradondo roiled the waters last Wednesday when he spoke to the press \u2014 in uniform, and in front of an MPD backdrop \u2014 to express his misgivings about the charter amendment. \"Yes\" campaigners criticized the chief for taking sides, drawing an ethics complaint for using city resources to weigh in on a political matter. The charter amendment vote also divided Minnesota's Democratic Party. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and state Attorney General Keith Ellison weighed in to support it, while U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Gov. Tim Walz opposed it.",

As the headline unambiguously states, here at NPR we've kicked off Hispanic Heritage Month. Not Latino Heritage Month. Not Latinx Heritage Month. Not even a compromise or a combination of the three: Hispanic/Latino/Latinx Heritage Month. To be honest, NPR began to participate in the national event that is called Hispanic Heritage Month with no discussion about existing tensions within Latino communities regarding the use of the word Hispanic, its origins and whether it may be time to swap out the catchall label for something different. Perhaps that has something to do with the rapid pace of the news recently regarding the end of a 20-year-long war in Afghanistan, another terrifying spike in the COVID-19 pandemic or this week's recall election in California. Or, in full transparency, it could have something to do with the fact that as of 2020 only 6% of the NPR's newsroom and on-air journalists identify as Hispanic or Latino. But it's not too late to pose the following thorny questions: What's the harm in lumping together roughly 62 million people with complex identities under a single umbrella? Is a blanket pan-ethnic term necessary to unite and reflect a shared culture that is still largely (infuriatingly) excluded from mainstream popular culture? Or the more basic question:  \u00bfPor que Hispanic? Hispanic Heritage Month initially began as a weeklong celebration in 1968 under President Lyndon Johnson who, at the time said, \"The people of Hispanic descent are the heirs of missionaries, captains, soldiers, and farmers who were motivated by a young spirit of adventure, and a desire to settle freely in a free land.\" \"This heritage is ours,\" he proclaimed. It wasn't until 1988 that President Ronald Reagan extended the week to a full 31 days \u2014 through Oct. 15 \u2014 keeping the Sept. 15 start date because it coincides with national independence day of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Similarly, Mexico celebrates on the 16th, Chile on the 18th and Belize on the 21st. But even before Johnson landed on the term Hispanic, there was a lot of debate within government entities on how to refer to Latinos in the United States, Cristina Mora, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, tells NPR. Mora, who wrote about the adoption of the term Hispanic in Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Created a New American, found that use of the umbrella categorization is inextricably linked to the U.S. Census and its attempts to identify and quantify different groups of people. The Pew Research Center reports that in the 1930s Latinos living in the U.S., regardless of their place of birth or family origin, were all noted as \"Mexican\" by door-to-door U.S. Census Bureau counters. It wasn't until 1970 that the agency began asking Latinos living in the U.S. to self-identify as either \"Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, Other Spanish\" or \"No, none of these.\" This, however, led to a bizarre and unexpected underrepresentation of white Americans who misunderstood the classifications. Apparently, hundreds of thousands of confused people living in the South or central regions of the U.S. mistakenly identified as Central or South American, according to Pew. But even with the added Latino subgroups, Mora says the 1970 Census once again resulted in a severe undercount of the minority but growing population, which in turn led to a national backlash from activists, academics and civic leaders who demanded fair representation. New groups were formed to tackle the problem, including the Census Bureau's  Spanish Origin Advisory Committee and a group of Spanish-speaking federal employees called the Ad Hoc Committee on Racial and Ethnic Definitions. Mora recalls several of the options being floated at the time included \"Brown,\" \"Latin American,\" \"Latino\" and Hispanic. \"One of the problems is that Latinos were seen as foreigners, invaders and not inherently American. And one of the jobs of the advisory board was to really show that Latinos were an American minority group, like African-Americans \u2014 a minority that stretched from coast to coast and that were patriotic, that fought in wars, that contributed to American history, that built American cities. So when a term like Latin American was used, right away, it seemed to strike discord because it was seen as too foreign,\" Mora explains. She adds: \"Hispanic was never a term that everybody loved, but it was a term that got a lot of support from within Latinos in the Nixon [administration] and, later, the Ford administration.\" It was eventually added to the 1980 census. \"We hated the term Hispanic because it was a term that we felt was forced upon us by the U.S. government,\" Paul Ortiz, author of An African American and Latinx History of the United States, tells NPR. \"It wasn't a natural fit for anyone that I knew. I didn't know anyone growing up who said, 'Oh, hey, I'm Hispanic.' It was always either, I'm Mexican, Mexican-American, Chicano or Chicana,\" says Ortiz, who is also a history professor at the University of Florida. A large part of that, he says, is based on the origins of the word Hispanic, which is the English translation of the Spanish \"Hispano,\" meaning a person whose cultural traditions originate from Spain. When that is the starting point, he says, \"That immediately erases all of the centuries of pre-Columbian history, culture and civilizations that existed before the European conquest and colonization of the Americas ... and that's understandably upsetting to people who are not white.\" It alienates indigenous and Afro-Latino communities whose history includes deep resistance to the Spanish invasion and is not necessarily tied to Spain, Ortiz says. The recent popularity of the word Latinx in the U.S. presents another alternative to the contentious Hispanic label that proponents say also offers gender inclusivity. Ortiz marvels at the way it has so quickly been adapted by young people, academic institutions and corporations alike, though it is not without its own critics. When naming his book, it was his students who suggested using Latinx in the title. \"Originally it was going to be African-American and Latino History in the United States. But my students really impressed upon me the themes of inclusivity and diversity, [saying] we have to be open.\" He's also noticed that in the past two years or so, many of the speaking requests he's received from corporations are for Latino or Latinx Heritage Month not Hispanic Heritage Month \u2014 that includes an invitation to speak at a Deutsche Bank event later this week. Ortiz suggests that one theory for the shift is that it is being driven by diverse employee organizations within the companies. \"Almost all of them \u2014 the ones that have reached out \u2014  have taken on the term Latinx.\" \"I find this fascinating because the stereotype is that the term Latinx is being foisted upon us by academics but that's just not true,\" he says. Beyond the dispute over what to name the month-long celebration, there is another concern: that in an effort to make it more palatable or commercially viable, stories of oppression, prejudice and injustice are whitewashed or ignored. \"Too often the focus is on the musical contributions or dancing or other happy artforms,\" Mario T. Garcia, professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, tells NPR. \"But we also need programming that reflects historical problems ... because you can't assume that Latinos already know about the lynchings in South Texas in the 1910s,\" the Zoot Suit Riots, the segregation of Mexican kids in schools, or the Chicano-led high school walkouts of the 1960s that permanently changed higher education enrollment for Latino students. In his experience, Garcia notes, the U.S. public education system does such a poor job of teaching Latino history in this country, that often Hispanic Heritage Month is the only opportunity for any students to learn about it. \"It is a real shame,\" he says. But approached in the right way, he adds, even these stories can be ultimately seen as happy. \"Because the historic struggles of Chicanos, Mexican-Americans, other Latinos are happy stories ... because only through those struggles have we been able to achieve more social justice in this country, more education.\"",

Sitting in the passenger seat of her parked car in Boston and peering at the Zoom app open on her phone, Michelle Wu's voice almost cracks as she describes the difficulties she has faced trying to access city resources. \"I had fought in the wake of my mother's mental illness to connect her with treatment and experienced such a dehumanizing system,\" she recounts. \"And I had fought to open a small family business to keep us going and felt just a complete helplessness in going through bureaucratic systems that seem designed to force you to give up.\" She cites these experiences to explain why she got involved in Boston politics despite growing up in a family which, like many Asian American and Pacific Islander families, discouraged political participation. Wu is the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, and both sets of her grandparents fled China during the country's civil war. \"It was not only out of the realm of conversation to discuss current events and politics,\" Wu says, \"but actively discouraged because of the sense of risk, or the family connotations around suspicion and active distrust of government.\" After stints working for Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Elizabeth Warren's 2012 senate campaign, Wu successfully ran for office herself, winning an at-large seat on the Boston City Council, which she has held since 2014. In 2016, she served as council president. This year, she's running for mayor. She faces six other Democrats in September's primary and currently leads the pack with slightly more than 23% of likely voters choosing her as their first choice in a June Boston Globe-Suffolk University poll. Trailing her by less than two percentage points is Acting Mayor Kim Janey, who assumed the office this March when former Mayor Marty Walsh was appointed to lead the U.S. Labor Department. When Walsh, who is white, stepped down, Janey became the first woman and first Black mayor of Boston. If she wins, Wu will break a political \"bamboo ceiling\" and become the first AAPI mayor of Boston. But AAPI advocates say that Wu's candidacy harbors a greater significance: combating anti-Asian hate. According to data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to police surged between 2019 and 2020 by 145% across the country, while hate crimes overall decreased by 6%. In Boston, there was a 133% rise in anti-Asian hate crimes as hate crimes dropped in the city overall by 14%. Over the first year of the pandemic in America, between March 2020 and March of this year, more than 6,600 anti-Asian hate incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit that tracks these kinds of incidents. While the majority were verbal harassment, about 13% were physical assaults. Some physical assaults turn deadly, like the attack on 84-year-old Thai grandfather Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco or the Atlanta spa shootings that claimed the life of Feng Daoyou, a 44-year-old working in America to help fund a new home for her family in China. The true number of anti-Asian incidents is likely much higher than what's currently being reported, says Connie Chung Joe, CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles, a legal aid and advocacy organization that serves AAPI communities in Southern California. \"When you think about the vulnerable community members, we're talking about folks who are seniors, often limited English speaking, and they don't know how to navigate language and cultural barriers,\" Chung Joe told NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. \"And so there is far more people who have not reported incidents than those who have.\" Civil rights attorney Elizabeth OuYang notes that there is a particular lens through which these incidents must be viewed. \"What is key to understanding hate crimes, particularly against Asian Americans, is the harmful stereotype that we are the perpetual foreigner, the enemy, and after 9/11, the terrorist,\" she explains. Part of the stereotype of AAPIs as \"others\" is rooted in a lack of visibility for the community, especially in local political life. According to data from the Reflective Democracy Campaign, AAPIs make up only 2.4% of municipal officeholders despite comprising over 6% of the national population. And of the 100 largest cities in the country, only five are led by Asian American mayors and all of them are in California. That this stereotype begets violence is not a new phenomenon. OuYang, who has represented victims of anti-Asian hate crimes since the '80s, looks at the pandemic-related incidents of the past year and sees a trend in anti-Asian hate in America. \"I'm 60 years old,\" she says. \"I've been a civil rights attorney for 35-plus years. Certain things like that theme of Asian Americans being portrayed as the persistent foreigner, constant threat, is still the same.\" People demonstrate against anti-Asian violence and racism on March 27, 2021 in Los Angeles. A week earlier eight people were killed at three Atlanta-area spas, six of whom were Asian women, in an attack that sent fear through the Asian community amid a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People demonstrate against anti-Asian violence and racism on March 27, 2021 in Los Angeles. A week earlier eight people were killed at three Atlanta-area spas, six of whom were Asian women, in an attack that sent fear through the Asian community amid a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. Often, it doesn't take much sleuthing to discern the prevalence of this stereotype in anti-Asian incidents. \"In many of the instances that I've been involved in and followed, it's often preceded by rhetoric like 'go back to your country, go home,' very hurtful rhetoric when this is for many of us, our home,\" OuYang recalls. \"Because once you do that, by labeling somebody as not part of your community, an outsider and so forth, it gives you a green light to then do things to them.\" To help combat hate crimes, OuYang argues that increasing AAPI representation in city governments will help dispel the perpetual foreigner stereotype at the heart of anti-Asian hate. She says that \"because politics is local and the mayor is high profile, a person of Asian descent representing all of their municipality sends an important signal that a person who happens to be Asian can represent a diverse municipality, can be trusted to do that, can be held accountable at the same time.\" And it's not just about deterrence. OuYang says that having AAPIs in city offices helps advocates like her resolve cases when they do arise, especially because of the oversight municipal governments have over their city's police forces. She recalls one case from 2006 in Queens, New York when two white men hurled racial slurs and physically assaulted four Asian American men. The attack was so vicious, two of the victims and two arresting officers were hospitalized with injuries. OuYang says that then-City Council Member John Liu, a Democrat who did not even represent the neighborhood where the attack occurred, was instrumental in bringing attention to the crime and pressuring the city and NYPD to take the incident seriously. Liu now serves in the New York State Senate, but at the time was a trailblazer as the first AAPI elected to the city council. Between serving on the city council and in the state senate, he was the city's comptroller for one term before unsuccessfully running for mayor in 2013. The most well-known AAPI mayoral candidate this year was Andrew Yang, who harnessed high name recognition earned during his 2020 presidential campaign to enter the New York mayoral race in January. Between 2019 and 2020, New York saw the largest increase in anti-Asian hate crimes of any big city, with a surge of 833%, while hate crimes in the city overall dropped by 38% according to data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. But after a series of gaffes and revelations that his history of voting in local elections was sparse, Yang came in fourth in the June Democratic primary, meaning New York will not be swearing in its first AAPI mayor next year. But three other big cities still might. In addition to Wu in Boston, Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Aftab Pureval came out on top in Cincinnati's six-way nonpartisan mayoral primary in May, earning 39.1% of primary votes.  Pureval will face David Mann in November's general election to replace term-limited incumbent John Cranley \u2014 both Mann and Cranley are white. Mann currently sits on the Cincinnati City Council and served as mayor from 1980 to 1982 and in 1991. In Seattle, former City Council President Bruce Harrell is running for the seat he held for five days as acting mayor in 2017, when then-Mayor Ed Murray resigned in the midst of sexual abuse allegations. In a July poll conducted by Change Research independent of any campaign, Harrell leads with 20% of votes, the most of any of the 15 candidates running in August's nonpartisan primary to replace incumbent Jenny Durkan, who is white and declined to run for reelection. According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, anti-Asian hate crimes surged in Seattle by 33% while hate crimes overall increased by 11% from 2019 to 2020. Cincinnati has a much smaller AAPI population at around 6,000 residents, compared to Boston's over 67,000 and Seattle's over 127,000 AAPIs. New York has the country's largest AAPI population, with over 1.2 million AAPIs. Christine Chen is the co-founder and executive director of APIAVote, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase civic engagement and political participation among AAPIs. She says that it is critical for AAPIs to participate in local politics because local elected officials are the public servants closest to their communities. She points out that local decision makers govern matters that impact their communities' daily lives, such as road closures and schools. An added benefit, she believes, is that community members are more likely to bump into local elected officials on the street than they are to encounter any other politicians. Chen is excited to see Wu, Harrell and Pureval run because their candidacies will get more AAPIs involved in politics. \"We know that when Asian American Pacific Islander candidates run for office, the first thing that they do is tap into their own family and friends network, which will include the Asian American Pacific Islander community,\" Chen says. \"So they are educating those that typically would not have focused on politics or the elections, but because now they know someone that is running for office they are more inclined to pay attention, to donate, to volunteer and participate.\" In turn, OuYang believes that this increased participation and greater visibility will continue to dismantle the dangerous perpetual foreigner stereotype. Bruce Harrell is \"proudly biracial,\" he tells NPR in an email. His father was African American and his mother Japanese American. He fondly calls the Black and AAPI Seattle communities in which he grew up his \"home base.\" In explaining his decision to run for mayor after retiring from the city council in 2019, Harrell is blunt. \"I will not lie that one of the reasons I decided to run was to confront this spike in hatred and do whatever I can to build trust,\" says the former city council president. He says building trust is especially important to him, as Harrell's mother, Rose Kobata, was incarcerated by the federal government during World War II in Idaho's Minidoka internment camp. \"My mother's life was shaped by the trauma of government sponsored hate and incarceration,\" he says. \"Her family lost their home and small business, and had to build from nothing.\" Today, Harrell describes his mother as his \"strongest advocate and teacher,\" and believes that the memory of her resilience helps keep him going. \"While she was a remarkably positive person, her story left an indelible lesson to never take anything for granted, to excel and achieve, and to never allow hate and bias to manifest in our culture and community,\" he says. Kobata's internment is one example of a long history of municipal leaders playing an outsized role in the oppression of AAPI communities. Charlotte Brooks, a professor of history at Baruch College who specializes in Asian American political history, says that local political support for a national Japanese incarceration policy came from cities many would not expect to have had substantial support for such a racist policy. She points to Fletcher Bowron, who served as mayor of Los Angeles from 1938 to 1953, as an example of a big city mayor propagating the perpetual foreigner stereotype by wholeheartedly and very vocally pushing for the internment of Japanese Americans. To his credit, Brooks qualifies, \"as big of a terrible jerk as he was, he apologized for this after the war, which is something that very few politicians did.\" Brooks also gives the example of wartime New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia, \"who made a name for supposedly being a progressive and much more integrationist and pro African American than previous mayors and definitely mayors of other cities. And he basically talked about not wanting Japanese Americans to resettle in his city \u2014 if they weren't safe for the West Coast, they weren't safe for New York.\" Ellen Wu, associate professor of history and a former director of the Asian American Studies program at Indiana University Bloomington, agrees that mayors have long influenced outcomes for AAPI communities. Regarding La Guardia, she adds that not all was hopeless for Japanese Americans needing resettlement. The \"Japanese American Citizens League and some of their allies really worked to intervene and have conversations with the mayor and try to smooth the transition for Japanese Americans wanting to move to New York City,\" she says. Back on the West Coast, she incriminates San Francisco, a city now known for its Chinatown and large AAPI population. \"San Francisco was a leader in the Chinese and then Asian exclusion movement in the 19th century and the early 20th century,\" the historian says. \"For example, segregated schools for 'Oriental' children. And certainly we think of San Francisco Chinatown as the quintessential Chinatown. But the whole reason it exists is basically because of racial segregation and wanting to contain what people thought of as a 'Chinese menace' in really close quarters.\" All three candidates \u2014 Michelle Wu, Harrell and Pureval \u2014 identify as progressive Democrats. The two historians quickly drew parallels between these contemporary progressives and the underrecognized history of progressive politics in AAPI communities. \"There was a lot of talk of Asian American conservatism in the eighties,\" says Brooks. \"But if you look locally, you don't see it nearly as much.\" In fact, the history of AAPI progressivism begins even further back with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \"What drew Chinese Americans in particular and Japanese Americans into politics was the New Deal,\" Brooks says. In the 1930s, these communities were in desperate need of decent housing and jobs while paying higher taxes and receiving almost no services in return. Brooks concludes that they \"did not run from progressivism ... they just wanted to get the garbage taken away.\" Members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and their allies attend a rally on the National Mall on May 31, 2021.

Members and allies of the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community are speaking out in response to a rise in anti-Asian violence in the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic. And Ellen Wu says that AAPI communities have been mobilized in political and social advocacy for longer than many realize. She says that it is especially true when considering the little-known historical parallels between AAPI activism and Black activism. She argues that similarities in the way both groups were treated in the 20th century, such as suffering public degradation, assaults and lynchings, meant \"Asian exclusion in a lot of ways was like a cousin of Jim Crow.\" It's no surprise then, she says, that the two communities often had similar goals, such as fighting to dismantle the same systemic barriers to equality that long suppressed both groups. Among these barriers she lists \"workplace discrimination, housing segregation, school segregation, voting rights, the filibuster.\" And she is quick to also point out that when activists first began using the term \"Asian American\" in the 1960s, \"they had a clear political vision, which was both anti-racist and anti-imperialist.\" As for the present, she says, \"I think today we're seeing again this kind of this burst of political energy in the United States that is among Asian Americans, very much inspired, I think, by the Movement for Black Lives.\" When Aftab Pureval ran for office for the first time in 2016, he realized that something was clouding his chances at victory. \"Oftentimes Asian Americans have proudly ethnic names. And so when name ID, particularly for local races, is so critically important, if the electorate is uncomfortable with pronouncing your name or uncomfortable with spelling your name or is just unfamiliar with your name and the origins of your name, that can be really difficult to overcome,\" says Pureval, whose first name is Persian and translates into English as \"sunshine.\" \"I really relied heavily on humor,\" he says. \"When you see 'Aftab' on a yard sign, a lot of people don't immediately think, oh, that's a human being, right? People sometimes would think, oh, that's an insurance company advertisement.\" So, he got creative. \"In our campaign advertisements,\" he recalls, \"every time I said my name, a yellow duck puppet would pop up and say 'Aftab' in the Aflac voice.\" Ducks aside, Pureval is also proud of his campaign because of the visibility it has given to AAPIs in Ohio, a state with a population that is about 3% Asian American or Pacific Islander. \"When I was growing up in Beavercreek, Ohio, in the '80s and '90s, there just weren't a lot of AAPI role models who were in politics,\" he says. When describing his own identity, he proudly states that he's \"half Tibetan, half Indian. I actually have a Persian first name, but I'm all Ohio.\" In looking to the future, he's optimistic. \"I won't be the last Asian American candidate to run and win or lose,\" he says. \"There is a whole generation of folks behind me who look like me, who are passionate, who are committed to public service, are ready to lead and will one day win and lead.\" OuYang also eagerly looks ahead to such a future. \"It is imperative that Asian Americans run for elected office so they can play an important role in government, in the public, demystifying many of these stereotypes and bridging that gap from fear to education, from fear to understanding and from fear to integration so there is a peaceful transition of this country in 2045,\" says the civil rights attorney, referencing the year the United States is expected by some estimates to become a majority-minority nation. And Chen sees another welcome impact of Pureval's candidacy in expanding the public's notion of what a candidate of AAPI descent can look like. \"For the longest time, Asian Americans were always seen as East Asian, mostly coming from Chinese, Korean or Japanese descent,\" says the APIAVote executive director. \"The reality is, in the last 20 years, that has really diversified and our stories are different, but at the same time similar.\" Brooks makes it a point to note that the population of AAPIs prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was mostly of East Asian descent. Today, the umbrella term \"Asian American Pacific Islander\" encompasses a much broader swath of Americans, who have varying political leanings. In general, AAPIs lean left, according to data from APIAVote. But disaggregating the data reveals that AAPIs are not a political monolith. Today, Indian Americans are the most Democratic while Vietnamese Americans are the most Republican, and Chinese Americans have the highest rate of identifying as political independents. Regardless of party, Chen believes that more Americans should embrace local politics as an escape from the divisiveness of national politics. \"I think by paying attention to local elected officials and the elections that are being held this year, it's a way for our community overall as Americans to be able to heal, because I think and I really hope and believe that the dialogue can be a lot more healing, and the debates hopefully are not as divisive, especially when you really have to live and work with those individuals on a day to day basis,\" Chen says. \"And so that's why my belief is that part of our healing process in American politics is going to have to happen at the local level.\" As Pureval says, \"there's no Republican or Democratic way to fill a pothole.\" Daniel Lam is an intern on NPR's National Desk.",

It was remarkably similar to a sentiment expressed by another Republican president about political correctness nearly 30 years earlier. When former President Donald Trump announced his lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and Google this month, he used a word that has become a familiar signal in modern politics. \"We're demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well,\" Trump said in a speech. That term, \"canceling,\" has become central to the present-day debate over the consequences of speech and who gets to exact them. It has ascended from minor skirmishes on Twitter to the highest office in the country, and it actually mirrors a cultural conversation that started three decades ago. \"This is a power struggle of different groups or forces in society, I think, at its most basic,\" says Nicole Holliday, an assistant professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"And this is the same case with political correctness that used to get boiled down to, well, 'Do you have a right to be offended if it means I don't have the right to say something?' \" The idea of being \"politically correct,\" having the most morally upstanding opinion on complicated subjects and the least offensive language with which to articulate it, gained popularity in the 1990s before people on the outside weaponized it against the community it came from \u2014 just like the idea of \"canceling\" someone today. \"I do think that 'cancel' in particular is something that was invented sort of by young people, and it actually just kind of means boycott, right? It means 'Do not support this thing,' \" Holliday says. Now, she says, \"conservatives have picked it up not to just mean boycott, but rather to say: Our value system is under threat by these people who want to [de-]monetize or de-platform us because we have unpopular opinions.\" But it's not just conservatives figures who think cancel culture has gone too far. The fear of being \"canceled\" has caused some everyday people to be more aware of \u2014 and at times, concerned about \u2014 what they say and post online. So how did an effort to hold people accountable for their actions become politicized and get so out of control? To understand the uproar over cancel culture, it may help to examine the past. Ruth Perry has seen the long arc of these kinds of debates. She's a professor emeritus of literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked for almost four decades and founded the women's studies department in 1984. Back in her early career, Perry says, she ran with a crowd of idealists. \"We cared about the Earth, we cared about ecology, we cared about treating animals correctly,\" she says. \"We cared about sexism, we cared about white supremacy \u2014 all these things.\" Perry says her peers would use the phrase \"politically correct\" to tease each other over whether their actions lined up with their ideals. \"Somebody would say, 'Would it be politically correct if we had a hamburger?' \u2014 somebody who was a vegetarian would say that. Or somebody who was a feminist might say, 'It may not be politically correct, but I think he's really hot,' [about] some sexist movie star or something,\" says Perry. \"Politically correct\" was a kind of in-joke among American leftists \u2014 something you called a fellow leftist when you thought the person was being self-righteous. \"The term was always used ironically,\" Perry says, \"always calling attention to possible dogmatism.\" Then, right-wing think tanks and conservatives started to use the term as a form of attack in both the media and academia. \"It felt like, 'Oh, my God, they're using this against us,' \" Perry says. \"And they're acting as if this term really was a kind of litmus test for political correctness, which it never had been.\" A search of newspapers and magazines in the archive Nexis shows just how rapidly the term expanded beyond its original scene. In 1989, the phrase \"politically correct\" appeared fewer than 250 times in print. By 1994, the archive shows more than 10,000 hits. The idea was everywhere: from comedy shows like Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect to cartoons like Beavis and Butt-Head and even current events shows like Firing Line on PBS. This national obsession didn't just bubble up organically. \"It is an industry,\" John Wilson, author of the 1995 book The Myth of Political Correctness, says. \"There are all these right-wing foundations and books that were published that made a lot of money promoting this idea.\" He adds that the word \"myth\" in the title of his book is important to understanding how it became a phenomenon. \"A myth is not a falsehood: It doesn't mean it's a lie. It doesn't mean everything is fabricated,\" he says. \"It means that it's a story. And so what happened in the '90s is, people, with political correctness, they took certain \u2014 sometimes true \u2014 anecdotes and they created a web, a story out of them, a myth that there was this vast repression of conservative voices on college campuses.\" Wilson says there were grains of truth to the conservative argument \u2014 isolated examples of conflicts and protests, often on college campuses, and real cases of people getting punished or fired \u2014 but that those isolated cases got magnified into a sweeping national narrative that the right used to claim conservatives were being silenced. And by claiming victimization, Wilson says, conservatives were able to use the term \"political correctness\" as a bludgeon to hammer the left, a lot like the way the phrase \"cancel culture\" is used today. Then, like now, local debates that might have stayed largely unknown beyond college newspapers suddenly became national news. For example, in 1988, NPR and several other news organizations reported on a fight over Stanford University's freshman requirements. The name of the course at the center of the controversy was \"Western Culture,\" which the students wanted replaced with a more multicultural class, Wilson says. People like Education Secretary William Bennett \u2014 a Republican \u2014 took the student protests as a broader attack. \"Right from the beginning, this was an assault on Western culture and Western civilization,\" he said in a 1988 PBS interview. By 1991, this panic had reached all the way to the president of the United States. President George H.W. Bush waves to a crowd of over 60,000 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Mich., on May 4, 1991, as he arrives to deliver the University of Michigan's commencement speech.\n                \n                    \n                    Greg Gibson/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption President George H.W. Bush waves to a crowd of over 60,000 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Mich., on May 4, 1991, as he arrives to deliver the University of Michigan's commencement speech. \"We find free speech under assault throughout the United States, including on some college campuses,\" said then-President George H.W. Bush in his commencement address at the University of Michigan in 1991. \"The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land.\" Bush went on: \"The disputants treat sheer force \u2014 getting their foes punished or expelled, for instance \u2014 as a substitute for the power of ideas.\" Another Republican president, Donald Trump, who denounced political correctness during his 2016 presidential campaign, made the same argument against cancel culture almost 30 years later at the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it,\" Trump said during a speech. Discussion about public cancellations increased in the years leading up to the 2020 election, and that points to something else that these two battles in the culture wars share. \"There tend to be these flare-ups or panics about political correctness in moments of institutional transformation or instability,\" historian Moira Weigel says, \"and I think it tends to be a way that certain groups claim authority in a changing public sphere.\" In those political correctness wars of the '90s, college campuses were becoming more diverse, and Weigel says something similar is taking place right now. \"It usually happens in response to movements for racial and gender and sexuality justice, and I think it's no accident that it's with the rise of BLM [Black Lives Matter] that you see it come back again as a big media theme,\" she says. Before the entire country started to weigh in on a single person's actions, \"canceling\" started out on a much smaller scale. Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, says \"cancel culture\" builds on a process of accountability that has unfolded in Black communities for years. But, she takes issue with the description of \"canceling\" as a part of our broader culture. \"Canceling is what comes out of Black discourse \u2014 it's what comes out of Black queer discourse \u2014 but the assignment of 'culture' to that makes it a label that's big enough to be slapped on anyone and anything,\" she says. \"And that is where the weaponization of what is otherwise accountability really takes off.\" If this had remained something that just stuck within Black communities, within Latinx communities, then this wouldn't really be a story. Meredith Clark Clark thinks one reason that cancel culture has become such a hot national topic is people in powerful positions are unaccustomed to having to answer to marginalized people who, through social media, have greater access to them than ever. \"That's what it's all about,\" Clark says. \"If this had remained something that just stuck within Black communities, within Latinx communities, then this wouldn't really be a story.\" \"But because it has crossed over,\" she continues, \"now this becomes newsworthy, and it becomes something that is positioned as something that every everyday person should fear.\" Undoubtedly, the biggest difference between discussions of political correctness in the '90s and cancel culture today is the way social media creates access to both public and private individuals and puts their dialogue on equal footing. Jon Ronson has been studying that transition for a decade and wrote about the way private individuals have been disproportionately punished for minor transgressions on social media in his 2015 book So You've Been Publicly Shamed. He thinks the issue with cancel culture is not so much one of right versus left, but with the idea that private individuals should be judged in the same way as public figures. \"The term 'cancel culture' has become this ridiculously catchall term where a private individual who did nothing much wrong, whose life was very heavily impacted by an overzealous social media shaming, is suddenly put into the same basket as a provocateur newspaper columnist,\" Ronson says. Clark's studies illuminate a similar problem. She says that when you look at the small percentage of the U.S. population that is on Twitter \u2014 42% of adults between 18 and 29 and only 27% of adults between 30 and 49, as of February 2021 \u2014 you understand how out of proportion the narrative of cancel culture is. \"Given the tiny, tiny portion of the American population in particular that uses Twitter, we're not really talking about a lot of people who are clamoring to cancel others,\" she says. \"It sounds loud because it gets amplified. The Twitter commentary gets amplified by mainstream media; it gets picked up in discussions [with people] that otherwise would not have been privy to what was happening online.\" Ronson thinks one way to alleviate the debate over cancel culture is to better understand how powerful social media \u2014 and our actions on it \u2014 can be. \"This is a very new weapon that we have. On Twitter, we're like children crawling towards guns,\" he says. As with any weapon, the best advice for navigating social media may be to proceed with caution and think before you shoot. \"I just think it's up to every individual on social media to be curious and patient. ... It's absurd to think that you know everything about somebody just because of one poorly worded tweet, and we are judging people that way,\" Ronson says. Ronson says he remembers growing up in a culture of racism, misogyny and homophobia in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and '80s and how the idea of political correctness was used to address those issues. In the cases of both political correctness and cancel culture, he thinks some degree of correction is necessary, but what we're witnessing may be overshooting the mark. \"We're living in this very binary world,\" he says, \"and in this world, people on the right are saying, 'You know, we are being silenced by a woke mob,' and people on the left are saying, 'It's not happening \u2014 we're just holding people accountable.' \" The truth, Ronson says, \"is somewhere in the middle.\" Mia Venkat, Noah Caldwell and Patrick Jarenwattananon produced and edited this story for broadcast.

Despite the Trump campaign's best efforts, the Supreme Court--aided by some 50 rulings from the lower courts \u2014 left it to the vote counters, state officials,  and the vote certification by Congress to determine the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts and most, if not all, other members of the court likely were relieved not to be involved in the political imbroglio. The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her before Ginsburg was even in the ground, and the GOP rush to confirm Barrett days before the election could have made for a fraught term, but on the surface, at least, it did not. The one exception to that came on the subject of religious rights during the pandemic lockdown. For months,  the court  voted 5 to 4 to uphold state and local rules limiting attendance at houses of worship, with the Chief Justice casting the fifth and decisive vote to uphold the limits in the name of state powers to regulate public health and safety. But Barrett  in early February cast her vote the other way, flipping the outcome. Even that, however, proved a relative ripple at the court, in part because Barrett, turned out to be, according to several justices, a most congenial colleague. Until almost the end  of the term,  the court's conservative supermajority held its fire, managing to achieve consensus with the liberals by deciding very little. The court upheld Obamacare for a third time, but did it on technical grounds,  ruling that the states challenging the law had not been harmed and thus had no legal standing to sue. It ruled unanimously that a high school cheerleader couldn't be punished by the school for cursing online about the team and the school, but the court did not ban schools from punishing all online student speech. And in a major religion case, the court ruled unanimously in favor of  a Catholic group that refused, on religious grounds, to consider LGBTQ couples for foster care--a refusal that the city of Philadelphia maintained was a violation of the non-discrimination provision in its contract with the charity. But the decision was far narrower than expected. The court's conservative dominance, however, was on full display on the last day of the term  when the conservative supermajority teamed up in  two thunderbolt opinions. In a major voting rights case, the court split along conservative/liberal lines to further gut the landmark 1965  Voting Rights Act by making it much easier for states to enact restrictive voting laws and much harder for voting rights advocates--including the Biden Administration--to challenge laws that are increasingly being passed in Republican-dominated states. On the same day,  in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court sided with rich donors in California who claimed they had a First Amendment right not to disclose to the state attorney general's office, their large contributions to nonprofits. The decision did more than invalidate a California law that the state enacted to monitor nonprofits for fraudulent behavior. It appeared to lay the groundwork for overturning election disclosure laws previously upheld by the Supreme Court. Should the court overturn those earlier rulings, it would mean Congress would be hamstrung in regulating campaign cash and the public would have no way to know who is financing political candidates. In another major conservative ruling just days earlier, the court, once again ruled against labor unions, this time tightening the leash on union representatives and their ability to organize farmworkers in California and elsewhere. By a 6-3 vote along ideological lines, the court's conservatives  struck down a law enacted nearly 50 years ago after a campaign by famed union organizer Cesar Chavez. It allowed union organizers to enter farms to speak to workers during nonworking hours. The court said the law amounted to a government taking of land in violation of the constitution. Critics said the decision could also call  into question other  laws, including those that allow health and safety inspectors onto private property. The court has already agreed to hear a major challenge to the  Roe v. Wade abortion decision, and a major case testing restrictions on the right to carry a concealed gun outside the home. Also pending is a major challenge to affirmative action in higher education, a challenge that asks the court to overturn more than forty years of precedent in a case from Harvard University, until now held up as the model for affirmative action in the court's prior cases, and an institution where four of the justices  were students,  three taught, and one served as dean of the law school.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks at a news conference about banning federal funding for the teaching of critical race theory. Last month, Republican lawmakers decried critical race theory, an academic approach that examines how race and racism function in American institutions. \"Folks, we're in a cultural warfare today,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said at a news conference alongside six other members of the all-Republican House Freedom Caucus. \"Critical race theory asserts that people with white skin are inherently racist, not because of their actions, words or what they actually believe in their heart \u2014 but by virtue of the color of their skin.\" Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., added: \"Democrats want to teach our children to hate each other.\" Many Republican lawmakers, who are fighting what they label as the teaching of critical race theory in schools, contend it divides Americans. Democrats and their allies maintain progress is unlikely without examining the root causes of disparity in the country, although they push back on the idea that critical race theory itself \u2014 a scholarly undertaking \u2014 is being taught on the K-12 level. The issue is shaping up to be a major cultural battle ahead of next year's midterm elections. Academics, particularly legal scholars, have studied critical race theory for decades. But its main entry into the partisan fray came in 2020, when former President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning federal contractors from conducting certain racial sensitivity trainings. It was challenged in court, and President Biden rescinded the order the day he took office. Since then, the issue has taken hold as a rallying cry among some Republican lawmakers who argue the approach unfairly forces students to consider race and racism. \"A stand-in for this larger anxiety\" Andrew Hartman, a history professor at Illinois State University, described the battle over critical race theory as typical of the culture wars, where \"the issue itself is not always the thing driving the controversy.\" \"I'm not really sure that the conservatives right now know what it is or know its history,\" said Hartman, author of A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars. He said critical race theory posits that racism is endemic to American society through history and that, consequently, Americans have to think about institutions like the justice system or schools through the perspective of race and racism. However, he said, \"conservatives, since the 1960s, have increasingly defined American society as a colorblind society, in the sense that maybe there were some problems in the past but American society corrected itself and now we have these laws and institutions that are meritocratic and anybody, regardless of race, can achieve the American dream.\" Confronted by the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer, as well as the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 curriculum, which roots American history in its racist past, Hartman said many Americans want simple answers. \"And so critical race theory becomes a stand-in for this larger anxiety about people being upset about persistent racism,\" he said. Legislative action States such as Idaho and Oklahoma have adopted laws that limit how public school teachers can talk about race in the classroom, and Republican legislatures in nearly half a dozen states have advanced similar bills that target teachings that some educators say they don't teach anyway. There's movement on the national level too. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has introduced the Combating Racist Training in the Military Act, a bill that would prohibit the armed forces and academics at the Defense Department from promoting \"anti-American and racist theories,\" which, according to the bill's text, includes critical race theory.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said critical race theory \"brings division\" and \"advances hate\" during a news conference on Capitol Hill on May 12.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said critical race theory \"brings division\" and \"advances hate\" during a news conference on Capitol Hill on May 12. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would prevent federal dollars from being spent on what he labels critical race theory in schools or government offices. \"The ideas behind critical race theory and [its] implementation is creating this oppressor-oppressed divide amongst our people,\" Donalds told NPR. \"And so no matter how you feel about the history of our country \u2014 as a Black man, I think our history has actually been quite awful, I mean, that's without question \u2014 but you also have to take into account the progression of our country, especially over the last 60 to 70 years.\" Donalds said the country's history, including its ills, should be taught, but that critical race theory causes more problems than solutions. \"It only causes more divisions, which doesn't help our union become the more perfect union,\" he said. A post-racial country? Nearly half of the speakers at the Republican news conference in May invoked Martin Luther King Jr., expressing their desire to be judged \"by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.\" But Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a sociology professor at Duke University, said King's dream was about the future. \"He didn't say, 'We are now in a colorblind society,' \" he said. Bonilla-Silva, whose book Racism Without Racists critiques the notion that America is now \"colorblind,\" says he too shares King's dream, \"but in order for us to get to the promised land of colorblindness, we have to go through race. It's the opposite of what these folks are arguing.\" He says the idea that American society is post-racial is nonsense. \"We are not, because we watched the video of George Floyd, and we are not because we have the data on income inequality, on wealth inequality, on housing inequality,\" he said. As an example, Bonilla-Silva noted the opposition of whites to affirmative action in the post-civil rights era. \"Many whites said things such as, 'I'm not a racist. I believe in equal opportunity, which is why I oppose affirmative action, because affirmative action is discrimination in reverse,' \" he noted. \"That statement only works if one believes that discrimination has ended,\" he added. \"But because it has not ended, claiming that you oppose affirmative action because it's presumably discrimination in reverse ends up justifying the racial status quo and the inequalities.\" Motivator for the midterms? The fight over Republicans' rebranding of critical race theory will likely continue to be a heated issue ahead of next year's midterm elections. Although November 2022 seems a long way away, Christine Matthews, president of Bellwether Research and a public opinion pollster, says pushback to anti-racism teaching is exactly the kind of issue that could maintain traction among certain voters. \"I think it's just one more addition to the culture war that the Republicans really want to fight and it's what they want to make the 2022 midterms about,\" she said. Matthews noted that Biden's approval ratings, in the mid-50s, are significantly higher than Trump's were throughout his term in office, \"so Republicans are wanting to make this about othering the Democrats and making them seem as extreme and threatening to white culture as possible.\" \"If Republicans can make [voters] feel threatened and their place in society threatened in terms of white culture and political correctness and cancel culture, that's a visceral and emotional issue, and I do think it could impact turnout.\" These issues could be used to galvanize conservative voters and increase their numbers at the polls. \"We have seen evidence that the Republican base is responding much more to threats on cultural issues, even to some degree more than economic issues,\" Matthews said. But Rep. Donalds said the Republican Party doesn't need to rally the base to get it to show up to vote. \"When it comes to the '22 elections, we don't need additional ammunition,\" he said, pointing to what he views as a list of failures from the Biden administration, from budget and taxes to shutting down the Keystone pipeline. Doug Heye, the former communications director for the Republican National Committee, said in some ways, the attempts to mandate what schools can or can't teach highlights just how far the GOP under Trump has moved away from traditionally conservative principles \u2014 like wanting less federal involvement in schools. \"A lot of what we might have described as conservative policy five years ago, 10 years ago, now just isn't that case,\" he said. \"If we're pushing what is a current priority for the Trump base, that's defined as conservative, whether or not that's a federal top-down policy or not. So the old issues of federalism has really been upended under Donald Trump's reign as the leader of the party.\" Heye said at this point, critical race theory is still politically a \"niche issue\" among conservative voters, but he expects it to play a larger role in state assemblies, governors races and school boards rather than in national politics. He said he believes it's an issue some candidates will raise \"to further rile up the base that is already pretty riled.\" \"So the question will be then for Republicans: What else are they really emphasizing?\" he said. From a strategy perspective, Matthews says she thinks it will all come down to messaging. \"The Republicans are trying to make it a bad thing,\" she said, \"but I feel like if the Democrats got the messaging right, they could make it a good thing.\" Both sides have a little more than a year to do that.",

Tim Scott of South Carolina walks through the U.S. Capitol before delivering the GOP response to President Biden's address to a joint session of Congress. President Biden's first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday and the official Republican response that followed offered two contrasting perspectives on race in America. Biden's remarks, on the eve of his 100th day in office, came during a renewed moment of reckoning over race and justice after a former Minneapolis police officer was convicted in the murder of George Floyd, and as subsequent fatal shootings by law enforcement gripped the nation. The president issued an urgent call for action, declaring that \"we have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans.\" He called on the country to come together to \"root out systemic racism that plagues America\" in myriad ways, a promise that echoes back to Biden's campaign pledges that led a multiracial coalition to vote him and Vice President Harris into office. Speaking shortly after Biden, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., drew on his lived experiences to rebut Biden's agenda in a wide-ranging speech. Scott, who is one of only 11 Black lawmakers to have served in the Senate and the only Republican currently among them, repeated that he has \"experienced the pain of discrimination,\" including his own troubling encounters with law enforcement. But he also declared that \"America is not a racist country\" and warned that \"it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present.\" Harris, the first person of color to serve as vice president, was asked to respond to Scott's statement on ABC's Good Morning America.  \"No, I don't think America is a racist country,\" Harris said. \"But we also do have to speak truth about the history of racism in our country and its existence today.\" Leah Wright Rigueur, a historian and the author of the book The Loneliness of the Black Republican, said that in many ways there was a lot of overlap between the speeches that Biden and Scott gave as it relates to the issue of race and policing. Biden talked broadly about the experiences that Black people in this country have in encounters with law enforcement, while Scott discussed his personal experiences as a Black man. She said that the place where the speeches diverged is in the conclusions they draw from those experiences. \"The clear difference came at the end, where Tim Scott was unwilling to say that we're talking about white supremacy. We're talking about a racism that goes deep in this country and that we have to address head-on,\" she said. \"And so that's where there is a clear difference. And I think the juxtaposition of a white man calling out white supremacy and a Black man unwilling to do so is actually quite striking.\" Part of the reason why those conclusions may have been so different is their intended audiences. Biden's joint address was his first opportunity to lay out his ambitious agenda for government to the American people amid a deeply polarizing moment in politics to which he offers himself as an antidote. Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist from South Carolina, said Biden gave an \"inclusive\" speech that did not lose sight of \"who butters his bread,\" namely the important and impatient coalition of voters that elected him \u2014 including the Black voters who played a key role in the president's 2020 primary and general election victories as well as in delivering Democrats the control of the Senate. \"So often people forget about the people that brought them to the dance when they move from campaign to governance, and [Biden] stays laser-focused on that as relates to delivering on an agenda,\" Seawright said. Scott's speech, meanwhile, was aimed at a Republican Party seeking to define itself after the Trump presidency, Wright Rigueur and Seawright agreed. \"I think there are people who do not look like Tim Scott, but share the same politics with Tim Scott. They look for him to be kind of the North Star on these issues,\" Seawright said. \"The fact that he could not take a big moment like last night, speak truth to power and talk about these issues in such a way that they do not seem like they are partisan issues ... as a Black man from the South and a Republican, he really missed an opportunity, I think.\" Scott's speech came as he is playing a leading role in bipartisan negotiations over policing legislation. In his speech, Scott discussed the police reform bill that he introduced last summer, aimed at creating incentives for local law enforcement agencies to reform their policies, but that did not gain support from Democratic lawmakers. He said that \"my friends across the aisle seemed to want the issue more than they wanted a solution.\" But the issue gained traction when much of the public was galvanized after Floyd's murder was captured on video by a bystander, sparking nationwide protests. During his speech, Biden urged lawmakers to pass policing overhaul legislation by the first anniversary of Floyd's death next month. On Thursday, Scott was set to meet with Democratic negotiators over the prospects for a bipartisan deal on police reform legislation. He also met with members of Floyd's family. Wright Rigueur said that on this issue, Scott is walking a tightrope. \"We know that Tim Scott is actually invested in many of the provisions that are included in these different versions of the bill. But we also know that Tim Scott has to mediate what his party is pushing for,\" she said. \"So he has to do double duty.\" Biden is striking his own version of that balance as he seeks to unify the country in a time of intense racial division. He rejects calls on the left to \"defund the police\" and casts himself as an ally of law enforcement while pushing an agenda to reduce systemic racism and deadly encounters between police and Black Americans. When Biden referred to the \"knee of injustice\" in his address, he quickly followed with this: \"The vast majority of men and women wearing a uniform and a badge serve our communities and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want \u2014 I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\"",

In the late 1960s, a man named Floyd McKissick began building his dream: a brand-new community in rural North Carolina, on a plot of land a third of the size of Manhattan \u2014 complete with factories, an airport, a bustling city center and tens of thousands of residents living in Brady Bunch-esque houses. The twist? It would be be built by Black business and enterprise: a capital for Black capitalism, as the New Yorker called it. This week on the show, we dive deep into Soul City: one of the most audacious (and controversial) experiments in Black capitalism. For a little while, it had the backing of some of the most powerful people in the United States, and it almost happened. At the time, the experiment was widely covered and debated in the news. And yet, today, very few people have heard of it. To learn more about this would-be utopia, we hit up Thomas Healy, the author of a new book called Soul City: Race, Equality, and the Lost Dream of an American Utopia.Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Can you tell us about Floyd McKissick? He was a major civil rights leader during the 1960s. His career actually began in the 1950s. He was born in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, in 1922. He served in World War II, was awarded a Purple Heart and graduated from Morehouse a few years after the war. He went to law school, and then, he set up shop as a lawyer in Durham. He was primarily interested in civil rights, and he gradually became one of the most important civil rights leaders in North Carolina. For a period of time in the 1960s, he was the head of the Congress of Racial Equality, which at the time was one of the big five civil rights groups. And he spoke at the March on Washington, and along with Martin Luther King and Stokely Carmichael, he led the March Against Fear in 1966. And he was one of the most prominent voices advocating economic equality for Black people during the 1960s. Thousands of marchers assemble for the last leg of the Mississippi March in 1966. In the front row, from left are: Mrs. Juanita Abernathy, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Dr. Martin Luther King, James Meredith, Stokely Carmichael of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and Floyd B.

In the front row, from left are: Mrs. Juanita Abernathy, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Dr. Martin Luther King, James Meredith, Stokely Carmichael of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and Floyd B. McKissick, national director of the Congress of Racial Equality. For those who aren't familiar with CORE, what did the group \u2014 and McKissick \u2014 want to acomplish? In the mid '60s, CORE became known as one of the more militant civil rights organizations. It shifted the focus from integration to the problems in Black neighborhoods and the issues of poverty, the lack of adequate housing and lack of economic opportunity. And, you know, McKissick was really sort of leading that; he was one of the figures who really spoke strongly about, you know, the importance of economic equality to the Black freedom struggle. And when Black power became the rallying cry in the summer of 1966, CORE became one of the leading proponents of Black power. They basically thought that there were six elements to Black power, economic self-sufficiency, political representation, improved self-image, the development of Black leadership, the enforcement of federal laws and the mobilization of Black consumers. But McKissick thought that the most important aspect of Black power was economic power. He said, if you don't have any bread in your pocket, you know, what good is it to you to be able to sit at a hamburger counter? So that was really the goal: to find a way for Black people to share in the wealth of America, and to share in the wealth that's generated in the capitalist system. And McKissick believed that it makes sense to work within that system because, I think he thought you had a better chance of working within that system than trying to overturn that system. How did McKissick come to believe that there should be a Black-run city in the U.S.? He did say many times that the idea came to him after World War II, when he and his Army unit were helping to rebuild French villages that had been destroyed by shelling. He described watching French planners and engineers put their cities back together again. And he had this idea that, if people in Europe could rebuild their cities, why couldn't Black people in America build new cities from scratch? That might have been the moment when it sort of crystallized for him. But it seemed to me that a lot of the motivation and the inspiration for Soul City came out of experiences that he had when he was growing up in Asheville, North Carolina, and saw racial injustice around him and experienced it himself. He described himself feeling like a Black boy in a white land. And I think that he wanted to create a place where he wouldn't feel like a stranger, where he would feel at home and welcome. Now, that doesn't mean that he wanted it to be separatist. You know, it doesn't mean that he didn't want to be around people of other races. But I think that he wanted to feel like he belonged. Everybody wants to feel like they belong. And I think that a large part of the impetus behind Soul City was the desire not to feel like you're a second class citizen, not to feel like you're Black first and American second. You wrote in your book that McKissick never envisioned Soul City to be just for Black folks; he wanted it to be a multiracial town. But he also just didn't envision it as a town for just any Black folks. What were the specifications that he wanted in the residents of Soul City? The requirements were more for the people who worked at Soul City than for the people who lived in Soul City. This was a serious undertaking, and he needed serious people to be involved in it. When he was recruiting a staff, he was looking for people with the qualifications they needed: engineers, planners, people with a background in building social systems and health care, and accountants. He needed people with very specific skills, because he had big ambitions. But as far as who would live in Soul City, he didn't want this to be a community only for well-educated people or people of a certain income level. Most of the people that he envisioned living and working in Soul City would be involved in industry. They would be factory workers, business people, from all walks of life. But he definitely did not want to restrict this to \"the talented tenth\" or anything like that. His whole emphasis at CORE had really been on improving the lives of poor people in Black neighborhoods. In McKissick's most ambitious imaginings, what did he envision this city to be? What did it look like? What would be there? Who would be there? So it would have been about 50,000 people by the year 2000. But obviously, 20 years later, it probably would have been bigger than that now. Physically, it would have been a relatively compact city; he was planning it on about 5,000 acres. It would have been more dense than your kind of typical, sprawling, you know, modern American city. Because it was to be built from scratch, all of the infrastructure would have been new. He was trying to take advantage of new ideas in terms of planning a city; all of the electrical lines were going to be buried underground. The road system was designed to sort of funnel traffic efficiently. There were going to be a lot of bike paths and walking paths to the woods. So there would have been a combination of urban and pastoral, with a lot of green space. And then, there would be neighborhoods that were pretty compact, little community centers in the middle of each, and one major town center. They never got very far in terms of the architecture, but when you look at the sketches, it looks to me like the architecture of The Brady Bunch. One of the strangest elements of the story is that Richard Nixon ended up becoming a big proponent of Soul City. How did that partnership come to be? Nixon was a strange figure, a complicated figure. Jet magazine referred to him as the civil rights workhorse of the Republican Party when he was vice president. After Nixon helped ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, Martin Luther King Jr. praised Nixon for his help and his courage in getting the law passed. The NAACP named him an honorary member in the late 1950s. When he was running against Kennedy, for a large part of that campaign, Nixon was viewed as more progressive on issues of race than Kennedy. It was only at the end, you know, when the Kennedys helped get King out of jail, that things flipped. So Nixon had a complicated past. And, you know, I think he was trying to have it both ways. He wanted to use the \"Southern strategy\" that he had seen work. And he also wasn't willing to give up entirely on the Black vote. He had this whole appeal to what he called the silent majority. And I think he thought that there was a Black silent majority that he could appeal to and that Black capitalism was the way to attract Black votes without alienating whites. And so he gave a speech in May of 1968 in which he praised Black capitalism, and said that it was much more in alignment with Republican principles than Democratic principles and made a play to attract Black votes. He called it the real Black power, right? Right. And in that sense, he and McKissick agreed that capitalism, or having control over capital, was power. And Nixon sort of reached out to the proponents of Black capitalism. Now, McKissic didn't support him in 1968; McKissick was a pretty harsh critic of Nixon's in the early years of Nixon's presidency. He called him the leading proponent of law and order racism. But when he needed money for Soul City, he realized that he was going to have to appeal to the Nixon administration. Before the 1972 election, McKissick reached out to some friends he had in the Nixon administration, and proposed that they join together in an effort to get out the Black vote for Nixon. And Nixon welcomed that support. The night before Nixon was inaugurated for his second term, he invited Floyd McKissick and his wife, Evelyn, to join him at a concert at the Kennedy Center. And so they shared a box with the president, because that's how grateful Nixon was for McKissick's efforts on his behalf. So there was an element of pragmatism and expediency in McKissick's alliance with Nixon, no doubt about that. You know, he was very clear eyed about it. But I think he thought that's how politics worked, and that he wasn't doing anything any different than what white businessmen. And so it was this strange alliance that each person thought had benefits for them. So how much did the Nixon administration end up pledging to Soul City? Basically, they were going to guarantee bonds that were going to be issued on Soul City's behalf, and the total amount that they said they would guarantee was $14 million. McKissick never actually got $14 million. He ended up getting $10 million. And then the Nixon administration also awarded him a variety of grants to help build some of the infrastructure for Soul City. And then, he continued to get some of those grants even after Nixon resigned \u2014 from the Ford administration and then from the Carter administration. So  it's hard to put an exact price tag on how much money he got solely from the Nixon administration. He ended up getting pretty substantial financial support, but not nearly enough to to accomplish what he was trying to accomplish. And so McKissick was sort of left without a lot to show for his alliance. But that federal support changed the popular perception of Soul City, though, right? He was suddenly sort of getting much more positive attention in the mainstream press. Yeah, absolutely. I think a lot of people were pretty amazed that McKissick managed to get that loan guarantee. And it changed a lot of people's minds about the feasibility of Soul City, and the people whose minds it changed the most or the people in the county where he wanted to build it: Warren County. The county was controlled by whites, even though it was two-thirds Black. But when those county officials saw the kind of money that McKissick was getting from the federal government, they jumped right on board. I think that's an important part of the story \u2014 the way McKissick was able to bring on board all of these local whites who had initially been skeptical and even hostile to Soul City. At one point he said, sometimes if you want to help yourself, you have to help others, too, which is a pretty pragmatic way of looking at it. But I think that what he was trying to tell these people in Warren County was that, look, I'm not going to just be helping Black people. I'm going to be helping everybody here. And this was a really poor part of the state. And when those officials saw the kind of money that was coming in, they were happy to have Soul City at that point. Self-interest is a huge motivator. And I think he leveraged the self-interest of local officials to get them to support Soul City.

She lost the general election for a Tennessee Senate seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Humphrey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marquita Bradshaw was the only Black woman to win a U.S. Senate primary this cycle. She lost the general election for a Tennessee Senate seat. On the day that California Gov. Gavin Newsom named Kamala Harris' replacement in the U.S. Senate, Molly Watson jumped on a call with other organizers and the two Black women in Congress whom they had urged Newsom to appoint to the seat instead. It was an emotional conversation, in which Watson said she struggled to hold back tears. \"It cut pretty deep knowing that we were going to be fully erased from the Senate,\" said Watson, of the progressive group Courage California. While the Democratic Party is in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, there is also a new fight playing out over representation. There are now no Black women in the Senate after an election cycle with key victories powered by Black women. It has turned a moment of triumph for many Black women thrilled to see Harris make a historic ascent to the vice presidency into something more bittersweet. \"Everybody else is represented in the U.S. Senate except for us, period,\" said Watson, one of the organizers who urged Newsom to select either Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland or Rep. Karen Bass of Los Angeles for the vacancy. Instead, Newsom appointed Alex Padilla, California's then-secretary of state, who is a Latino man. \"We've got to figure out what to do after everybody spent all this time loving Black women and thanking us for saving the country and doing the work in the background,\" Watson said, \"but not ever being pushed to the front or believed in to do the jobs of actual elected representatives as we so often see.\" Why so few Black women? Asked why so few Black women have served in the Senate, more than a dozen current and former Black lawmakers, candidates and strategists said there is not just one diagnosis for a problem that has plagued the Senate for its entire history. The barriers to entry are high. Another argument: The party establishment doesn't see potential candidates of color as viable candidates who can win. And Black women, in particular, are plagued by the intertwined ills of sexism and racism, not to mention the impact of voter suppression tactics. \"There is targeted, systemic and constantly evolving voter suppression tactics that people are trying to keep up with that make it hard for certain paths to victory to be made possible when you're thinking about a statewide run, which is a completely different math calculation than when you're thinking about running for a House district,\" said Amanda Brown Lierman, the executive director of the activist group Supermajority and a former political director of the Democratic National Committee. Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor as Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, holds the Bible. Harris is the first woman to be vice president, and the first person of Black or South Asian heritage to hold the office.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor as Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, holds the Bible. Harris is the first woman to be vice president, and the first person of Black or South Asian heritage to hold the office. All agree that one of the biggest challenges is money. The last cycle saw Senate candidates raise jaw-dropping sums, like Jaime Harrison in South Carolina who raised more than $133 million in his unsuccessful challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham. \"It's bloody expensive. You're talking multimillion-dollar campaigns,\" said Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman to serve in the Senate. \"And if you don't start off with a Rolodex full of people who can write big checks, and write big checks to the party. ... If you try to do it the 'pass the hat' kind of way, that doesn't work anymore.\" Raising money simply opens doors, to attention from deep-pocketed donors, as well as from the party establishment itself. Too often, party leaders don't invest in candidates who are Black women early enough, said Stefanie Brown James, a co-founder of The Collective PAC, one of several groups that has served as an early financial pipeline for Black candidates. \"Black women need to have a disproportionate amount of money provided to them when they're running as candidates, because they are disproportionately faced with obstacles and challenges to them being successful in their races,\" she said in an interview. James said The Collective's top priority in 2024 is to elect a Black woman to the Senate, but she also issued a call to action. \"The entire progressive community needs to really put their money where their mouth is,\" she said. \"Don't just say that Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. No, you need to show us with support and with resources that you understand the importance of Black women, not just as voters but as candidates as well.\" Being the only one \"made me work harder\" Only one Black woman won a Senate primary this cycle. In Tennessee, Marquita Bradshaw, an environmental activist, defeated a field of Democrats including James Mackler, the candidate backed by Senate Democrats' campaign arm. Her victory also made her the state's first Black woman to win a major party's nomination for the U.S. Senate. \"The dynamic of there not being another African American woman in the whole United States that was running for U.S. Senate made me work harder,\" Bradshaw said in an interview. Bradshaw, who said she makes less than $15 an hour, said that fundraising was a challenge from Day 1. \"I remember just trying to get the first $100 to open up the account, and how hard it was to get somebody to just give $100 to me,\" she said. Even after winning her primary, Bradshaw said she received no institutional support from the party establishment, support that she believes could have made a difference. In November, she lost to Republican Bill Hagerty by about 800,000 votes. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee endorsed a number of racially diverse candidates this cycle, including Raphael Warnock, who became the first Black Democratic senator from the South. The committee also pointed to aggressive efforts to push Stacey Abrams to run for Senate in Georgia, though she ultimately declined. The absence of Black women in the Senate is not just among Democrats: No Black Republican woman has ever served in the Senate, and the Republican Party significantly lags behind Democrats in terms of racial diversity. Bradshaw described it as \"pretty disappointing\" to know that she was the only Black woman running for Senate and to not have the full resources of the party at her disposal. She says she's working to ensure that the next Black woman who runs for federal office in Tennessee won't face the same issues. Today, there are no Black women in the U.S. Senate because our nation\u2019s second-ever Black woman senator is now becoming our first-ever Black woman VP.Black women shouldn't have to sacrifice our representation at one table to have a seat at another. Elect more Black women. Bradshaw rejected the idea that Tennessee, which hasn't elected a Democratic senator since Al Gore 30 years ago, is a clearly red state. She said she believes many people across Tennessee simply don't vote, a problem she's looking to solve. Since losing her campaign, she's launched a nonprofit, Sowing Justice, with a goal of bringing more people into the process. Jessica Byrd, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of The Front Line, pointed to races like Bradshaw's as an example of how gains by Black women in elected office are often made: without the permission \u2014 or support \u2014 of the party establishment. \"It's really going to take the DSCC, the DCCC and the DNC to really see the primary process as an opportunity for Black women to be elected to the United States Congress, which then makes them more viable and able to be elected to the United States Senate,\" she said. \"And until then, there are many, many many Black women who are both qualified and want to run and have really been gatekept from doing so.\" Brown Lierman, who worked at the DNC, said the party needs to have some tough, internal conversations about the \"loyalty and deference\" given to incumbents. \"Of course that's a fair thing to do, but it makes it really hard for new people to enter our political systems and enter halls of power,\" she said. \"We're going to demand power\" Current and former lawmakers say that the fresh absence of Black women in the Senate is not just a symbolic loss. \"You have a void in terms of perspective, in terms of experiences, in terms of the ideas that are brought to the policy agenda,\" said Lee, the California congresswoman who was first elected to the House in 1998. Carol Moseley Braun became the first Black woman to serve in the Senate when she was elected to represent Illinois in 1992.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Bahr/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The very types of issues that Black women raise, by virtue of their lived experiences, may go unmentioned. Moseley Braun, who was elected in 1992 and served one term in the Senate, recalled working on legislation related to lupus, which affects more women than men and is more common among Black people. \"It wasn't that my colleagues didn't know that there was an issue with lupus \u2014 many of them did,\" Moseley Braun said. \"But it just wasn't that important to them because it wasn't exactly their world.\" She said that it was her insight as \"a person with a Black person's consciousness that helps everybody in the country.\" \"By not having that voice in the room or at the table, we do ourselves a disservice, we do our country a disservice,\" said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is the first Black person and Black woman to represent the state of Delaware in Congress. Black women in Congress are taking the push for representation in the Senate into their own hands, grappling with the reality that a Black woman's candidacy often does not get prioritized in the way that they believe it should. Lee said that she and others are launching an urgent effort to \"secure the seat\" for a Black woman. \"We have to take, in many respects, it in our own hands, hoping that the formal committees will recognize that we have a lot to offer, and that we're here to stay and we're going to demand power,\" she said. Blunt Rochester underscored the gravity of the moment, paraphrasing a quote from Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to serve in Congress. \"When a person's voice is not in the room, sometimes people don't even know that they're missing it, and it hampers, and dampens and makes us not as effective,\" she said. \"I love Shirley Chisholm's quote that everybody knows: 'If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.' That's really what this moment is about.\" Black political leaders are eyeing opportunities on the horizon that might give them opportunities to fill the void. One is in Ohio, where Republican Sen. Rob Portman is not seeking reelection. Some have publicly speculated that Rep. Joyce Beatty, a veteran lawmaker who represents Ohio's 3rd district, should campaign for the seat. I have not made any decisions on next steps, but sincerely believe now is a perfect time for change. We can and must do more to Build Back Better for all Ohioans. /2 For her part, Beatty has said that she is \"beyond flattered\" by the attention, but has made no decisions on a future Senate run. And in California, eyes are on the future of 87-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has several years left in her current term. Lee, who was among the Black women that organizers had publicly pushed for the appointment to fill Harris' seat, said that she is \"honored\" by the support and that her colleague, Rep. Bass, is among the \"phenomenal Black women\" who could \"step into the United States Senate and hit the ground running.\" \"I've been in Congress now 21 years and I worked for a member of Congress for 11 years; I certainly know the ropes,\" she said. \"But having said that, it's so important that we focus on supporting Black women wherever they may be, for a seat in the Senate.\"",

In 1969, the civil rights activist, tired of seeing Black people shut out of politics and business, made a bold proposal: He wanted to found a new city, one where Black people would have power and opportunity. As Thomas Healy writes in his new book, Soul City, the town would be \"a model of Black economic empowerment, bringing money and jobs to a region that had been left behind by the twin forces of industrialization and urbanization.\" It very nearly worked. Healy's fascinating book explores how McKissick went about building a city from scratch, only to have his dreams dashed by a combination of prejudice and bureaucracy. It's an excellent chronicle not just of McKissick's project, but of an America in the 1970s still influenced by anti-Black racism. McKissick had a long career in civil rights before launching his Soul City project, participating in a freedom ride and working as a lawyer fighting segregation. In 1966, he was elected executive director of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), steering the organization to the Black Power movement. He minced no words in explaining Black Power to a skeptical Harvard professor: \"That means putting power in black people's hands. We don't have any and we want some. That simply is what that means.\" After leaving CORE in 1968, an idea occurred to McKissick: \"He was determined to build a new kind of city, one that would avoid the mistakes of the past and serve as a model for the future.\" A World War II veteran, McKissick had witnessed French city planners rebuild their towns after they'd been shellacked by mortar shells; the experience inspired his idea for a new town, Soul City, that he'd build from the ground up in the Piedmont region of his native North Carolina. It would be a city where Black people could feel free and safe, although people of all races would be welcome to live there. He had his work cut out for him. The land that he purchased lacked infrastructure, and a billboard nearby proclaimed \"You Are in the Heart of Klan Country.\" But the land was cheap and stocked with natural resources, so he soldiered on with the help of a group of true believers. McKissick secured grants and loans from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and banks, and got help from an unlikely ally: President Richard Nixon, who shared McKissick's interest in so-called \"Black capitalism,\" the idea that Black people should combat inequality by becoming entrepreneurs. After McKissick switched parties and endorsed Nixon's re-election, the president hinted that McKissick would get additional funding from HUD: \"Don't worry, Floyd, you're going to get your money,\" Healy recounts Nixon saying. But funding was only one part of the problem \u2014 he needed people and employers to move to the North Carolina town: \"But just as residents would not move to Soul City unless there were jobs, companies would not locate in Soul City unless there were skilled workers to run their factories and safe, attractive neighborhoods for their managers to live in.\" And despite some early, modest successes on those fronts, the project, in the end, couldn't overcome a hostile media, a skittish HUD department, and opposition politicians, including newly elected Sen. Jesse Helms. In 1980, HUD foreclosed on Soul City, effectively killing the project, and leaving McKissick \"weary and diminished.\" Just over a decade later, McKissick died in Soul City, where he's now buried. The Soul City project was a fascinating one, and Healy does a wonderful job explaining how and why it ultimately failed. The book is meticulously researched, and Healy expertly provides ample context; he paints an excellent, and accurate, picture of America in the 1970s, a country still in denial about the racism that was poisoning the nation to its core. He also manages to craft a deft, readable narrative out of the ups and downs of the Soul City project. Government grants and bank loans aren't topics that typically scream \"page-turner,\" but Healy is a natural storyteller; the book is difficult to put down, even if you know how it ends. Most importantly, Soul City succeeds because of Healy's trenchant analysis. The Soul City project was a wonderful dream that was hamstrung from the start, and Healy does a masterful job explaining why that was. \"What doomed Soul City was not just the size of its ambition, but, at least in part, the color,\" he writes. \"Like nearly every other effort to improve the lives of Black people, it was subjected to a level of scrutiny, second-guessing, and outright hostility that other ambitious ventures rarely encounter. Some of this scrutiny was motivated by blatant prejudice, but some of it is simply embedded in our social structures. If a project is designed primarily to help Blacks, it is automatically held to a higher standard of justification.\"",

Blow\n                \n                    \n                    Harper\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto by Charles M. Blow Some time into his new book The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto, Charles Blow recalls hearing Harry Belafonte give a speech. The subject was Belafonte's bailout of some student members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC.) Belafonte had raised $70,000 in bail money and called up his best friend Sidney Poitier to help him deliver the money. But it was not easy. Belafonte recalled how he and Poitier were chased by the Ku Klux Klan, whose members accosted them at the airport; Belafonte and Poitier had to take off speeding in a race for their lives. Poitier and Belafonte were, without a doubt, two of the most acclaimed Black stars in America. And this still happened to them. But Belafonte's did not end his story at the recounting of this memory of vile racism and terror. Belafonte turned it into a call for action. Facing the audience that Charles Blow sat in, Belafonte asked a simple question: \"Where are the radical thinkers?\" In the years that passed, Blow found himself haunted by Belafonte's question. In time, Belafonte's questions spurred the writing of The Devil You Know, Charles Blow's own declaration of radical thought \u2014 for Black Americans to reconsider their Great Migration North and imagine new possibilities of Black political might. Writes Blow: \"The proposition is simple. As many Black descendants of the Great Migration as possible should return to the South from which their ancestors fled.\" By concentrating their political power in key Southern cities, Blow posits, Black Americans will be able to effect actual social change. \"The mission begins with the states, which are the true centers of power in this country, and as such control the lion's share of the issues that bedevil Black lives: criminal justice, judicial processes, education, health care, economic opportunity and assistance.\" Blow, the author of the memoir Fire Shut Up In My Bones and a New York Times columnist, is himself a child of the South who migrated North for employment opportunities, and thus is aptly situation to discuss these ideas. \"I was born in 1970 in Louisiana at the end of the Great Migration into a world shaped by vacancy,\" Blow writes. \"The landscape was specked by empty houses; there was more work than could be done, more jobs than could be filled.\" So why, remembering the economic blight of his childhood, does Blow advocate a return to the South? Firstly, Blow argues, the South is no longer an economically depressed region, but an economically thriving part of the country, especially in its major cities. Writes Blow: \"In 2018 Forbes compiled a list of 'The Cities Where African Americans Are Doing the Best Economically\" and found many of those cities were in the South. The 15 worst cities for Black Americans were all the destination cities from the Great Migration.\" Secondly, the South is home to more than 1,000 of the nation's 1,200 majority Black cities, home to most of the nation's Black-owned businesses, has more Black folks in local government than northern cities, and carries an intergenerational Black history, memory and culture that must be honored. But Blow's main point is this: Racism is everywhere \u2014 it's just about what kind of racism you can live with. And for Blow, Southern racism is preferable to its Northern cousin. He writes: \"I often think of racism as having developmental cycles. In the South, it's an old man. There racism hasn't vanished (far from it), but it has come to terms with itself. In the North, particularly in destination cities, racism is a teenage boy, acting out as the old man did years ago.\" In cogent arguments bound together by his customary incandescent prose, Blow explores how the white backlash towards the Great Migration that never really ended has created a situation where racism in these Northern \"destination cities\" of the Great Migration makes life untenable for Black Americans. Through research undertaken by Project Implicit, Blow found there is no difference between anti-Black bias in the North and the South. There are only the ideas that people will admit to out loud. In other words, writes Blow, \"white people outside the South say the right words but many possess the same bigotry.\" Consider this: Of the violent deaths of unarmed Black folks at the hands of policemen and white vigilantes, a great many now occur in the North, rather than the South. Eric Garner was killed in New York City. George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Philando Castile was killed outside St. Paul, Minnesota. Mike Brown was shot in Ferguson, Missouri. Tamir Rice was gunned down in Cleveland, Ohio. Stephon Clark was killed in Sacramento, California. Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, Maryland. The most segregated school systems are no longer in the South \u2014 instead, the most segregated school system in the United States is in a city many have long held up as a beacon of diversity and liberalism: New York City. And while the American public imagination remembers the murders of Emmett Till and George Stinney by white supremacy in the South, the North was also an extremely unsafe place for Black Americans of that time as well. The post-World War I migration of Black folks North was followed by violence levied at the new Black arrivals by white Northerners. \"So much blood flowed in America's streets that year that James Weldon Johnson, field secretary of the NAACP dubbed it the 'Red Summer' writes Blow of the 1919 Chicago white uprising against the Black citizens of the region. \"In ten months, an estimated 250 people were killed \u2014 including nearly 100 who were lynched.\" Weaving together deeply thought out analysis and in-depth sociological and historical research, Blow details how, as Black folks migrated North, \"white people in Chicago found a way to formalize and ensure segregation: restrictive covenants\" that made Black people unable to lease, buy, or even use property in certain areas of the city. The result? \"By 1939, an estimated 80 percent of all Chicago's land area was covered by these covenants,\" Blow writes. Black Americans in the North suffered racial violence and reductions of rights codified by law \u2014 just like Black Americans in the South, but often without the support of extended family and community back home. Blow connects the dots between moments of social advancement for Black Americans through and the accompanying white backlash: \"Whenever Black people make progress, white people feel threatened and respond forcefully. Emancipation and the Civil War gave rise to the KKK, which formed just months after the war ended. The Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education striking down racial segregation in schools gave rise to the white supremacist Citizen's Councils. The election of the first Black president gave rise to the Tea Party, which was formed soon after Barack Obama was sworn in.\" As he discusses the rise of anti-Black violence and the need for safe spaces for Black folks, Blow draws from personal experience, detailing the moment his college student son was held at gunpoint on his Yale campus; how that moment echoed his own experience of being unjustly held at gunpoint by white police officers while in college himself. \"He said he could make us lie down in the middle of the road and shoot us in the back of the head, and no one would say anything about it,\" Blow writes. But throughout the book, Blow grounds his ideas in this central question: \"What could and should Black people do to acquire and maintain the economic and political power \u2014 for the many, not just for the few \u2014 that the Great Migration failed to secure?\" Blow pays special attention to the role of elders in the community as he discusses how the original Great Migration caused a \"loss of generational connectedness as an entire young generation left and the South became more of aged society,\" adversely affecting both young people and the elders. Here, Blow crafts an homage to the of elders in the Black community \u2014 from the great-uncle who babysat him to the importance of the example of elders like the 100 year-old Tim Black of Chicago who mentored a young Barack Obama newly arrived to Chicago. It is also important to note the space Blow gives here to Black women social justice leaders who are often ignored, spending time with the mothers of the murdered black children \u2014 Samaria Rice, Sybrina Fulton; honoring the work of the great Shirley Chisolm; honoring the work Stacey Abrams. Indeed Abrams' work, like Belafonte's call to action, is an impetus of sorts for Blow's book. \"Georgia became the model for how Black people can potentially experience true power in this country and alter the political landscape,\" writes Blow in his introduction. Consider this: Just after the Civil War, Blacks were the majority in three Southern states and within inches of the majority in three more. \"If the Great Migration hadn't happened, and those Black people had remained in the South until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it is possible that African Americans would dominate the politics of the Deep South.\" They could have controlled as many as 12 seats in the U.S Senate. Blow does not call himself an activist and does not admit to any political aspiration; since starting his first newspaper in high school he has thought of himself as a newspaperman through and through. His job, writes Blow, is this: \"I bear witness. I interpret the world. I record history in real time.\" But for Blow, Belafonte's call still comes through loud and clear. Imagining free Black futures requires radical thought. \"In a society and system in which white supremacy is ubiquitous and inveterate, Black people need fierce advocates to help restore the balance in the first instance,\" writes Blow. Throughout his legendary career in journalism, Charles Blow has long been that voice. The question is now: Will you join him?

            "article_content": "If you've been riding an emotional, politics-fueled rollercoaster in 2021 (not to mention 2020), believe us: Your kids have noticed. Here's a quick primer from Life Kit on how to talk with your kids about politics  \u2014  and, even get them thinking about civics. Kids can see that we're on edge. They are naturally self-centered, and they'll assume your stress is about them. Be honest and tell them, \"Dad/Mom is a little nervous about what's happening in the country.\" It's helpful for kids' social and emotional development to hear you naming your emotions. At the same time, it's not great for you or them to be mainlining the news 24/7, so try your hardest to turn off the TV or the radio, put away your phone and connect \u2014 especially over meals and other key moments during the day. \"We can control the amount of information. We can control the amount of exposure,\" Rosemarie Truglio, senior vice president of curriculum and content at Sesame Workshop, told us when we talked to her about parenting during intense news events. Parents and caregivers, this question is a golden line to have in your back pocket at all times \u2014 even when there is no election, no riots, no pandemic casting a long shadow over our lives. Tara Conley, a media researcher at Montclair State University, says adults should choose a quiet moment to check in with their kids, maybe at the dinner table or at bedtime. The idea, she says, is to allow kids to \"ask questions about what they're seeing, how they're feeling and what do they think.\" In other words: Give kids a safe space to reflect and share. And give yourself a chance to dispel any scary rumors or misinformation they may have come across. And this is key: Your job, first and foremost, is to listen. Looking for a silver lining to all the recent upheaval? Well, the Annenberg Public Policy Center's annual Constitution Day survey found a marked increase last year in the awareness among average Americans about their rights, like free speech and the structures of government. And, just over half can name the executive, legislative and judicial branches, an all-time high on this survey. Obviously, though, that good news comes as our kids (and the rest of us) are being buffeted by hurricane-force winds of misinformation and conspiracy theory. According to a new NPR/NewsHour/Marist Poll conducted earlier this week, 38% of Americans polled said they still do not trust the results of the 2020 election \u2014 even though there has been no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud. To be active, empowered citizens, kids need to be able to sort fact from fiction, especially when that fiction is coming from our own elected leaders. And that requires they build a strong foundation of basic knowledge \u2014 about history, geography and our political system. \"The more you know, the more you can know,\" says Ashley Berner, a professor at Johns Hopkins who studies how schools teach civics. In fact, she says, research shows students who have more time with social studies actually do better in other subjects, too. The 2020 election, the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration present a perfect opportunity to help kids build this foundation of facts. With my (Anya's) older daughter, we looked at a map of the distribution of House seats between the two parties, and talked about why the Vice President is allowed to break a tie in the Senate. My younger one, who is four, wanted to see Washington, D.C. on a map, and to know that it was pretty far away. Ashley Berner also suggests a simple, civically-minded walk outside. \"Talk about what institutions are public and what are private. So which things have we decided as a community that we're going to support, like road-building, or parks or libraries?\" Many of the rioters who invaded the U.S. Capitol were known white nationalists. Some carried Confederate flags. Black Capitol Police have described the racist taunts of their attackers. And all of this follows a concerted effort by the President and many Republicans to disenfranchise voters \u2014 particularly Black Americans. In short: Our nation's painful history of racism is integral to an understanding of this moment. The United States and its democracy are a work-in-progress, and in order for children to understand the role we all have to play in its improvement, they need to learn about its failures as well as its successes. \"I think the highest form of patriotism is self-reflection and saying, 'Hey, this is what we've done wrong,'\" says Hasan Kwame Jeffries, a history professor at Ohio State University. Presenting kids with a less-than-honest version of history, especially the nation's racial history, risks leaving them feeling confused, alienated, even betrayed when they're exposed to facts that don't fit that rosy narrative. This came up when we spoke with Taylor Pittman, an advisor to a program called Cultures of Dignity, which is dedicated to \"civil dialogue\" among young people, families and educators. A high-school senior in New Orleans, Pittman told us about the time her class visited a former plantation that depended on labor from enslaved people. She says the tour guide wanted to talk about, \"The agriculture, and 'It's so pretty. And look at the nature,'\" especially the plantation's oak trees. \"And then when we got back onto the bus, my teacher was like, 'The oak trees are where they used to hang people. They used to have beatings there.' And we talked about how everything they said there at that plantation was wrong,\" Pittman remembers. Jeffries says, when talking about race and identity with kids, the point is not to focus solely on the hard stuff but to strike a delicate balance, like when he talks with his daughters. \"Race couldn't always be discrimination and injustice or slavery and Jim Crow ... I had to begin to consciously say, 'You got to balance the good with the bad. You got to balance the pain with the joy.' Right? The hardship with the love.\" It feels like the United States has never been so divided. But, in an interview late last year, Berner said we need to actively expose our children to a range of opinions. \"It's so important for young people to be engaged in conversations about meaning and purpose and different political viewpoints.\" In fact, she says, historically, \"civic formation is the prime reason why modern democracy started funding education in the first place.\" According to this view, classrooms should be like a little lab where students practice having reasonable, evidence-based debate. \"In fact, most of our peer nations have made it a priority to explicitly teach children about the ways that different groups in society actually see the world differently,\" says Berner. Emotions are running high right now, but, in the run-up to the 2020 election, Truglio told us that, at all costs, we should resist the temptation to simply label the other side \"bad guys\" or \"evil.\" It's not helpful, and it may increase fear and confusion. Instead, child development experts say, we should condemn actions, such as violence and hateful speech. And try to talk about why some might make choices we find painful or ugly. Empathy, perspective-taking \u2014 it's hard to do, but it's also absolutely necessary in a democracy. Jeffries adds, \"We're afraid to talk about politics ... As my 5-year-old says, 'That don't make no sense!' You got to let people know where you stand. Provide children evidence. Provide them with stories.\" Biden's inaugural committee is highlighting this year that Martin Luther King Day is a federally designated National Day of Service. Invite your kids to join you in the nuts and bolts of civic action \u2014 like writing letters and cards to lonely seniors, or collecting cans for a food pantry. It's empowering, and it builds a sense of belonging and agency, says Jeffries. \"Society is service. You have to serve other people.\" This story was originally published in November 2020.

            "article_content": "Education issues took on an outsized role in this week's elections in Virginia and elsewhere. The question for politicians of all stripes is whether education will remain an important topic into 2022.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Republican Glenn Youngkin will be the next governor of Virginia. Education in public schools was what he drilled on in the closing days of the race, but voters' concerns about what happens inside classrooms often reflect their worries about what happens outside of schools. So to help us understand the role of education this year and how it might play out in the voting booths in 2022, we're joined by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Hey there, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: And education reporter Anya Kamenetz. Welcome back, Anya. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Thanks, Audie. CORNISH: Tam, I want to start with you. What are we learning about what kind of role education and issues around education played in this gubernatorial race? KEITH: Certainly in the closing stretch, it was the most prominent issue that both campaigns were talking about. That doesn't mean it was the only thing that mattered or the only factor in Youngkin's win. The economy was part of it, too. But here is what one Republican political consultant told me. ROY COOPER: If the schools in Virginia opened up in fall of 2020, like they did so many other places in America, Terry McAuliffe wins the governor's race, and it's not even close. KEITH: That's Roy Cooper. He's a Republican consultant who lives in suburban northern Virginia. He has three kids and has been quite vocal about his frustrations with the schools being slow to return to in-person education. Parents with their kids at home struggling to connect them to Zoom led to far more parent engagement, he says, and also massive anger and frustration. COOPER: And that is what made them go to school board meetings, and that's what made them start looking at curriculum. And that's what made them start looking at other issues in other counties they didn't even live in. CORNISH: Anya Kamenetz, does any of this sound familiar to you? KAMENETZ: You know, Audie, parents are not a monolith. And even many of those who are dissatisfied with school closing - they may be worried about coming back to school. But I hear from many parents who are angry and alienated by prolonged school closures. They drove mothers out of the workforce. Kids suffered seriously with their mental health, with their learning. And, you know, when you look at in-person learning days last school year - that's tracked by the website Burbio - Virginia was seventh lowest in the nation. And New Jersey, where we saw a near upset in the governor's race on Tuesday, was 10th lowest in the nation. And nationally, not just in those races, there is a lot of energy going into local school board races. So Ballotpedia - they track a few hundred local races. And what they saw was three or four times as many recall elections as a typical year and many more contested seats where the candidates are bringing up kind of these hot-button national issues like race and sex and gender as well as masks and vaccines. CORNISH: So is it just about school closures? - because a lot has been made of the culture war going on in our schools. KAMENETZ: I think just as Tam said, like, this issue is connected to the first. So generally with Zoom school, parents saw and heard a lot more of what was happening in their schools, and some primarily white parents perhaps did not like what they saw. And so, you know, what happened over the last summer, the last fall with the Black Lives Matter uprising, with The 1619 Project from the New York Times, schools, along with other institutions, have been increasingly trying to address white supremacy, trying to address structural racism. And then you have this backlash phenomenon. It's almost like a repeat of the Tea Party, right? The Dems have control of the national government. The Republicans seize on culture war issues. And, you know, there is grassroots, authentic anger. But we would be remiss not to mention that it is also amplified. It's amplified on right-wing media. It's amplified on social media. There's think tanks, well-funded groups at all levels. So if you want to get up and protest at a school board meeting or if you want to run for school board yourself, there's people there to help you out - the Cato Institute, Manhattan Institute, brand-new networks like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education and even a PAC, a national political action committee, for school board races called the 1776 PAC. CORNISH: So that brings us back to Virginia. Tam, Youngkin promised that he would not allow critical race theory to be taught in schools. It's not on the curriculum, but he very much was talking - using that kind of language. So how big of a factor was that based on your reporting? KEITH: CRT certainly became a catchall for a lot of things. Outrage over it definitely motivated some of Youngkin's voters, in particular more conservative voters who were solidly part of the Republican base. But Youngkin could not have won on the Republican base votes alone. And in an interview with Politico, one of Youngkin's chief strategists, Jeff Roe, said they put a focus on education from the very beginning, really targeted it to different groups of people to try to win over independent and Democratic voters. For some people, it was about CRT. For others, it was about advanced math or school resource officers on campus or testing. And then the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, made a comment in a debate that came off as dismissive of parents, and Youngkin's team turned it into an ad within hours. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: The topic was education, and Terry went on the attack against parents. TERRY MCAULIFFE: And I'm not going to let parents come into schools. I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach. KEITH: That statement from McAuliffe that he said was taken out of context was gold for Youngkin. He had a rallying cry. But political analysts I've spoken to say it would be a mistake to assume Youngkin won simply because of culture wars and CRT because in reality, he was talking about a lot more. And there were elements of his message that were nationalized and other elements that were quite localized. And let me just add he also campaigned extensively on the economy, which didn't get as much media attention, but his ads about grocery prices were unavoidable. CORNISH: So, Anya, if all politics is local, what happens next? KAMENETZ: Well, you know, I want to take your attention back to those local school board races. As you mentioned, you know, there was so much energy. There was all this national money coming in. But at the end of the day, I talked to Ballotpedia about this. They track a sample of local races, and they said, you know, most incumbents kept their seats. And even amongst these kind of nationalized races, the pro-teaching kids about race, the pro-masking candidates won two times as often as kind of the anti-woke or the anti-mask candidates. But I do agree that, you know - that the underlying issue that ties it all together here is parent voice. You know, parents really are fired up. They really do want more of a voice in what goes on in schools. And I talked to Keri Rodrigues about this. She's a president of a parent voice group founded in 2020 called the National Parents Union. And her belief is that CRT is kind of a drummed-up issue. But frustration over the rocky school closing and reopening is very real, and it could be lasting. It could be a problem for Democrats. KERI RODRIGUES: Parents are not interested in going back to the status quo that didn't work for our kids before. And we had a firsthand view of what was not working. And so we are very interested, and we need to see some urgency from folks around this. KEITH: And parental political engagement could continue into the midterms in 2022. People I've spoken to aren't convinced that Youngkin's strategy on education would translate into every House race in the country. But certainly there are going to be a lot of governors on the ballot in 2022. And education often plays a big role in governor's races, whether it's these sort of culture war issues or teacher pay and class sizes. CORNISH: That's NPR's Tamara Keith and Anya Kamenetz. Thanks to you both. KEITH: You're welcome. KAMENETZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF TOMMY GUERRERO'S \"WAR NO MORE\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Here she greets voters outside the Orange County Registrar's office Sept. 18, 2020 in Orange, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., is one of 70 House Democrats that Republicans are targeting to beat in November 2022. Here she greets voters outside the Orange County Registrar's office Sept. 18, 2020 in Orange, Va. At a busy pub in Midlothian, Virginia, a group of voters are gathered at long wooden tables, ordering burgers and pimento cheese fries and talking about the Democrats' legislative agenda. \"I think universal pre-K is a good idea,\" said Lindsay Sherrard, a local physician. \"The [child] tax credit is fantastic,\" added Yael Levin, who works on education issues. \"I love the tax credit because that gives the choice back to people.\" Both policies are staples of the Democrats' Build Back Better bill, which passed the House Friday morning. But this isn't a Democratic event. It's a meet and greet for supporters of Tina Ramirez, one of at least seven Republicans vying to challenge incumbent Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who was first elected in 2018 by a narrow margin. The pub is located in Chesterfield County, which makes up the largest percentage of Spanberger's district, Virginia's 7th. It swung from former President Donald Trump in 2016 to President Biden four years later and most recently to Republican Glenn Youngkin for governor. Republicans have made gains in recent off-year elections and they want to maintain that momentum. The National Republican Congressional Committee is targeting at least 70 incumbent Democrats, eyeing key opportunities to flip suburban districts like Spanberger's, which used to be GOP strongholds. Democrats are hoping legislative victories that bring home federal dollars will boost their chances at the polls next year and allow them to retain control of the House. But the voters gathered for burgers and politics in Midlothian are clear: sure, they may support some of these Democratic policies, but not enough to cast their vote for a Democrat in the 2022 midterm elections. Ramirez tells NPR that's because voters here by and large don't like the idea of Washington having a blank check for government spending. \"I think there's a real feeling, in this state in particular, that you have this idea that government knows best or that government's the answer to everything,\" she said. \"People are just fed up.\" Ramirez added it's the issues people \"feel every day\" \u2014 like inflation \u2014 that ultimately drive their political decisions. \"People are so frustrated,\" she said. \"They feel it and this is a result of just bad economic policy.\" Republican candidate for Congress Tina Ramirez is running in Virginia's 7th district.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call Inc. via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican candidate for Congress Tina Ramirez is running in Virginia's 7th district. It's an issue that resonates with voters like Levin. She considers herself an independent and has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past. She is solidly in Ramirez's camp and said she's concerned about inflation and the supply chain. \"My momma van is dying and we need to get a new car, and there's no inventory,\" she said. \"I can barely afford gas. I can barely afford groceries for two teen athletic boys.\" She likes the child tax credit, but not if it's wrapped up in a $2 trillion spending package. \"Tax credits are always a good thing,\" she said. \"But if you lump it in with spending that's out of control, that's going to put my great-great-grandchildren in debt, then I'm going to be against it.\" Another issue that nearly every voter at Ramirez's campaign event brought up was critical race theory \u2014 a graduate-level academic approach that looks at institutions through the lens of race and racism. They believe CRT has made its way into K-12 public schools. \"Kids \u2014 when they go to school, they want to learn,\" said Carmen Williams, a Ramirez supporter who immigrated to the U.S. from Peru. \"A white person shouldn't say, 'Oh I am white, I am bad.'\" While CRT scholars would take issue with Williams' characterization, Republican messaging has turned the graduate-level theory into a culture war issue and it's led to spinoff discussions in school board and PTA meetings about whether to ban various books from curricula and how the existence and history of racism should be taught in schools. Monica Hutchinson, a community organizer and lifelong Democrat, said the angry debate over how teachers talk about race in schools is frustrating, particularly as a Black mother. \"When I hear suburban white moms say, 'Well, I think my child is too young to learn about racism,' I'm like, 'Hello \u2014 the counter to that is simple: my child has to experience racism, right?'\" she said. \"We don't get the luxury of saying, 'Oh, my child's too young.'\" Sherrard, a white mother of two who typically votes Republican, said she thinks pushback against Democratic rhetoric helped fuel Youngkin's recent win. \"I think Virginia voters just really came against so many woke policies, if you want to call it that \u2014 just the constant focus on race and the constant focus on transgender issues,\" she listed. \"We want to just go back to the basics: basic economic recovery, basic education, a military that can defend us.\" A woman holds up a sign during a rally against \"critical race theory\" being taught in schools at the Loudoun County Government Center in Leesburg, Va., on June 12. CRT was an issue that helped bolster Republicans at the polls earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman holds up a sign during a rally against \"critical race theory\" being taught in schools at the Loudoun County Government Center in Leesburg, Va., on June 12. CRT was an issue that helped bolster Republicans at the polls earlier this month. She posits the county's flip from Trump to Biden wasn't a rebuke of conservative principles so much as a rebuke of Trump himself. \"I still voted for Trump because I liked his policies better than Biden's, but the man is crazy,\" she said. \"And I think a lot of people felt like he was not a dignified leader of our country.\" The retreat of white suburban women who voted for Biden in 2020 back to the GOP in 2021 is a tale Hutchinson has heard before. \"It is easier for suburban white women to flip because they don't have to live with the consequences of a lot of these issues that are directly impacting families like mine,\" Hutchinson told NPR in Henrico County, the blue heart of the 7th district. She supports the Democratic agenda, but said the party has a major political problem. \"We have always been horrible at messaging,\" Hutchinson said. \"[Democrats] are fighting so hard, [but] they're forgetting to come out and let the people know what they're doing.\" It's a sentiment that's widely shared among Democrats in Henrico County. Lorah Vizdos is a fervent supporter of Spanberger \u2014  so much so that she and a group of friends she met volunteering for the congresswoman have dubbed themselves the 'fan-bergers.' She's adamant that Democrats need to go on the offense. \"They're too busy playing defense and trying to be nice. 'We go high' \u2014 stop it,\" she said, shaking her head. \"Because this culture war is not going to end because you refuse to participate. It's simply going to get worse and worse and worse.\" She's frustrated Democrats didn't pass their trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill in time for Virginia Democrats to campaign on it. \"[Republicans members are] going to be there at all the ribbon cuttings and taking credit for stuff they didn't vote for,\" she said. Vizdos wants Democrats to be consistent with their messaging \u2014 making sure they \"bang the drum\" on all the things they've voted for that bring resources to their communities. \"Just say, 'The guy who's running against me voted against this.' It's not hard,  it's not rocket science. You don't need special words or an interpretive dance or anything \u2014 just say it.\" Vizdos may get her wish. Democrats are planning a nationwide public relations blitz with over 1,000 events to tout the legislation they've passed. Rep. Spanberger told NPR a lot of the national Democratic messaging up to this point has obscured the very real deliverables lawmakers are bringing to their districts. \"In the community that I represent, we have had school districts use American Rescue Plan dollars to be able to hire bus drivers. There's still a bus driver shortage but to be able to use that money is incredibly important,\" she gave as an example. That these kinds of real world benefits get lost frustrates the moderate. Refining a national message is one thing. But perhaps the more challenging task for Democrats like Spanberger is reaching constituents like the voters at the burger joint, who \u2014 despite supporting pieces of their policies \u2014 say they just won't vote for a Democrat next year. \"I know that people who see themselves as Republicans see the value in the child tax credit \u2014 they see it in their own lives, they see it in their grandchildren's lives,\" Spanberger said. \"But sometimes, our political labels in a time of hyper-partisanship can be blinding.\" Whether Democrats can reconcile that divide could be the difference between maintaining control of the House in 2022 or getting washed away in a red wave.",

            "article_content": "The Poway Unified School District, in San Diego County, Calif., was planning a pretty typical school board meeting in September. They were hearing reports from their student representatives and honoring their teachers and other staff members of the year. Because of the pandemic, the general public has been asked to join and comment via livestream. That hasn't stopped protesters from showing up in person. \"In the August meeting, they were pounding on the windows,\" said board member Darshana Patel. \"So little by little it's been escalating \u2014 they've been antsy and escalating their hostility and aggression toward the board.\" In several states and districts around the country, protestors have been disrupting school board meetings. They're opposed to mask policies. Vaccine mandates. LGBTQ rights. Sex education. Removing police from schools. Teaching about race and American history, or sometimes, anything called \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" or even \"social-emotional learning.\" The protests aren't ubiquitous, but they're widespread and intense enough that the National School Boards Association asked President Biden to step in, and Attorney General Merrick Garland then directed the FBI to help. What happened \u2014 what is happening \u2014 in Poway is not an isolated incident, but it may take the cake for being \"surreal,\" as Patel puts it. At the board's Sept. 9 meeting, some protesters followed behind a visitor and got inside the building. Patel and her fellow board members decided that the best way to de-escalate the situation was to immediately adjourn the meeting. What happened next is documented in an elaborately shot and edited video posted to YouTube: \"So we are the people,\" says a man in a black baseball cap and black T-shirt. \"So we can go ahead and replace the board. Let's take a vote. Who's willing to become the president?\" Another man steps up, wearing a T-shirt that says \"Let Them Breathe,\" with a yellow smiley face on it. He gives his name as Derek Greco. The protestors vote, \"Aye!\" to make him the new \"school board president.\" Later that night, Greco, who could not be reached for comment, posted a video to Instagram. In it, he's breathless and sweaty. \"The board vacated their seats tonight. So we then brought in a constitutionalist and we held a quorum and we voted in a new board,\" he says. \"You are looking at the new president of the Poway Unified School District, apparently.\" \"Constitutionalism\" is a far-right ideology that means, in essence, that people don't have to recognize any laws or authorities that they don't like beyond the Constitution itself. The video continues at a local restaurant, where Greco and some of the others who had just declared themselves the new school board explain that they then \"voted\" to remove Critical Race Theory from the school \u2014 though it is not being taught \u2014 and to stop requiring masks. Later, Greco and four others filed notarized oaths of office with the San Diego County Clerk. The \"election\" by those protestors on Sept. 9 was in no way legitimate, county officials say, and the properly elected school board continues to run the district. Melissa Ryan founded the consulting firm CARD Strategies, which tracks right-wing extremism. She says this kind of activity usually begins with real anger \u2014 in this case, on the part of parents, at COVID school shutdowns and restrictions like masks. But it's not entirely grassroots and spontaneous. \"The flames are being fanned by national money and resources,\" she says. \"It's basically the same groups and funders that were funding the Tea Party and frankly, it's the same tactics.\" Here are some of the groups providing resources and support to school board protesters around the country. None have endorsed violence, threats or incitement. Nor are they all formally connected. What they do is offer help to parents who have questions or objections about what their children are learning in school or how schools are run. They issue press releases, sell T-shirts and lawn signs, produce flyers and publicize events on social media, supply information and legal advice, offer template letters, scripts for public testimony, and model legislation. They put out webinars and trainings to give practical assistance to those who want to target or disrupt school boards. The term \"critical race theory\" specifically refers to an academic theory developed in law schools and usually taught at the undergraduate level. But since the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, mainstream K-12 education groups and individual districts have indeed started to acknowledge the existence of systemic and structural racism in American society, both through educator professional development and curriculum. The toolkit further says activists don't need any evidence that \"critical race theory\" is currently being taught in their local schools in order to mount a campaign against it: \"It's important to note that whether CRT is currently in your school system is mostly irrelevant to the purpose of this document.\" Jill Simonian, the director of outreach for PragerU Kids, says she herself has spoken out at school board meetings, and ultimately pulled her kids out of public school this fall because of what she overheard during Zoom teaching. \"They were offering opinions that were very politicized ... my previous school was trying to create activists out of my kids. My kids are in elementary school.\" She says the attorney general's directives to federal law enforcement are \"unfairly silencing parents.\" \"I think it's a threat to civil discourse. I think it feels like an intimidation tactic to suppress free speech of parents,\" she said. \"I think one thing that we can all agree with is that free speech is a fundamental right for everyone to have as long as it's not violent in any way, and it's not inciting immediate violence in any way.\" In Poway, the protesters held the signs of yet another group. That yellow smiley face on Greco's T-shirt? It bore the logo of Let Them Breathe, an anti-mask, anti-vaccine-mandate group whose founder is Sharon McKeeman, a mother of four. McKeeman told NPR, \"I had been part of the school reopening movement, and once my kiddos were back in school, I could see they still weren't back to effective in-person education because of the forced masking.\" Let Them Breathe is fairly new, but it has grown fast. They've raised nearly $160,000 in the past three months on GoFundMe. They are suing the state of California alongside a group called Reopen California Schools over the student mask mandate, and the San Diego Unified School District over its student vaccine mandate. They have a podcast that's also broadcast on a San Diego conservative radio station, and a professional videographer to record their events. McKeeman says the group is dedicated to peaceful, positive advocacy only. \"We had a Smile Fest. We had a couple of marches that were really positive, full of kids, and just to help the community come together and dialogue with each other.\" On its Instagram page, Let Them Breathe has promoted dozens of \"Mask Choice Rallies\" at school board meetings all over California, including the September one in Poway. But McKeeman says the organization does not condone what happened that day. She adds that she reached out afterwards to the protesters who were there to \"clarify that their viewpoints and actions do not align with Let Them Breathe and to please never attend any of our events or represent that they are affiliated with us in any way.\" After September's board meeting, Darshana Patel and a board colleague met with the San Diego City Attorney, who assigned a prosecutor to investigate. Some protestors were escorted out by police in handcuffs at the Oct. 14 board meeting. One of them, in a video posted to Facebook, tells an officer, \"You do not have any authority over me. You have no jurisdiction over me.\" Then, on Oct. 19, \"all five board members and the superintendent got a knock at the door,\" at their homes, says Patel. \"And we received a packet of papers from someone impersonating a process server. And it had 16 copies of the same document from 16 different individuals saying that we were abusing children.\" The letters were complaining about the district's mask and vaccine policies. The letter Patel received begins: \"Greetings to the woman Darshana Patel who at times acts as a school board member. This notice serves to address the damage done and still occurring to my young one and others from your acts supporting the issue of the emergency measures of which have been and are being considered ... \" Patel, who has a Ph.D. in biophysics, moved with her family to San Diego from the Bay Area when they were expecting their third child, so she could take a step back from her career and spend more time with her family. But instead, she found herself drawn into public service. And now she's coping with a situation that seems not so much scary or threatening, as completely irrational. \"Ever since the beginning of public education, where there have been school boards, we've had passionate parents come in and give us their opinions and defend their children and speak to their rights and their values,\" she says. \"We expect that, we welcome it. This is a whole different level.\" Patel says her staff is still afraid of holding a meeting that's fully open to the public because they don't know what's going to happen next.",

She is a tenured faculty member at Howard University.\n                \n                    \n                    The New York Times\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nikole Hannah-Jones won a MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant in 2017. She is a tenured faculty member at Howard University. As a child, journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones didn't hear much in school about the role of Black people in U.S. history. \"Black people are largely treated as an asterisk in the American story,\" she says. But Hannah-Jones' awareness changed in high school when she signed up for a Black studies elective. Among the things she learned was the date 1619, significant because it's the year that the White Lion, the first ship carrying enslaved Africans, arrived in the British colony of Virginia \u2014 one year before the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock. \"Every American child learns about the Mayflower, but virtually no American child learned about the White Lion,\" Hannah-Jones says. The omission, she says, is \"symbolic of how history is shaped by people who decide what's important and what's not. And that erasure is also a powerful statement.\" As editor of the New York Times' 1619 Project, Hannah-Jones fought against that erasure. Originally published in 2019 as a special issue of The New York Times Magazine, the project reframed the American story through the lens of slavery. Hannah-Jones was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for her introductory essay. Now, the new book, The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story, expands upon that initial initiative. \"The project argues that slavery is a foundational American institution,\" she says. \"It is one of the oldest American institutions, and that the legacy of the first 250 years of slavery still, of course, permeates throughout society in a variety of ways.\" Students across the country have embraced the ideas contained in the work. But there's also been a backlash by conservatives who have vowed to keep the 1619 Project out of classrooms \u2014 including threats that have been made against her personally. \"People who send threats, people who make threats, what they're really trying to do is silence you,\" she says. But, she adds, \"This is my mission. And so nothing will distract me from that, and I just can't go around worried about what might happen. I just have to do my job.\" On having a realistic view of U.S. history I feel like I have to try to force us to acknowledge the truth about who we are so that we can try to build the country that we believe that we are. Nikole Hannah-Jones The benefit of not having very high expectations in the first place is that you are seldom surprised, though you can be disappointed. When you have the luxury to spend your life studying history, then you understand that the moment that we're in is wholly predictable, and that every time there is a sense of racial progress in this country, it is met by an intensive backlash. And I guess what is difficult is that you would hope we would eventually learn the lessons. But we don't. So I'm motivated by a sense of obligation to all of the ancestors who never could have lived the life that I live, and I have been very blessed to be in the position that I am, and so I feel like I have to try to force us to acknowledge the truth about who we are so that we can try to build the country that we believe that we are. But that requires, for me at least, taking a very unsparing understanding of our country, and some might consider that cynical. But I just think it is a realistic view of where we are and what to expect in these times. On the connection between the protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the backlash against teaching history of structural racism The 1619 Project is specifically banned from being taught in Florida, in Texas and in other states by name. And then, of course, there are many more states that have now passed or are considering these larger, much more vague anti-Critical Race Theory laws, which I would argue are anti-history and memory laws. This all begins to happen around the time of the [George Floyd] protests. And I think that what you saw during the protests were millions of Americans ... and those protests were multiracial, multigenerational. And people were really connecting what they were marching in the streets about to this 400-year struggle against the legacy of slavery. And they were arguing that the reason people were protesting, that the inequality that Black Americans were facing, was not about individual actors, Black people making individual choices and a few \"bad apple\" racists, but that these were structural and that they were going to require a structural solution. ... So it's not incidental that that's when you start to see this really stoking of white resentment through the Saving American History Act. Donald Trump begins to talk about The 1619 Project, and you see this effort to say, \"Look, they want to take your history from you. They want to tell you that you're bad. They want to tell you that all of your heroes are not heroes anymore.\" And that backlash \u2014 I mean this is the argument of The 1619 Project \u2014 there's a reason that racializing our politics is so effective to drive white voters. On the news media's responsibly to speak out against threats to democracy and voting rights I think that this is a time where [journalists] really have to question the stated mainstream mores of our field. And if those actually allow us to rise to the urgency of the moment, this kind of dispassionate view of the world, of our country, of our politics and this both side-ism that we treat both sides as equal, even if one is clearly doing things that are beyond the pale, that are beyond norms, that are actually harmful to our democracy, our sense that to be fair or to be objective, we have to treat them both as equally legitimate is actually one of the things that is weakening our democracy. Our job as journalists is to tell the truth. And sometimes the truth is, one political party doesn't believe in democracy. One political party is actually doing things that are hurtful to democracy. And I really fear that we are not rising to the moment, not enough of us anyway. There certainly is excellent reporting being done. But there's also something about a political press that largely comes from people who have not had to fight for their rights in this society, who have never had their ability to vote and exercise their franchise questioned that they sometimes, I think, report with too much faith in our institutions, or too much faith that things will work out OK. That's not a luxury that Black journalists or journalists of color or journalists from other marginalized groups could ever have. We understand what the worst can be because we have, as a people, experienced that. And so we have it, I think, an innate skepticism that things will work out, that we need to pretend to have objectivity in a country where we're seeing legislatures actively trying to take away our fundamental right as citizens, which is the franchise, which is the key to all other rights. On the term \"woke,\" and if it can be used as a slur I have often and regularly really tried to discourage journalists from using the term \"woke\" because I think it is lazy and I think it is useless, and I do think it has become a dog whistle. What does it mean? What are we saying when we say that? Are we saying that being anti-racist is bad? Are we ... talking about Black people asking and fighting for justice as a bad thing, but we can't say that, so we use woke as this kind of catchall phrase? To me it's to really try to silence or diminish racial justice claims, people who are asking for racial justice. So I think many, many Black people hear it as a slur. One, we know that this is a term that was co-opted from Black people, that this is something that Black people were using. It became co-opted by conservatives in a way that is disparaging. ... I have often and regularly really tried to discourage journalists from using the term 'woke' because I think it is lazy and I think it is useless, and I do think it has become a dog whistle. Nikole Hannah-Jones I don't think that journalists should be using it. And I think when politicians and others use it, we should ask them to define what they mean, because when we're using terms like that, we are expecting people to fill in the blanks, and we're using terms like that because we don't want to be explicit about what it is that we're saying. And journalists should not be letting people get away with that. So I think it can be taken as a racist slur, yes. On reparations not being a serious conversation in the mainstream For my entire lifetime, reparations has not been a political topic that you could have in serious company. It has been treated as a fringe topic. You didn't see mainstream political candidates talking about it. You certainly didn't see cities, municipalities, states and other governments seriously talking about reparations, and there's been a really seismic shift in that conversation. And that is because I think there is a scholarship and a reckoning that is occurring where we are being forced to actually acknowledge the truth about our past. ... There's certainly a cohort of Americans whom you will never convince that anything is owed to Black Americans or anyone else. But I think there's a large segment of Americans, because they have not learned this history well, because they do not understand ... that Black people were trying to get reparations during slavery, immediately after slavery, and have never stopped trying to get that. And so it's not just a matter of \"no one alive today was enslaved.\" It's an ongoing debt. But also that people don't understand that after the end of slavery, we didn't become an equal society, and that the government continued to engage in practices that were harmful to Black Americans and that kept Black Americans from obtaining the same type of wealth and resources and opportunities that other Americans have, and that we still live with that legacy. That is why the study of history is important because we don't learn this history, and so it becomes very hard to understand: Why are these people owed anything? On why Ida B. Wells is her \"spiritual godmother\" I was just astounded that a Black woman, who was born around the time of the emancipation, existed in the form of Ida B. Wells. She was a suffragist, a feminist, a newspaper publisher, an investigative reporter, a co-founder of the NAACP. And she was a woman who stood up to white people, to Black men, to anyone who she thought morally was incorrect and also who was trying to deny rights to anyone. I just never heard of a historical figure like her. As someone who was thinking about journalism as a career myself, one who always understood that as a Black American, if I wanted to be a journalist, there was always going to be a degree of activism to that journalism in this society, that she provided a template for the type of person and journalist and woman I hope to be. And ever since then, I've considered her in some ways kind of my North Star and my spiritual godmother. Sam Briger and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

The last six months have seen dozens of alleged members of the far-right extremist group charged with actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. This was followed by even more marginalization of the group by corporate America. And a late January revelation that the national chairman of the organization was once an informant for law enforcement led some chapters to threaten to splinter off. Founded in 2016 as a self-described \"Western chauvinist\" organization, the Proud Boys is defined as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC's Cassie Miller described the Proud Boys ideology as focusing on the principles \"that politics should be practiced by force, that the country is full of internal enemies, that the United States needs to be reborn or renewed in some way.\" With the law enforcement spotlight on the group, Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio envisions his organization focusing on local political races rather than national ones. \"I've always said my goal for this year ... was simple,\" Tarrio said. \"Start getting more involved in local politics, running our guys for office from local seats, whether it's a simple GOP seat or a city council seat.\" Tarrio will be going local himself. Following a year in which he admits his organization has \"been through the wringer,\" he told NPR he plans to step down as national chairman in September to focus on his chapter in Florida. Tarrio dismissed signs of turmoil within his organization, claiming that hundreds of Proud Boys recently met in Georgia. He added that he has met with chapters that threatened to splinter off, to assuage their concerns, and that \"we're all on the same page.\" The Proud Boys has a national membership of some 30,000, he claimed, though he could not provide any evidence, as there is no central repository of membership. A Wall Street Journal investigation into the group's struggling finances recently revealed that Tarrio secretly ran a T-shirt business that was selling Black Lives Matter merchandise. Tarrio claimed that it was not a sign of financial desperation but a sly prank in which he and the Proud Boys were earning beer money by selling BLM T-shirts. The Proud Boys' new goal of pivoting to local politics appears to be a reaction to the group's marginalization on the national stage. An NPR project tracking the hundreds of individuals prosecuted in the U.S. Capitol riot showed that more than 30 people have alleged Proud Boys connections. Tarrio said his organization had been banned from many major U.S. businesses, including Airbnb, Uber, credit card processors and major banks. At least 30 people with alleged Proud Boys connections have been charged in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to an NPR project tracking the hundreds of individuals being prosecuted in the attack.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At least 30 people with alleged Proud Boys connections have been charged in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to an NPR project tracking the hundreds of individuals being prosecuted in the attack. One person seeking local office is Joel Campbell, a former Proud Boy running for City Council in Topeka, Kan. Campbell, however, said he left the organization after the Jan. 6 insurrection because he believed it had become too far outside the mainstream. In particular, he disagreed with the Capitol riot and members of the Proud Boys who \"were going out looking for fights during ... protests.\" \"I knew that if I wanted to actually seriously pursue a political career, that I could not be associated with them anymore,\" Campbell told NPR. A 34-year-old who got a Proud Boys tattoo on his forearm after former President Donald Trump famously told the group's members to \"stand back and stand by,\" Campbell said he joined because he felt that news outlets and politicians were attacking \"straight white men\" such as himself. His association with the far-right organization has drawn attention in his community, especially after The Topeka Capital-Journal profiled him this year. The notoriety has been a boost for his campaign, Campbell argued. \"The truth is, I haven't spent one campaign dollar. I haven't asked for one donation yet. And I'm probably the most well-known person in Topeka,\" Campbell said. He describes his views as seeking \"minimum government, maximum freedom,\" and added that he is \"very anti-drug war\" \u2014 views that are similar to what drew him to the Proud Boys in the first place. Regardless of whether or not he wins his City Council race in November, Campbell doesn't rule out ever rejoining the group. He said that he hasn't \"given it much thought\" and that he chooses \"not to change anything at this point.\" As for his Proud Boys tattoo \u2014 necessary to become a \"third-degree\" member of the group \u2014 he said he doesn't yet have a plan for removing or covering it up.",

            "article_content": "President Biden's nominee to be the country's next public lands chief appeared before a U.S. Senate panel Tuesday where she was grilled over Biden's controversial freeze on new oil and gas leasing.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The woman President Biden has chosen to lead much of his ambitious climate agenda on U.S. public lands appeared before the Senate today for her confirmation hearing. Montana environmentalist Tracy Stone-Manning has been tapped to be the next director of the Bureau of Land Management. It controls energy development and other activities on a tenth of all the land in the U.S. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: As Montana's former top environmental regulator and chief of staff for that state's former Democratic governor, Tracy Stone-Manning did develop a reputation for bipartisan deal-making, which she repeatedly referenced in her first appearance before the U.S. Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRACY STONE-MANNING: I think that my career has shown that the only way to get things done in the country and specifically in the West is to work together. SIEGLER: Stone-Manning's nomination marks a dramatic reversal from the agency's previous acting director, William Perry Pendley, who hailed from rural Wyoming and once suggested the U.S. government shouldn't even own public land. She's from a liberal pocket of Montana and more reflective of who's been gaining power and influence in much of the West lately - people from cities. New Mexico's Martin Heinrich is a senior Democrat on the committee. The Trump administration pulled Pendley's nomination before it could question him last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN HEINRICH: The BLM has been without a confirmed director - for good reason, in some cases - for almost 4 1/2 years. That should not continue one day longer. SIEGLER: Republicans, though, seized the opportunity to grill Stone-Manning about President Biden's freeze on new oil and gas leasing on public lands. They also argued her campaigning last year on behalf of Democrats was evidence she's a polarizing pick. She shot back, urging the committee to examine her entire career of brokering compromises, she said, on heated public lands battles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STONE-MANNING: Elections can be tough. I was supporting my former boss, Governor Bullock. But the election is over, and I will honor the outcome of that election. SIEGLER: But the ranking Republican on the committee, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, said Stone-Manning's recent tweets reveal a bias against energy companies, ranchers and loggers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN BARRASSO: Based on her record, I'm concerned that Ms. Stone-Manning does not fill the bill. Her career has been defined by her support for policies that restrict multiple-use activities on public lands. SIEGLER: An up or down vote on Stone-Manning's nomination is expected in the coming days. It would then need to go before the full Senate. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Democrats did not do as well in the 2020 Election with Latino voters as they had hoped they would \u2014 particularly in South Florida, where the Latino vote is crucial. So what happened?  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's sample the Democratic Party's debate over the Latino vote. Democrats, as usual, won big in that voter group as they captured the presidency and the Senate in 2020. Yet Ruy Teixeira sees a reason for Democrats to worry about the future. RUY TEIXEIRA: There's no political coalition and no political majority that's secure. INSKEEP: Latinos are a huge part of the Democratic coalition, and their 2020 turnout was way up. Yet that giant group broke a little less toward Democrats than expected - just a few percentage points, but... TEIXEIRA: But that's absolutely millions and millions of votes. INSKEEP: Which is why Teixeira is concerned. TEIXEIRA: Hillary Clinton did not nearly as well in 2016 as they thought she would, given the incredibly high profile of the immigration issue and Donald Trump's, you know, sort of evident racism and, you know, sort of direct hostility against immigrants. They thought they'd carry the Hispanic population by 50 points. It didn't happen. So that should've been concerning back then. And I think these results from 2020 really underscore the extent to which the Hispanic constituency is in play between the Republican and Democratic Party. INSKEEP: Latinos gave Democrats a decisive edge in some places but less support elsewhere. So we called Democrats familiar with one of the places where the party was disappointed, South Florida. Jose Parra is a Democratic consultant in Miami and says Democrats were slow to campaign. JOSE PARRA: Hillary Clinton, you know, won by 30 points in Miami-Dade County, whereas Joe Biden only won by seven points in Miami-Dade County. INSKEEP: How did the Trump campaign approach Miami-Dade and the rest of South Florida? PARRA: Well, they were basically here for the past four years, Donald Trump and Pence had a personal presence here in South Florida. They made sure to exploit any policy decision that they made that remotely affected South Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Venezuela was the wealthiest nation by far in South America. INSKEEP: When President Trump criticized Venezuela or Cuba, it resonated among people who fled those socialist regimes and now live in areas known as Little Havana or Little Caracas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: ...The tyrannical socialist government... INSKEEP: When Trump then labeled Joe Biden a socialist, it resonated, even though he's not. PARRA: That was especially successful for Republicans here because you have a basic community that has a historical trauma that they have to deal with. INSKEEP: Trump campaign ads tried to label the Black Lives Matter movement. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). INSKEEP: What do you hear there, Mr. Parra? PARRA: They equate the Democratic Party with the BLM protests, and they had already tagged BLM as being a socialist Marxist movement. And the Trump campaign also exploited their - some anti-Black bias that does run through the community. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED RADIO SHOW) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). PARRA: There was a radio host here who was saying openly on air that Black Lives Matter was associated with witchcraft. And that sort of messaging penetrated into the community. INSKEEP: People who missed that baseless conspiracy theory on the radio got messages on their phones. Many immigrant communities share political news on the encrypted social media platform WhatsApp. It's a habit some brought from repressive home countries. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). INSKEEP: Democrats finally responded with ads like this in October, which flipped the immigrant community's experience against Trump. PARRA: Basically, you have a Venezuelan American voter describing the reasons why she left Venezuela, why she left the authoritarian regime behind and that she is faced now with the prospect of an authoritarian prolonging his stay in office. INSKEEP: But it was too late for Democrats, who lost Florida and two South Florida congressional seats. Analyst Ruy Teixeira contends that Republican efforts worked in some places because some Latino voters are liberal on economic issues but skeptical of social justice movements. TEIXEIRA: Almost half of Hispanic voters had an unfavorable view of the Black Lives Matter movement. And then, perhaps just as important, if not more so - you look at the more radical demands that became associated with the Black Lives Matter movement over time and that the Democratic Party never completely succeeded in dissociating themselves with. They're very opposed to defunding the police. They're very opposed to the idea you should have less police officers in communities. INSKEEP: So how could Democrats protect their dominance among Latino voters? Tom Perez was chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2012 election. TOM PEREZ: One of the most important things you need to know when you organize Latino voters is, what is their country of origin? INSKEEP: Perez says Democrats track that voter information and also track relevant news, like the hurricane that struck the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 2017. PEREZ: We did very well with Puerto Rican voters in Florida. They remember paper towels and Donald Trump's abject failure in the aftermath of that hurricane. And because we had that data, we could target Puerto Rican voters. INSKEEP: Were there other groups in South Florida you had trouble getting to? PEREZ: The Cuban American vote, the Venezuelan American vote, the Colombian American vote - the levels of disinformation - and we were monitoring this - that we saw during that campaign were very, very significant. INSKEEP: Perez says Democrats did much better in other states, which is a big reason that Joe Biden is president. PEREZ: Well, in Arizona, the socialism pablum fell flat. INSKEEP: Because many Arizona voters with ties to Mexico shared a different experience in Arizona - a 10-year battle over Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He was famous for harsh detention of immigrants until he was convicted of criminal contempt and then pardoned by Donald Trump. PEREZ: And out of those moments where Latino residents were being demonized grew a movement. And what grew out of it was an organizing ecosystem. INSKEEP: Faith groups and nonprofits on the ground countered Republican messages. And Arizona voted for a Democrat for president for the first time in a quarter century. PEREZ: What we have to do is make sure that the work that was done in places like Arizona to build those relationships year round is replicated elsewhere. INSKEEP: It was a 10-year project in Arizona. Is that about how long it takes to build political relations with a community that are really valuable? PEREZ: It took a long time. INSKEEP: Perez says if Democrats invest, they can recover in Florida when places like Texas and cement their party's majority. But if Republicans gain even some ground, elections could look very different. In recent times, the Republican presidential candidate who did best among Latino voters was George W. Bush in 2004. He's also the only Republican in recent times to win the national popular vote. (SOUNDBITE OF LRKR'S \"MOON ROCKS\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Liz Cheney for voting last month to impeach then-President Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Updated at 1:50 p.m. ET Sunday The Wyoming Republican Party voted Saturday to censure Rep. Liz Cheney and also asked her to resign for her vote last month to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6. On Sunday, Cheney defended her decision. \"I think that the people in the party are mistaken. They believe that [Black Lives Matter] and Antifa were behind what happened here at the Capitol. That's just simply not the case, it's not true,\" she told Fox News Sunday about the censure, in which just eight of the party central committee's 74 members opposed the resolution. Evidence and arrests thus far have shown it was largely far-right groups and pro-Trump extremists who planned and carried out the Capitol attack. \"People have been lied to,\" Cheney added. \"The extent to which President Trump, for months leading up to Jan. 6, spread the notion that the election had been stolen or that the election was rigged was a lie, and people need to understand that.\" Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of 10 members of her party who voted to impeach Trump for an unprecedented second time. She has come under fire from Trump loyalists for siding with Democrats in the impeachment. \"As I've explained and will continue to explain to supporters all across the state, voters all across the state: The oath that I took to the Constitution compelled me to vote for impeachment,\" she said. \"It doesn't bend to partisanship, it doesn't bend to political pressure. It's the most important oath that we take, and so I will stand by that.\" Cheney also doubled down on her criticism of Trump, whom she said \"does not have a role as the leader of our party going forward.\" \"The single greatest threat to our republic is a president who would put his own self interest above the Constitution, above the national interest,\" she told Fox. Cheney's censure by her state's GOP is largely symbolic, and it comes after House Republicans decided to let her hold onto her leadership role in Congress. The Wyoming committee also called on her to \"immediately resign,\" according to a copy of the censure published by Forbes. The House vote to impeach Trump, the letter reportedly reads, was done \"with no formal hearings held, no quantifiable evidence presented, no witnesses sworn to give testimony, and no right to cross examine the accusers provided.\" It reportedly says Cheney \"violated the trust of her voters, failed to faithfully represent a very large majority of motivated Wyoming voters, and neglected her duty to represent the party\" and the will of the state's voters. The resolution also falsely states, according to the letter copy, that there was \"ample\" video evidence that the riot at the Capitol was \"instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.\" NPR's calls to the Wyoming Republican Party were not answered. The pressure on Cheney is unlikely to dissipate following the censure. Anthony Bouchard, a state senator planning to run against Cheney in 2022, tweeted a photo of an empty chair with her name on it from Saturday's meeting. \"Today's vote to censure illustrates that Liz Cheney is hopelessly out of touch with Wyoming, Trump's best state TWICE,\" he said. Today's vote to censure illustrates that Liz Cheney is hopelessly out of touch with Wyoming, Trump's best state TWICE. Maybe Liz should run inside the DC Beltway in VA where she lives fulltime, because she's never here and has no clue how we think. And doesn't care. #AWOL pic.twitter.com/BerG7wVTVL Cheney was invited to address the meeting but didn't attend. In late January, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz ignored calls by the Republican leadership to try to cool tensions within the party and flew to Wyoming to campaign against Cheney. Cheney is not the only GOP member to face censure for acting in opposition to Trump. South Carolina's GOP formally censured Rep. Tom Rice over his support for impeachment. And Arizona Republicans rebuked Gov. Doug Ducey, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain \u2014 widow of the late longtime Sen. John McCain \u2014 for taking positions against Trump.

For some, it was the final straw. The U.S. Capitol riots, and the president's behavior both before and after, has soured some of Trump's supporters. For others, it has only ratcheted up their zealous devotion to the president, and their deep frustration with an election they falsely believe was rigged. Carol Jones, 74, from Franklin, Tenn., is among those regretting her support for Trump since Wednesday's insurrection, when thousands of pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building. The protests were timed to coincide with Congress' certification of the Electoral College votes and aimed at pressuring Republican lawmakers into supporting Trump's effort to overturn Biden's electoral victory. The violent confrontations ended in a lockdown, with four casualties and dozens of arrests. \"He started the whole thing. It's just plain as the nose on your face,\" Jones said. \"I don't understand it other than a humongous ego that he had a need to satisfy. It's like he has a mental condition he needs to get a handle on. It's just sad.\" Randy Dittmer, from Liberty, Mo., is fed up with Trump, too. The 62-year-old retired schoolteacher said he watched the rioting on TV in disbelief that it was happening in the United States. \"It was hard to watch,\" he said. \"I lay the blame straight on the president.\" Brenda Baer, a nurse in rural Northwest Pennsylvania, was more circumspect.  The riots, she said, \"were not okay,\" and \"there has to be some accountability\" for Trump. \"He's done a lot of good things,\" she said. \"But I do think he needs to be a little more ... responsible and needs to think a little bit more before he speaks.\" Dylan Costello, 25, and Bobby Manson, 28, both construction workers from Quincy, Mass., see it differently.  They're still proud Trump supporters, with a Trump hat, Trump face mask and Trump stickers on their truck. \"We have some Trump flags here, too, but I can't pull it out because it has some swears on it,\" Manson said with a chuckle. \"I have a lot of respect for Trump, and I always will.\" But the Trump supporters who broke into and ransacked the Capitol building, they say, are a different story. \"They should have never done that,\" Manson said. \"It's like making Trump look like a bad person, and he's really not. They made him look bad.\" Manson credits Trump for eventually tweeting that people should leave the Capitol and go home, though Costello is quick to concede that Trump's tweets and video message after his speech to the crowd on Wednesday were also egging rioters on. \"He tried to play both sides,\" Costello said. \"He played one side, and then the other when everything went down.\" Both Manson and Costello say they sympathize with the frustration of pro-Trump extremists who breached the Capitol. They too, believe the president's baseless claims that the Nov. 3 election was rigged and that President-elect Joe Biden won because of widespread voter fraud. \"Trump was ahead, and then all of a sudden he went down,\" Costello said.  \"Most definitely, there was something going on, but we're never going to find out what actually happened.\" \"It was fraud,\" said Manson. \"100% fraud.\" Another Trump supporter, Jeffrey Stroehmann, also believes Trump's unfounded portrayal of an election rife with corruption, even though courts, state election officials and many leading Republicans have rejected those claims. He travelled from rural central Pennsylvania to Washington and participated in the protests. His intention, he said, was to march peacefully. But once there, when listening to Trump in the morning, and later, surrounded by the angry mob, Stroehmann said he was surprised to find that he, too, was feeling his own rage boiling over. \"There I was going to a different level of protest\" he said. \"I don't feel like I was doing anything wrong,\" he added. As the crowd got increasingly agitated, he said, \"People's pent up frustrations were starting to pour out.\" Stroehmann concedes the violence likely harmed their cause. But, he warns, lawmakers who dismiss Trump's supporters do so at their own peril. \"I think the elected officials need to stop minimizing the concerns of the millions of people who voted for Donald Trump,\" he said.  \"Donald Trump is just the mouthpiece for what we are feeling. Don't look at it as him inciting us. Look at it as him being the person who is vocalizing our frustrations and concerns.\" Gabriel King, a Trump supporter who installs floors in Colorado Springs, also hopes the siege of the Capitol building will serve as a wake-up call to Congress. \"It's hard to see it happening,\" King concedes. \"But on the other hand, I'm tired of being bullied by the scum in D.C. ... They're just criminal trash that lie about everything. Thank God someone finally did something. I'm actually happy about it.\" He's among the many Trump supporters who reject the widespread accusations that the president bears some of the responsibility for inciting the violence. \"At no time did he say smash windows and get violent,\" Stroehmann said. He blames \"outside agitators.\"  The violent rioters at the capitol, he said, \"were not your down-home Trump supporters.\" Other Trump supporters are promoting a conspiracy theory that it was actually left-wing activists, masquerading as Trump supporters, just to make Trump look bad. \"It was Antifa and BLM stealing the Trump flags and playing like they were Trump people,\" said Bonnie Metter, a retired IRS worker from Fresno, Calif. \"It was disgusting.\" Her friend Jane Ochs, 78, agrees. \"It's just a shame that they had to do this to Trump. He's been maligned for four years now. The man doesn't deserve it.\" Sylvia Cervantes from Laredo, Texas, is equally supportive of Trump, but is content to leave the judgement of his sins to God, she said. She urged fellow Trump supporters to stop being \"crazy,\" and to accept that Trump lost. \"It's time to move on,\" she said.",

The Trump administration has held the first oil lease sale in the refuge.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n                    \n                \nhide caption Caribou graze on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Trump administration has held the first oil lease sale in the refuge. Updated at 7:54 pm ET One of the Trump administration's biggest environmental rollbacks suffered a stunning setback Wednesday, as a decades-long push to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ended with a lease sale that attracted just three bidders \u2014 one of which was the state of Alaska itself. Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation was the only bidder on nine of the parcels offered for lease in the northernmost swath of the refuge, known as the coastal plain. Two small companies also each picked up a single parcel. Half of the offered leases drew no bids at all. \"They held the lease in ANWR \u2014 that is history-making. That will be recorded in the history books and people will talk about it,\" said Larry Persily, a longtime observer of the oil and gas industry in Alaska . \"But no one showed up.\" The sale generated a tiny fraction of the revenue it was projected to raise. It was a striking moment in a 40-year fight over drilling in the coastal plain, an area that's home to migrating caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. It also potentially sits atop billions of barrels of oil, according to federal estimates. But amid a global recession, low oil prices and an aggressive pressure campaign against leasing by drilling opponents, oil analysts have for months been predicting little interest in the sale. Persily took the sale as evidence that while drilling in the refuge remains a long-held dream of some politicians, it is no longer treasured by oil companies. \"It was, in the oil industry terms, a dry hole. A bust,\" he said. \"They had the lease sale, the administration can feel good about it, but no one's going to see any oil coming out of ANWR.\" Even Kara Moriarty, head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, acknowledged that the sale results weren't as \"robust\" as expected. But she said the industry still supports future access to the coastal plain. \"Today's sale reflects the brutal economic realities the oil and gas industry continues to face after the unprecedented events of 2020, coupled with ongoing regulatory uncertainty,\" she said in a statement. The lease sale raised a total of $14.4 million in bids, according to the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency that held the sale. Nearly all of that came from Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority. Half of the cash will go to the federal government, and half will go back to the state of Alaska. Rep. Deb Haaland at a 2018 rally in Washington, D.C., to oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. President-elect Joe Biden has tapped Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public Media\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Deb Haaland at a 2018 rally in Washington, D.C., to oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. President-elect Joe Biden has tapped Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. The amount raised is nowhere near what was projected when a Republican-led Congress officially opened the coastal plain to drilling in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill ordered two lease sales, the first by the end of this year, with the revenue aimed at offsetting massive tax cuts. Despite the lack of industry interest, Alaska's Congressional delegation applauded the sale on Wednesday, and so did officials with the Bureau of Land Management, describing it as historic and a success. \"It was a joke\" Opponents had a different reaction. \"I laughed out loud. It was a joke. A joke to the American people,\" said Desir\u00e9e Sorenson-Groves, director of the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign. \"I'll tell you, I have a message to those who bid today, there were only three. But here's the message: 'You will never ever drill in the Arctic Refuge. We'll stop you.'\" The land that received no bids on Wednesday will not be leased in this sale. Of the two small companies that did win leases, one is Regenerate Alaska, a subsidiary of Australia-based 88 Energy. The other is Knik Arm Services, a small Alaska company managed by an investor named Mark Graber. The state-owned entity which dominated the sale, has never held federal oil leases before. But Alaska politicians, including former Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski, recently pushed the state to bid, citing the lack of industry interest. Murkowski, in an interview Wednesday, said he expects the corporation to eventually partner with companies to do the actual drilling. \"We'll see how good an investment it is when we see what the interest is from some companies to negotiate,\" he said. The oil leases are still not finalized. That process, which includes an anti-trust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, typically takes about two months. But the Trump administration is expected to rush to issue the leases formally before the president leaves office in two weeks. Even if it succeeds, additional oil leasing and drilling in the refuge will face headwinds, said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., a longtime drilling opponent. He said his next step will be pushing for \"permanent protection\" for the Arctic refuge. He's likely to have support from a Biden administration. The president-elect and his appointee to lead the Interior Department have both said they oppose drilling there, and Georgia's run-off elections give Democrats control of the Senate along with the House. Huffman said he's open to a compromise with drilling boosters \u2014 from the state of Alaska to Indigenous I\u00f1upiaq leaders in Kaktovik, the only community inside the refuge's boundaries \u2014  that would provide them with alternative paths toward economic development. \"We're not hostile to taking care of the interests here, and helping put folks on a path of economic development that makes sense and that's sustainable,\" Huffman said. Roger Herrera, a retired BP executive and longtime lobbyist for an Alaska group that pushed Congress to open the refuge, said he was \"hugely disappointed\" in the results of the sale. \"Alaska is a natural resource state,\" he said in a phone interview. \"You take away its natural resources and it has basically nothing.\"",

            "article_content": "Authorities in the nation's capital were on high alert for possible violence, as far-right demonstrators rallied.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: The mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 continues to have ripple effects throughout the country, and that's where we're going to start today. Remember, back in January, thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol to try to stop lawmakers from certifying the lawful election of Joe Biden as president. And there are still those who refuse to accept the results of the election. Today, there was a rally in Washington, D.C., in support of people being held for their involvement in the January 6 attack. Authorities worried it could turn violent. But as it turns out, the scene today looked very different from the one eight months ago. NPR's Tom Bowman was there, and he's with us now. Tom, thank you so much for being here. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So would you just set the scene for us? How was the turnout? BOWMAN: Well, you know, they expected some 700 people. And I would say no more than 50 or so showed up, you know. They carried American flags and signs saying, Justice for January 6. They wore red, white and blue shirts. And it was almost completely peaceful. We saw only one argument between the competing groups of protesters and counterprotesters. The police weighed in, pulled one of the guys away to cool off, no arrests. And there were actually maybe even more journalists than protesters. Besides local press, there were reporters from all over the world, from Canada, France, Turkey and Belgium. And again, a very, very small turnout at this rally. MARTIN: Of those few who did turn out, what was their message? What were they saying? BOWMAN: Well, the overall message was protesting the continued confinement of those arrested during the January 6 insurrection. Now, of course, some 600 were arrested that day. Most have been released or working on plea deals. Now, there are some 78 still being held, and those are charged with more serious crimes of beating up law enforcement or media or have prior criminal records. Now, one woman named Janie (ph) from South Carolina and Phil (ph) from Kentucky - they only allowed first names 'cause, you know, they don't trust the media. And some of the speakers actually said don't talk to the press. Now, both said there are many more people in jail than the government is reporting. And this is something we heard from several people along with the fact that they believe antifa and Black Lives Matter members actually broke into the Capitol posing as Trump supporters. Let's listen. PHIL: And those weren't Trump supporters. BOWMAN: Who were they? PHIL: They were all wearing - I don't know. I didn't ask them their names. But they were blacked out in gear. JANIE: So they wore black helmets, black clothes, black backpacks. And who started bursting the windows first? There were some Trump supporters trying to fight them off. I'm sure there were Trump supporters who got involved. But initially, what I saw was what looked like either BLM or antifa. BOWMAN: And, of course, Michel, I was there that day, January 6, for the insurrection. There's no evidence at all that there was any antifa people or Black Lives Matter people in that crowd. I saw them with my own eyes. Those who have been arrested clearly were Trump supporters. There's no evidence of that. And, Michel, it's also worth mentioning that almost everyone we talked with also did not trust the COVID vaccine, including that woman Janie, who says she's a nurse practitioner and does not want to get the vaccine. MARTIN: That is NPR's Tom Bowman. Tom, thank you. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Michel. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATT GAETZ: Now we know that the swamp isn't truly drained until we've nailed the hides of the alligators to the wall. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Republican Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida on December 19 and Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert on January 1. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOUIE GOHMERT: That you got to go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and BLM 'cause... GARCIA-NAVARRO: Conservative media, meanwhile, fed the flames. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) MARK LEVIN: On January 6, we learn whether our Constitution will hold. JEANINE PIRRO: January 6 will tell us whether there are any in Congress willing to battle for the America that those soldiers... GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mark Levin and Jeanine Pirro, January 3. Here's Alex Jones on the ground in D.C. the night before the attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEX JONES: They have tried to steal this election in front of everyone. I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want a fight, they better believe they got one. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And here's what he had to say to his audience after the assault. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JONES: The White House told me three days before, we'll lead you to a point, take you out of the front row and lead you to the place where they want you to start the march. And Trump will tell people, go and I'm going to meet you at the Capitol. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Inside the Capitol during the proceedings on January 6, the first lawmaker to rise and formally challenge the results of the election was Republican Paul Gosar. And in that moment, NPR's Kirk Siegler saw a thread running through recent American history. Kirk joins us now from our bureau in Boise. Hi, Kirk. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We know there's a long history of violent rhetoric in American political history and, in fact, a long history of violence. But what was it that jumped out to you when that congressman from Arizona stood up? SIEGLER: Well, it's that some of the roots of the Capitol insurrection you can trace right through the Western U.S. In the West, tapping anti-government sentiment resonates in some places, part just because the federal government is just a huge presence here. It owns so much land, unlike back East. So, you know, Lulu, you can go way back - well before Election Day, of course - and the kind of commentary that followed it that we just heard. In the '90s, some elected officials refused to condemn and sometimes supported far-right militia groups here in the West. And today, some of the loudest calls for overturning the free and fair election come from Western lawmakers like Gosar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL GOSAR: You know what? Imagine this - that you can just sit and go back home once we conquer the Hill. Donald Trump is returned to being president. (CHEERING) GOSAR: And amazing things will happen with four more years. (CHEERING) GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Gosar in a rally in Phoenix, December 19. SIEGLER: That's right. He later, after the insurrection, condemned the violence. But more importantly, some Republican senators who had planned to vote against certifying the Electoral College reversed course. And one of them is Steve Daines from Montana. His campaign, as you may recall, even solicited donations for his staff to travel to Arizona to monitor ballot counting following President Trump's bogus fraud claims. But Daines explained his decision to reverse course in an interview with Yellowstone Public Radio. Let's listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEVE DAINES: I wanted to make sure we had a moment of unity, particularly coming off of the horrible events of Wednesday 'cause when it came time to actually vote on that objection, I voted no. SIEGLER: And then there's the outgoing president himself. After urging on the mob, Trump issued a statement saying there must be no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind. Now, experts in extremism see a clear historical pattern here - politicians courting the far-right right up to a certain point. RICHARD WHITE: They go up to them with - to the Capitol steps. They let them go in by themselves. SIEGLER: Professor Richard White is a Western historian at Stanford. WHITE: They egg them on. They egg them on. They support them in principle. And when they do something crazy and stupid and violent, they say, no, we were never talking about that. SIEGLER: White says this is a pattern that's been going on since the 1990s. Some politicians, especially in the West, sympathized with militia groups that gained traction. Remember the standoffs at Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge, Idaho; and the Freemen in Mont., the self-described Christian patriots who tried to secede. White says back then, lawmakers like the late Idaho Congresswoman Helen Chenoweth and Steve Stockman of Texas curried votes by capitalizing on anti-government sentiment. By the way, Stockman had been in jail on fraud and other felony charges until President Trump commuted his sentence in December. Extremism experts say this behavior from elected leaders of either tacit or overt support for lawbreaking and extremism could lead to more violence. Eric Ward runs the Western States Center in Oregon. ERIC WARD: It is time to understand that there is an armed insurrectionist movement in the United States that seeks to overthrow American democracy. SIEGLER: After the attack on the U.S. Capitol, 147 lawmakers still voted to challenge the counting of electoral votes. One of them was the new far-right congresswoman from rural Colorado, Lauren Boebert. She's under criticism for tweeting during the insurrection that the House speaker had left the chamber. Here's Boebert talking about her defense of the Second Amendment in a recent interview with Breitbart. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAUREN BOEBERT: This is our check on government. The Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting, unless you're talking about hunting tyrants, maybe (laughter). SIEGLER: Plenty of Second Amendment supporters in this region, including Montana's Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester, don't see it that way. Tester had some of the harshest words in Congress for his colleagues who supported overturning a democratic election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JON TESTER: I have damn little respect for people who wrap themselves in the flag and then try to burn this country down. SIEGLER: So Lulu, Tester went on to call the Trump loyalists who stormed the U.S. Capitol domestic terrorists. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Kirk Siegler with that really important context. Thank you very much. SIEGLER: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "There's a fledgling effort to organize against far-right ideology that's moving into Idaho's political mainstream.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Far-right extremist activity is not new in Idaho. You may remember the deadly standoff between a fundamentalist white separatist group and federal law enforcement at Ruby Ridge back in 1992. There's evidence that extremist ideas are becoming more mainstream there, and now an organized effort to push back is trying to establish itself. From Boise, Heath Druzin has this report. HEATH DRUZIN, BYLINE: Well before the U.S. Capitol insurrection, this was happening in Boise. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting, unintelligible). (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) DRUZIN: That's an anti-government mob shattering a glass door while storming the Idaho Capitol in August over pandemic restrictions. Tactics like that have become commonplace in Idaho, where what was once fringe is now mainstream. And it's not just happening at the state Capitol. Alicia Abbot lives in Sandpoint, where armed militia members took to the streets this summer. ALICIA ABBOT: It was very frightening to have a few days' worth of anti-government thinkers and COVID conspiracy theorists, anti-BLM protesters out in our streets with high-capacity weapons. DRUZIN: After that, she joined a new anti-extremist group. She and others worry about state lawmakers like Chad Christensen. He's also a member of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, militia movements whose members have been implicated in the U.S. Capitol insurrection. Christensen rejects the extremist and militia labels. CHAD CHRISTENSEN: I believe I follow the Constitution and uphold it. And these days, you know, that's viewed as extreme, I think. DRUZIN: Not everyone sees it that way. (SOUNDBITE OF HORNS HONKING) DRUZIN: That's members of the Idaho 97 project at a car rally for early childhood education in Boise. They formed in December to push back on what they see as radical ideologies. The number is a jab at the Three Percent militia movement and a nod to what the group's executive director, Mike Satz, says is a quiet majority who thinks state politics has gone off the rails. MIKE SATZ: We have shared values. We have more in common than we have in different. DRUZIN: He's dismayed by elected officials in all-out rebellion against the governor's pandemic orders and lawmakers like Christensen praising our men and women who have come out to counter anti-racism protests. Satz says, as a Black man in a largely white state, that makes Idaho feel unwelcoming. SATZ: It has a very negative effect, and it has a deep, deep history for people of color in particular when people show up armed. DRUZIN: The Idaho 97 is officially nonpartisan, but critics have pointed to liberal activism by founding members. Satz acknowledges that's a tough perception to overcome in conservative Idaho. So far, the group's results have been mixed. They claim more than 13,000 newsletter subscribers and collected 11,000 signatures on a petition calling for stricter pandemic precautions. But the petition remains unanswered, and the car rally attracted just a couple dozen people. SATZ: I am under no illusion that this is an easy task. DRUZIN: The Idaho 97 project is one of several anti-extremism groups across the political spectrum that have popped up in the region. Amy Cooter, who studies far-right groups at Vanderbilt University, says one challenge these groups face is recent success by far-right candidates. AMY COOTER: I think it's absolutely a trend, both at the state and the national level, where we maybe have a good number of Republicans who feel like things are going too far but who fear they'll lose the next election if they actually say that. DRUZIN: Cooter sees a mixed forecast for anti-extremist groups. She doesn't think militia groups take them seriously, but... COOTER: Long-term, those sorts of coalitions might actually be something that helps us move past such a divided political moment. DRUZIN: Idaho 97 organizer Mike Satz acknowledges change won't come quickly. SATZ: We're looking at years and years and years of standing up to this. DRUZIN: But he says he's in it for the long haul.

            "article_content": "Support for Black Lives Matter erupted after the murder of George Floyd by former police officer Derek Chauvin. But activists say many posts targeting Black Lives Matter are full of disinformation.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: One year ago today, George Floyd died under the knee of a police officer and protests erupted worldwide. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) George Floyd. George Floyd. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Black lives... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Matter. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Black lives... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Matter. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Black lives... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Matter. MARTIN: Support surged for Black Lives Matter, a movement that began with an online hashtag, and today, there's still lots of support for the movement online. Posts on social media continue to call for racial justice and an end to police brutality. But there are also posts that are riddled with disinformation. Activists charge that's part of an overall effort to undermine Black Lives Matter and its message. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Log on to a social media account, and there's a myriad of posts about Black Lives Matter, including plenty of disparaging ones, like this one that falsely claims the government has identified it as a terrorist group. Another that circulated widely claimed that BLM activists had badly beaten a group of elderly white people. That post has been debunked by fact-checkers, who found the photos were taken in South Africa years ago, and it has been taken down. However, Jordan Giger, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in Indiana, says there's still plenty of disinformation online designed to cause confusion and distrust. JORDAN GIGER: Like reports circulating that BLM is going to vandalize businesses in downtown areas, that we are targeting specific white communities, those kinds of things. It makes our supporters say, OK, I don't want to get involved in that, right? And so when disinformation just goes unchecked, folks will believe it if you don't get ahead of it or respond to it appropriately. CORLEY: Giger says that's why BLM launched an effort to stop disinformation and urges people to send in details about suspicious posts or stories to the Black Lives Matter website. Win Black/Pa\u2019lante, a nonpartisan group created after the 2016 presidential election, also monitors disinformation aimed at people of color. Hundreds of organizers across the country formed a digital war room during last year's election. They tracked bots that automatically send out scripted disinformation, often from Russia or other foreign governments trying to sow discord in the U.S. And they tracked what are known as digital blackface accounts that steal images to masquerade as Black people and spread disinformation. Ashley Bryant, one of the co-leaders of Win Black/Pa'lante, says they also found conspiracy theories about Black Lives Matter. ASHLEY BRYANT: That went everything from George Floyd not being dead to, you know, George Soros funding protests and then the full out attacks on Black Lives Matter, where there's foreign actors, there's fake accounts pretending to be antifa, all to actually just build this violent narrative around Black Lives Matter. CORLEY: University of North Carolina professor Deen Freelon studies digital politics. He points to specific instances of disinformation about Black Lives Matter protesters engaging in violence. DEEN FREELON: There was a false story about a Black Lives Matter allied protesters setting fires in Oregon, so connecting to the wildfires there; the claim that Black Lives Matter is white led. There has been some Spanish-language disinformation. CORLEY: Freelon says Twitter has been vigilant about rooting out state-sponsored disinformation from foreign actors. Facebook says it's taken several steps, too, including working with non-partisan and independent fact-checkers to root out the spread of fake stories. Information proven to be false can be removed for violating social media standards. That's not the case when it comes to posts online that are technically considered an opinion. Freelon says, that's harder to combat. FREELON: Examples there include things like the notion that BLM is antiwhite, which of course is an opinion, that it is a hate group, that it's somehow anti-family, that it is morally equivalent to far-right groups. And then there are some things that kind of blur the line between fact and opinion. CORLEY: Critics of Black Lives Matter say it's the movement's supporters that are getting duped. MIKE GONZALEZ: I feel that Black Lives Matter is one of the greatest sources of disinformation. CORLEY: Mike Gonzalez is a senior fellow with The Heritage Foundation. He's the author of an upcoming book about Black Lives Matter and Marxism. GONZALEZ: They have good Americans, good Americans, well-intentioned Americans who do not want to see racial injustice, and rightly so, putting up signs on their lawn about Black Lives Matter. They have manipulated the good nature of many people who think what they're doing, in my view, is trying to promote a philosophy that is not going to be good for this country, will destroy this country and will destroy our way of life. CORLEY: And then right-wing pundits like Rudy Giuliani, Candace Owens and Carol Swain amplify often baseless anti-BLM messages to wider audiences. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) RUDY GIULIANI: Black Lives Matter wants to come and take your house away from you. They want to take your property away from you. CANDACE OWENS: Far-left crazy antifa thugs who know exactly what they're doing. CAROL SWAIN: Using Black people to advance a Marxist agenda. CORLEY: On her YouTube channel, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter, responds. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"AM I A MARXIST?\") PATRISSE KHAN-CULLORS: I need to set the record straight. Am I a Marxist? CORLEY: Khan-Cullors says she does believe in Marxism but laughs at the online comments that say she's pushing a communist agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"AM I A MARXIST?\") KHAN-CULLORS: I'm working on making sure that people don't suffer. I'm working to make sure people don't go hungry. And these comments that I've received have been incredibly hurtful. It means that so many people aren't really taking our work very seriously. CORLEY: The dean of the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, says some of the disinformation surrounding Black Lives Matter could be from the old style anti-civil rights playbook of the 1960s. Brown-Nagin says the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover and segregationists repeatedly used disinformation in an attempt to besmirch that movement. TOMIKO BROWN-NAGIN: So opponents characterize activists as lawbreakers or as violent, when overwhelmingly they were nonviolent. And Martin Luther King Jr. and members of his inner circle were said to be communists or communist sympathizers. CORLEY: And like the civil rights movement back then, Black Lives Matter has seen its support both rise and decline after months of protest and the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin. While polls show a large majority of African Americans continue to back the movement, overall support has dropped from record levels seen after George Floyd's death. How much of that loss is due to disinformation is difficult to measure. But what's certain is the battle over controlling what people believe about Black Lives Matter and its influence is ongoing.
