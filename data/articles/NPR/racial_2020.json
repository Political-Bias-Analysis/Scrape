Since 1970, Indigenous people have gathered at noon on Cole's Hill in Plymouth to commemorate a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving. For Walter Fleming, an enrolled member of the Kickapoo tribe in Kansas, Thanksgiving will be difficult this year because so many Native Americans have died from COVID-19. \"Particularly because it's been among our elders, the grieving is gonna be that much more,\" Fleming said. \"These are the cultural guardians.\" Fleming is a professor of Native American studies at Montana State University, who observes the holiday. He says it's a chance for people to come together, feast and celebrate. \"It's not because they've been colonized or because they might support any myths around Thanksgiving,\" Fleming said. \"It is that we've grown up with the custom of celebrating Thanksgiving. It's just been a feast day.\" Some Native Americans celebrate Thanksgiving by taking the opportunity to gather with loved ones and focus on gratitude. Others consider it a day for mourning because it perpetuates the myth that Pilgrims had a symbiotic relationship with Indigenous people and glosses over past atrocities committed against Native Americans. \"The myths behind the Thanksgiving holiday have been a factor in erasing Indigenous realities for decades, especially the myth that the Pilgrim and other European invasions were peaceful or friendly,\" said Mahtowin Munro, who is Lakota, and co-leader of the United American Indians of New England. This year Thanksgiving comes as chronically under-resourced Native populations are contracting COVID-19 at record rates. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that Native Americans are 3.5 times more likely to get COVID-19 than white people. According to the CDC, more than 53,000 Native Americans and Alaska Natives have contracted the virus and nearly 1,300 have died \u2014 a number that is likely an underestimate because many jurisdictions don't compile data on ethnicity. Thanksgiving also comes on the heels of widespread protests demanding racial justice. Native Americans have their own history with police brutality, and are incarcerated and killed by police at disproportionately high rates. SomeIndigenous and Black advocacy groups have partnered together in the push for racial justice. Following the record-breaking election of six Native Americans to Congress, some advocates are hopeful the nation's latest reckoning with race will lead to change. \"I think there is a strong and empowered desire, and not just from Indigenous peoples, but from a broader body politic,\" said Shannon O'Loughlin, who is Choctaw, and executive director of the Association on American Indian Affairs. But, Native leaders say, more needs to be done. \"I don't think there can be any reconciliation until conditions actually change for Native people,\" Munro said. \"This is not just about history and Thanksgiving; this is about what is happening right now in 2020.\" While the injustices are clear, O'Loughlin says, addressing them is hard at a time when people are polarized. \"I think people want to resolve the burdens of our history. I think what's been painful is that people don't know how to do it,\" O'Loughlin said, adding that taking the day as a chance to combat racism is a step forward. \"Even if it's only one day,\" said O'Loughlin, \"it's an opportunity for us to re-learn.\" Here are some ways educators and Native leaders recommend bringing anti-racism to the table this year: Piper McDaniel is an intern on NPR's National Desk.",

This week's episode of Code Switch focused on these Generation Z Latinos \u2014 a fast-growing group of voters who could have a huge impact on the 2020 presidential election. And yet, for decades, pundits and politicians alike have predicted that Latinos will have a huge impact on elections \u2014 and that's never quite panned out. (Latinos have, historically, had lower turnout rates in elections than other racial and ethnic demographics.) So to understand how the Latinx vote has played a part in past election cycles, we talked to Geraldo Cadava, a history professor at Northwestern University and author of the book The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, From Nixon to Trump. Here's the extended cut of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity. Your book is all about how Latinos have arrived at their politics throughout history \u2014 specifically Republican Latinos. How would you sum up how that process works? Latinos became increasingly politically active after the World War II years; many Latinos served in World War II, and that gave them expectations about how they should be included in all aspects of American society: socially, economically and politically. Many more Latinos went to college, bought homes and also began to vote and become politically active. And the parties really started to reach out to Latinos after World War II, because the Latino population started to grow in areas like Texas, California, Arizona and Florida, which were becoming more and more electorally important. That's also the moment when Latinos themselves become more politically active as part of their drive for civil rights. There was a moment in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the Latino population was growing, and Time magazine had a cover story that projected that the 1980s were going to be the \"decade of the Hispanic.\" And there's an argument that Latinos are the \"sleeping giant\" who are about to awaken and control American politics in the late 20th and 21st century. It's kind of amazing to me that every four years, there's this idea that Latinos are about to break out of their shell and really determine elections; it's like pundits and politicians rediscover them every four years. Like you said, every election cycle, there's this idea that this metaphorical \"sleeping giant\" of Latinos will somehow come out of the woodwork and have a huge impact. Has it ever really panned out? I should say, first of all, that the image of the sleeping giant feels like not a great image. There are all of these caricatures of Mexicans dating back to the early to mid-20th century, of us wearing serapes and sombreros, leaning against a wall with a bottle of tequila. We're always asleep and lazy, and it plays into this idea that we're apathetic. So I think the whole image is not great. There is this perennial argument that we hear every four years, that Latinos are going to be the critical voters in this election. And I think that idea mainly comes from the fact that our population is growing. In 2020, we're projected to be the second-largest group of American voters, and the largest nonwhite group of voters. We are going to represent about 14% of the American electorate. This year, a Latino becomes eligible to vote every 30 seconds. And they're going to be a million more Latino voters this time than four years ago. So for all of these reasons, there's this idea that there's a lot of political momentum, and politicians had better start paying attention to us because we hold political power. But there has also been this ongoing sense that we're, to put it crudely, punching below our weight. We're not reaching our full potential because we don't register to vote in as high numbers as other groups. But [high Latino turnout] has panned out in certain elections, like the 1964 election. For example, when Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter won in Texas. This was the last time that a Democrat won Texas. But he won by a very slim margin, and largely his victory in Texas was attributed to his success among Mexican Americans. I think we can point to the 2000 election in Florida, where George W. Bush won in Florida by a mere few hundred votes. And there was the Elian Gonzalez story, where George W. Bush and Jeb Bush, his brother who was the governor of Florida at the time, took a strong stance, saying that there's no way that Elian Gonzalez should be returned to his family in Cuba. And that really kind of galvanized Cuban American support for George W. Bush. And in 2012, by all accounts, Mitt Romney woke up on Election Day thinking that he was going to win the election \u2014 but Obama won. And in the days after the election, many made the argument that Obama's success among Latinos in swing states like Colorado and New Mexico and Virginia had made the difference and tipped the election in favor of him. So if [the \"sleeping giant\" prediction] has ever panned out, it has panned out in particular elections, and in particular swing states, when they're very narrowly contested. But I think that many Latino get-out-the-vote organizers are still waiting for the moment when Latinos are going to realize their full political power. We know that Latinos vote at fairly low rates compared with other groups of Americans. So I think there is still a sense that our political potential is not yet fully realized. Why haven't those voting turnout rates been higher? For a long time, the [conventional] answer was that Latino voters are apathetic, and they don't care about politics. And that's the main argument that political scientists have tried to argue against for a long time. What they increasingly point to is a few different factors. One is that Latinos feel alienated from the political process. We've read reports that as late as August or July, some 60% of Latinos said they'd had no candidate reach out to them. And this is a kind of historical phenomenon. Latinos have argued for a long time that American politics and electoral politics wasn't made for them. There are some other explanations about how many Latinos live in noncompetitive states, like California, Illinois and New York. And so they don't feel like their votes matter because they're not making a difference. And more generally, when we talk about elections and presidential politics, we are paying so much attention to Latinos in Arizona, Texas and Florida, critical battlegrounds. So Latinos in those states are hyper-visible, while Latinos everywhere else are ignored and invisible. Apart from the idea that Latinos are apathetic, what are the biggest misconceptions that people have about Latinos and voting? This is so tricky, because there's both a lot of truth and a lot of misconceptions. I mean, there's the way that people segment the Latino population in their minds. There's the idea that Florida is all Cubans and Cuban Americans when, in fact, Florida is incredibly diverse. There are large Mexican and Puerto Rican populations. And they have so many different interests and issues that they care about. So it's really hard to stereotype them. And there's the idea that the whole Southwest is Mexican American when, in fact, there are many Central Americans who live there. Latinos are truly a national population and a growing population everywhere we live, but the way that we get talked about is still very much about the Cuban vote in Florida, the Mexican American vote in California or the Puerto Rican vote in New York. And, you know, there's almost like this hierarchy of our politics, from more conservative to less conservative \u2014 that Cuban Americans are the most conservative, Mexican Americans are somewhere in the middle and then Puerto Ricans are the most liberal of Latino voters. And there's a degree of truth to that; Cuban Americans vote for Republicans at higher rates than Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, but Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans still vote for Republicans in really large numbers. Let me tell you one fact that always astounds me: California has the largest number of eligible Latino voters: 8 million. Recent polls have shown that Donald Trump is earning somewhere between 25% to 30% of their support. That means that if all of those 8 million eligible Latino voters vote, more than 2 million Latino voters in California \u2014 the state of Proposition 187, the state where the Republican Party is dead \u2014 there will be more than 2 million Latinos who vote for Donald Trump. Compare that with Florida, which has 3.1 million Latino eligible voters. In 2016, 35% of Latinos in Florida voted for Donald Trump: That's around 1 million votes. And if that holds true in 2020, there will be more Latinos who vote for Donald Trump in California than in the state of Florida. And that's just one example of how, if you really dig in to individual communities and the politics of individual states, there's a lot that you would be surprised to learn. And as you've been watching this election cycle, what do you see pundits and candidates misunderstand about this voting bloc? When I hear pundits talk about the Latino vote, they're still assuming that all Latinos are out there are reachable by Democrats. And it's just a matter of committing more time, committing more energy and resources; Latinos are just waiting to be given a reason to vote for Democrats. And I think that that completely misses the point that Hispanic Republicans have developed their partisan identities and their loyalty to the Republican Party over a long period of time. There are a handful of issues, like school choice or religious freedom or the ghost of anti-socialism and anticommunism, that continue to draw Hispanics into the Republican Party. There's a real diversity of political beliefs, and we need to acknowledge that Latinos are fully human, complicated political actors, rather than just kind of pawns that are easily poached or persuaded, just because a politician talks to them. In your research, you've found that both Republicans and Democrats have called Hispanics \"natural\" Democrats or \"natural\" Republicans \u2014 but you disagree with this premise. Can you lay out why they say that, and why you disagree? I don't think Latinos are naturally anything; that would mean that we're born with these fully formed political identities. To call them naturally liberal or conservative comes from a place of ignorance and not knowing much about who Latinos are as political actors. Reagan is probably the most famous example of someone who tried to argue that Latinos are natural conservatives. And it was a statement that he apparently delivered to one of his Hispanic campaign organizers, an advertising executive named Lionel Sosa from San Antonio. Reagan told him, you know, you're going to have the easiest job ever, because Latinos are Republicans who just don't know it yet. And it was his campaign that, for the first time, tried to articulate these core values that supposedly brought together all Latino conservatives; they talked about family values, a hard work ethic, patriotism, belief in the free enterprise system and anti-communism, and all of the kinds of military sacrifices that Latino families had made for the United States. These are ideas we still hear them today uttered by the Latinos for Trump campaign. So they've been kind of remarkably persistent in their message over a long period of time. I'm always reminded this year of that Joe Biden line that \"if you're Black and support Donald Trump, you ain't Black.\" Democrats have had plenty of those moments when it comes to Latinos, too. In 2010, Harry Reid from Nevada said that he couldn't understand how even a single Hispanic could be a Republican. So I think you have both parties taking for granted that Latinos are naturally one way or the other. And I think when they do that, they risk not taking Latinos seriously as individuals and communities with deeply held political beliefs.",

The Department of Justice has set aside $3 million in grants and established a National Response Center aimed strengthening police reforms and reducing the use of excessive force by law enforcement. Federal officials unveiled the initiative in Minnesota Tuesday and expressed hope the city of Minneapolis would be the first jurisdiction to take advantage of the program. The announcement comes five months after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police on Memorial Day. That encounter, captured on cell phone video then posted to social media, sparked international protests against police brutality and systemic racism. \"I'm encouraged and excited about the offer,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said at a media briefing. \"I have been working on our plans in creating a new MPD and this would be a key component to that.\" He added that the grant would provide additional support for training officers, and assist with reviewing current policing policies, as well as providing for the mental health of officers. Arradondo also said he hoped city leaders would agree to accept the offer from the Department of Justice and noted the police department has lost an estimated 130 officers compared to this time last year. He said he anticipates more officers will leave before the end of 2020. Katharine Sullivan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Office of Justice Programs billed the initiative as a \"tactical center that will surge resources\" to assist law enforcement agencies. She said the response center will be run by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a nonprofit organization based in Alexandria, Va., which will help with recruiting and retaining officers. The announcement comes two weeks ahead of the presidential election where issues of policing, racial tensions and civil unrest in cities across the U.S. are top campaign issues. Since Floyd's death in May, he and other Black Americans who have been killed or seriously injured by police this year, including Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and Jacob Blake, have become rallying cries at demonstrations. The Minneapolis City Council banned the use of chokeholds and other neck restraints in June, less than two weeks after Floyd's death. The city council also approved an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which opened a civil rights investigation in the wake of Floyd's killing. All four officers involved in the Floyd incident have been fired from the police department and face criminal charges linked to his death. Derek Chauvin, the then-officer who is seen kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes in the video, faces second-degree and third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The other three, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and Alexander Kueng, face charges of aiding and abetting murder in the killing of Floyd. All have been released from jail on bond and their trial is expected to get underway in March.",

In late March, shortly after New York state closed nonessential businesses and asked people to stay home, Ashley Laderer began waking each morning with a throbbing headache. \"The pressure was so intense it felt like my head was going to explode,\" the 27-year-old freelance writer from Long Island recalls. She tried spending less time on the computer and taking over-the-counter pain medication, but the pounding kept breaking through \u2014 a constant drumbeat to accompany her equally incessant worries about COVID-19. \"Every day I lived in fear that I was going to get it and I was going to infect my whole family,\" she says. After a month and a half, Laderer decided to visit a neurologist, who ordered an MRI. But the doctor found no physical cause. The scan was clear. Then he asked: Are you under a lot of stress? Throughout the pandemic, people who never had the coronavirus have been reporting a host of seemingly unrelated symptoms: excruciating headaches, episodes of hair loss, upset stomach for weeks on end, sudden outbreaks of shingles and flare-ups of autoimmune disorders. The disparate symptoms, often in otherwise healthy individuals, have puzzled doctors and patients alike, sometimes resulting in a series of visits to specialists with few answers. But it turns out there's a common thread among many of these conditions, one that has been months in the making: chronic stress. Although people often underestimate the influence of the mind on the body, a growing catalog of research shows that high levels of stress over an extended period of time can drastically alter physical function and affect nearly every organ system. Now at least eight months into the pandemic, alongside a divisive election cycle and racial unrest, those effects are showing up in a variety of symptoms. \"The mental health component of COVID is starting to come like a tsunami,\" says Dr. Jennifer Love, a California-based psychiatrist and co-author of an upcoming book on how to heal from chronic stress. Nationwide, surveys have found increasing rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts during the pandemic. But many medical experts say it's too soon to measure the related physical symptoms since they generally appear months after the stress begins. Data from FAIR Health, a nonprofit database that provides cost information to the health industry and consumers, showed increases in the percentage of medical claims related to conditions triggered or exacerbated by stress, such as  multiple sclerosis or shingles. The portion of claims for the autoimmune disease lupus, for example, showed one of the biggest increases \u2014 12% this year \u2014 compared with the same period last year (January to August). Express Scripts, a major pharmacy benefit manager, reported that prescriptions for anti-insomnia medications increased 15% early in the pandemic. Perhaps the strongest indicator comes from doctors reporting a growing number of patients with physical symptoms for which they can't determine a cause. Shilpi Khetarpal, a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic, used to see about five patients a week with stress-related hair loss. Since mid-June, that number has jumped to 20 or 25. Mostly women, ages 20 to 80, are reporting hair coming out in fistfuls, Khetarpal says. In Houston, at least a dozen patients have told fertility specialist Dr. Rashmi Kudesia they're having irregular menstrual cycles, changes in cervical discharge and breast tenderness, despite normal hormone levels. Stress is also the culprit dentists are pointing to for the rapid increase in patients with teeth grinding, teeth fractures and temporomandibular joint disorder. \"We, as humans, like to have the idea that we are in control of our minds and that stress isn't a big deal,\" Love says. \"But it's simply not true.\" How mental stress becomes physical Stress causes physical changes in the body that can affect nearly every organ system. Although symptoms of chronic stress are often dismissed as being in one's head, the pain is real, says Kate Harkness, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Queen's University in Ontario. When the body feels unsafe \u2014 whether it's a physical threat of attack or a psychological fear of losing a job or catching a disease \u2014 the brain signals adrenal glands to pump stress hormones. Adrenaline and cortisol flood the body, activating the fight-or-flight response. They also disrupt bodily functions that aren't necessary for immediate survival, such as digestion and reproduction. When the danger is over, the hormones return to normal levels. But during chronic stress, such as a pandemic, the body keeps pumping out stress hormones until it tires itself out. This leads to increased inflammation throughout the body and brain, and a poorly functioning immune system. Studies link chronic stress to heart disease, muscle tension, gastrointestinal issues and even physical shrinking of the hippocampus, an area of the brain associated with memory and learning. As the immune system acts up, some people can even develop new allergic reactions, Harkness says. The good news is that many of these symptoms are reversible. But it's important to recognize them early, especially when it comes to the brain, says Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. \"The brain is plastic, so we can to some extent modify it,\" Sahakian says. \"But we don't know if there's a cliff beyond which you can't reverse a change. So the sooner you catch something, the better.\" The day-to-day impact In some ways, mental health awareness has increased during the pandemic. TV shows are flush with ads for therapy and meditation apps, such as Talkspace and Calm, and companies are announcing mental health days off for staff. But those spurts of attention fail to reveal the full impact of poor mental health on people's daily lives. For Alex Kostka, pandemic-related stress has brought on mood swings, nightmares and jaw pain. He'd been working at a Whole Foods coffee bar in New York City for only about a month before the pandemic hit, suddenly anointing him an essential worker. As deaths in the city soared, Kostka continued riding the subway to work, interacting with co-workers in the store, and working longer hours for just a $2-per-hour wage increase. (Months later, he'd get a $500 bonus.) It left the 28-year-old feeling constantly unsafe and helpless. \"It was hard not to break down on the subway the minute I got on it,\" Kostka says. Soon he began waking in the middle of the night with pain from clenching his jaw so tightly. Often his teeth grinding and chomping were loud enough to wake his girlfriend. Kostka tried Talkspace, an online therapy program, but found texting about his troubles felt impersonal. By the end of the summer, he decided to start using the seven free counseling sessions offered by his employer. That's helped, he says. But as the sessions run out, he worries the symptoms might return if he's unable to find a new therapist covered by his insurance. \"Eventually, I will be able to leave this behind me, but it will take time,\" Kostka says. \"I'm still very much a work in progress.\" How to fend off chronic stress When it comes to chronic stress, seeing a doctor for stomach pain, headaches or skin rashes may address those physical symptoms. But the root cause is mental, medical experts say. \"We shouldn't think of this stressful situation as a negative sentence for the brain,\" says Harkness, the psychology professor in Ontario. \"Because stress changes the brain, that means positive stuff can change the brain, too. And there is plenty we can do to help ourselves feel better in the face of adversity.\" That means the solution will often involve stress-management techniques. Here are some key evidence-based techniques to try: Exercise. Even low- to moderate-intensity physical activity can help counteract stress-induced inflammation in the body. It can also increase neuronal connections in the brain. Meditation and mindfulness. Research shows this can lead to positive, structural and functional changes in the brain. Fostering social connections. Talking to family and friends, even virtually, or staring into a pet's eyes can release a hormone that may counteract inflammation. Learning something new. Whether it's a formal class or taking up a casual hobby, learning supports brain plasticity, the ability to change and adapt as a result of experience, which can be protective against depression and other mental illness.

The open carry rally is organized by an activist group known as BLM757 in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the Second Amendment. Editor's note: NPR will be continuing this conversation about Being Black in America online and on air. Bruce Tomlin, a 63-year-old truck driver from New Mexico, said he was never really a \"gun person.\" Then he saw a video of three white men following and fatally shooting Ahmaud Arbery while he was jogging. \"The man is trying to get away and they're just gunning him down in the street like he was a dog,\" Tomlin said about watching the video of Arbery. \"It's made me hypervigilant. It has made me nervous. I'll even admit to being a little bit scared sometimes.\" So he bought a gun. And he's planning on buying more. \"I just feel like in my viewpoint, every Black person in America, especially Black males, needs to have some type of protection with them as often as [they] can, because I think the political climate [is] getting to the point where it's just going to be a lot of violence coming our way,\" Tomlin said. \"I just feel safer now having a gun. And I didn't always feel that way. I've never been the world's biggest fan of guns, but I just don't feel safe without one.\" In early June, NPR reached out to Black Americans to ask about their personal experiences in this country. Nearly 500 people responded, some of whom described wanting to buy \u2014 or decidedly not wanting to buy \u2014 firearms for self-defense in response to the recent fight for racial justice. Tomlin is one of many Black Americans who recently bought firearms for the first time, faced with a combination of the coronavirus pandemic and the fight for racial justice. \"The highest overall firearm sales increase comes from Black men and women, who show a 58.2% increase in purchases during the first six months of 2020 versus the same period last year,\" Jim Curcuruto, the National Shooting Sports Foundation director of Research and Market Development, wrote in a report, according to AOL News. \"Bottom line is that there has never been a sustained surge in firearm sales quite like what we are in the midst of.\" Philip Smith, the president of the National African American Gun Association, said that he had a massive influx of members in two waves: Once, in 2016, following President Donald Trump's election, and again during the recent  racial justice protests. He said a year ago, NAAGA was getting maybe 10 new members a day; now, its seeing 10 new members an hour. He said there are many factors pushing Black people to buy firearms, including \"the politics right now, the pandemic and the racial tone: Those three things together act as kind of a three-headed monster that is driving folks to come to us.\" While there may be an uptick in Black people owning guns in the United States today for protection, it's not necessarily a new phenomenon. The majority of gun owners are white men, but in a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center, 24% of Black people reported owning a gun, compared to 36% of white people. Ifeoma Ozoma, a 28-year-old who works in tech policy, owned guns for self-protection long before the recent protests erupted across the nation. She grew up in Alaska, with familiarity with firearms, and always knew she wanted to own one for self defense. So, after graduating college, she started buying them. \"My gun ownership is not connected to the political movement,\" Ozoma said. \"It's connected more to the history of the country, and I am adherent to both the First and the Second amendment and so I am practicing both, I believe, in owning guns.\" Across races, since the 1970s, gun ownership has shifted away from hunting and sport and towards self-defense \u2014 and one of the most fierce advocates for the right to bear arms in public, particularly for protection, was the Black Panthers. Malcolm X said African Americans had to defend themselves \"by whatever means necessary.\" Even Martin Luther King Jr. applied for a permit to carry a concealed firearm in 1956, shortly after his house was bombed. His application was denied, but he had armed supporters guarding his home. \"I'm a student of history and political science, and I think what we're dealing with now, and it's the same with most societies, is like frog boiling, where you don't realize how bad things are because they just get incrementally worse,\" Ozoma said. \"And we've taken some big, big leaps this year in getting incrementally worse. But if there was a societal breakdown, my first assumption is not that the police ... is going to make a priority of protecting Black citizens. And so I would like to have my own form of protection.\" Armed members of the Black Panther Party leave the Capitol in Sacramento May 2, 1967. The Panthers entered the Capitol fully armed and said they were protesting a bill before the Legislature restricting the carrying of arms in public.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Armed members of the Black Panther Party leave the Capitol in Sacramento May 2, 1967. The Panthers entered the Capitol fully armed and said they were protesting a bill before the Legislature restricting the carrying of arms in public. Some people in the United States do tend to buy firearms in reaction to emergencies: Gun sales spiked after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and in response to the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and, according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, twice as many Americans underwent background checks for handgun purchases in March 2020 as they had two months earlier. Kat Traylor, of Aurora, Colo., first started thinking about buying a weapon when she saw empty grocery shelves at the start of the pandemic. Like Ozoma, she's thought about chance encounters with police, too. \"Elijah McClain was murdered in my city,\" Traylor said, referring to the death of a Black man who died following an encounter with law enforcement last year. Police put McClain in a chokehold. Paramedics  injected him with an anesthetic called ketamine. Aurora has since opened an independent investigation into his death, as has Colorado's attorney general. McClain's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and several of its police officers. Traylor said she doesn't necessarily envision using her firearm, particularly against police, but having it gives her some sense of control. \"What we as a family had to determine is how do we want to...die,\" she explained slowly. \"It's sad to look at it that way. Do we want to die not being prepared? Or at least trying to protect ourselves. That's how you weigh that.\" Kat Traylor and her husband Kevin Cox at a gun range.\n                \n                    \n                    Leigh Paterson /Courtesy Leigh Paterson\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kat Traylor and her husband Kevin Cox at a gun range. At the same time, data shows owning a gun might not actually make you safer. Larry Green, a 68-year-old in Phoenix, doesn't want to buy or own a gun for exactly that reason. He pointed to Philando Castile, a registered gun owner who was shot and killed by a police officer on July 6, 2017, in a St. Paul, Minn.,  suburb after he told the officer he was armed. Green was pulled over in Phoenix the week Castile was killed, and the officer asked if he had a gun in the car. He was thankful that he didn't. Ozoma understands the point that Castille was a legal gun owner who was shot and killed anyway, but she says that doesn't make her shy away from her gun ownership. \"Philando Castile was just pulling for his license to show that he had the right to have a gun. Breonna Taylor was lying in bed with her partner who was lawfully using his weapon against some people who broke into their apartment and did not announce who they were,\" Ozoma said. \"So it doesn't really matter either way, whether I'm armed or not, I could be killed or be attacked. And I'd rather be armed.\" Tomlin agrees. \"I'd rather go to trial than go to the cemetery,\" he said. KUNC reporter Leigh Paterson contributed to this report.",

Protesters have often accused President Trump of being fascist.\n                \n                    \n                    Aidan Loughran/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People march during the nationwide protest demanding the end to the Trump administration in New York City on Saturday. Protesters have often accused President Trump of being fascist. Since it was first popularized by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in the 1920s, fascism, and accusations of it, have been a common theme in American political discourse. Voices on the left warned of fascism in the form of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush; conservatives have accused liberals of actually being the ones to embrace the far-right ideology. Historians have noted similarities between Donald Trump and Mussolini since before the 2016 election. Some of the racial justice protesters this summer have said they are fighting fascism in the form of President Trump. And the presence of antifa \u2014 anti-fascist \u2014 protesters at some demonstrations has upped attention to the word. But what is and isn't fascist isn't even agreed upon by scholars. Jason Stanley, a professor of philosophy at Yale University, offers one perspective on the word. He defines fascism as \"a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation.\" Stanley, who is the author of the 2018 book How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them, tells NPR's All Things Considered: \"The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors.\" Stanley says recent global events, including the pandemic and the protests, have substantiated his concern about how fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world. On what has changed between when he first wrote the book in 2018 and now Well if someone described to you, \"Here's country X. The leader of country X claims that he is going to remain in power for many years beyond what is legal. He sends federal forces in to quell largely peaceful protests for racial justice in his country. His attorney general seems dedicated to him over the rule of law. The major political party that controls the courts and most of the government has, as their entire platform, devotion to him.\" What would you think about that country? Where would you think the direction of that country was headed? I would think that country was losing its democratic status, especially when it had a history of voter suppression and the highest incarceration rate in the world as background conditions. On how conspiracy theories can be used as fascist tactics Conspiracy theories destroy an information space. The goal \u2014 fascism is based on a friend-enemy distinction, so you're either with them or against them. The enemy is the enemy of civilization. What it does is it destroys the information space. It makes you think that even if your guys are corrupt and lying, it is because [the leader is] facing a mysterious cabal that is controlling things that are trying to foment a race war. This is the basis of the Ku Klux Klan ideology. And even when they seem respectable they're really being controlled by the Marxists and the minorities. And so that makes you think that your opposition is not legitimate and there's no debating them because they're really in a conspiracy to hide a pedophilic sex ring and advance the interests of Marxism. And so what we find is not just a conspiracy theory but a conspiracy theory that echoes the worst aspects of European history and American history. On what gives him hope [The U.S.] is the home of anti-fascist resistance \u2014 not just our soldiers in World War II but our intellectuals and journalists and nonviolent protest movements and revolutionaries here who have confronted our own racial history that so influenced Hitler. So we have the seeds in this country of the evils that were the foundation of many anti-democratic regimes, but we also have the flowers that stopped them.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We're at a moment in this country when it's easy to keep looking inward. The election, the pandemic, the economic crisis, racial issues and more give us plenty to do, but the rest of the world is out there. We're keeping an eye for you. Today we have news from West Africa. The president of Mali has been ousted in a military coup that comes after months of popular protests. Here's NPR's Africa correspondent Eyder Peralta. (SOUND OF GUNS FIRING, CROSSTALK) EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: On Tuesday morning, soldiers took over a military base just outside the capital, Bamako. By afternoon, they had marched into the city and arrested their president and prime minister. (SOUND OF GUNS FIRING) PERALTA: Soldiers fired in the air, and thousands joined them to celebrate the ouster of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. For more than two months now, people in Mali have been taking to the streets, demanding the ouster of President Keita. They complained of corruption and the government's inability to bring an Islamist insurgency under control. By nightfall, Keita was giving a speech on state TV. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IBRAHIM BOUBACAR KEITA: (Non-English language spoken). PERALTA: Surrounded by soldiers, he said he had no choice but to resign. Another coup back in 2012 actually led to the elections that brought Keita to power, but Islamists took advantage of the yearlong power vacuum before the elections, claiming vast territory. Their advance was stopped by a French military intervention. France, the former colonial power which still has thousands of troops in the country, called for constitutional order following the coup. The African Union issued a statement condemning the coup, saying all arrested government officials should be released immediately. ECOWAS, the regional body for West African states, said the coup leaders had no legitimacy. It decided to close all borders with Mali and suspend financial flows in an attempt to restore Keita to power. Today on state TV, however, coup leaders said they intend to form a transitional government. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Baltimore's newest mayor, Brandon Scott, represents a changing of the guard in Baltimore politics, but the 36-year-old progressive Democrat inherits divides that existed long before the pandemic began. Scott, the city's youngest mayor in more than a century, campaigned on a platform of building racial equity, professionalizing city government and treating the city's homicide rate \u2014 one of the highest in the nation \u2014 as a public health crisis. \"Baltimore, like every major city, has problems.\" Scott said. \"But what Baltimore is getting ready to have now is leadership that will not shy away from those problems as someone who has lived and grown up through them.\" Scott grew up in Park Heights, a once-robust neighborhood that declined after white flight occurred in the late 20th century. There, he witnessed firsthand the violence that plagues Baltimore, seeing his first shooting before his 10th birthday, as well as the disinvestment that predominantly Black neighborhoods still face. He attended schools with no heat or air conditioning and watched zero tolerance policies tear apart families. In 2011, at the age of 27, Scott was elected to the city council and spent the next decade passing racial equity, public safety and government transparency legislation. He's called for supervised injection sites and drastic reform to the Baltimore Police Department. He became president of the Baltimore City Council in 2019, after ex-mayor Catherine Pugh resigned amid her self-dealing children's book scheme scandal. Brandon Scott outside his grandmother's house in Park Heights, Baltimore, after winning the primary in June.\n                \n                    \n                    Emily Sullivan/WYPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brandon Scott outside his grandmother's house in Park Heights, Baltimore, after winning the primary in June. Scott's win represents a changing of the guard, said Roger Hartley, dean of the College of Public Affairs at the University of Baltimore. \"A sweep of progressive, generally younger city council members have been replacing an old guard in the city, who were tied to an old style of Democratic politics that was linked to networks and industry,\" Hartley said. \"But they had never really captured the mayorship.\" And in recent years, several Baltimore mayors automatically ascended to the office after their predecessors resigned, some amid corruption scandals. Scott campaigned in the wake of such a scandal, narrowly beating longtime fixtures of Baltimore politics in the deep-blue city's primary \u2014 including former mayor Sheila Dixon, who left office in 2010 after a corruption scandal of her own. Scott, on the other hand, \"can claim that he has full support of the voters that elected him and that this wasn't just a person who got appointed,\" Hartley said. Baltimore must re-allocate its budget away from the current dependence on the police department. We must diversify our investments into agencies that focus on proactively developing our young people and communities.https://t.co/aDDa7ySCF1 He also campaigned on an unprecedented platform of curbing mayoral power. Baltimore has what political scientists call a strong mayor system: the office controls the city's powerful spending board and has total power to distribute state and federal funds. Scott has supported legislation to reduce the amount of city council votes needed for a veto override and give councilmembers the ability to move money around the budget, among others. His plan to combat gun violence, which he has long conceptualized as a public health crisis, involves studying the flow of guns into the city and and implementing a group violence reduction strategy to target the \"small group of people committing violence against another small group of people.\" It also requires bolstering social services, Scott said. \"That means looking at how we deal with substance abuse, trauma, housing opportunity, especially for those that we know are living in the neighborhoods where the violence is,\" Scott said. In Baltimore, that's crucial: the city became the American pioneer for urban segregation policies and practices, when the city passed the first residential racial zoning law in U.S. history in 1910. \"Baltimore never really wrestled with the demons of segregation,\" said Lawrence Brown, a visiting sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The legacy of redlining remains painfully present throughout the city today. When Scott steps into the mayor's office, he inherits deep-rooted health, educational and economic gaps in disinvested Black neighborhoods, Brown said. The pandemic, which has predominantly killed Black Americans and has shuttered job sites throughout the city, is widening these gaps even further. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner and visiting professor at George Washington University, said leaders must redouble their efforts to reduce these disparities, especially as the pandemic worsens. \"There needs to be a lot of work done over the medium and long term while we recognize that racism and racial inequity are public health issues,\" Wen said. Scott said he will be unafraid to impose stricter pandemic restrictions in majority-Black Baltimore on things like indoor dining and retail than Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. The progressive is also adamant that he's not a savior. \"Am I going to wipe away hundreds of years of inequity in Baltimore? No,\" Scott said. \"But someone has to be the person willing to put the bricks at the foundation of a better city.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump has launched something he's calling an \"Evangelicals for Trump\" coalition in support of his re-election.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Evangelical Christians have been President Trump's most loyal supporters since he was elected to office. And his reelection effort this year is set to mobilize that group, again. This past Friday, his campaign launched what it is calling an Evangelicals for Trump coalition with a rally at a Miami megachurch. NPR's Tom Gjelten was there. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: The Miami rally was announced just after the evangelical magazine Christianity Today ran an editorial calling for President Trump's removal from office on account of what the magazine called his immoral conduct. So Trump is eager to show he still has a lot of evangelicals on his side, like Pastor Robert Jeffress, senior pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas. Jeffress has stuck with Trump through thick and thin, and he was a key organizer of this rally. Attacking the president over his moral failings, Jeffress says, doesn't necessarily resonate with evangelical Christians. ROBERT JEFFRESS: The whole basis of the Christian message is - we're all sinners. We all need a savior. There's nobody perfect. And so I think people who understand the Gospel message understand that, and they're not looking for perfection in a leader. GJELTEN: Evangelical voters are clearly a top priority of the Trump reelection campaign. Losing just a small share of them could cost Trump the election, broadening his evangelical base could win it for him. This meeting was hosted at a Pentecostal megachurch, El Rey Jesus, King Jesus Church. It serves a largely Latino population in southwest Miami. The Trump campaign chose this church, deliberately, to launch this campaign, seeing Hispanic evangelicals as a group that can be mobilized to support a conservative, explicitly pro-religion cause. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Before my election, religious believers were under assault like never before. You all know that. So many leaders here. GJELTEN: Speaking to the crowd, Trump claimed to have won new protection for faith-based groups and Christian leaders, many of whom he said had been targeted by federal bureaucrats and ordered to abandon their religion beliefs or stop serving their communities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: But the day I took office, I got sworn in, the federal government's war on religion came to a very abrupt end. GJELTEN: The idea of a president sticking up for Christians is part of what made Marta Rivero a Trump supporter. MARTA RIVERO: I think he takes our opinion into account when he makes decisions about, you know, issues that we care about. GJELTEN: For her husband, Emiliano Rivero, it's the good economic news that has sold him on Trump. EMILIANO RIVERO: He is a businessman. He's picked up this country a whole lot. The economy is good right now. There's a lot of work. GJELTEN: The Riveros are immigrants - Marta from Colombia, Emiliano from Cuba. South Florida is home to many people whose experience of socialism in Cuba, in Venezuela, in Nicaragua has made them leery of what they see as left-wing ideology. And in his speech, Trump fanned those fears, saying the left in America wants to replace God with socialism. Many people here who voted for Trump say they did so reluctantly, in part because of the concerns about his temperament. Tammy Juanita Scott Wise admits Trump's language and tweets sometimes make her cringe, but she forgives him. TAMMY JUANITA SCOTT WISE: You know, we're not perfect people. Christians are not perfect, but we are working to let God change us from the inside out. And I think he's trying to do that. GJELTEN: In fact, she concluded after listening to Trump that he's a different person than he was three years ago. WISE: The Donald Trump that I saw today was a very relaxed, much less cantankerous man than I've known him to be in the past. And I see God working in his life. GJELTEN: Less cantankerous, maybe? Or perhaps everyone, including evangelical Christians, have just gotten used to Donald Trump's behavior and give it less heed. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Miami. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer says two militia groups \"were preparing to kidnap and possibly kill me.\" Thirteen people are charged after the FBI thwarted the alleged plot.  NOEL KING, HOST: In the spring, far-right militia members carrying guns protested at Michigan's state Capitol. They demanded an end to coronavirus restrictions that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had put in place. Some people, at the time, openly worried that anti-government sentiment was growing in Michigan. And now six men are facing federal charges that they plotted to kidnap the governor. Another seven, who are linked to that plot, face other state charges. Authorities haven't said yet what motivated the men. With me now, NPR's Hannah Allam, who covers extremism, and Abigail Censky, who's a reporter with WKAR in East Lansing. Good morning, ladies. HANNAH ALLAM, BYLINE: Hi there. ABIGAIL CENSKY, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: Abigail, it is early in Lansing, but what is it been like in the hours since these men were arrested? CENSKY: People here have been shocked. Some supporters did show up to the Capitol last night with a Big Gretch sign at the Capitol. But Republican leadership still spoke at a rally. And, you know, despite a majority of Michiganders supporting the job the governor has been doing, there have been these sizable protests - thousands of people who showed up in April, and armed protesters who entered the Capitol in May. If you were at those protests, you might not be surprised by this plan. There was a lot of anti-Whitmer and misogynous sentiment, signs like tyrants get the rope, comparisons to Nazi Germany and graphic depictions of violence. They tapered off over the summer after our stay-at-home order ended. But resentment toward Whitmer has still been around in the form of fledgling recall efforts and a petition to strip the governor of her emergency powers. KING: Hannah, all of this raises a question as to whether what's happening in Michigan is extreme or whether it is part of something bigger that's happening in this country. ALLAM: Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of both. Domestic terrorism analysts have said for months that they can't remember a time when tensions were running this high. I mean, we've got the pandemic, a polarizing election, racial justice protests. And there's been concern for a while about the threat of political violence, so it's not surprising that the feds were watching this group. But that being said, the number of people involved and the planning that went into the alleged plot are definitely not run of the mill. I mean, we've seen some explosives charges, and shootings and car rammings but not the kind of premeditated, high-profile kidnapping the prosecutors lay out in this case. KING: So, Abigail, what do we know about these men and where they fit into anti-government or anti-Whitmer protests in Michigan? CENSKY: Well, the criminal complaint yesterday said that these men were allegedly incensed by her, quote, \"uncontrolled power right now.\" So there's a kind of two levels of anger. At the bottom you have these fringe and extremist groups who protest at the Capitol. And in the upper echelons of the Michigan state legislature, you have Republican leadership that are very angry with the governor's COVID response. She's issued hundreds of executive orders without a lot of legislative input. And state Republicans here have been calling that a power grab for months. They've sued the governor, passed bills that would limit her emergency powers. So they may not be calling her a tyrant, but they mingle with these protesters, and they've had a huge amount of contempt for her coronavirus response that's been boiling under the surface. KING: Lawmakers mingling with protesters - that's interesting. Hannah, Gov. Whitmer said something very direct last night. She said, this is not a Michigan problem. It's an American problem. Does your reporting confirm that? ALLAM: Well, all year, I've been hearing about secret meetings of armed fringe groups in various states where they all come together to talk about what they call constitutional flashpoints - when they might take a stand, what everyone's role will be. Definitely, you know, they've been animated by some of the coronavirus restrictions and the lockdown. And then the, you know - they've shown up to protest as well. Some militia members have told me they don't go to these meetings, these big gatherings, precisely because they believe they're likely to be infiltrated by the authorities, so they stay away. And so it's been very hard to pin down exactly what's going on. But here in the court papers is confirmation of these kinds of gatherings and a look inside this interstate organizing that federal agents are tracking. I mean, this case takes us to meetings and trainings in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and there are references to other states in there as well. KING: OK. So beyond Michigan at the very least. NPR's Hannah Allam covers extremism, and Abigail Censky is a reporter with WKAR in East Lansing. Thanks so much to you both. We appreciate it. ALLAM: Thank you. CENSKY: Of course.

            "article_content": "When President Trump visits Wisconsin Tuesday, it will be without the invitation of the governor. Trump has cited the protests in Kenosha as part of his law-and-order message.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The president visits Kenosha, Wis., today. He's disregarding a letter from the governor of Wisconsin. Gov. Tony Evers asked the president to stay away from the city that is facing protests over a police shooting. The president's visit fits in with his reelection theme of law and order. So how are voters in a vital swing state responding? Maayan Silver of our member station WUWM in Milwaukee is on the line. Good morning. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: And first, why did Gov. Tony Evers and other officials ask the president to stay away? SILVER: So two people are dead, one is paralyzed, another injured. The city is rebuilding from damage and boarded up businesses throughout its downtown. Trump has a history of inflammatory language. So Lieutenant Gov. Mandela Barnes tweeted, the city was on fire. And we need healing, not a barrel of gasoline rolling in. But there are plenty of Republicans who want to hear and see from Trump, like U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who has said he - Trump provided decisive leadership. INSKEEP: All right. Well, those are the officials. What are voters telling you? SILVER: I did talk to a lot of people. If anything, this isn't changing anyone's mind. It's sort of just reinforcing settled opinions. One person I talked to was Jan Kaminski (ph). She was stocking up on pickling supplies at a farmer's market this weekend. JAN KAMINSKI: I picked up pickles, garlic and dill. My mother's 94. And she likes to put up refrigerator pickles. She makes them and I get some (laughter). SILVER: While the market seems far removed from the unrest that happened in Kenosha the previous week, it was on her mind. KAMINSKI: There's nothing wrong with peaceful protesting. But don't tell me it's a peaceful protest, as they're showing on CNN, and behind the guy, there's a building burning. I mean, that's just sort of, like, crazy optics. Are you going to believe me or your own lying eyes, you know? SILVER: Kaminski watched both political conventions. She won't say who she's voting for. But it's Trump's message that Democrats are to blame for the unrest that's sticking with her. KAMINSKI: Well, there is something to be said when they say all these major - these cities that are having problems are run by Democrats. I didn't know that. You know, you have to put it that - look that they did in Kenosha when the National Guard came in and enough backup came. You know, the rioting and all that stopped. SILVER: Others here, even former supporters of Trump, say that after four years, the president is not able to unite the country. Karen Cayman (ph) of Plymouth - it's north of Milwaukee - says she voted for Trump in 2016. KAREN CAYMAN: And I will not vote for him again. He has no rules. And he fires everybody that he doesn't like and disagrees with him - and no morals. SILVER: Even though she's concerned about what happened in Kenosha and is worried about looting and violence, Cayman says Trump is making it worse. CAYMAN: He just wants people to riot. He instills riots and discord. SILVER: The Democrats I spoke to at the market said the counter protests by right-wing groups that led to more violence just proved to them that Trump needs to go. Gaetano Marangelli (ph) was loading bushels of tomatoes into his car. He hopes people see through Trump's racially divisive message. GAETANO MARANGELLI: This strikes me as, you know, a play that Republicans have run for years and decades. And they're running it again. Is it salient? Does it speak to people? I like to think it doesn't. SILVER: Meanwhile, in Kenosha, where all this started, protesters are still showing up to demand justice for Jacob Blake, the Black man who was shot by police. Activist Lauren Cross (ph) says the experience has made many people realize they need to get out on the streets for change and engage in activism, not simply vote. But she says all the people out protesting are pretty single-minded when it comes to the ballot box. LAUREN CROSS: I'd definitely say so. I think, like, all the people out here are voting against Trump in some capacity. INSKEEP: Those are some voters who spoke with Maayan Silver, reporter in Wisconsin. How did they fit into the big picture in your state? SILVER: So it's too early to tell. But it's really a question of whether this hyper-motivates one side or the other more. Trump won Wisconsin by just 22,000 votes in 2016. He really can't afford to lose it this time. One reason he won was that turnout in Milwaukee, which is a majority nonwhite city, was down from past elections. And there's a deep racial divide between the city and its suburbs, between Milwaukee and Madison and the rest of the state. So there are a lot of signs that the president plans to emphasize racial strife on his visit and then in the coming months. INSKEEP: Reporter Maayan Silver of WUWM in Milwaukee in the state of Wisconsin, where President Trump visits Kenosha today. Thanks so much. SILVER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court, which begins its new term Monday, is confronting cases related to the election, the Affordable Care Act and religious rights, among others.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Supreme Court, which begins its new term Monday, is confronting cases related to the election, the Affordable Care Act and religious rights, among others. The U.S. Supreme Court opens a new court term Monday, while across the street at the Capitol, Republicans are seeking to jam through, before the Nov. 3 election, President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the court. Trump offered Barrett the nomination just two days after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. And since then, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has been leading the GOP charge to get Barrett confirmed before Election Day. It's a race to the political finish line made more difficult by the fact that at least two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Utah Republican Mike Lee and North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis, have tested positive for the coronavirus and, on Saturday, McConnell said the committee will start the hearing as scheduled on Oct. 12. Regardless of what is happening in the Senate, the Supreme Court is carrying on in its usual stately fashion. The court is an institution built on tradition, and the traditional opening day of the term is the first Monday of October. This time, however, there will be just eight justices, not the usual nine, and because of COVID-19, once again the justices will gather by telephone hookup to hear the lawyers make their arguments. Because they will not be together, there will be none of the usual freewheeling debate; instead, the justices will ask questions in order of seniority, with each justice limited to just a few minutes. And once again, the public will be able to listen in. A lot has changed since July, when the court concluded a tumultuous term, surprising observers with lopsided decisions favoring LGBT rights in one case and repudiating Trump's claim of total immunity in two others involving grand jury and congressional subpoenas. In other more closely divided rulings, Chief Justice John Roberts, on some notable but rare occasions, broke with fellow conservatives to cast the deciding fifth vote with the court's liberals. His vote to strike down a Louisiana anti-abortion law infuriated some conservative politicians, but it was typical of Roberts. He wrote separately from the liberal justices, stressing that he had dissented when the court just four years earlier had struck down an identical law in Texas, but he said that 2016 decision was now binding precedent and he was obligated to uphold it. Despite that \"institutionalist streak,\" with Ginsburg's death and her replacement by the very conservative Barrett, Roberts may well have lost his leverage, observes University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley. \"The chief justice is no longer going to be the center vote,\" he notes. In short, the hard-line conservatives on the court can prevail without Roberts. Obamacare on the chopping block again Just how far right the court will move could become apparent quickly in a case to be argued a week after the election. It is the third challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which in the past was upheld by votes of 5-4 and 6-3. This time, the Trump administration and a coalition of red states are arguing that because the Republican Congress three years ago zeroed out the monetary penalty for those not covered by insurance (the so-called mandate), the whole law is now void. If the administration were to prevail, there would no longer be protections for those with preexisting conditions; health insurance for some 22 million people under Obamacare would likewise be gone, and so too would be many other protections that people have gotten used to. Trump's newest supreme court nominee, Barrett, has been highly critical of Chief Justice Roberts' reasoning in the previous Obamacare cases. But even Paul Clement, who argued on behalf of those challenging the law in the Supreme Court the first time, thinks this case is a stretch. \"It's just hard for me to say that the mandate is central when it doesn't have any teeth,\" he says, noting that Congress has repeatedly refused to repeal the law in the wake of previous Supreme Court decisions and that the penalty no longer exists. There is, he adds, \"an air of surreality\" around the current case. Indeed, sources say that top Justice Department officials tried and failed to talk Trump out of bringing the case. The Obamacare case is just one of many controversies flashing red on the Supreme Court docket this term \u2014 many of them political. Some cases are already being expedited. One involves how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives. The Constitution requires the \"whole number of persons in each state\" to be included for apportionment purposes. But Trump maintains he has discretion to determine the numbers and has said he intends to exclude noncitizens without legal status from the count. A three-judge federal court prevented him from doing that. Now the case is before the Supreme Court. Another Bush v. Gore? In addition, there are numerous cases directly involving the upcoming election, cases that are being teed up in the wings and that could determine who is the next president. \"Lurking in the background is the possibility that this could become the most tumultuous and divisive term since the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore,\" says Irv Gornstein, director of the Supreme Court Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center. And that's just the beginning. Among the other controversies is a case testing whether a House committee conducting impeachment hearings is entitled to secret grand jury transcripts \u2014 a case that dates back to the Mueller investigation but has important implications for congressional powers in the future. Then, too, there is a case that pits the rights of religious groups against state and federal anti-discrimination laws. On one end is Catholic Social Services of Philadelphia, and on the other, the city, which contracts with a wide variety of groups that it pays to screen and certify couples for foster care. The city cut off Catholic Social Services because the group refused, on religious grounds, to certify same-sex couples, and that violated the city's nondiscrimination law. The lower courts upheld the city's decision, citing the Supreme Court's 1990 decision declaring that religious groups are not entitled to exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws. The decision was written by conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia. Nonetheless, four of the court's current conservatives have expressed an interest in overturning that decision, and with the addition of Barrett, there may well be a majority.",

On Thursday a circuit judge disqualified her and her staff from prosecuting the case against Mark McCloskey. The St. Louis prosecutor spearheading the case against Mark McCloskey, one half of the husband-and-wife team accused of menacing Black Lives Matter protesters with weapons, has been removed from the case. Circuit Judge Thomas Clark II on Thursday dismissed Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner and her entire staff, saying campaign fundraising emails Gardner sent to constituents that alluded to Mark and Patricia McCloskey's case \"raise the appearance of impropriety and jeopardize the defendant's right to a fair trial,\" The Associated Press reported. The ruling means Gardner can no longer oversee McCloskey's prosecution. Instead, a special prosecutor will have to be selected to take over. The decision does not apply to McCloskey's wife, Patricia, who is scheduled to appear before a different judge on Jan. 15. The couple's defense attorneys filed the motion to disqualify Gardner in July, arguing it was an unprecedented move for a prosecutor to discuss a case in campaign materials, NBC affiliate KSDK reported. Court documents note the materials were sent out as early as three days before Gardner had filed any criminal charges against his clients. Attorney Joel Schwartz wrote, \"The July 17th email drew a direct line from the incident, which had not yet resulted in criminal charges, to Ms. Gardner's political antagonists and from there to a call for donations to further her re-election efforts.\" The McCloskeys, who are white, became a polarizing couple over the summer when they brandished firearms at a crowd of marching protesters; Mark McCloskey waved around an AR-15 rifle while Patricia kept her finger on the trigger of a handgun as a few hundred protesters marched toward the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. The couple insist they believed the protesters, who they say had torn down a fence to enter the gated community, would have burned down their mansion if the two hadn't \"stood their ground.\" They were indicted in October on charges of unlawful use of a weapon and tampering with evidence. Both have pleaded not guilty. The confrontation was captured on video and has drawn ire from Black Lives Matter supporters and praise from Second Amendment activists. It has also stoked the heated debate over the rights and protections of protesters. Gardner, who is St. Louis' first Black Circuit Court attorney, says the emails referenced the McCloskey case in an effort to defend herself from backlash from conservative politicians and media. \"Kim needs your help to fight back!\" one campaign email read, according to the AP. She added that she was under \"national scrutiny from our divisive President, the Republican establishment of Missouri, and the right-wing media, including Fox News.\" But KSDK notes that in his 22-page ruling Thursday, Clark wrote: \"Ms. Gardner has every right to rebut criticism, but it appears unnecessary to stigmatize defendant \u2013 or even mention him \u2013 in campaign solicitations, especially when she purports to be responding to others. \"In fact, the case law and Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit it,\" Clark added.",

During his inaugural speech, he unveiled a series of criminal justice reforms that impact how prosecutors in his office pursue convictions, sentencing and cash bail. Newly sworn-in Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n used his inaugural address to introduce himself as a transformational agent and unveil sweeping changes to the criminal justice system of California's most populous county. Gasc\u00f3n is a former officer with the Los Angeles Police Department who now leads the nation's largest district attorney's office. In a series of tweets he said the experiences he faced as a young officer 40 years ago stayed with him. They also shaped his approach to criminal justice reform. Among the changes, many of which went into effect Tuesday, call for ending the death penalty, stopping most uses of cash bail for misdemeanor nonserious or nonviolent felony offenses and prioritizing cases for resentencing inmates who are serving excessive prison terms. \"I recognize those are big changes,\" said Gasc\u00f3n, a Democrat. \"But they are changes that will enable us to actually protect the truly vulnerable.\" He also called for a Use of Force Review Board. Gasc\u00f3n said the review board would comprise civil rights attorneys, members of the community and policing experts, to review law enforcement fatal use-of-force cases going back to 2012. During his remarks Monday, which were delivered via video link amid the surge of coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County and throughout the state, Gasc\u00f3n said the Memorial Day killing of a Black man by Minneapolis police laid bare the inequities of what he called the \"two-tiered system of justice.\" \"The murder of George Floyd this summer was a horrific reminder that too often our profession has failed to hold its own to the same standards we impose on the communities that we are sworn to protect and to serve,\" he said. \"It galvanized a generation to stand up, and speak out against a system that the public largely views as a two-tiered system: one for police officers and prosecutors, and one for everyone else.\" As the Los Angeles Times points out, Gasc\u00f3n's policies are seen by many as a departure from his predecessor Jackie Lacey who critics said was \"an overly punitive district attorney. \" Gasc\u00f3n is one of several newly elected district attorneys across the country who are attempting to make good on campaign pledges to make radical changes to the local justice systems. The LAist reports that Gasc\u00f3n faces both opposition to much of his agenda, namely from his own prosecutors and law enforcement officers he must work with, as well as an uptick in violent crime in LA County. In what the publication describes as \"perhaps his boldest move,\" he calls for the banning of sentencing enhancements, a step which could lead to the release of thousands of inmates. Seeking longer prison terms for criminal defendants with past felony convictions or for those suspected of being in a gang had become a common practice among LA prosecutors. On cash bail, Gasc\u00f3n said by Jan. 1 his office will unveil detailed plans to end the system of money bail \"in its entirety.\" According to a special directive effective Tuesday, prosecutors will now be instructed to ask the court for the criminal defendant's release. Bail can still be considered at arraignment if the defendant is accused of a violent felony or sexual assaults. He said cash bail disproportionately impacts minorities and low-income criminal defendants. \"[The new policy] will reinvigorate the presumption of innocence in Los Angeles County,\" he said. On Election Day last month, California voters rejected Proposition 25, which was an effort to end the state's system of cash bail. The district attorney's office will also no longer seek the death penalty in Los Angeles County and current cases with a judgment of death will be reviewed, with the ultimate goal of getting the capital punishment removed. \"The reality is the death penalty does not make us safer, it is racist, it's morally untenable, it's irreversible and expensive and beginning today it's off the table in LA County,\" Gasc\u00f3n said. \"And it's not just off the table going forward, I am committed to resentencing those currently on death row to life in prison.\"",

Veterans of the Justice Department are waiting with anticipation for President-elect Joe Biden to unveil his choice to serve as attorney general, a decision that has weighty consequences for civil rights and public confidence in the troubled department. A prospective top Justice Department nominee is expected before Christmas, a transition spokesperson said Monday \u2014 a trajectory that would make the person last to be named among the \"Big Four\" Cabinet offices, together with the leaders of the Treasury, State and Defense departments. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are making diversity in ethnicity and ideology a top priority, which has extended their deliberations, as has the closely divided Senate they expect to inherit in January. The Department of Justice stands at the center of questions of enormous public interest, from investigations into racial discrimination and excessive force by law enforcement to rooting out corruption within state and federal government. Another looming issue is whether and how a new administration might investigate President Trump, his family members and Cabinet officials. Trump faces serious legal questions in federal, state and local investigations. Insiders bemoan diminishmentThe Justice Department suffered in the Trump years, insiders say, as the president attacked prosecutors and FBI agents on Twitter and prodded leaders to help his friends and target his enemies. Attorney General William Barr further alienated the workforce by delivering a speech in which he likened prosecutors to \"headhunters\" going after targets and said they were in need of supervision like Montessori schoolchildren. Years of this treatment have not been kind to those inside of Justice. \"Because of failed leadership, the department is in crisis,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and former acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Rosenberg said that new leaders needed to restore a sense that the Justice Department is acting free from political interference and can command the trust of the career workforce. \"There are big decisions to make about the direction of the department, and they need to be made correctly and quickly,\" he added. \"We need someone who is ready on Day 1 \u2013 someone with deep experience in the department who understands how its many pieces operate; someone who knows the organization, top to bottom.\" Another Obama-era U.S. attorney put it more bluntly: \"This is, in some ways, a salvage operation.\" \"The department has been so rocked by politics and politicization over the last four years that step one will be identifying the issues and working from Day 1 to bring the department back to where it should be,\" said the former U.S. attorney, who asked not to be identified because he has business before the Justice Department. Five former prosecutors told NPR they believe the next attorney general needs intimate familiarity with the Justice Department so he or she can perform a sweeping assessment: both in civil and criminal enforcement cases that have been brought \u2014 but also ones that have not, and should have been \u2014 to see if there is any \"remedy\" or ability to charge those matters years after the fact. New administration promises new direction Other policy adjustments for a new Democratic administration are more clear: revive investigations of systematic wrongdoing by local police and throw out a Trump-era memo directing prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious provable crime. That practice is a significant break from so-called smart on crime initiatives during the Obama years and new efforts by many state and local prosecutors to reevaluate who and how many people need to be incarcerated. Here are some of the names being discussed for the Justice Department leadership: Sally Yates Sally Yates\n                \n                    \n                    Steven Senne/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sally Yates Sally Yates remains a leading contender for the post, according to three sources familiar with the process. As deputy attorney general in the Obama years, she has both recent experience in managing the 113,000-person department and a commitment to the sorts of prison education programs and criminal justice reforms that Biden has pledged to advance. As the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Yates worked her way up inside the Justice Department, under Republican and Democratic bosses, over 27 years. The Senate confirmed her as deputy attorney general, the chief operating officer of the department, by an 84-12 vote in 2015. More recently, some Senate Republicans have expressed doubts about Yates after her high-profile exit from the department. She refused to defend Trump's first travel ban, and he fired her in January 2017. Doug Jones Sen.

Doug Jones of Alabama, who recently lost his bid for a full six-year term, is also on the Biden radar, sources said. In the late 1990s, as a U.S. attorney under President Bill Clinton, Jones famously revived a case against two Klan members who bombed a Birmingham church in 1963, killing four little Black girls. The prosecution, decades later, represented a measure of justice in a notorious civil rights crime. Jones, who recently told NPR he has known Biden for some 40 years, is a moderate Democrat who developed relationships with Republicans during his Senate term that could help ease his path to confirmation. Progressives, however, may object to his votes on behalf of dozens of federal judges appointed in the Trump years. Merrick Garland Judge Merrick Garland\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Judge Merrick Garland Merrick Garland is the widely respected former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He launched his career at the Justice Department decades ago. Garland oversaw the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and gained significant management experience inside the sprawling department in the 1990s. More recently, Garland was nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court by President Barack Obama, to fill the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Former Justice Department officials pointed out that after Watergate, President Gerald Ford enlisted former University of Chicago President Edward Levi to be attorney general and restore public confidence in the institution. The Justice Department bestows an award for honor and integrity in his name. Supporters said Garland could play a similar role if he could be enticed to leave his lifetime-tenured appointment on the federal bench. Lisa MonacoAnother veteran lawyer under consideration for the attorney general job is Lisa Monaco, who helped vet Biden's vice presidential nominee.

Mueller III. Monaco was the first woman to serve as assistant attorney general for the National Security Division at the Justice Department. She spent the last few years of the Obama administration as the former president's homeland security adviser, a job that brought her into close contact with Avril Haines, the Biden team's pick to be director of national intelligence, and with Antony Blinken a long-serving foreign policy specialist who is Biden's choice to serve as secretary of state. Monaco's friends also point out that in between college and law school, she worked on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she did research on the Violence Against Women Act, one of Biden's chief accomplishments on Capitol Hill.

As the nation grapples with issues of racial injustice and social inequality, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing to remove the so-called slavery loophole from the United States Constitution. With the adoption and ratification of the 13th Amendment 155 years ago, the practice of slavery formally ended in this country, but it did not strip away all aspects of involuntary servitude. A joint resolution dubbed the Abolition Amendment, introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate Wednesday, seeks to correct that. It would remove the \"punishment\" clause from the amendment, which effectively allows members of prison populations to be used as cheap and free labor. \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,\" Section 1 of the amendment states. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, one of the Democrats leading the effort to amend the Constitution, put the change in the context of the overall campaign for justice. \"As we take on the long and difficult challenge of rooting out systemic racism in our nation, ending the slavery loophole in the 13th Amendment is [a] critical step in that challenge,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"Slavery is our nation's original sin and this loophole has been exploited for far too long to criminalize Black and Brown Americans,\" he said. Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., who is leading the amendment effort in the House, seeks to \"finish the job that President (Abraham) Lincoln started.\" \"No American should ever be subject to involuntary servitude, even if they are incarcerated,\" he said. The measure has more than a dozen cosponsors, however no Republicans in either chamber are currently signed on to measure.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with the Democrats, is a cosponsor. The minimum estimated annual value of incarcerated labor from U.S. prisons and jails is $2 billion, according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative. And as NPR reported in July, companies like Walmart, AT&T, Whole Foods and Victoria's Secret have used incarcerated populations for their business operations. The Associated Press, which first reported the news of the congressional push to alter the 13th Amendment, notes that the reliance on prison labor is a generally touted as a way to rehabilitate inmates and provide an environment for teaching them new trade skills. It's unlikely the effort will be taken up, let alone passed, before the current session of Congress ends in a few weeks. But Merkley told the AP that he hopes to reintroduce the legislation after the next session starts in January. Should that happen, a new lead sponsor from the House would be needed, as Clay was defeated during the Democratic primary earlier this year by Cori Bush. Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist, won her general election race last month and will enter as a freshman member of the House when Congress convenes in January. Article V of the Constitution allows for a change in the founding document, only after a two-thirds majority of both the House and Senate approve a resolution or by a constitutional convention in which two-thirds of state legislatures vote to support the measure. Then, three-quarters of state legislatures or conventions must approve the change to become federal law. None of the Constitution's 27 amendments have been proposed by constitutional convention.",

            "article_content": "We look at what a concession from the Trump White House might look like, and what the president might be able to get done in his remaining days.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump signaled this week he would accept the results of the election once the Electoral College declares Joe Biden the winner after weeks of mounting failed legal challenges and making unfounded allegations of voter fraud. But after that moment of lucidity on Thursday, the president returned to calling the elections, quote, a \"massive fraud\" and a \"big scam.\" He tweeted more of the same yesterday. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Is this as close as we might come to hearing a concession, if not the word? ELVING: You know, it's all over, perhaps, but for the tongue-lashing the president's lawyers keep getting in the courts. Yesterday, it was a federal appeals court in Pennsylvania saying that, quote, \"calling an election unfair does not make it so.\" This in the same week the president called in to a Republican event - it was in Gettysburg, as it happens - and he then ranted about how he just needed to get, quote, \"some judge\" to listen to him. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the recount the Trump campaign sought and paid for is actually enlarging Biden's lead, at least in the largest county. So as states continue to certify results, we're moving toward a vote on the Electoral College in two weeks and two days. That will set up the situation the president said would cause him to leave the building. So we can expect the president and his most devoted course of supporters will continue to deny it not necessarily because they think they can stop the train, but because there are other reasons to resist the inevitable. SIMON: And those reasons are? ELVING: Well, the president has always been interested in controlling the narrative, and he's not eager to be cast with those other one-term presidents, like the first George Bush, Jimmy Carter, Herbert Hoover. He's not willing to be one of the losers. So even in defense - even in defeat, he may want to remain in denial. And he can do that. He just needs friendly media venues where he's a victim of injustice. SIMON: Earlier this week, we saw the implications of an expanded conservative majority that President Trump put on the Supreme Court when they delivered the decision upholding challenges to pandemic restrictions on the size of crowds gathered for worship at religious services. Those restrictions had already been lifted. Does this decision look like what amounts to President Trump's legacy? ELVING: You're right to say this decision was of limited effect in an immediate sense in New York or elsewhere, but it was clearly a signal that the court has a new majority, five justices willing to vote to the right of Chief Justice John Roberts, five justices eager to be seen as champions of religious liberty and willing to defend that principle even in the face of public health advisories. Three of these five are Trump appointees. So, yes, this is indeed a singular achievement for the president and a salient feature of Donald Trump's legacy. SIMON: President pardoned Michael Flynn this week, which may not have been so surprising. But what else do you believe the president can do between now and January 20, when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office? ELVING: There is a great deal the president can do. The question is how much of it can be undone and what permanent effect will be left after January 20. We're also seeing a flurry of orders from Cabinet members governing their various jurisdictions. Some of those are draconian and may be swiftly reversed, and others may remain on the books for some time. As for pardons, that is a presidential power with very few restraints. And the pardons he grants for federal offenses are permanent and not reviewable. SIMON: And we must ask this weekend, what about prospects for military action? It was reported that the president was quite recently talked out of bombing an Iranian nuclear facility. And, of course, he has recently ordered the withdrawal of more U.S. troops from Afghanistan. ELVING: There's real concern about what Trump could do as commander in chief, anxiety about him deciding to make a mark on his way out the door. So when we see a key figure assassinated in Iran, we wonder whether that shows the hand of the U.S. in any way. But right now, it seems the president is preoccupied with projects closer to home, things that have always interested him more than foreign affairs, including his challenges to the election and pardons for former associates in criminal difficulty and measures he may take to insulate himself or his family against legal or financial consequences down the road.

More votes were cast in the 2020 presidential election than in any other U.S. election in history, and the turnout rate was the highest in more than a century. President-elect Joe Biden has now earned 80 million votes, and ballots are still being counted. That is by far the most votes cast for any presidential candidate in U.S. history. President Trump holds the distinction, however, of earning the second-most votes all time. About 74 million Americans voted for him. Biden's total shatters the 2008 record of 69.5 million votes cast for Barack Obama. The former vice president was also on that ticket as Obama's running mate. Loading... Overall, more than 156 million Americans cast ballots in 2020, a number that will continue to climb in coming days as more results are reported. The final vote total is likely to get to about 158 million. That is more than 20 million higher than the 2016 record of 137 million votes cast. The turnout rate is estimated to be 66.5% of eligible voters, the highest since 1900, according to the United States Elections Project. Loading... These are remarkable figures with voting taking place in the midst of a worldwide pandemic that has led to statewide lockdowns and more than 250,000 Americans dead in less than nine months. It also significantly reduced the abilities of campaigns to do in-person door knocking and voter registration ahead of the election. As the coronavirus became more widespread, most states adjusted their voting rules, including broadening access to early voting. As a result, some two-thirds of voters cast their ballots early, far surpassing 2016 rates. The sky-high turnout is due, in part, to the expanded mail-in voting. Traditionally, states that predominantly use voting by mail have higher participation rates than other states because of the reduced obstacle of waiting in line in person. The other reason, though, is Trump, who remains one of the most polarizing figures in American political history. Lots of people turned out for and against him. Democrats have now won the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. A Republican hasn't won it since George W. Bush's reelection in 2004. And yet, Democrats have only won the presidency in five of those elections because of the Electoral College. Democrats are concentrated on the coasts and in cities, making it harder to win the White House than their popular vote margins might suggest. In fact, in this election, Biden won the national popular vote by some 6 million votes so far, more than double Hillary Clinton's margin over Trump four years ago. But just 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from a tie in the Electoral College. Though Biden's margin is significant, it will likely go down as the 15th widest in U.S. history. Considering these polarizing times, it is a feat, but it's hardly a mandate. That's because polarization seemed to harden in this election. Blue areas (cities and Democratic-leaning suburbs) became bluer, and red areas (small towns and more rural places) became redder. Trump hasn't helped bridge the divide, as he still has yet to concede and until this week delayed the transfer of power. All of it will make for a challenge for Biden to govern, while needing to hit the ground running to address COVID-19 and the economy, as well as racial inequality.",

AILSA CHANG, HOST: After a summer marked by widespread unrest over police violence and racial injustice, voters showed their support for criminal justice reforms. And that support at the polls proved that a growing movement to elect reform-minded district attorneys has staying power. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: One of the country's largest prosecutor's offices is the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in Chicago. Kim Foxx, the first Black woman to lead it, is considered one of the country's most prominent progressive prosecutors. First elected four years ago, she promised to address disparities in the criminal justice system. Despite some political stumbles, her reelection is an example of the movement's progression. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIM FOXX: It means, in this next term, doubling down on our efforts to make sure that people with substance use disorder or mental health issues have the resources they need in communities so we can stop the de facto use of our justice system. CORLEY: Foxx reduced charges for low-level offenses like retail theft. She steered some facing drug charges into treatment programs. She vacated the sentences of at least 100 men wrongfully convicted and survived a firestorm of controversy over how her office handled the case of a television celebrity. JOSE GARZA: My name is Jose Garza, and I am the district attorney-elect in Travis County, Texas. CORLEY: Austin, the capital of Texas, is the county seat. District Attorney-elect Garza, a former public defender, says the typical hallmark of a prosecutor, conviction rates and longer sentences, is wrongheaded. He says prosecuting low-level drug crimes and some nonviolent offenses doesn't make communities safer and that won't be his priority. GARZA: We also know that those kinds of offenses are one of the greatest drivers of racial disparities in our criminal justice system. And so we have made clear that when we take office, we are going to end the prosecution of low-level drug offenses. CORLEY: In what's considered a big win for the progressive movement, voters in California's Los Angeles County elected George Gascon as the new district attorney to head the country's largest prosecutor's office. Gascon, who is the former district attorney for San Francisco and a former police chief, says he's ready to move forward on a number of plans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE GASCON: Would eliminate the death penalty, would stop prosecuting children as adults. We would start creating more diversion opportunities for those - especially those that are mentally ill. CORLEY: The push to elect reform-minded district attorneys began six years ago in the aftermath of nationwide protests spurred by a fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo. The movement is growing but still small. Out of more than 2,400 elected prosecutors, fewer than 100 pursue reform agendas. Scott Roberts, the head of campaigns for the activist group Color of Change, says there's been lots of pushback. SCOTT ROBERTS: From law enforcement and from police unions, from conservative politicians - we think we caught a lot of those folks off guard. They weren't ready for a movement that would focus on prosecutor elections. CORLEY: But it has caught their attention now. During a speech at the national convention of the Fraternal Order of Police last year, U.S. Attorney General William Barr called the prosecutors, anti-law enforcement district attorneys. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM BARR: That style themselves social justice reformers and spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook and refusing to enforce the laws... CORLEY: John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Peter Moskos says, despite the criticism from the attorney general, those prosecutors are raising real issues. But Moskos says their focus has to be on public safety. PETER MOSKOS: The idea that if we just stop arresting and prosecuting nonviolent offenders, then everything will get better is just - it's a dream world. We haven't seen that happen anywhere. CORLEY: Prosecutors Foxx, Gascon and Garza say they are providing a necessary and more nuanced approach and not compromising public safety. Jami Hodge at the Vera Institute of Justice says the election of more progressive attorneys speaks volumes about where the movement is heading. JAMI HODGE: And how communities and advocates and organizers are recognizing by changing one person - one person at the top - they can really see something different in the way their system is working in their local community... CORLEY: A criminal justice reform that she and other advocates hope will gain even more momentum during the next election for prosecutors across the country. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

President Trump's campaign unsuccessfully used spurious claims of voter fraud to invalidate votes in Philadelphia and other largely Black cities. When Joe Biden thanked Black voters in his first remarks as president-elect, he credited them with lifting his campaign from its lowest point during the Democratic primaries. \"You've always had my back, and I'll have yours,\" he promised. While Biden won Black voters overwhelmingly across the country, they were key to his victories in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia \u2014 places where President Trump and his allies have been targeting ballots in cities with large Black populations in an attempt to overturn the president's defeat and retain power. Trump's campaign and his allies have presented no real evidence of widespread voter fraud or other impropriety in any of these cities, and they have faced multiple defeats in court. But the persistence of the president and loyal Republicans has alarmed Black leaders, civil rights activists and historians who see an unprecedented attempt to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters, many of them Black. The president's campaign has denied racial motivations in its  lawsuits, saying that its recount strategy is not targeting Black voters. Jenna Ellis, the Trump campaign's senior legal adviser, said in a statement to NPR that \"every American deserves to know that our elections are conducted in a legal manner, no matter who they are or where they live.\" \"That's our only goal: to ensure safe, secure, and fair elections,\" Ellis added. \"That's what our Constitution requires.\" But Bob Bauer, a senior legal adviser to the Biden campaign, said the Trump campaign's \"targeting of the African American community is not subtle. It is extraordinary\" and that \"it's quite remarkable how brazen it is.\" \"This is straight out, discriminatory behavior,\" Bauer told reporters on Friday. A group of Michigan voters has also filed a lawsuit against Trump and his campaign, arguing that \"defendants are openly seeking to disenfranchise Black voters,\" including those in Detroit. The plaintiffs, who are represented by lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, allege that the Trump campaign has attempted mass voter suppression by pressuring election officials into not certifying the election results in their state, and that Trump's apparent attempt to pressure Michigan election officials and state lawmakers was a violation of the provision against voter intimidation included in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \"Defendants' tactics repeat the worst abuses in our nation's history, as Black Americans were denied a voice in American democracy for most of the first two centuries of the Republic.\" the lawsuit said. Trump and his allies have made similar efforts in Pennsylvania, with false claims about widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia. There have been charges leveled against the electoral process in Atlanta as the political universe is focused on Georgia ahead of two runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. In Wisconsin, the Trump campaign has called for a recount of ballots in the diverse, large counties of Milwaukee and Dane, which put Biden over the top there, but the Trump campaign did not ask for recounts in the rest of the state's whiter counties. To many civil rights advocates, this is another grim chapter in what they see as an expansive, decades-long effort by Republicans to gain more power by suppressing the votes of people of color. \"It is difficult for me to think of another president in modern time who has literally driven a national scheme to disenfranchise Black voters and other voters of color en masse, in the way that we see with these post-election lawsuits,\" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. She said there was \"racial motivation\" in Trump's focus on cities like Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta. Trump's attempts hit a significant roadblock on Monday as Michigan's state canvassing board certified Biden's victory with one of the board's two Republican members abstaining. Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, called that action \"appalling.\" He pointed out that the Trump campaign was aided by supporters and allies across the country in his failed efforts to reverse Biden's victory. \"It's only because of the environment that was created by this president to defy the rule of law, to destroy customs and practices, and to really push people toward a sense of tribalism that's not in our economic interest, that's not in the interest of democracy, for his own selfish and self-reflecting outcome,\" Johnson said in an interview. \"And it's unfortunate that there have been so many people willing to put their character, their integrity at stake for such activity.\" Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, said voter suppression is typically thought of as rules or practices that, when put in place, have the impact of making people of color less likely to vote than their white counterparts. The effort that Trump is undertaking, she said, is a new type of attempted voter suppression in which the president is attempting to invalidate ballots that have already been counted. \"I think he has targeted heavily African American cities because they happen to be heavily Democratic cities, and if he's going to invalidate enough votes to turn the election in his favor, this would actually be the best place to do it,\" Gillespie said. Trump's attempt to overturn the election result comes at the end of an election season in which the nation elected its first Black vice president, California Sen. Kamala Harris. It also comes at the end of the year where many voters, particularly voters of color, faced unprecedented obstacles to cast ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. With the election challenges serving as a sort of punctuation mark on all of that, Clarke said, \"I think this will stand out in the history books as one of the darkest moments in our nation's history.\"",

            "article_content": "As President Trump still refuses to accept his election defeat, Travis Goodman finds himself gaming out what kind of \"power grab\" the outgoing president could stage, from continuing to contest the results to trying to disrupt the Electoral College process. \"I'm full of anxiety all the time,\" said Goodman, an accounting clerk at a manufacturing firm in Goshen, Ind. \"These institutional norms where I was told to go get a job and a 401(k) full of money so you can retire, you know, and live a decent happy life \u2014 is there going to be a boiling-over point where these things don't matter?\" During this rocky presidential transition, NPR asked Americans how the nation can move forward. More than 600 people weighed in, many citing fears about the future of U.S. democracy and apprehension about a lame-duck Trump presidency and the transition to Joe Biden's administration. Some respondents expressed fear about Trump trampling democratic norms, while others trusted the election process but feared lasting political extremism. People also shared ideas for how to overcome the discord and improve the system \u2014 from bolstering voting infrastructure and abolishing the Electoral College to addressing the problem of misinformation and regulating social media. Nearly two weeks after Biden clinched enough electoral votes to win the presidency, Trump continues to pursue legal battles \u2014 even after many claims have been tossed out of court \u2014 and to falsely insist there was widespread fraud. Some Republicans have acknowledged Trump's defeat and that recounts are unlikely to change the outcome, but Trump surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, continue to push baseless conspiracy theories about a rigged election. Many people told NPR they worry about the impacts of a contentious transition. Already, Trump has denied Biden security briefings and has thrown up roadblocks preventing his transition team from accessing millions of dollars in transition funding. \"He's going to have to leave. It's just a matter of is he going to do it with any sort of dignity whatsoever,\" said Lisa Stafford, a high school teacher in Saginaw, Mich. \"It's going to be a mess in January. It's not going to be a smooth transition like it should be.\" Despite widespread division, Stafford believes there is \"a genuine middle ground.\" \"Most people that I know, Republican or Democrat, are in that middle ground,\" said Stafford. \"It doesn't seem like the parties at this point, Democrat or Republican, can keep a middle ground where we're supposed to work together toward a future.\" Many Americans lamented divisions along political, racial and other lines, telling NPR they aren't sure how the nation can come together. Several people put the onus on Democrats and an incoming Biden administration, criticizing what they called a lack of civility from Democrats and bias from left-leaning media. \"I mean nobody is blameless, but I would say over the last four years the major drivers of division came from Democrats. They were relentless in pounding on Trump and his supporters,\" said Bruce Hutchins, a Republican from Florida. Hutchins, a retired public financial management specialist who voted for Trump, isn't optimistic there is a path out of the divisiveness but points out that Democrats \u2014 not Republicans \u2014 are the ones talking about reconciling differences. \"Democrats are seeing themselves as the winners, obviously, in this election, and they're the ones asking for reconciliation,\" said Hutchins. \"So if that's what they really want to do, they have to take steps to alleviate the distrust Republicans have of them right now.\" Alberto Filipponi, a high school teacher in Lombard, Ill., believes that the Biden administration needs to make concessions for Trump supporters and give them room to voice policies they support. \"I think one of the ways you can heal the nation is just by taking out the extremes on both sides,\" said Filipponi. \"I feel like Joe Biden is someone who can do that.\" Still, Filipponi continues to feel disconnected from Trump supporters in his own life. \"Some people supported things that I just personally found so contrary to what I believed, that a good human being should believe,\" he said. \"The racism, the misogyny, the lack of consideration for other people's feelings and not just feelings but lives. It's not acceptable for a president, and for me it's not acceptable for a friend.\" Several Americans told NPR they're also concerned about what they consider Trump's authoritarian leanings and the possibility his presidency will culminate in violence or an illegitimate power grab. \"It's not a given that this will occur,\" said Rohan Hunt, a woodworker who lives in Philadelphia. \"But I think he's sent clear signals that he's prepared to go as far as encouraging armed insurgency to have his own way.\" While not all fear an election steal, many Americans noted that four years under  Trump have amplified differences on a range of issues. \"We need our country to come together,\" said Jean Beinemann, a retired public health nurse in Sheboygan, Wis., \"where individuals reach across the aisle and agree that we are all in this together. And there has to be give-and-take for an orderly and peaceful transition to occur.\" For some, like Beinemann, the arrival of a Biden administration raises hopes for a return to some amount of normalcy and the chance to start a new chapter. She quoted the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once said in reference to the gridlock of partisan politics, \"enough of this nonsense\" and urged politicians to work together. \"Enough of this nonsense,\" Beinemann said. \"Let's move together to ensure a safe transition.\" Piper McDaniel is an intern on NPR's National Desk.",

            "article_content": "Portland and Seattle were the epicenter of summer protests over police misconduct, which included frequent vandalism and clashes with law enforcement. Things are quieter and we explore what's changed.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We are nearing the end of a year that will be known among many things as a year of protest. Some of the most intense and sustained protests against police misconduct came in two big cities of the Pacific Northwest - Portland, Ore., and Seattle, Wash. Now the protests are smaller and less frequent, which gives us a chance to take a serious look at how they progressed, how they declined and what, if anything, they achieved. NPR's Martin Kaste is in Seattle and Oregon Public Broadcasting's Jonathan Levinson is in Portland. Welcome to you both. JONATHAN LEVINSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: Jonathan, what sticks in your mind from these months of protests? LEVINSON: Since the end of May, we've had nights with over 10,000 people in the streets. We had weeks of federal law enforcement officers firing less-than-lethal munitions, commonly called rubber bullets, and firing tear gas on groups of mostly nonviolent protesters. Protesters have received major head injuries from police. This week, we learned from a Portland police audit that the department has used force against protesters more than 6,000 times this year. That figure includes tear gas use, impact munitions, baton strikes, you know, pushes and shoves. And that's just what was documented. Because of the way these are tallied and recorded, that's likely an undercount. INSKEEP: Wow. A new number that gives us at least some sense of how intense these protests were. And of course, at one point, President Trump's administration sent in federal law enforcement officials. It made a lot of headlines. What, though, did people want? LEVINSON: Portlanders have had a fraught relationship with the police for a long time. In May, protesters initially called for a 50 - five zero - million dollar cut to their budget. And in June, the city passed a $15 million cut, which eliminated a few controversial police programs. More recently, attempts to make further cuts to the budget, however, did not succeed. INSKEEP: OK. So how do things look on the streets now? LEVINSON: The number of people taking to the streets has dwindled recently. In August and September, they were showing up in the low hundreds, and more recently, it's even smaller than that. And there are some divisions as to what they're protesting. Some activists in the city say what had been a focus on anti-racism has morphed into general anti-establishment protests and sort of directionless vandalism for its own sake. And their tactics have changed a little, too. On two occasions now, they've gone to the home of a city commissioner who was a key vote on a police budget cut. They went to his house in the middle of the night to pressure him to vote for the cut. And then they went back after he voted against it and vandalized his home. INSKEEP: Wow. So the protests have become less widespread but also the remaining protests a little less mainstream, a little more extreme. Now, that's Portland. What about in Seattle, Martin? How have things evolved where you are? KASTE: Well, Steve, yeah, I think that dwindling is happening here, too. I mean, people often tend to kind of confuse Portland and Seattle when they're talking about this issue. And there are some similarities, like the city government here has also cut the police budget in response to protests. But there are some important differences, too, between the cities. I'd say there's more community pushback here in Seattle against some of the more extreme aspects of the protests. You might remember that protest zone in the heart of the city, the sort of anti-police zone in June. Well, the businesses in that zone sued the city for abandoning them. And they got a lot of sympathy when they did that. There's sort of just a general anger about the more extreme groups that go out at night and direct action-type protests and break windows, people in black hoodies. And even the lawyer for Black Lives Matter here in Seattle says he doesn't like those people. David Perez is the attorney on some federal litigation against the police about their crowd control tactics. But he says the protesters who go too far make his job so much harder and he calls them bozos. DAVID PEREZ: Bozos ought to be arrested. So they should be charged. You have no right to break a window. I don't care if it's Starbucks or mom and pop coffee shop. You don't get to break their windows. And when you do, you ought to be held accountable. INSKEEP: And just to be clear, that is the lawyer for Black Lives Matter. KASTE: That's right. I mean, he is still suing. He's part of this lawsuit against the police department about their crowd control tactics. But he says under pressure from lawsuits like this, the police have gotten better, in his opinion. You know, you don't see the use of tear gas and flash-bang grenades. You see them shadowing protest groups, looking for lawbreakers, people obstructing traffic on important streets or breaking windows and plucking them out, arresting them specifically, but letting the bigger protest go on. Here's a little video that the police department itself uploaded during election week sort of capturing the tone they're trying to set when talking to crowds blocking a street. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We ask - we please ask that you'd move and continue to move. We're hear to support your rights to free speech and assembly. We're here to assist in the demonstration. We ask that you continue to move. I apologize to the community that we've had to make this announcement. KASTE: Now, it should be pointed out that the police did arrest people that night for specific charges like property damage. And it should also be noted that these crowds are smaller, so this tactic might just be more doable. INSKEEP: Jonathan, I wonder if there's another factor in the decline of these protests. The election is over and, of course, there was a lot of tension over it. LEVINSON: Yeah, but, you know, these aren't homogenous groups. They're deliberately leaderless. So it's tough to identify a single issue that influences their numbers. I think there's a combination of factors that have led to smaller turnout. People are exhausted. These protests can be dangerous. It's been more than five months now of protests and really violent nights with law enforcement. Many protesters have been arrested multiple times, and it's often for very low-level offenses, like interfering with a peace (ph) officer. But just getting arrested, spending the night in jail, is traumatic. I think the election results may have provided a sense of relief for some people in the city. The weather has changed. It's starting to rain here. The governor just instituted a new shutdown order, but up until recently, people were slowly starting to go back to work, and that likely impacted turnout also. INSKEEP: What comes next? LEVINSON: Well, there are a lot of Black activists who were organizing protests early in the summer who are now working to advance policies, to cut police budgets, to strengthen police oversight, invest in the community. And overall, the protest message resonates with voters here. The mayor was widely seen as being an ineffective leader during the protests. He just won reelection but didn't win an outright majority. So he's coming into a second term without a clear mandate and with a majority of voters supporting some of these really substantial changes to policing in the city. Eighty percent of voters just supported a new police oversight board. INSKEEP: Wow. What do the police think of that? LEVINSON: Well, they're not happy. The police union has filed a grievance over the new board and has promised to challenge it in court. But their union contract is up for negotiation in January. And the hope among city leaders is that voter sentiment will help win some concessions. The city council is already backtracking on some of these additional proposed police budget cuts. Perhaps ominously, Jo Ann Hardesty, who's currently the only Black commissioner and the driving force in city government behind these cuts, said she knew that Black lives wouldn't matter for long. INSKEEP: A sense of what's changed and what has not in Portland and Seattle from Jonathan Levinson of Oregon Public Broadcasting in Portland and NPR's Martin Kaste in Seattle. Thanks to you both. LEVINSON: Thank you. KASTE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF RARE'S \"VOID\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Residents of Gwinnett County in Georgia hold Biden-Harris campaign signs on Election Day in Norcross, Ga. President-elect Joe Biden ran up the margins in Atlanta's diversifying suburbs.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Residents of Gwinnett County in Georgia hold Biden-Harris campaign signs on Election Day in Norcross, Ga. President-elect Joe Biden ran up the margins in Atlanta's diversifying suburbs. There was a debate in the runup to this year's presidential election about whether it would be a base election or a persuasion one. In other words, what would matter more for a candidate \u2014 turning out one side's core voters, or winning over undecideds and wavering supporters of President Trump? Based on an NPR analysis of the more than 3,000 counties, it was, in fact, mostly a base election with some key persuasion in Democratic-leaning suburbs that went for Joe Biden by wider margins than they did for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, there have been far fewer counties that flipped from one major party to the other, as compared with four years earlier. In 2016, 237 counties changed allegiances from 2012 \u2014 216 of them went from President Barack Obama to Donald Trump. In 2020, just 77 counties total have flipped so far, and Biden won 59 of them. Many metropolitan areas with high concentrations of Democratic-leaning voters went more strongly for Biden than for Clinton in 2016, and he blew out margins in populous suburbs in key states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. But Trump's promise to turn out more voters open to his message worked, too. The president won by even wider margins in many rural areas than he did in 2016. The result: sky-high turnout. More than 155 million ballots have been tallied, and with the counting still going in some states, that tally could go higher than 158 million. That would be a turnout rate of eligible voters of almost 67%, the highest since 1900. Trump was the top factor in the 2020 election, and he turned out record numbers of voters \u2014 both for and against him. Loading... A polarized America When looking at the map of how all 3,141 counties or county equivalents in the 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., shifted \u2014 or didn't \u2014 from 2016 to 2020, it's clear this is a very divided country. The overwhelming majority of counties didn't change hands. But voters in many parts of the highly populated Northeast; in cities in key Midwestern states, the West and West Coast; and in many suburban areas went for Biden by wider margins than for Clinton. And rural areas and many places with high concentrations of white voters without college degrees went even more strongly for Trump than they had in 2016. That was seen as a tall task, given he won a record margin with this core group four years ago. Trump promised to turn out more of them and did so, but Biden's gains, primarily in the suburbs, offset that turnout. Biden currently holds almost a 6 million-vote lead in the popular vote. Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million in 2016. Notably, Trump also made inroads in counties with significant Latino populations in places like South Florida and South Texas. Those improvements helped Trump win those two big states more comfortably than the preelection polls had shown. In Texas in particular, it's notable that Biden did better than Clinton had in 2016 in Dallas, Austin, Houston and in some surrounding suburban counties. But that was offset by Trump's gains in South Texas and the increased turnout in more rural areas. So just looking at the map, the country looks stretched even further apart. Trump remains one of the most polarizing figures in American presidential history, and President-elect Biden inherits a deeply divided nation in the midst of health, economic and racial crises. Arizona: Every election, most of the vote in Arizona comes from Maricopa County, home to Phoenix. That was no different this year, as more than 60% of the state's vote came from Maricopa. So winning it is key. And that's exactly what Biden did. Biden became the first Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948 to win Maricopa, which is fast-growing and diversifying. (Note that in the graphic below, Maricopa is listed solely as an urban county.) Biden defeated Trump there, 50% to 48%, or by about 45,000 votes. Biden's statewide margin: a little over 10,000. Trump actually increased his margins in the rural counties overall, but Biden also gained significantly in Pima County, where Tucson is. There, Biden won by 40,000 more votes than Clinton in 2016. Loading... Michigan: Votes for Democrats in Michigan start in Detroit, or Wayne County. About 1 in 5 Biden votes in the state came from Wayne County. He won it by 32,000 more votes than Clinton did. But Biden also flipped Kent County, home to Grand Rapids, winning 31,000 more votes than Democrats did in 2016. Biden made up even more votes in the suburbs, improving more than 94,000 over 2016 just from four counties \u2014 Oakland, Washtenaw, Macomb and Ottawa. And more than half of those votes came from Oakland. Like in other places, Trump expanded here in rural areas but not enough to offset Biden's improvements, for a 51% to 48% win, or 145,000 votes. Remember, this is a state Trump won by just over 10,000 votes in 2016. Loading... Pennsylvania: For as much attention as Philadelphia vote-counting has attracted from the president, Pennsylvania was all about the Philadelphia suburbs. Biden actually won Philadelphia by thousands fewer votes than Clinton. But he more than made up for it in the suburbs. In just four counties \u2014 Montgomery, Delaware, Chester and Bucks \u2014 Biden improved on the 2016 margin by about 100,000 votes. Trump did gain in some rural counties, but this is one state where Biden did cut into Trump's margins in some redder places, like Lancaster County. Loading... Wisconsin: Trump won here in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes. Biden, though, won it by 20,500 votes (pending a recount). So every vote counted. Biden turned out more Milwaukee County voters and won by a 20,000 more votes than Clinton did in 2016. But Biden's biggest vote gain came from Dane County, home to Madison and the University of Wisconsin. He won there by 35,000 more votes than Clinton did in 2016. Biden also chipped away in some more rural and suburban areas, even Waukesha, the heavily Republican county. Biden cut into Trump's margin there by 7,500 votes. Loading... Georgia: Like Pennsylvania, Georgia was all about the suburbs around one city, Atlanta. Though The Associated Press hasn't called a winner in the narrowly contested state, Biden rode a demographic wave of change in Georgia to likely become the first Democrat to win it since Bill Clinton in 1992. Back then, though, Georgia was far more white. Now, it is nearly evenly split between white and nonwhite. Trump won the state by more than 211,000 votes in 2016, but Biden made up for that in and around Atlanta. Biden won an almost 65,000 wider vote margin than Clinton in Fulton, where Atlanta itself is, but also more than 190,000 in the suburbs of DeKalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton and Henry counties.

            "article_content": "Thousands of President Trump's supporters were out in Washington, D.C., on Saturday for a day of rallying to echo the false assertion that the 2020 presidential election was marked by fraud.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Thousands of President Trump's supporters rallied in Washington, D.C., today at an event known as the Million MAGA March. Turnout estimates were all over the place. The White House said a million. President Trump tweeted about hundreds of thousands. Authorities in Washington, D.C., say it was more like 10,000. Whatever the figure, it was a bigger than expected public showing for Trump supporters who believe without evidence that he was robbed of a second term. NPR's Hannah Allam was at the rally. She's actually still in the field near the White House. And she's with us now from there. Hi, Hannah. HANNAH ALLAM, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: So tell us a bit more about who showed up. ALLAM: Well, it was a broad cross-section of Trump supporters. There were Republican families with their children, probably more racial diversity than I've seen at many other right-wing events. And as expected, there was a real mix of fringe and extremist groups there. I saw the Proud Boys, boogaloo boys, followers of the mass delusion of QAnon. There were a few scuffles, but no major violence. And for the most part, all these groups are coalescing under the stop the steal slogan - again, a reference to the baseless claims that the election was fraudulent. The Trump supporters at the rally, needless to say, do not consider their views conspiratorial. I talked with one couple from Eastern Tennessee, Julie (ph) and David North (ph), and this was their response to that characterization. DAVID NORTH: Look. JULIE NORTH: Look around (laughter). D NORTH: Is this fringe? This tells the whole story. This is the real story. This isn't the fringe. J NORTH: Well, and I heard a great definition the other day. Someone said that the conspiracy theory that you would keep getting - you know, we hear that term being tossed around. Really what that means is it's a way to try to put people in a category who are smart enough to look and connect the dots. So they can call it whatever they want to call it, but it's truth. MARTIN: Was there a goal for the day? If so, what was it? ALLAM: Yeah. It kind of depended on who you ask. But, I mean, overall, it was a show of support for President Trump, a vocal rejection of the election results and an effort to kind of rally Trump's various constituencies under one banner. And they did this under the - you know, during the lockdown protests over the summer. And it seems like they're building on those connections, maybe extending those to some kind of, you know, forming of an opposition bloc under a Biden administration. MARTIN: And President Trump had tweeted that he might show up at the rally, and he did. What exactly happened? ALLAM: Yeah, that's right. I was around the corner with another crowd when it happened, but yes, the president's motorcade came to Freedom Plaza. It did a ring around the site. And, of course, this was thrilling to his supporters who were there. I spoke with one of them who got to glimpse the motorcade. It was - that's Patti Tymon (ph). She's actually an immigrant from the Philippines who came to the U.S. when she was a child. And she says she's living the American dream that she believes Trump is protecting. And this was her thought on seeing his motorcade today. PATTI TYMON: We just exited the elevators, and then there was this ruckus, and we ran out. I was, like, oh, my God. It's President Trump. And we tried to run to see him, but we saw, you know, all of the - the whole parade of security and everything else that follows him. But then he did a U-turn, and he started coming around the other way. And everybody was so excited because really they just love - they love him. They do. They genuinely love this president. ALLAM: So yes. I mean, she is - she, I'd say, would be among the supporters who are coming to terms with the fact that the president is leaving office and I want to thank him, say goodbye, perhaps. But others say, no, they're not ready to give up the fight. MARTIN: That is NPR's Hannah Allam. Hannah, thanks so much for your reporting. ALLAM: Thank you.

Of those arrests, four were for firearm violations, two for simple assault, one for an assault on a police officer and two for disorderly conduct, D.C. police told member station WAMU. Seven guns were recovered. It was not immediately clear if the guns belonged to Trump supporters or counterprotesters. Scattered clashes turned violent around 8 p.m., when Trump supporters armed with batons and counterprotesters collided in a brawl five blocks from the White House, The Post reported, before police broke up the groups. A city fire official said a young man was transported to the hospital for serious injuries after he was stabbed in the back during the fight, according to the newspaper.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: World leaders have been congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, but America's top diplomat is not ready to start a transition. In fact, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is fueling President Trump's baseless claims of fraud. Here's what Pompeo said at a State Department news conference today when he was asked about the transition. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE POMPEO: There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration, all right? We're ready. SHAPIRO: Joining us from the State Department is diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen. Hi, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi there, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us more about how the secretary is dealing with these questions about the election results. KELEMEN: Well, he certainly toed the president's line, saying all legal votes need to be counted. And when one of my colleagues asked whether the fact that Trump has not yet conceded is undermining America's image as it tries to promote democratic values abroad, he was quite dismissive. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) POMPEO: That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous. KELEMEN: He often calls questions ridiculous if there are questions that could lead to any daylight between him and the president. And by the way, Ari, the secretary talked about the great work the U.S. does along with international election observers overseas. Well, some of those observers were here in the U.S., and they criticized President Trump for undermining democratic institutions with what they called baseless allegations of widespread fraud. SHAPIRO: Well, I know President-elect Biden was asked about this today. What did he say? KELEMEN: Yeah. He was asked specifically about Pompeo's remarks and basically said that the transition is moving ahead. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: And nothing's going to stop that. And so I'm confident that the fact that they're not willing to acknowledge we won at this point is not of much consequence in our planning and what we're able to do between now and January 20. KELEMEN: Biden says he's been getting calls from world leaders, and he's moving ahead with his plans to name cabinet officials. He said it would be nice to have access to classified information, as is usual during such a transition. But he says that's not critical. SHAPIRO: Did Secretary Pompeo address whether a delayed transition is a risk to national security? KELEMEN: Well, that was pretty interesting because he actually cited 2000, the Bush versus Gore race, and said though it was delayed by the courts, the transition went smoothly. But, Ari, the 9/11 Commission said that the Bush administration was slow to get its national security team in place, and that was a problem as al-Qaida was planning that attack. Now, with Biden, he has a lot of foreign policy experts on his team, so he's sounding pretty confident. SHAPIRO: In addition to all of this back-and-forth, I understand Pompeo also had some other foreign policy news today. Tell us about that. KELEMEN: Yeah. Well, for instance, he announced more than $23 billion in arms sales with the United Arab Emirates. That includes 50 F-35s. It's a deal that followed the UAE's decision to normalize ties with Israel. Pompeo also announced that he's going to be visiting UAE and Israel as well as France, Turkey, Georgia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar on a trip starting Friday. And the rest of his news conference sounded a bit like a swan song. He talked about his accomplishments that he's most proud of, like promoting religious freedoms and joining a group of countries that oppose abortion rights. SHAPIRO: That is NPR's Michele Kelemen reporting from the State Department. Thanks very much. KELEMEN: Sure thing. (SOUNDBITE OF EL TEN ELEVEN'S \"FANSHAWE\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Wisconsin saw one of the nation's tightest presidential contests. How do voters there deal with their state's sharp political and social divisions and move forward?  NOEL KING, HOST: Wisconsin was a swing state again this year. Joe Biden won it by about 20,000 votes, which is almost exactly the same number that Donald Trump won it by four years ago. So Wisconsin is deeply divided. How does the state move on? Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: There's this thing in Wisconsin; maybe you've heard of it. It's called Wisconsin nice. KATHY CRAMER: Wisconsin nice is this behavior of avoiding conflict, generally. SCHAPER: Kathy Cramer is a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. CRAMER: I can remember numerous times growing up, people would say things like, yeah, you just stay away from politics, sex and religion. Just don't talk about those things (laughter), you know? SCHAPER: I do know. I went to college there and - this is true - one of my first roommates said those exact words to me as we were moving into the dorm. CRAMER: Wisconsin nice meant that if you didn't get along with someone politically, you still got along with them. You just didn't talk about politics. SCHAPER: But Wisconsin nice was already disappearing a decade ago when Republican Scott Walker was elected governor and immediately slashed union rights for most public employees. And the state's political divide grew even wider after Trump took office. That might be why at this sidewalk cafe in downtown Kenosha, many seemed more eager to talk about the unseasonably warm weather than politics. And those enjoying this rare 70-degree day in November say they're feeling... JOEY MORALES: A sense of relief. SCHAPER: ...Thirty-four-year-old Joey Morales says he really feels that Kenosha - and the whole country - have been on edge. JOEY MORALES: I feel like there's so much hate, and people have been pushing each other away. There's a sense of division, and the country needs to come together and rebuild. JASMINE MORALES: I mean, we're still boarded up. You can still see it here in Kenosha. SCHAPER: Thirty-one-year-old Jasmine Morales points to plywood on storefronts all around downtown Kenosha months after the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent protests that turned violent, with two demonstrators shot and killed and a third seriously wounded. She had hoped this election would heal some of those wounds. JASMINE MORALES: With everything, all the unrest and everything that's happened, this should bring us together. SCHAPER: But that may be difficult to do here. After winning Kenosha County by just 238 votes four years ago, President Trump won this county by nearly 3,000 votes this year, and that's with a significant increase in voter turnout. It's surprising to many here after a summer of racial strife. Southeast Wisconsin has some of the nation's widest racial inequities by virtually every measure. TIMOTHY THOMPKINS: Biden may win this election, but that hasn't changed America's heart of the deep-seeded systemic racism. SCHAPER: Timothy Thompkins is a member of the Kenosha Coalition for Dismantling Racism. He says you can't have a serious talk about the political divisions here without discussing race. THOMPKINS: America needs to heal from its inside. Elections don't do that. People do that beyond the elections. SCHAPER: But in the more conservative western end of Kenosha, many Trump supporters are not yet ready to look past the election. JIM COLLETTI: I honestly think somebody's put the kibosh in - somehow the numbers are wrong. Trump should have won Wisconsin. SCHAPER: Jim Colletti is outside of the world-famous Brat Stop, a place where people returning from weekend trips up north stock up on beer, sausage and cheese. He's sitting at a picnic table enjoying his brat. COLLETTI: I think it's all a scam. There's too many inconsistencies with the election. SCHAPER: Inside at the Brat Stop's bar, some other Trump supporters express concerns about the nation's deep political divide. Here's 61-year-old Terry Beal. TERRY BEAL: They need to find a way to come together for the good of the people. Right now, the country has been in turmoil for the whole year. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCHAPER: Beal is sipping beer and playing a dice game with her friend Mary McNigh, who is even more pessimistic. MARY MCNIGH: I just don't think people are - they like being mad. They like having something to argue about. SCHAPER: McNigh and Beal agree that, in a way, the nation's political divide really reflects us. And even in Wisconsin, it appears that many people just don't want to be nice about politics these days. David Schaper, NPR News, Kenosha, Wis. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (left) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2018. Newsom will appointment a successor to Harris in the Senate, a highly coveted seat among California Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Damian Dovarganes/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (left) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2018. Newsom will appointment a successor to Harris in the Senate, a highly coveted seat among California Democrats. Speculation about who California Gov. Gavin Newsom would choose to fill out the rest of Kamala Harris' U.S. Senate term if she got elected vice president began almost the moment Joe Biden announced her as his running mate. Now that Harris is vice president-elect, filling her Senate seat is not a matter of if, but who and when. And what are the qualities Newsom should consider as he makes his most important political decision yet as governor? Newsom's considerations include diversity, geography, electability and political compatibility. Asked on Election Day about the possibility of choosing a successor, Newsom insisted he was not looking forward to it. \"I mean, honestly, I'm not even exaggerating. There's a hundred chores that I'd prefer. I'm not kidding,\" Newsom joked. \"This is not something that I wish even on my worst enemy, because you create enemies in this process you know, not just friends. And it's a vexing decision. It's a challenging one,\" Newsom said. Harris, who was elected to her first Senate term in 2016, would be up for reelection in 2022. Whoever replaces her will get a couple of years in the Senate before running (Newsom has ruled out a special election to fill out the term). \"Diversity is a given,\" said Newsom's longtime adviser Nathan Ballard. \"It's not going to be someone who looks like Gavin,\" meaning not a straight white male. The current moment, after George Floyd's death and Harris' focus on rooting racial bias out of the criminal justice system, would seem to rule out likely Senate aspirants such as Rep. Adam Schiff, at least at this time. For Newsom, there are also other, practical considerations. \"Is it a caretaker, or someone who can turn around a win? Is it someone that's qualified that may not win but would be?\" Newsom asked rhetorically. The shortlist Kamala Harris is the only Black woman in the U.S. Senate, so you can start there. Would Newsom want to replace her with someone who fits that criteria? In that case, the governor has solid options. One Bay Area mayor fits the bill, San Francisco's London Breed, who's won high marks for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Across the Bay, Mayor Libby Schaaf in Oakland, who is white, also has made a name for herself. Both Democrats have solid relationships with Gov. Newsom and are relatively young. Rep. Karen Bass from Los Angeles is chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Bass saw her stock rise during the vice presidential vetting process only to be taken down by stories about her past comments regarding Cuba and Fidel Castro. But Bass, 67, is well-liked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others in Congress who lobbied Biden's vetting committee to choose her to be his running mate. And as former speaker of the state Assembly, Bass is known as an effective legislator who worked across party lines. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, who worked with Bass in the legislature, called her \"my favorite Democrat,\" which, considering that's a short list, may not be saying much. Then there's Rep. Barbara Lee, a longtime friend of Harris and a fellow Oaklander who has represented her city in Congress since 1998. Lee, 74, is also close to the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and was the only member of Congress to vote against authorizing the use of force for President George W. Bush before the Iraq War. Lee also helped bridge the divide between the left-leaning and moderate parts of the party in 2016 after Hillary Clinton won the nomination. That may make her more than acceptable to all parts of the California Democratic Party. Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna, 44, is also an up and comer after crushing veteran Congressman Mike Honda in 2016. Like Harris, Khanna is Indian American and co-chaired Sanders' national campaign for president this year. One argument against Breed, Schaaf, Bass and Lee, however, is that none of them has ever waged a statewide campaign in California, which is hardly an easy task given the size of the state and the cost of running. Secretary of State Alex Padilla has been widely rumored to covet a U.S. Senate seat and is a longtime friend and supporter of Newsom. Padilla chaired Newsom's abortive campaign for governor in 2010 before Jerry Brown jumped in. Padilla was also an early endorser of Newsom while he was running against former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and others in 2018. \"Gavin Newsom has just a handful of close friends,\" Ballard noted. \"And Alex is one of them. He's part of that inner circle.\" Padilla worked as an intern for Sen. Dianne Feinstein and at age 26 was elected to the Los Angeles City Council. Two years later he became the youngest person ever elected president of the city council. Padilla, 47, just oversaw a complicated election where, for the first time, every registered voter was sent a vote-by-mail ballot. But the secretary of state was recently caught up in controversy over a $35 million contract for nonpartisan voter outreach that went to a firm linked with Joe Biden. How much the dustup would matter to Newsom is unclear. But as Ballard tells it, Padilla is near the top of Newsom's list. \"He is eminently qualified for the position, and of all the contenders he's the most senatorial,\" Ballard said, meaning he believes Padilla sounds and looks like a senator. Ballard noted that Newsom's choice will be on the ballot in 2022 when the governor is up for reelection. \"It's almost like having a running mate,\" he said, adding he wouldn't want to appoint someone who would be a drag on his own campaign. Padilla has run for statewide office twice and won both times. Another point in Padilla's favor: It's a two-for. If Newsom chooses him, or another statewide officeholder, he would get to name the replacement for that office as well. Other options State Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles would be a dynamic choice to replace Harris. As chair of the state Senate Budget Committee, Mitchell has been a fierce and effective advocate for social justice, working mothers and low-income people. But Mitchell, 56, was just elected to the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and would seem unlikely to give that up before she's even sworn in. Newsom, who said he's been inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle entreaties by would-be appointees, called the decision \"vexing\" because of all the dynamics involved. \"In this case you've got people that voted for Kamala Harris. And so is it [someone] in her image? Do you sort of extend that narrative?\" Newsom wondered aloud. Newsom, whose recent nomination of a Black, openly gay judge to the California Supreme Court, seems to enjoy making history. In that case, he has several options including: Others who are either thought to be eyeing this U.S. Senate seat or the one held by 87-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein include: While Newsom eyes these potential picks for political ascension, he has also long eyed higher office. He is widely believed to have seen himself running for president one day, though that option seemingly foreclosed at the moment by the ascension of Harris. But the former San Francisco mayor has remained quite popular with voters, receiving a 57% approval rating in an October survey from the Public Policy Institute of California. He could decide to run for the U.S. Senate when Feinstein leaves. In any case, Newsom said on Election Day that he was thrilled for Harris, who has been a kind of \"frenemy\" or political competitor since he was the city's mayor and she was the city's district attorney. \"I've never seen her more happy, more confident, loose,\" Newsom said. \"She's in her element. And you feel that. You see that. And so I just couldn't be more happy for her. And it's profoundly significant for the state.\"",

            "article_content": "There are a lot of lessons from this election, and given the results, governing won't be easy for President-elect Joe Biden.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption There are a lot of lessons from this election, and given the results, governing won't be easy for President-elect Joe Biden. The tumultuous and chaotic Trump presidency is coming to an end \u2014 even if President Trump himself hasn't accepted it yet. Democrat Joe Biden is now the president-elect, according to calls from The Associated Press, which NPR relies on for race calls, as well as all the other broadcast networks. Loading... Biden is currently at 290 electoral votes, 20 more than needed thanks to Pennsylvania, which was called Saturday. Biden is on track to win 306 electoral votes if his slim lead holds in Georgia. It wasn't the timeline many Americans were expecting, given that Election Day was Tuesday, but we warned that counting an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots might take a while \u2014 and it's still going. There was record turnout and both Biden and Trump got more votes than any other presidential candidates in history. There are a lot of lessons from this election, and given the results, governing won't be easy for Biden. 1. The popular vote wasn't that close, but Democrats continue to have an electoral map problem Given how polarized the country is, for Biden to win (as of Sunday night) almost 51% of the popular vote, with a margin of more than 4 million votes and climbing, is a feat. When all is said and done, more than 158 million people will have voted this election, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a turnout rate of more than 66%. That would be the highest since 1900. And Biden could get to 80 million votes cast for him, by far the most ever. 2020 was a perfect storm for high turnout \u2014 a hotly polarizing president up for reelection and the wide use of mail-in voting. States with a history of most- or all-mail elections, like Washington state and Colorado, routinely see turnout of 80% or higher. Democrats have now won the popular vote in seven of the last eight elections, and yet two of them didn't become president in the past 20 years, and even this year, the margins in key states were very close. Democrats are concentrated in cities and on the coasts, and that sorting is making presidential elections closer than their advantage with the broader population. 2. President Trump still hasn't accepted the outcome \u2014 and he may never Unlike every other presidential candidate in the modern TV era, Trump has not made a concession speech, nor has he even called Biden. Democrat Al Gore retracted his concession in 2000 as the vote got closer between him and Republican George W. Bush, but that was over a 537-vote margin in one state. President Trump speaks in the briefing room at the White House on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks in the briefing room at the White House on Thursday. That's not what's happening here. Trump is down more than 10,000 votes in Georgia, more than 20,000 in Wisconsin, more than 30,000 and growing in Nevada, more than 40,000 and climbing in Pennsylvania and 146,000 in Michigan. Trump has filed lawsuits challenging votes in multiple states. And he has requested a recount in Wisconsin. He has every right to go to court and present evidence. If some votes are overturned, that's part of the democratic process. But can he make up differences of tens of thousands of votes in multiple states? Very, very unlikely. And part of the role of an American president is to uphold the very thing that separates the United States from corrupt countries \u2014 free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. Instead, this president continues to baselessly undermine it with one last conspiracy because it seems he just can't accept losing. 3. The suburbs helped Biden to the presidency The suburbs were a key fight in this presidential election. Trump called for \"law and order\" and tried to win over suburban white women with an anachronistic and outdated view of the suburbs. Biden took a different tack, and it appears he benefited. For as much as the polls underestimated Trump's support, one thing they continuously showed was that suburban voters were moving away from the president, and that played out in key states. In the collar counties of Philadelphia, for example, Biden improved on Hillary Clinton's 2016 margin in Chester County by 8 points (so far), and by 5 points in Montgomery and Delaware counties, in addition to other gains he made. In Georgia, Biden did better than Clinton in Cobb and Gwinnett counties, both outside Atlanta, by double-digits. In Cobb, Clinton won it by 2 points, Biden by 14. In Gwinnett, Clinton won by 6, Biden by 18. These are populous, growing areas that have to worry the GOP. 4. Biden rebuilt the \"blue wall,\" but the Sun Belt is the future Biden reversed Trump's 2016 wins in the former \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, but he didn't win by as much as the polls suggested or as past Democrats have. The three states combined were decided this year by just over 200,000 votes out of more than 15 million \u2014 just enough to win. If those three states don't seem reliably Democratic anymore, that's because they aren't. We're seeing a political realignment in America, most brightly along education lines. Whites without college degrees have migrated away from their lunch-pail Democratic days to Republicans, largely around culture. The demographics are what they are. All three of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are majority white noncollege. And that's to say nothing of Iowa and Ohio, which are also majority white noncollege and states Democrats used to be competitive in and don't appear to be anymore. On the other hand, the South is growing and diversifying, and Biden made important inroads in Georgia, Arizona and even Texas. If Biden holds on to his leads in Arizona and Georgia, he will be the first Democrat to win Arizona since 1996 and the first to win Georgia since 1992. (And in both of those years, Bill Clinton, a Southerner, was at the top of the ticket, and there was a serious third-party contender.) Thirty years ago, Georgia was more than 80% white. Today, that is down to 52% and it has seen its share of Northern transplants moving to the Atlanta suburbs. With continued Latino growth, as well as out-of-state transplants and retirees, Arizona continues its leftward shift. In 2020, Arizona not only voted for Biden in the presidential race, but it will also have two Democratic senators for the first time since the 1950s \u2014 and the Democratic Party was very different then. Texas continues to be more of a Democratic hope than reality, but this is the closest Texas has been since 1996. Biden won more than 1.3 million more votes than Clinton in 2016. It wasn't enough, but it's on the map. Florida, however, is the Sun Belt exception. Republicans have racked up win after win there. Even though it will continue to be close, it seems it's become harder for Democrats to win there. 5. Given the down-ballot outcomes, governing is going to prove difficult for Biden Democrats' main goal in 2020 was to get rid of Trump, but they had disappointing performances in House and Senate races. In the House, Republicans were not expected to make gains, but that's exactly what happened. They currently stand to pick up a net of five seats, when Democrats thought they might expand their majority. The Senate is still to be decided, hinging on two Georgia races headed to runoffs in January. But key races in Maine, North Carolina, Iowa and Montana that could have clinched full control in Washington didn't go Democrats' way. Instead, what's more likely is split control with Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remaining as majority leader. Biden's skill as a legislator is going to be tested. Today's Senate is not the same Senate he left in 2009; it's far more ideological and polarized. There are some big-ticket items Biden would want to get through, like more coronavirus relief funds, but other items might prove even more difficult. Biden promised a health care public option, a $15 minimum wage and big advancements on climate and racial justice. Those are going to be impossible to get without cooperation from the other side. Even though Biden won the most votes in history, Trump won the second most. Biden called his win a \"mandate,\" but it's hardly that, and politicians often overread mandates. Biden pledged during his campaign to \"unite\" the country, and in his victory speech he said he would reach out to Republicans while delivering for his base. But how does Biden go about doing that, especially since this is still a hotly divided country that's dealing with a public health crisis, will likely have divided government, and he won't start with the numbers to achieve major legislative accomplishments in his first two years?",

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: After his victory speech last night, President-elect Joe Biden has turned his focus to the transition. But the incumbent, President Trump, still refuses to concede. As his campaign continues to challenge the results, Republicans seem divided over how to respond. One leading Republican made it clear in no uncertain terms today that the election is over. In a statement, former President George W. Bush said, quote, \"though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,\" unquote. So what happens next? To answer that, we're joined by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, welcome back. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Thank you. MARTIN: So have we heard from the president today? What's going on there? KEITH: Yeah, he went golfing again today. And he has been tweeting, including one tweet where he falsely pretends not to understand that in every election for decades, media organizations have made calls about who won once enough votes have been counted that it became clear that the other candidate could not win - in this case, him. He wrote, quote, since when does the lame-stream (ph) media call our next - who our next president will be? We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks. But here is the problem with this - many times in the last two weeks and in the last four years, President Trump has recounted with glee how the networks called the race for him in 2016. This was him in Pennsylvania last weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They wouldn't call it. I said, wait a minute. They have to call it because I was at 98 - not 99. I was at 98. It stood there, like, for an hour and a half. And I kept saying, that'd be nice. Pennsylvania - that'd be nice (unintelligible). And then they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. (CHEERING) TRUMP: And then they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. And we won. KEITH: That, of course, is a blast from the past. This time, it was Joe Biden who had to wait even longer for the AP and other networks to call Pennsylvania. And when they did, Biden became president-elect, just as Trump did four years ago. But unlike Trump, Hillary Clinton conceded. Trump has not yet. MARTIN: As we mentioned, former President George W. Bush put out this statement today acknowledging Biden as the clear winner. But he may be the most high-profile person to do that, but he also, to this point, seems to be one of the few. What has been the message from Republicans? KEITH: It's been a bit of a mixed message. The Republican leaders in Congress, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, haven't said anything about Biden's win since the race was called. But others are saying that it isn't final yet and that the legal challenges being raised by the Trump campaign need to continue to be adjudicated. Many have picked up on what seems to be the official Republican talking point - that every legally cast vote should be counted without getting into detail about what that means. And then there are a few others, like Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who was the party's nominee in 2012 and a critic of the president who has congratulated Biden and says he isn't convinced that Trump will accept the inevitable, as he's put it. MARTIN: So regardless of Trump's willingness to concede - which doesn't really have any legal force, it has to be said - Biden has won well over 270 electoral votes, and he's now focused on his transition. So what will that look like? KEITH: Well, the Biden team updated its website to showcase four policy areas the incoming administration will prioritize - COVID-19, economic recovery, racial equity and climate change. There's a transition page and transition social media accounts. And they've announced who will be leading up their coronavirus task force, which gets to work on Monday. MARTIN: That is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, thank you. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The team being assembled will meet these challenges on Day One and build us back better,\" the site reads. The transition now has official social media channels as well \u2014 with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts using the handle @Transition46.

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden is calling for unity and healing while President Trump refuses to accept the results of the election.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: The uncertainty, the wait, is over. Yes, there are still votes being counted this morning and races yet to be determined. Georgia and North Carolina, for example, are still too close to call. And there may be recounts. But the presidency has been decided, and America chose Joe Biden and his promise of unity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task - the task - of our time. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's the president-elect speaking from Wilmington, Del., last night. And with us this morning is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's start with the current president. He has not conceded, though let's remember there is nothing legal or binding about declaring victory or conceding defeat. Meanwhile, former President George W. Bush has called Joe Biden to congratulate him on his win. What's Trump's rationale for not accepting these results? LIASSON: Well, the president is continuing to contest the election in court. He's been tweeting that he won the election. He says he got 71 million legal votes, suggesting that the 75 million and counting votes that Biden got are somehow illegal. But this is a hard thing for the president and nobody likes to lose. But for President Trump, his brand is about never, ever, ever losing. And it sounds like he wants to make sure he leaves the White House not looking like a loser for himself and his supporters. He needs to start the second chapter here by saying he's the real president and it was stolen from him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There are lawsuits. What chances do they have of succeeding? LIASSON: Legal experts on both sides say they have very little chance because they'd have to reverse hundreds of thousands of votes - tens of thousands of votes in multiple states. That generally doesn't happen. Even recounts, which the president has threatened in the states that are close enough to allow for a recount - he'd have to pay for those recounts. And historically, recounts never change more than a couple hundred votes here and there. So the prospects are slim. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's turn to Biden's speech last night. What did you make of it? LIASSON: Well, it was a unifying speech. He spoke directly to people who didn't vote for him. He said to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment. I've lost a couple of elections myself. But now let's give each other a chance. So that's his brand. He's going to try to unify. It was also a very practical speech - let's get down to work. He listed the things he believes he has a mandate for - control the virus, build prosperity, secure health care for Americans, achieve racial justice and save the climate. So he's going to get to work right away, and he's told the country what he wants to do. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And meanwhile, we're in this strange period - right? - where there's going to be several months until there's an inauguration where much could happen. Trump has hinted before the election that he would fire, for example, Anthony Fauci. Is that the kind of thing we should expect from him? What do you think the next two months will look like? LIASSON: It's possible that the president could fire a lot of people. He could pardon a lot of people, most presidents do that on their way out. He could issue a lot of executive orders. Most of what President Trump could do between now and Inauguration Day could be reversed. But what I think will happen in the next couple of months is all of a sudden the focus of America will shift away from Donald Trump and towards the new president by definition. We've lived in a Donald Trump-centric political universe for four years, and that's what's going to happen. I think Biden has indicated he wants to hit the ground running. He has and his team have decades of experience in government. They're very organized and prepared. They know what they want to do in these agencies. And there's only so much that Donald Trump can do that would leave a permanent mark at this point. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hit the ground running - Mara, let me ask you this, as someone who's obviously been a long time watcher of Washington. Joe Biden is calling for unity. How much success do you think he'll have on that front? LIASSON: I think legislatively it depends on Mitch McConnell. If Republicans still control the Senate - we don't know that yet, we're waiting for some races in Georgia. But what's in Mitch McConnell's political interest? Does he want to compromise or not? We know that Joe Biden is a pragmatic centrist - kind of half a loaf guy. He is - wants to compromise. He's said that. He has said that cooperating is a choice. We can choose to cooperate or choose not to cooperate. And he says the American people want us to work together. He said also that it's a constant battle between the better angels of our nature and our darkest impulses, and what presidents say in this battle matters. So he's going to try as hard as he can to reach across the aisle. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much. LIASSON: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Evangelical voters have shown strong support for President Trump over the last four years, and 8 in 10 voted for him in the 2020 election as well.\n                \n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Evangelical voters have shown strong support for President Trump over the last four years, and 8 in 10 voted for him in the 2020 election as well. President Donald Trump and Joe Biden this year both looked to rally support among religious Americans, but the faith vote largely broke along familiar lines. \"The religious landscape in terms of voting has been remarkably stable,\" says Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. \"Since Reagan, we have essentially seen this: white Christian voters have tended to support Republican candidates, and Christians of color and everyone else, including the religiously unaffiliated, have tended to support Democratic candidates.\" One slight change this year was a small decline in support for Trump among white Catholics, compared to 2016, according to National Election Pool and AP/Votecast. Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University who follows the faith vote closely, thinks the improvement in Catholic support for Biden this year was significant.\" White Catholics are important in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,\" Burge says. \"If you can swing them your way, that's the difference in close races.\" The loss of white Catholic votes for Trump in the Upper Midwest may have been somewhat offset, however, by an apparent increase in Hispanic Catholic support for Trump in places like Florida. A notable fact in 2016 was that exit polls showed about 80% of white evangelical Christians supported Trump in spite of his unfamiliarity with the Bible, his divorces, his vulgar rhetoric and his association with porn stars. Trump's reputation in moral terms hasn't changed all that much during his time in office, but there is little evidence of slippage among these faith voters. Surveys of early voters and exit polls this year showed between 76 and 81% of white evangelical and \"born again\" voters supporting Trump, according to the National Election Pool and AP/Votecast. \"We essentially have White evangelicals, somewhere around 8 in 10, supporting the president, standing by their candidate, standing by their man,\" says Jones. Pundits and politicians are most interested in those voter groups who are up for grabs. From that point of view, white evangelical Christians may no longer warrant close attention. \"I think the Democrats should stop thinking about white evangelicals entirely,\" Burge says. \"And I think the Republicans should take them for granted. At some point, it's like, what can you do to make them change \u2014 on the Democratic side or the Republican side?\" Some of Biden's supporters did try to reach evangelical Christians this year. Jerushah Duford, an evangelical writer and the granddaughter of Billy Graham, was a leader of the group, Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden. \"I don't know if it made a difference in the election results, but that's not the only difference we were attempting to make,\" she says. \"My goal was more about giving voice to those people who felt really uncomfortable watching evangelical leaders not saying anything and sometimes actually condoning what they were seeing in this administration.\" \"I think what these individuals needed was some faith leaders to come out and say, 'I know you're not hearing this everywhere, but this is not our faith,' \" she says. When the pro-Biden \"Not Our Faith\" group was organized, Duford joined it. \"My goal,\" she says, \"was more of an encouragement to the droves of people who are leaving the church because of the hypocrisy they've seen.\" The phenomenon of Americans leaving the faith traditions in which they were raised has been well documented in recent years. The share of the U.S. population and the electorate who list their religious affiliation as \"none\" is growing steadily. \"I think the 'God Gap' is more and more the narrative when we think about the parties,\" Burge says. \"Half of white liberals today identify as religiously unaffiliated, while the Right is staying very Christian.\" The growth of the \"nones,\" those with no religious affiliation, is especially notable among the youngest voter cohort, Generation Z, born after 1996. \"The Republicans have to figure out a way to peel off some of those more libertarian or fiscally conservative Generation Z 'nones,' \" Burge says, \"or they're going to have a very bleak future politically.\" But in doing so, he warns, \"They need to keep their white Christian base happy.\"",

            "article_content": "The AP has President-elect Biden at 290 electoral votes to Trump's 214. Still, President Trump has not conceded the election.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This evening, President-elect Biden is expected to address the nation in a primetime address. It will be his first speech since winning the presidency, which happened earlier today - after the (unintelligible) was confirmed, we really should say, earlier today, after the Associated Press called the states of Pennsylvania and Nevada for him. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: The AP has President-elect Biden at 290 electoral votes to Trump's 214. Still, President Trump has not conceded the election. To hear more about how the president is responding, we're joined now by Franco Ordo\u00f1ez, NPR White House correspondent, who's been covering the Trump campaign. He's traveled with President Trump across the Midwest and Florida and has been at the White House for much of this presidency. Franco, thank you so much for staying with us. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Thank you. MARTIN: So you've met a lot of Trump supporters in your travels. What message are they getting from the president today? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, they're - I mean, they're definitely hearing from him, and they're definitely hearing from him in very Trumpian fashion. I mean, just an hour ago, the president published a very long, fiery tweet claiming more fraud. All of it was in caps. He noted that he had received more than 70 million legal votes, which was the most for a sitting president. That is true. Of course, Biden got more than 74 million votes. Trump is also pledging to take more legal action despite, you know, several cases that he's already launched or his campaign has already launched have been thrown out by the courts. His rapid response team is asking for donations and calling for more examples of voter fraud. But the reality is, as we've reported, he has yet to show any actual evidence of systematic wrongdoing. MARTIN: And as we have all said, that - the president makes his views clear. He doesn't need or - he doesn't need an intermediary, nor does he use one. So he makes it very clear what he feels and how he feels at any particular moment. But behind the scenes, is there any evidence that a different message is being delivered or taking hold? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. He was at his golf course today where he issued some of these fiery statements. But it's interesting because the public comments - there's a contrast between those and the private conversations that are happening behind the scenes. I've been talking with a former campaign aide who tells me that the president is being advised that his legal options are limited. But it's been hard for him. You know, no politician likes to lose. And the president, you know, really doesn't like to lose. He said that on Tuesday when he was at his headquarters, his reelection headquarters. The president really believed that he couldn't lose. And frankly, many people in Trump world also didn't think that he could lose. The president had overcome so many challenges, you know, over the last four years. And, you know, he does want to continue to fight for the people who voted for him, I'm told. But it is also dawning on him that if - even if he were to win some of these legal challenges that he's still likely not to get the 270 electoral votes that he needs to win reelection. MARTIN: So let's look ahead to the transition now. Before we turn to Mara Liasson, our colleague, is there any sign of how that will go? I have to note that this is news that may not have gotten quite a lot of attention in recent days because of all the drama surrounding the election, but three officials who led agencies were fired or replaced in just the past two days. And the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who ostensibly runs things at the White House, has been diagnosed with coronavirus. We just learned that. So do we have any sense of what a transition could look like? Is there a sense that the Trump administration will cooperate? Has any planning been going on? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, from the Trump side, you know, they have been saying that they do not - they were not thinking about a transition, that they planned to be reelected. President Trump also himself said repeatedly that he, you know, raised questions about whether he would hand over power easily. He argued that, you know, it wasn't handed over to him very well. And, you know, he also argued many times that considering, you know, mail-in voting, which he considered fraudulent, that it would not be a legal transfer - pardon me, a legal election. So he had been setting this up for so long. But as you noted, we're already seeing these very challenging signs of people leaving under questionable circumstances, the chief of staff getting the coronavirus. It's really - it's a - you know, we'll see. MARTIN: That's NPR White House correspondent Frank Ordonez. We want to go now to Mara Liasson, NPR national political correspondent. Mara, why don't you pick up the thread there? And I know this is a situation where I might have to ask you to speculate a bit, but what is next for President Trump, assuming that he does leave office, as all signs indicate he now should? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yeah. I think that it's going to be a very subtle kind of pressure campaign, in a way. You already hear his supporters on Fox News talking about his incredible legacy and that he would keep his legacy more burnished if he did step down in a dignified manner. You're not really hearing Republicans say out loud, please don't let the screen door hit you on the way out. But there aren't a lot of prominent Republican voices saying the election was stolen. You're the real winner. Dig your heels in. Don't leave. You're not hearing that. So I think that over time, Trump is going to have to try to figure out a way to leave office but with his brand as someone who never loses and always wins intact. If he's going to continue to be the most important person in the Republican Party - and I think he will remain that for as long as he has a Twitter account - I think that he has to figure out a rationale. You know, I don't know if he says it was stolen from me, I'm the real president in exile, or I accomplished so much in four years - as much as any president could accomplish in 12. I don't know what he says, but he has to keep his brand intact because that's how he makes a living. He's monetized the brand. And the brand is his personality as a winner, somebody who's extremely successful. MARTIN: And... LIASSON: So that's going to take some time. MARTIN: And before we turn to Scott Detrow, I want to ask you, Mara Liasson, about the president-elect, Joe Biden. And what are what are his big challenges? We know he sent messaging around... LIASSON: Well... MARTIN: ...Wanting to lower the temperature and so forth. But beyond that, tell us more. LIASSON: Yeah, I think that his challenges are so big they're mind-boggling. I mean, he and Barack Obama came into office in 2008 in the midst of a financial crisis. Now he's coming into office in the midst of a pandemic, a recession, a huge debate about racial justice. But as he said yesterday - he said, quote, \"they have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.\" And they made it clear - they, the voters, made it clear they want the country to come together, not pull apart. So that is what he wants to communicate every day after January 20... MARTIN: And... LIASSON: ...And maybe even before. MARTIN: But - and how are - say, let's assume just for the sake of argument - I know it's not decided yet - that the Senate - that the Republicans retain control of the Senate. How are they likely to interpret that mandate? LIASSON: How are the Republicans? MARTIN: Republicans... LIASSON: Well, that's... MARTIN: Exactly. LIASSON: That's the big question. What does Mitch McConnell see in his political interest? Is it compromising with Joe Biden on certain things, or is it obstructing him at every step of the way, which he has the power to do? And we've seen him do it very effectively in the past. We don't know the answer to that question. But Joe Biden is going to have to figure out how to take popular Democratic policies, whether it's a $15 an hour minimum wage, public option to Obamacare, something big on climate change, some kind of a big relief bill for people who are still suffering from the pandemic - how to sell those policies even if Republicans in the Senate don't want any part of them. MARTIN: That was NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Let's go to Scott Detrow now, NPR correspondent Scott Detrow, who has been following the Biden campaign. Scott Detrow, what do we expect to hear from President-elect Biden tonight? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: You know, I think, as Mara was saying, you're going to hear him start to set his agenda out, talk again about the idea that he feels like he has a mandate. And even though he certainly had a very decisive win in the presidential race, Republicans gained seats in the House, and Democrats really did not meet expectations in the Senate. So I think it's important for Biden to make that case early and often. I think we're going to expect to hear a lot of a constant theme from the Biden campaign - the idea of unifying the nation. One thing he said last night in that I-think-I've-quite-won-but-I-won't-quite-say-it-yet appearance - he said, the purpose of our politics, the work of this nation, is not to fan the flames of conflict but to solve problems. And lastly, I think we'll expect him to continue to talk about that No. 1 priority, getting this coronavirus pandemic under control. We have blown past previous daily records over the last week as we've counted these votes. One thing in Biden's favor - a lot of the things he wants to do can be done in the executive branch. A lot of it is centralizing decision-making, not leaving it up to states, trying to push for more mask usage, getting more plans in place for this eventual vaccine. Those - that's work that Biden and his transition team can start right away. MARTIN: And just briefly, if you can, Scott, you know, this man has such a compelling personal story, which I think is well known at this point. I mean, having been sworn into his Senate seat from the hospital room where his boys were recovering after his wife and baby daughter were killed in a car crash - I mean, this is his third run over 30 years - a lot of, you know, losing his son Beau, who was a political star, a rising political star in his own right. I mean, what is likely to be his North Star in setting his course in the next couple of months and years as he addresses all these issues that Mara just outlined for us? DETROW: I think empathy, I think understanding a lot of Americans are in pain, whether it's financial pain or physical pain or losing loved ones to due to a pandemic. On Tuesday, he started the day visiting the grave of his son Beau. He later went to his childhood home, the home that he often talks about, his dad coming up the stairs to tell him he had lost his job and had to move. There were a lot of sentimental journeys for Biden on Tuesday, but a lot of them came back to moments of real struggle that he overcame and something he always comes back to saying, I understand how that feels, and I understand how you feel right now. I think that will be a theme tonight, on January 20 and throughout the Biden administration. MARTIN: That was NPR correspondent Scott Detrow. We also heard from NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson and NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Thank you all so much for staying with us. And we know you'll stay with us throughout the evening. Thank you so much. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF EMANCIPATOR'S \"GOODNESS\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated on Tuesday at 3:15 p.m. ET President-elect Joe Biden called for healing and cooperation in his victory speech on Saturday night, striking an optimistic tone about the prospects for a renewed and reunited America. \"I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, and to make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home,\" Biden said at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. \"It is the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision real \u2014 it's a task, the task, of our times.\" \"I've long talked about the battle for the soul of America,\" he said. \"It's time for our better angels to prevail.\" Read a transcript of Biden's remarks below. Biden did not directly acknowledge President Trump's false claims to have won the election. The Associated Press and other news outlets called the election for Biden on Saturday morning. \"The people of this nation have spoken,\" Biden declared. \"They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for 'we the people'.\" But the former vice president, who pledged throughout his candidacy that he would represent the Americans who voted for Trump as well as those who voted for him, reiterated that promise in his address Saturday. \"Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now,\" he said, calling for Democrats and Republicans in Congress to cooperate with each other. He also emphasized the vital importance of controlling the coronavirus, which is hitting new record levels, promising to bring experts onto his transition team beginning on Monday. \"I will spare no effort ... to turn around this pandemic,\" he said. As a grim and difficult year draws to a close, Biden hearkened back to history with calls of American exceptionalism and laid out a hopeful vision for the future. \"Now together on eagle's wings, we embark on the work that God ... called us to do,\" Biden said, citing a hymn he said has brought comfort to his family. \"With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and each other, with love of country, a thirst for justice, let us be the nation that we know we can be \u2013 a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed, the United States of America.\" Vice President-elect Kamala Harris \u2014 who is set to make history as the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to serve as vice president \u2014 spoke Saturday evening ahead of Biden's speech. She thanked election workers as well as the voters who participated in an election with record turnout. \"You chose hope and unity, decency, science and, yes, truth,\" she said. \"You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America.\" Harris celebrated the groundbreaking nature of her victory, too: \"Every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\" Vice President-elect Kamala Harris acknowledged the groundbreaking nature of her victory on Saturday night: \"Every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Like many of their campaign stops, the Wilmington event Saturday was held as a drive-in rally to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. Masked supporters were cheering and waving flags from car hoods and pickup beds. The former vice president's path to being elected the 46th president of the United States was a tumultuous one, marked by unprecedented campaign challenges because of the coronavirus pandemic and an incumbent opponent who declared a premature victory, baselessly attacked the integrity of the election and is now filing a flurry of last-minute legal actions in an attempt to deny Biden's victory. Trump did not speak publicly on Saturday, but in written remarks, he refused to concede. In a statement, he vowed to take the election to the courts and falsely accused Biden of seeking to violate election laws. On Twitter, he inaccurately claimed victory and asserted that observers had not been allowed access to vote counts, which is false. Some prominent Republicans have congratulated Biden and pushed back on Trump's false claims of fraud, while others have either remained silent or expressed support for Trump's legal challenges to the voting process. Biden empathized with those who supported the outgoing president. \"To those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight,\" Biden said in his speech. \"I've lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let's give each other a chance.\" Read the transcript of Biden's prepared remarks below, as released by his campaign. My fellow Americans, the people of this nation have spoken. They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory. A victory for \"We the People.\" We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation \u2014 74 million. I am humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me. I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify. Who doesn't see Red and Blue states, but a United States. And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people. For that is what America is about: The people. And that is what our Administration will be about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of the nation \u2014 the middle class. To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home. It is the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for this vision. And now the work of making this vision real is the task of our time. As I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, Hunter, Ashley, all of our grandchildren and their spouses, and all our family. They are my heart. Jill's a mom \u2014 a military mom \u2014 and an educator. She has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn't just what she does \u2014 it's who she is. For America's educators, this is a great day: You're going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady. And I will be honored to be serving with a fantastic vice president \u2014 Kamala Harris \u2014 who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country. It's long overdue, and we're reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice. Kamala, Doug \u2014 like it or not \u2014 you're family. You've become honorary Bidens and there's no way out. To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials \u2014 you deserve a special thanks from this nation. To my campaign team, and all the volunteers, to all those who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you everything. And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history. Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Progressives, moderates and conservatives. Young and old. Urban, suburban and rural. Gay, straight, transgender. White. Latino. Asian. Native American. And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest \u2014 the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I'll have yours. I said from the outset I wanted a campaign that represented America, and I think we did that. Now that's what I want the administration to look like. And to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans. The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season \u2014 a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now that the campaign is over \u2014 what is the people's will? What is our mandate? I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time. The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family's health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. Our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments \u2014 hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us \u2014 until we get this virus under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as Transition Advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort \u2014 or commitment \u2014 to turn this pandemic around. I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me \u2014 as those who did. Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end \u2014 here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision. It's a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate. That's the choice I'll make. And I call on the Congress \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 to make that choice with me. The American story is about the slow, yet steady widening of opportunity. Make no mistake: Too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody \u2014 no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability. America has always been shaped by inflection points \u2014 by moments in time where we've made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Lincoln in 1860 \u2014 coming to save the Union. FDR in 1932 \u2014 promising a beleaguered country a New Deal. JFK in 1960 \u2014 pledging a New Frontier. And twelve years ago \u2014 when Barack Obama made history \u2014 and told us, \"Yes, we can.\" We stand again at an inflection point. We have the opportunity to defeat despair and to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can. I've long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses. It is time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe. And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. I've always believed we can define America in one word: Possibilities. That in America everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. You see, I believe in the possibility of this country. We're always looking ahead. Ahead to an America that's freer and more just. Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect. Ahead to an America that cures disease \u2014 like cancer and Alzheimers. Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind. Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in. This is a great nation. And we are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything we haven't been able to do when we've done it together. In the last days of the campaign, I've been thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and to my family, particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America. And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the more than 230,000 families who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well. \"And He will raise you up on eagle's wings, Bear you on the breath of dawn, Make you to shine like the sun, And hold you in the palm of His Hand.\" And now, together \u2014 on eagle's wings \u2014 we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do. With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country \u2014 and a thirst for justice \u2014 let us be the nation that we know we can be. A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed. The United States of America. God bless you. And may God protect our troops.",

Updated at 9:45 p.m. ET California Sen. Kamala Harris will become the next vice president of the United States, shattering another racial and gender barrier in American politics, at the end of a bruising presidential race that further exposed a bitterly divided electorate. Harris, 56, will bring a legion of firsts to the vice presidency: A daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, she will be the first woman, the first Black person, the first Indian American and the first Asian American to hold the office. She will also be the first graduate of a historically Black college and first member of a Black sorority to do so. \"We did it, Joe\": those were the words of Kamala Harris as she called her running mate Joe Biden after a win in Pennsylvania took the Democratic ticket past 270 Electoral College votes. Credit:  Storyful \"It sends a message about what kind of country we are today,\" said Manisha Sinha, a professor of American history at the University of Connecticut. \"An interracial democracy that represents people, men and women, from all over the globe. I think that's a very good thing for American democracy. And for me personally, it gives me a sense of national belonging that may not have been there before to some extent.\" Harris claimed her place in history on Saturday after a close battle for the White House, at the conclusion of which President Trump falsely claimed victory with millions of votes outstanding, and his legal team pursued action amid the close race. It also closes an election season upended by the coronavirus pandemic, and a fierce national reckoning over race, justice and police brutality. Democrats were seeking a victory that would demonstrate a repudiation of Trump and the direction in which he is leading the country. That did not happen this year, in a race with razor-thin margins in some key states, and there was no Democratic wave. But in Harris' elevation to the vice presidency, the party and the country mark a significant milestone in a caustic political environment. Still, it is a jubilant moment for many women across the country, but most notably for Black female activists who pushed Joe Biden to name a Black woman as his running mate. Black women have been longtime party stalwarts and were a key constituency that helped deliver Biden the Democratic nomination, though activists say the contributions of Black women have often been overlooked and taken for granted. \"Black women have always been the backbone of this Democratic Party, and oftentimes not valued for our ability to lead,\" said Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland, Calif., who was a co-chair of Harris' own presidential bid, which she launched in January 2019. \"But I tell you now, Black women are showing that Black women lead, and we'll never go back to the days where candidates only knew our value in terms of helping them get elected. Now they will see how we govern from the White House.\" Lee said the moment made her think back to working on the campaign of Shirley Chisholm \u2014 the pioneering first Black woman to serve in Congress and who also became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the 1972 election. \"When Kamala was selected as the vice presidential nominee, I thought about Shirley Chisholm, and I thought about how it took all this time, but how happy she must be,\" Lee said. Glynda Carr, the president of Higher Heights, a group dedicated to building the political power of Black women, described the moment as \"game-changing.\" \"Kamala Harris' win is going to change the way we think about what leadership looks like,\" she said. \"My goddaughters will know the possibilities that exist for their political leadership if they want to pursue that. I was most prideful to see my little goddaughter, who is in pre-K, standing at that TV, one inch away, looking at Sen. Kamala Harris.\" Celebrations broke out across the country on Saturday, including on The Yard at Howard University. Ashley Gray, who defended her dissertation \u2014 which happened to be on black women in leadership \u2014 was there. \"There's symbolic history in us being here, and her having gotten her foundation here,\" she said. Shanel Wilson, who graduated from Howard four years ago, said that \"to see one of our own in the White House, that's a major accomplishment.\" \"She walked this yard just like how I walked this yard,\" Wilson said. In Austin, as a crowd sang 'We Are The Champions,' Gabriela Long grew emotional as she described a moment of release. \"We're just so happy because the past four years has been really bad,\" she said, as her voice broke. \"Seeing a Black woman as vice president after all of this, it really just makes me emotional, seeing someone I can look up to.\" Harris is also a prominent face of a generation of children of immigrants who are a growing political force in their own right. More than a quarter of American adults today are immigrants or children of immigrants. \"Her background is something that we often celebrate about America, that we are this immigrant melting pot, we are a place where anybody can succeed who can come to America and find opportunity, and her family did that,\" said Chryl Laird, an assistant professor of government and legal studies at Bowdoin College. Biden's selection of Harris as his running mate earlier this year, and her ascension to the vice presidency, is a nod to the future of the Democratic Party. Her place on the ticket could well pave the way for Harris to become the leader of the party in four or eight years. The first time that Biden and Harris appeared together as the Democratic ticket, Biden nodded to the history that Harris had made \u2014 and the barriers that she could break in the future. \"This morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up \u2014 especially little Black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities. But today, today, just maybe, they're seeing themselves for the first time in a new way,\" Biden said at their first event as political partners. \"It is not without struggle\" Harris herself has discussed, cautiously at times, her own trailblazing status and has acknowledged that the experience of being a \"first\" or \"the only\" can often come with its own battle scars. \"When you break things, that can be painful. Sometimes you get cut. Sometimes you bleed,\" she has said, reflecting on her own experiences \u2014 and on those who came before her. \"It will be worth it every time, but it is not without struggle.\" In the closing days of the campaign, Harris was the subject of attacks from the president, who called her a \"monster\" and a \"communist,\" and argued that it would be an \"insult\" if she one day became the first female president. Republican Sen. David Perdue appeared to intentionally mock Harris' first name at a campaign rally in Georgia. \"If you think of the kind of racist and misogynistic slurs that are hurled at Black women or sometimes even unconscious ideas about who Black women are and how they should behave, or how they should talk, I think she's the best answer to that,\" said Sinha. \"In a way, I think it will lead to the country's healing a little bit after four years of blatant racism and sexism being literally espoused from the highest office in the land.\" Harris' ascension to the vice presidency comes four years after Hillary Clinton's bruising 2016 loss. And it also comes after Harris' own much-lauded campaign for the White House fell short of the same goal. Harris' campaign began with a flag-draped rally in Oakland, Calif., and she was one of a historically diverse field of candidates, including multiple women and people of color, who vied for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. But Harris dropped out last December, before voting began, and in choosing Biden, her party again opted to elevate another white man. So Harris did not shatter the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that Clinton somberly talked about when conceding in the Democratic primary in 2008 and and general presidential election in 2016. But it is a singular feat that a Black woman who is a daughter of immigrants achieves this milestone first, in a country where some may have expected a white woman to break this barrier. Clinton wrestled with gender and her own history-making status, ultimately giving it a more prominent role in her 2016 campaign than in 2008. As Mirya Holman, a political science professor at Tulane University who studies women in politics, explained, while both campaigns were historic, Harris' ascent stands apart from the history of Clinton's campaign. \"Kamala, in comparison, got to kind of do whatever she wants. And part of that, I think, is that she's not at the top of the ticket. Part of that, though, is that she's a Black woman and she in that way gets to separate herself from the legacy of Hillary Clinton in ways that I don't think, say, Elizabeth Warren would have been able to,\" said Holman. \"And part of it has been a very strategic action on the part of the Biden campaign to really showcase Kamala as a unique, unusual individual and an exciting part of the campaign. Let's not even talk about history, let's just talk about how cool she is today.\" Her mother's legacy Multiple women pointed to the profound influence of Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, that led the Californian to this moment. Gopalan, who left India in the 1950s to pursue graduate studies at UC Berkeley, died of cancer in 2009. Her father, Donald Harris, is a professor of economics at Stanford University. The two divorced when Harris was a child, and it is her mother's impact on Harris \u2014 in life and through her death \u2014 that is indelible. \"She speaks about how her mother said to her and her sister, 'You are Black girls,' \" said Laird, the Bowdoin College professor. \"So although she is multiracial, her mother who is Indian is saying to her: 'You are Black girls, the world will see you as Black girls and you need to understand that you are Black girls.' And so that is how she lives her life, in an understanding that how she is seen, how she is viewed is as a Black girl.\" Congresswoman Lee, who has known Harris since the 1980s, recalls running into her at a political event after Lee's own mother died in 2015. Harris, Lee explained, connected with her over their shared experience of grief. \"It was just a moment that demonstrated how caring she was and how she could connect and understand the pain of women, the pain of loss and just what it meant, because she's been through that experience also,\" Lee said. \"I think that bodes well for someone who's a vice president of the United States to be able to connect with people the way she did with me.\" Rachel Kurzius of WAMU in Washington, D.C., and Claire McInerny of KUT in Austin, Texas, contributed reporting.",

Voters in Myanmar will cast their ballots Sunday in the country's second general election since the military ceded absolute power in 2011. While the result appears predictable \u2014 analysts believe Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy will win again \u2014 the elections could further exacerbate the country's ethnic tensions due to the disenfranchisement of many minorities. The military establishment continues to wield significant political power. And COVID-19 may dampen voter turnout. \"It's almost a foregone conclusion that the NLD will get back in for a variety of reasons, most of which is Aung San Suu Kyi's undiminished domestic popularity,\" says David Mathieson, an independent analyst based in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial hub and capital. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate and former political prisoner who spent nearly two decades in jail or under house arrest by the military, remains a beloved figure. \"There is almost an inherently magical connection between her and many voters,\" says Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. \"People can't even imagine not voting for her.\" But her party's margin of victory may not be as large it was as five years ago \u2014 in part because there are few signs of tangible progress in improving people's livelihoods in one of Asia's poorest countries or in ending armed conflict with ethnic minority groups. \"Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD were elected in a landslide in 2015, including with ethnic votes, because it was expected that they would represent everybody,\" says Robertson. \"Increasingly, what we're seeing is she is primarily interested just in the ethnic Burmans who comprise 65% of the voters.\" It's a majority voting bloc in a country of some 53 million, one for whom the ideas of ethnicity and race are especially important in terms of who belongs and who doesn't. It helps explain the overwhelming public acceptance \u2014 and even approval \u2014 of the Myanmar military's brutal crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya in Rakhine state in 2017. More than 750,000 Rohingya fled to safety in neighboring Bangladesh, alleging they and their families had been subjected to rape, murder and torture. A 2018 United Nations Human Rights Council fact-finding mission reported that 10,000 deaths would be a \"conservative estimate.\" Myanmar was accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Late last year, Suu Kyi personally led the country's defense team. \"She stood up for nation, race and religion \u2014 not the army, but for race and religion, at The Hague,\" says Mary Callahan, a Yangon-based analyst and associate professor of international studies at the University of Washington. Suu Kyi's decision to go to The Hague proved wildly popular among Myanmar's Buddhist Burman majority. Analysts say it helped bolster her standing ahead of this year's election. And despite the world's condemnation of Myanmar for its treatment of the Rohingya, the government remains defiant. It is not allowing the vast majority of Rohingya \u2014 those who fled and those who remain \u2014 to vote in the election. \"They weren't allowed to vote in the last election in 2015, either,\" says Yangon-based analyst Richard Horsey, the author of a recent International Crisis Group report on the upcoming election. \"Before that, they have voted in every post-independence election since the 1940s. So that group has been disenfranchised. And that's part of the systematic denial of citizenship.\" Last month, Myanmar's election commission also announced it would cancel voting in several conflict areas, disenfranchising more than 1.5 million voters, most of them from ethnic minorities in Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan and Chin states, says Robertson. The military is \"prosecuting a war against certain ethnic groups and insurgencies and they are trying to pressure them,\" says Robertson. \"And one of the ways they're going to do it is also by denying elections in some of those areas.\" The army continues to loom large in Myanmar politics. \"When the military decided unilaterally to step back from full power, it drafted a constitution which sets aside 25% of the seats in parliament, plus control of the three security ministries, for itself,\" says Horsey. \"So this constitution and these elections will be for hybrid governments. The military will still have significant political power.\" There are also worries about what might happen if ethnic parties have a poor showing in the vote, says Callahan. While some may continue to participate in the political process, she says, others may \"give up on it all and just decide armed resistance is the only answer, especially for young people who will wonder why they've been bothering with a system that really doesn't serve them at all.\" In addition, the election comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Myanmar late but hard, starting in September. With nearly 57,000 confirmed cases and 1,330 deaths, Myanmar is now the worst-affected country in mainland Southeast Asia. The virus has strained the country's rudimentary health care system and forced widespread lockdowns, including in Yangon. While some opposition parties suggested the election could be delayed until the COVID-19 situation improved, Suu Kyi's government has pressed ahead and says it has taken precautions to try to ensure voters' safety \u2014 by providing personal protection equipment to voters, polling staff and volunteers, and more voting stations to try to reduce overcrowding. But analysts believe some people may stay at home simply out of fear. Despite the challenges, they say it's important that elections are happening \u2014 and for the second time. \"The fact that Myanmar shifted from decades of military dictatorship to an electoral system of deciding government is fantastic,\" says Horsey. \"And it's something we would have had difficulty to imagine even 10 years ago.\" But it's an election, he warns, that could easily exacerbate existing tensions between the Burman Buddhist majority and ethnic minorities and do little to address economic inequality in one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations.",

Biden edged President Trump, who in the days since voting ended has falsely claimed a premature victory and baselessly said Democrats were trying to steal the election. The Trump campaign is still contesting the process in several states. \"The simple fact is this election is far from over,\" Trump said in a statement Saturday. \"Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. \" Despite the president's rhetoric, Biden's team projected confidence as ballots were tabulated, knowing that large chunks of the vote still to be counted were in diverse Democratic strongholds like Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia. Loading... The Associated Press called the race for Biden on Saturday when it said that Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes put him over the 270-vote threshold needed to win the Electoral College. It's a fitting tipping point state. Biden was born in Pennsylvania and launched his campaign with rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. He spent Election Day visiting his childhood home in Scranton and then rallying supporters in Philadelphia. \"I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect [Kamala] Harris,\" Biden said in a statement. \"With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.\" Trump had appeared to hold a lead in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, but the margin was a mirage of sorts, because at the time more than 2.5 million mail-in ballots had not been counted. Biden won the vast majority of those yet-to-be-counted ballots. The race was closer than preelection polls had suggested, with Trump holding on to contested states like Florida, Ohio and Texas. But Biden won back the White House the way Democrats vowed to since the day Trump won four years ago: by resurrecting the so-called \"blue wall\" that Trump dismantled in 2016 \u2014 winning Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Biden was also able to flip longtime conservative redoubt Arizona, according to The Associated Press, and held a narrow lead in Georgia as of early Saturday. \"The soul of the nation\" In topping Trump in a race that was both upended and largely defined by the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic nominee has become the first challenger to defeat an incumbent first-term president in nearly 30 years. At 77, Biden becomes the oldest man ever elected president. (He'll be 78 by Inauguration Day.) He's also the first former vice president to win the White House since George H.W. Bush in 1988; the second Roman Catholic in U.S. history elected president; and he'll be the first president to call Delaware home. And with his victory, his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will become the first female vice president. She'll also become the nation's second Black candidate, following former President Barack Obama, to serve as president or vice president. \"This election is about so much more than [Biden] or me,\" Harris tweeted shortly after being declared vice president-elect. \"It's about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get started.\" Biden's slim victory perhaps validates the central conceit of a presidential campaign that fellow Democrats often doubted: After nearly four divisive and drama-filled years of the Trump administration, voters would long for stability and a return to the status quo that Biden and his nearly five decades of federal government experience represented. From the moment he launched his campaign in April 2019, Biden focused on what he called a \"battle for the soul of our nation,\" arguing that Trump was a dangerous aberration in American political history \u2014 but an aberration that voters could course-correct. The election was seen as a referendum on Trump's tenure, particularly how he had handled \u2014 or mishandled \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic. And though the election was highly contested, Biden led Trump in polls for almost the entirety of what was, ultimately, a remarkably stable presidential race in an anything-but-stable year. But for Biden, a career politician, this victory is a political comeback \u2014 a triumph that comes after a rocky start in this year's primaries and two previous failed attempts at the presidency years ago. An early political triumph, then tragedy Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and when he was young, his family moved to Claymont and then Wilmington, Del., as his father looked for steady work. \"The longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child's bedroom to say, 'Honey I'm sorry, we have to move,' \" Biden has often recalled. Biden struggled, too, to overcome a severe childhood stutter. He learned to navigate it in part by memorizing and reciting the poems of William Butler Yeats and other Irish poets in his bedroom mirror. Biden went to the University of Delaware, and then law school at Syracuse University, where he met his first wife, Neilia. They returned to Wilmington and started a family as Biden quickly established himself as a politician, winning a seat on the New Castle County Council, and then, in 1972, launching an improbable run for the U.S. Senate. Biden wouldn't turn 30, the minimum age to serve as a senator, until after the election. He won in an upset and was set to enter the Senate as a rising Democratic star. Then, Biden's life was shattered. Neilia and their three children \u2014 sons Hunter and Beau, and daughter Naomi \u2014 were hit by a truck while Biden was in Washington, D.C., setting up his new Senate office. Neilia and Naomi were killed, and Biden weighed resigning his seat before he was sworn in in order to care for his surviving children. When Joe Biden was first sworn in as a U.S. senator in 1973, he took the oath in a Wilmington, Del., hospital, where his sons Beau, in the bed, and Hunter, in the arms of Biden's father-in-law Robert Hunter, had been treated after a car crash that left his wife and daughter dead.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Horton/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., helped persuade Biden to stay in the Senate. And Biden began a habit that would become a trademark of his life and political career: He commuted every single day between Wilmington and Washington, D.C., in order to spend as much time at home with his children as possible. Biden married again, in 1977, to Jill Jacobs. After two runs for president, the vice presidency The Delaware senator made his mark in the chamber on the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, serving for long stints as chair or ranking member on both. Biden presided over several high-profile and contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Robert Bork's failed nomination and the hearings during which Anita Hill accused future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2008. Both times were considered flops. He withdrew from the 1988 campaign before the Iowa caucuses in part because of a plagiarism scandal. In 2008, Biden carved out a niche during the debates as a foreign policy expert but finished well behind fellow Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Iowa, and quickly dropped out. But Biden had made an impression on Obama during those debates. That summer, looking to compensate for his lack of foreign policy experience and his relative newness to Washington \u2014 and also looking to appeal to white voters who may have been skeptical of the first Black major-party presidential nominee \u2014 Obama tapped Biden as his running mate. Biden headed several key policy efforts for the Obama administration, including the 2009 stimulus package that's credited with helping pull the economy out of a spiral toward a depression. Biden helped set the administration's foreign policy agenda and often acted as the more aloof Obama's emissary to Republican congressional leaders like Kentucky's Mitch McConnell. Biden and the Senate Republican leader crafted several budget compromises in the later years of the Obama administration.

When Obama signed the landmark Affordable Care Act in 2010, Biden punctuated the moment with a hot mic assessment that instantly became iconic in Democratic circles: \"This,\" Biden whispered into the president's ear as they stood in the White House East Room, \"is a big f****** deal.\" Biden weighed another run for president in 2016, but it was clear many people in Obama's orbit, including the president himself, preferred Clinton as the party's next standard-bearer. Another, devastating factor sealed Biden's decision not to run: Tragedy struck his family one more time as his son Beau, who had risen to become Delaware's attorney general, died of brain cancer in 2015. A dramatic turn in South Carolina By the time Biden decided to enter the presidential race this cycle, in April 2019, there were already some 20 other Democrats in the field. But Biden entered the crowded primary as the clear front-runner, with strong name recognition and a simple message \u2014 he was running to \"restore the soul of our nation.\" He spoke about morality, character and unity. It was, to his critics on the left within his own party, the wrong message for this moment; it was optimistic when many Democrats were demoralized and angry. Throughout the primaries, Biden spoke of bipartisanship when many Democrats were convinced that was an outdated political vision. Progressives thought of Biden as the out-of-touch elder statesman who didn't understand the modern Democratic Party. They wanted sweeping systemic change; they wanted \"Medicare For-All\"; they wanted a wealth tax. And Biden seemed to offer only incremental solutions to their problems.

Biden would finish a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Biden and his wife, Jill, arrive at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 2. Biden would finish a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. He was battered by his fellow Democrats during the primary debates for his orchestration of the 1994 crime bill and his work with segregationist senators. And yet despite that record and the fact that he faced several Black opponents \u2014 including Harris, his eventual running mate \u2014 the polls showed Biden consistently had the support of Black voters. Some elder Black voters pointed to Biden's loyalty to Obama during their eight years in the White House. Others more specifically pointed to Biden's willingness to be \"No. 2\" to a Black man, something they said many white people wouldn't be willing to do. Campaign aides routinely insisted there was no path to the Democratic nomination without the clear support of Black voters. And in their view, no candidate but Biden had support from that key demographic. Still, the early primaries were rocky for him. He finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and fifth in the New Hampshire primaries. His fundraising slowed to a trickle. New Hampshire was such a blow to his candidacy that his campaign hightailed it out of the state before the polls had closed. That night, Biden was instead in South Carolina, where he tried to reassure his supporters not to count him out. \"We just heard from the first two states,\" Biden said during a speech in Columbia, S.C. \"Where I come from that's the opening bell, not the closing bell.\" But at that time, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appeared to be on his way to building an insurmountable lead in the primary's early states. Biden needed a decisive win in South Carolina to resurrect his fledgling campaign \u2014 and he got it. With the help of the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the most influential Democratic politician in the state, Biden won South Carolina by roughly 30 points. It was the conclusive victory he needed to head into Super Tuesday, the single most consequential day in the Democratic primary process, in which more than a third of all delegates were at stake. But Biden was still without the campaign infrastructure, grassroots support and the fundraising dollars that some of his rivals boasted. And so perhaps just as influential as the South Carolina result itself was the decision by a number of Biden's rivals to quickly coalesce behind him. On the eve of Super Tuesday, three of Biden's former opponents \u2014 former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke \u2014 endorsed him in quick succession. That day was critical in swiftly reshaping the narrative of the primary campaign. The end result was that Biden scored huge victories on Super Tuesday. Shortly after, the Democratic contest became a two-man race between Biden and Sanders.

Kamala Harris, after she endorsed him at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9. But before that battle could substantively get underway, the country was facing a new crisis: The coronavirus was threatening to close schools, shutter businesses and hospitalize vast numbers of Americans. On March 10, as voters cast ballots in Michigan and five other states, Biden and Sanders both abruptly canceled primary night rallies because of public health concerns. The campaign trail would never return to normal, and Biden would at times struggle to adapt to a new remote-only platform. Biden won Michigan in a rout, and the primary was effectively over. In countless interviews, voters \u2014 even some on the more progressive end of the party \u2014 said they ultimately opted for Biden because they thought he had the best chance of defeating Trump, regardless of whether they agreed with all of his ideas. By early April, Sanders decided to end his own campaign. Unlike in 2016, he enthusiastically endorsed and worked with his rival to unify progressives against Trump. Taking on Trump Biden ran his primary campaign in much the same way that he would go on to wage his general election bid \u2014 with an appeal to unity and healing. But the coronavirus pandemic brought traditional campaigning to a standstill. For months, Biden was stuck at home in Wilmington, Del., trying to fight an Internet war against a president known for his social media savviness. But as the pandemic turned into an economic recession, coupled with a summer of racial protest, the November election increasingly turned into a referendum on Trump's leadership. Polls showed voters increasingly losing confidence in how the president was handling the pandemic and race relations. And the Biden campaign sought to fill that leadership void by focusing on competence and empathy. \"Today in America, it's hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that,\" Biden said in a June 2 speech in Philadelphia, the day after Trump responded to nationwide protests by marching through a Washington, D.C., park that had been cleared of protesters by force so that he could appear in front of the press at a damaged church. \"The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem.\" When Biden cautiously returned to the campaign trail after those remarks, he did so in eerily empty settings. Biden would often give speeches to empty rooms of socially-distanced reporters. Over time, his campaign filled venues with a few dozen supporters at a time, eventually building up to drive-in rallies. The sometimes-awkward scenes were efforts to prioritize safety and to signal to voters that Biden \u2014 who was regularly seen wearing a mask \u2014 took public health seriously. Trump, on the other hand, began to ignore the advice of his own public health advisers and held massive in-person rallies \u2014 most open-air, some indoors \u2014 with supporters \u2014 many without masks \u2014 crowded together. Biden and President Trump participate in the final presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 22. This debate was a more civil affair, following Trump's persistent interruptions in the first faceoff.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Bourg/Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption As the U.S. death toll from the pandemic climbed, eventually surpassing 200,000 people, many parents entered a new school year juggling the demands of working from home while monitoring virtual classes. And yet despite the instability, the polls seemed to suggest a remarkably stagnant race. Throughout the summer and into the fall, Biden retained a consistent lead in most national polls. And after struggling to raise money in the primary, Biden's team started collecting huge sums, often from virtual fundraisers. Just in the months of August and September, the campaign and joint Democratic efforts raised nearly $750 million, smashing records. That money gave the campaign the resources to invest and try to compete in traditionally Republican states like Texas and Georgia. The race's most notable stretch came near the end of September, when Biden and Trump met face to face for their first debate, and the president made the event nearly unwatchable with constant interruptions. Then, a couple of days later, news broke that the president had been diagnosed with the coronavirus. He was soon hospitalized for treatment. It was an unpredictable October surprise, and yet Trump acted as if it didn't matter. He was quickly back on the campaign trail, holding his trademark rallies and boasting that he felt better than he did 20 years ago. He continued to defend his administration's response to the virus, citing his decision to ban some travel from China and his efforts to boost therapeutics and vaccines. What's on the Biden agenda In the final days of the race, Trump dismissed the pandemic even more bluntly than before \u2014 as cases soared to new records in key electoral states like Wisconsin. Biden, on the other hand, promised to immediately marshal the resources of the federal government toward tackling the pandemic. He has promised that his administration will centralize decision-making on distributing testing and personal protective equipment. He will push for universal mask usage and has urged Congress to pass a substantial coronavirus relief package in the first weeks of his administration. The longtime foreign policy expert has also vowed to repair the international alliances that have been frayed by four years of an isolationist, treaty-busting Trump administration, beginning with a reentry into the Paris climate accords.(The U.S. withdrawal from the accord actually became official the day after Election Day.) Over the course of the campaign, Biden embraced many of the more progressive policy goals of his onetime primary rivals. He'll enter office vowing an agenda inspired by the transformative New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Biden wants to retool the Affordable Care Act by adding a public, government-run option; invest $2 trillion in green energy and transform the country's energy production to almost entirely renewable sources over the next 15 years; and make massive investments in education and child care, including universal pre-kindergarten and tuition-free public college for middle- and lower-income students.

As of the AP race call for Biden, control of the upper chamber remained in doubt. Regardless, throughout his entire campaign, Biden largely emphasized tone and style over policy. He began and ended his campaign promising to \"restore the soul of the nation\" and repeatedly vowed in its closing days to govern with all Americans in mind, not just the ones who voted for him. \"We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together,\" Biden said in a speech in Gettysburg, Pa., last month. \"What we need in America is leadership that seeks to deescalate tension, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together.\" As Obama's vice president, Biden saw firsthand that unifying messages and aggressive policy agendas are difficult to make coexist \u2014 especially in a divided government. Now, elected president after a lifetime of government experience, in the wake of a turbulent and divisive administration, and amid an unprecedented global crisis, Biden will get his chance to try to accomplish both those ambitious goals.",

But this week, he's been hard to ignore. \"There's something to people who don't get their way, and they have temper tantrums like him,\" Wright said. \"The fragility, because something don't go your way? How dare you?\" Trump has \u2013 without evidence \u2013 accused Democrats of perpetrating a \"fraud\" on the American people, and launched a flurry of lawsuits in Georgia and other states aimed at questioning the election results. But to his supporters, such as Catherine McDonald in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, what's unfolding now seems to confirm the warnings she's heard from the president and conservative media. \"I have been hearing about this for months, if not the last year, that there were going to be a lot of challenges. That with how divided the country is, that the Democrat side was fully prepared to cast as much doubt as possible on the outcome,\" McDonald said. A close vote, a slow process To be clear, election experts have been predicting for months that counting early and absentee ballots would take some time due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions around the 2020 election results are especially high in Georgia, a state that has not been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992. Election results are coming down to the narrowest of margins this year, and officials have promised a recount. \"We are literally looking at a margin of less than a large high school,\" Gabe Sterling, an official with the Georgia secretary of state's office, said during a Friday morning press conference in Atlanta. Georgia's growing and increasingly diverse suburbs, combined with organized, well-funded, get-out-the-vote efforts by Democratic activists, have propelled Georgia into the swing state category. \"Blue-ing\" of the suburbs Amy Steigerwalt, a political science professor at Georgia State University, said there are many reasons why Georgia is now in play \u2013 among them an increasingly diverse electorate, which includes a growing Black middle class and increasing numbers of Asian and Latino voters. \"The 'blue-ing' of the suburbs is probably the biggest thing that's happening,\" she said. \"These areas that have long been Republican strongholds are not anymore.\" Steigerwalt also gives substantial credit to activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, whose Fair Fight organization worked to register and mobilize voters statewide after her narrow \u2013 and controversial \u2013 loss to Republican Brian Kemp in 2018. The group raised about $40 million from more than 200,000 donors nationwide to turn out Democratic voters in Georgia and other key states, according to a spokesman. The Atlanta area will remain a focus of voter turnout efforts as both parties look toward two potential runoffs in January that could decide control of the U.S. Senate. Bethany Lind Mendenhall and her husband, Eric Mendenhall, say they're concerned about the division they see in the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bethany Lind Mendenhall and her husband, Eric Mendenhall, say they're concerned about the division they see in the country. One state, two realities While the results of the presidential race look promising for Democrats in a state the party has not won since 1992, it's all too close for comfort for some Biden supporters such as Eric Mendenhall of east Atlanta. \"I was hopeful that it would be decisive and clear and that that there would be a denouncement of the last four years that we could at least see a general consensus across the country that this isn't who we are,\" he said. His wife, Bethany Lind Mendenhall, said she worries that divisions in the state, and the country, have been once again laid bare by this election. \"We have family members who listen to completely different voices and news sources than we do,\" she said. \"We see things very differently. But I want to be able to have conversations. But it's like we're operating in different realities.\" In midtown Atlanta, retired lawyer and Vietnam veteran Al Lindseth said he reluctantly voted for Trump. He dislikes Trump's demeanor and said he almost didn't vote for the president after his first debate performance, which he found rude. But Lindseth said he's concerned by where he believes the left wing of the Democratic Party wants to take the country. \"People are so easily offended these days. People are concerned about division now; they should have been here in the '60s when we had rioting in the streets. We were worried about going to a war and getting shot,\" he said. \"I just think we worry about a lot of things in this country, and they're not our major concerns.\" Lindseth said he wouldn't mind a Biden presidency terribly as long as Republicans hold the Senate. A ''false sense of unity\" Back at her home in suburban Atlanta, Wright said a Biden presidency could buy some time for Americans to pause and reflect on the future after a tense four years. Whatever the outcome of the election, Wright said she hopes the lessons of the Trump years won't be forgotten. \"I think what Biden offers is \u2013 I hate to say it \u2013 like this false sense of unity, right? What I'm scared that might happen is that people actually might get comfortable again,\" Wright said. \"That's my biggest fear.\"",

            "article_content": "Latino voters helped to shape the presidential race in different ways. For the first time, Latinos became the second-biggest voting demographic after white people, and that has major implications.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We are still waiting for a winner to be called in this year's presidential election. But the race so far has illuminated one thing for certain - the country's shifting demographics have played a huge role in how our elections will be decided. One group that's been getting particular scrutiny this year, Latinos. They became the second-biggest voting demographic after white people for the first time this year, and that has big implications. We're joined now by Shereen Marisol Meraji, host of NPR's very own Code Switch podcast, to talk through what we should keep in mind when thinking about Latino voters in this country. Shereen, hi. SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: All right. So let's start with just your own observations. What did you see happening on election night as results were rolling in? MERAJI: Well, I saw a lot of confusion and a lot of hand-wringing over why Latino support for President Trump was higher in some places than polls had originally predicted. And Rachel, that got my antennae twitching, knowing that most polling of Latino voters is not great. I spoke to Matt Barreto. He's a political science professor at UCLA. He's been working with the Biden campaign for the last few months. And he told me sample sizes for Latinos tend to be really small - too small to draw clear conclusions about their voting behavior. And these polls tend to do a bad job of polling Latinos who are not college educated and who prefer to speak Spanish. MATT BARRETO: That's a very large segment of the Latino electorate of voters. And so these folks are systematically underrepresented in mainstream polls. MERAJI: Matt Barreto told me that's why ahead of the primaries - and I know, Rachel, that feels like forever ago. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Yeah. MERAJI: But that's why ahead of the primaries, you saw wildly divergent stories about how Latino voters were all in for Bernie Sanders. And then the next week, it was like, just kidding - Hispanics love Donald Trump. It's like, wait, what? How does that work? I think we just need to look at polling ahead of elections with a much more critical eye, especially when the polls are saying anything about Latino voters. MARTIN: Right. OK. So considering all of the holes in polling, all the blind spots - I mean, is that why you think Latinos seem, at least, to surprise us every election? MERAJI: (Laughter) I think that's one reason. And I got to be frank here - most politicians and journalists have work to do when it comes to understanding Latinos. You know, this week there's been so much attention on how Latino votes in Miami-Dade County in Florida went more to Trump than in the last election. And as interesting as that may be - and it is interesting - it's highlighting two groups of Latinos, Cubans and Venezuelans, that make up 4% - that's Cubans - and less than 1% - that's Venezuelans - of the total Latino population. MARTIN: Right. MERAJI: So, you know, I think it's really important to note, the overwhelming majority of Latinos in the United States are of Mexican origin at 60-plus percent. Next up are Puerto Ricans. Both of those groups do tend to vote more Democratic. So spending outsized energy on a couple of counties in a couple of states, it's not really giving us the full picture of the, quote-unquote, \"Latino vote.\" MARTIN: So does that big category just lose any significance? Obviously, Latinos are not a monolith, and there is no such thing as a Latino vote. MERAJI: I agree. Latinos are not a monolith, nor is any other ethnic or racial identity group, for that matter. And I wish we could just (laughter), you know, stop reminding people of that because it is obvious. But with Latinos, politicians and journalists, they really need to be taking into account country of origin, race, class, age, gender, language preference, where Latinos live in the United States, how long they've lived in the United States. And Rachel, in some cases, the answer to that question is long before there was a Texas, New Mexico and California. MARTIN: Right. MERAJI: All of those things affect what issues are important to Latino voters. And for years, both Democrats and Republicans have been inconsistent and sloppy in their outreach to Latinos. But despite that, patterns have emerged over the years. It's notable that two-thirds of Latino voters identify as and vote for Democrats. The other third vote Republican, which - this is not a new development, and I'm not sure why it keeps surprising everyone (laughter) every time there's an election. That said, we also can't forget that Latinos are the youngest voting demographic in the United States. So they're the second-largest voting demographic, and they're the youngest voting demographic. They have more eligible voters under 30 years old than any other voter demographic, and it's going to stay that way for a while. We know - and you've reported on this - younger voters lean left. MARTIN: Right. MERAJI: So back to your question - are Latinos a monolith? No. Are they a voting bloc? Maybe - but obviously one that cannot be ignored or taken for granted. And these gains for President Trump are a sign that Democrats may have been taking Latino voters for granted. MARTIN: So Latino voters have a lot of young people in that demographic. Young people lean left. Is that kind of political orientation, is it animating those voters? I mean, is any of this turning into grassroots political activism? MERAJI: Oh, most definitely. I know we've been talking a lot about Arizona and how Arizona is in serious play. And lately I've been reading things like, oh, well, it's because so many Californians moved to Arizona or it's because Cindy McCain endorsed Biden and suburban moms rallied and got out the vote. You know, it's Senator John McCain's revenge from beyond the grave. But actually, a huge part of that story is that Latino grassroots groups have been working for years on the ground to get out the Latino vote, the young Latino vote. And they have been spurred on by hard-line immigration policies like the SB 1070 show-me-your-papers law. So I'm really hoping that people will look, you know, beyond the surprise in some of these election stories and for the substance when it comes to Latinos and civic engagement. But, you know, that's my wish every election cycle. MARTIN: NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji, host of NPR's podcast Code Switch. Shereen, thank you. We appreciate this. MERAJI: Thanks, Rachel.

            "article_content": "NPR discusses the racial breakdown of current exit polls and how the electorate is changing.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: With the end of campaign season, we're going to hear a lot of conversation about the Latino vote or the Black vote. What you won't hear a lot about is the white vote. So I asked Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch podcast team to come on the program and talk about why. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: So the white vote is always there. But, you know, we in the media have a million euphemisms for the white vote. We have a lot of ways to say white without saying white. We say evangelical, soccer moms, suburban women, NASCAR dads, etc. Never mind that, you know, plenty of people of color overindex on things like church attendance or that, you know, the suburbs all over the country are becoming browner all the time. White is kind of implied in U.S. politics, and because it's left implied, there tends to be this hyperfocus after elections on the way that nonwhite voters behave. So right now we're hearing a lot about Biden's underperformance among Latino voters in Florida, for example, but far less about the fact that Trump won 60% of white voters in Florida. And white voters make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate in Florida this year, at least according to The New York Times. So Trump's viability relies almost entirely on his consistently strong white support. But because we don't talk about white people that way, we tend to focus on these sort of marginal shifts with people of color. CORNISH: So what is the story that the media tends to tell? I mean, is it really looking at the white vote as somehow a cohesive voting bloc? DEMBY: Well, I mean, white voters on the top line are not a bloc in the way that Black voters are. Black voters regularly vote for Democrats somewhere, like, in the mid-'80s into the mid-'90s in terms of percentages in presidential elections. And it's true that a solid majority of white voters break one way. The majority of white voters have voted for Republicans in presidential elections going back to the 1960s. Lyndon Johnson was actually the last Democrat to win the white vote. But it's when you get under the hood that you start to see what looks more like bloc voting. So white evangelicals, for example, they overwhelmingly support Trump in numbers that look like bloc voting. Another big part of the Republican base is noncollege-educated whites. So Trump won almost two-thirds of white voters without college degrees in 2016. And it appears - it's early, but it appears he won them again pretty handily this time. Trump also narrowly won most white voters with college degrees that time. But this year, support seems to be about even. White men broke for Trump pretty comfortably in 2016. And Trump famously - or infamously, depending on what your Twitter feed looks like, Audie - won white women in 2016, too. And, again, there's some indication that Trump may have done even better with white women this time around. And that's a shift that's worth keeping an eye on as the election data becomes clearer. But when it comes to swaths of white voters, we're really talking about how big the majorities of support for Republicans go in presidential elections, not whether they'll have the majority. CORNISH: Well, then let's come back to the Latino vote for a moment - right? - as it's being talked about in Florida and in Arizona. Put that in the context of what you're telling us about the media and how we talk about white voters. DEMBY: Latino is a term that's worth sort of us taking apart and exploring in greater detail. But it is a panethnic term that doesn't work in quite the same way that white does for electoral purposes. The Latinos in Maricopa County, who might end up turning Arizona Democratic, have different, you know, familial countries of origin than the Latinos in Miami-Dade County, in Florida, who shifted towards Trump in this election. The Cubans and Venezuelans in Florida are outliers among Latino voters, who trend strongly Democratic overall across the country. Meanwhile, you know, white non-Republicans in the electorate, they are the outliers, which is why, you know, Democrats rely so much on strong turnout from voters of color to be viable in presidential elections. But it's important that, you know, we think about the ways that there are many, many white Latinos. And because whiteness so thoroughly informs voting behavior, we should probably be asking better questions about Latino voters, like whether they identify as white or not. That might be more illuminating than simply whether someone refers to themselves as Latino in some ways. CORNISH: The backdrop to all of this, Gene, is the white vote is shrinking every year - right? - in terms of its portion of the electorate. What does that mean going forward? DEMBY: So starting in the very next election, it looks like these younger, browner cohorts - the Gen Zers and the millennials - are going to outpace boomers in terms of voters in the electorate. These are demographics that are much more hostile to the GOP. This is going to be a really big challenge for the GOP in terms of electoral viability in some ways. And people have been saying this for a long time. But the sort of demographic realities become really, really concrete in the next two cycles. CORNISH: That's Gene Demby of NPR's Code Switch podcast. Thanks for talking with us. DEMBY: Thank you, Audie. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

NPR's reporters in each state discuss the voting scenes.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now, as we wait for the final tallies, the results that will tell us who will be the next president of the United States, there are other ways to measure the election, such as how many people have already cast their ballots - more than 100 million, for the record - also how many people will vote today and what those voters say is driving their choice for president. We're going to check in now with reporters who have been talking to voters in three key states. They are Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. So let me welcome first Jen Rice of Houston Public Media. Hey there. JEN RICE, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: Maayan Silver of member station WUWM in Milwaukee, hi to you. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Hey there. KELLY: Hey. And Emily Previti is on the line from member station WITF in Luzerne County, Penn. Hi, Emily. EMILY PREVITI, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So Pennsylvania first because there's been so much attention focused on the commonwealth as a key battleground - Trump's been there; Biden's been there. They keep going. Biden was there making multiple stops today in Pennsylvania. Emily, what are you hearing from Pennsylvania voters? PREVITI: So I'm in Luzerne County, which swung for Trump in 2016 after electing Democrats for president for decades. And today I've talked to Democrats and Republicans and unaffiliated voters supporting both candidates. I talked to Tom Tyson, who's registered as a Democrat in Wilkes-Barre, this afternoon while he was waiting for his wife to arrive so they could vote together about why he's supporting Biden. TOM TYSON: Just some normalcy, any normalcy would be nice right now. I mean, COVID and everything - it makes it even worse. But yeah - just to get back to waking up in the morning and not wondering, you know, now what? PREVITI: And earlier in the day, I met up with Jane Hergert. She was wearing a white Make America Great Again hat. She says she's hoping during the next four years that the pandemic's under control and the economy improves and thinks Trump is most likely to deliver, in part because she herself is now in a better spot. JANE HERGERT: I'm better off now than I was before when Obama was in, much better off. I got better health care now, and definitely the economy is much better. PREVITI: And, Mary Louise, as we said, both presidential candidates are focused on Pennsylvania. And it's clear that people are listening and have strong opinions. KELLY: Yes, strong opinions not being in short supply in this election season. OK, let's go to Milwaukee now and Maayan Silver. You are there in Milwaukee, Wisconsin being one of those states that both campaigns have also spent a lot of time in recently. How are voters there reacting to all the extra attention? SILVER: Well, first off, Wisconsin set a record for people voting early. Part of the reason is that the state is breaking records, unfortunately, with COVID right now. But also, Democratic leaders in the state and some Republicans were pushing their voters to cast ballots early, too. And clearly, people have been listening. Even today there have been lines in some precincts. KELLY: And what are they saying as you're out and about speaking to voters? SILVER: Today I stopped by Riverside High School, a polling place in Milwaukee, and I caught people from a variety of viewpoints - Biden supporters, Trump supporters, independents and third-party voters. The city of Milwaukee is racially and ethnically diverse, and it's heavily Democratic, as is the county. There's a ring of further-out suburbs that start trending Republican. Kelly Harrison is 31, a massage therapist who lives in downtown Milwaukee. She's a Republican and says her spa therapy business has improved so much over the past four years under Trump. KELLY HARRISON: I don't like how he's handling things, but I definitely think he's really good in handling business and leading us in a different direction as far as businesswise. SILVER: Other voters said COVID, the faltering economy and racial justice were getting them to the polls. And, like Black veteran Jack Cheeks said, they need a more tolerant, inclusive government and that Trump is not it. JACK CHEEKS: We need new leadership in order for us to heal. In order for the country to come together, in order for the world to be a better place, you know, we have to once again be the shining city on the hill. SILVER: So, Mary Louise, one more point to make - Wisconsin is one of those states that's a battleground, and this year the overall turnout is expected to be very, very high. KELLY: All right. Well, speaking of turnout, let's flip over to Texas, which has been breaking all kinds of turnout records for early voting. Jen Rice, you were there in Houston. You've also had all kinds of chaos these last 24 hours or so, this whole back-and-forth as judges deliberated whether 120,000 early ballots should be counted at all. Just bring us up to speed. Has that been finally resolved? RICE: Sort of. So the legal challenge is still out there. But last night around midnight, the 5th Circuit denied the appeal. So what that means is the drive-through votes cast during early voting will be counted. Houston is in Harris County. That's the largest county in Texas. It's billed as the most diverse county in the country. Republicans sued to have those 120,000 ballots thrown out because of technicalities, which, if it had happened, would have given Republicans a better chance of holding onto the state. I spoke with voter Sarah Jones at a protest rally, who was emphatic all votes cast legally should be counted. SARAH JONES: My kids need to see that I'll crawl over broken glass to make sure that my vote counts. KELLY: Wow - determination very clear there. But, Jen, tell me a little bit more about that legal decision yesterday. Does that change voting rules there? RICE: Yes, it did. So late last night, the county clerk decided to close 9 out of 10 drive-through voting locations today because the judge left open the possibility that drive-through votes cast on Election Day might not count. So most people who planned to drive to do voting drive-through today have had to come up with a different plan at the last minute instead. KELLY: All right - all kinds of chaos continuing there, it sounds like, in Texas. That is Jen Rice of Houston Public Media, Maayan Silver of member station WUWM in Milwaukee and Emily Previti speaking with us from member station WITF in Pennsylvania. Thanks to all three of you. Good luck. Hang in there tonight. RICE: Thank you. SILVER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a separate photo, President Trump campaigns in Gastonia, N.C., on Oct. 21. Almost every election cycle, someone on one side or the other is claiming that this is the most important election in their lifetime. Well, this one actually probably is \u2014 and it appears voters think so, too. The election is already setting records for turnout, and perhaps no two candidates are more at odds over the future of the country and the direction they want to take it in. This election is fundamentally about what it means to be an American. One thing is clear: Whoever wins could shape what America means for generations to come through social policy, the courts and by their own example. Voters are turning out This election is expected to have the highest voter turnout since 1908, north of 65% of eligible voters turning out, according to Michael McDonald, a turnout expert at the University of Florida who runs the U.S. Elections Project. It's on track for that and possibly more, considering the sky-high early voting totals. So far, more than 93.1 million people have voted early. That's about 68% of the total votes in 2016. In some key contested states, the totals are even higher than that. Take Texas, for example, where more people have cast a ballot already than in the entire 2016 election. More Texans have now voted in the 2020 presidential election than in any election ever by about 700,000 and climbing, as of Sunday afternoon. There's a similar trend across the country \u2014 North Carolina has hit 95% of its 2016 total, Georgia 94%, Florida 91%, Nevada 91%, Arizona 87%, according to the Elections Project. A referendum on Trump These numbers are all about President Trump. He has inspired deep devotion and intense repulsion, and that is translating to sky-high enthusiasm for voting \u2014 whether that's in person or by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. As is the case with most presidential reelection campaigns, this has been a referendum on the president's first term. Trump touts what was a strong economy before COVID-19 shocked the country, his tax cuts and trade deals, as well as reshaping the Supreme Court in a conservative direction. Democrats \u2014 and many independents, according to the polls \u2014 see a president who takes pride in not playing by the rules, has inflamed racial division, is untruthful, mishandled a pandemic, damaged the country's image around the world and is an existential threat to progress and justice. As one candidate in this race might say, and that's not hyperbole, folks. \"You're the worst president America has ever had,\" Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a former vice president, told Trump during their first presidential debate. With a socially distanced audience of supporters and journalists, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivers remarks at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport in Wisconsin on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The president's counterpunch Trump, for his part, has tried to deflect the focus from himself onto Biden. Trump and his campaign have recognized that they needed to try and make Biden so unacceptable that those wavering 2016 Trump voters will stick with the president. They have warned that Trump is the only thing standing between America and\"socialism,\" claiming Biden is too inept to prevent being taken over by a radical left that wants to defund the police and bring crime to the suburbs. \"No one will be safe in Joe Biden's America,\" Trump said this summer. \"I can't even call it Biden's America \u2014 the guy doesn't even know he's alive.\" It's something he's repeated many times, even claiming Biden \"doesn't know where he is\" or \"what office he's running for.\" So far, surveys have shown that attack hasn't stuck. Biden has maintained a wide lead in an average of the polls and consistent, if smaller, leads in many of the states key to the Electoral College, which determines who will be president. Voters have also said consistently that Biden would be better to handle the coronavirus, race relations and even crime, despite Trump casting himself as the pro-police \"law and order\" candidate. Trump continues to get a slight edge on the economy. Voting groups to watch President Trump arrives at a rally on Saturday in Newtown, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Makela/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump has done little to reach out beyond his base, which still strongly supports him. The Trump campaign's theory of the case is that there are more untapped eligible voters out there who were open to Trump's message in 2016 but didn't turn out at the polls. One of Trump's strongest core groups is white voters without a college degree. And it's true that there is room to grow with them. Trump won a record margin with the group in 2016, but they turned out at a 58% rate that year, lower than in some recent past presidential elections. This group is worth watching, but the negative environment for Trump's presidency and the absence of Hillary Clinton on the ballot (Biden is better liked) casts doubt on its motivations for voting this time. Especially if these voters didn't turn out in 2016 when Trump was fresh and new as a candidate. What's more, 2016 wasn't just a base election. Trump won persuadable voters. He won voters who decided in the last month as well as a big share of those who said they didn't like him or Clinton, according to exit polls. Trump also won independents, suburban voters and seniors in that election, too. And those groups are telling pollsters this year that they have largely abandoned him. He really can't afford to lose any voters, considering he won by fewer than 80,000 votes in the three key states that put him over the top \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The path All that said, Trump remains within striking distance in the key swing states. The Trump campaign had hoped Trump's chances would get better if there was news of a potential vaccine for the coronavirus on the horizon or COVID-19 cases declining in the country. But neither has been true. For Trump to win, there would have to be an even bigger polling error than in 2016. He would have to win every toss-up state and one leaning in Biden's direction currently. That's possible, given the toss-up states are all polling within the margin of error and they certainly could all break in one direction. But bigger than what the keys are to this election, the outcome will likely have consequences for how politics is practiced and how Americans conduct themselves for generations to come.",

Updated 4:43 p.m. ET President Trump makes five stops in five different swing states Sunday, while his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, focuses on Pennsylvania just days before Election Day. Trump's jam-packed schedule highlights the uphill battle he faces for reelection and the categorically dissimilar style of campaigning he has taken in contrast to Biden. Trump began his Sunday speaking to supporters in Macomb County, Mich. \u2014 a state he captured by just about 10,000 votes in 2016, but where Biden currently leads in polls \u2014 to make a last-ditch appeal to voters as to why he deserves to be reelected. In his characteristically boastful tone, Trump defended his administration's handling of the coronavirus and touted the nation's economic success prior to the pandemic. \"This election is a choice between the Biden depression,\" Trump said, \"or you can have the greatest economic boom in the history of our country.\" \"The Biden plan is to imprison you in your home,\" Trump added. His administration has pushed to get people back to work and kids to school with few restrictions, even as the coronavirus has continued to savage the country. With 230,000 Americans now dead from the coronavirus, Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the virus' toll, and he continues to hold large, close-contact campaign events in outdoor spaces. \"Look at what China has done to the world. And we're not forgetting it,\" Trump said Sunday in Michigan, in reference to the coronavirus, which first appeared in China. Researchers at Stanford University have found that Trump's rallies this summer were likely responsible for some 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Researchers say that these events likely resulted in more than 700 deaths. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks at an event Sunday at Sharon Baptist Church in Philadelphia.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks at an event Sunday at Sharon Baptist Church in Philadelphia. Biden has made underscoring the human cost of the pandemic his key pitch to voters while spotlighting what he calls an irresponsible and anti-science handling of the virus by Trump and his administration. \"It's almost criminal the way he has handled [the pandemic],\" Biden said during one of two campaign events held in Philadelphia on Sunday. \"On day one of my presidency,\" he said, \"I'm going to put in action a plan I've been talking about for months \u2014 masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines, when we get one.\" Biden has blamed Trump for holding \"super-spreader\" rallies and has opted to hold fewer, smaller campaign events himself \u2014 often with supporters remaining in or around their cars for a drive-in event \u2014 in order to follow public health guidelines. At a \"Souls to the Polls\" event, an effort among Black churches to mobilize voters, Biden emphasized his plan to combat racial injustice and noted health disparities in the Black community with COVID-19. \"Every single day we're seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus: higher infection rates, lower access to testing, a harder time quarantining safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected and tragically, higher mortality rates,\" he said. Biden will travel to Cleveland on Monday before returning to Pennsylvania to barnstorm the state. Trump himself held four rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday. It's another swing state that Trump carried in 2016 but where the president now trails in surveys. With the election just days away, Biden has also enlisted the help of Democratic favorite Barack Obama, the former president. He appeared with Biden in Michigan on Saturday, and travels to Georgia and Florida on Monday. Trump has planned five rallies in four key states on Monday, ending in Michigan. One Biden campaign event in Texas had to be cancelled over the weekend, after a caravan of Trump supporters swarmed a Biden campaign bus and forced it to stop. Trump seemed to praise his supporters' actions in a tweet, proclaiming \"I LOVE TEXAS!\" alongside what appeared to be a video of the incident.",

Police in Graham, N.C., moved in on a march and rally to drive voter turnout, using pepper spray and making several arrests on the state's last day of early voting. According to video, police and participants, deputies with the Alamance County Sheriff's Office and Graham police officers twice used pepper spray on the \"I Am Change\" march to the polls. Participants and organizers say they had proper permits for Saturday's event, which marched from Wayman's Chapel AME Church to a rally at the city's Court Square. Following the rally, organizers had then planned to lead the some 200 marchers to a nearby polling place. Along the way, marchers led by organizer the Rev. Greg Drumwright stopped for a nearly nine minute long silence in memory of George Floyd, the Black man who was killed after a white police officer kept a knee on his neck for that span of time. It was shortly after that moment of silence that the first confrontation occurred, according to march participant Amy Cooper. Cooper says that police then  began ordering marchers to remain on the sidewalk. \"They said they were clearing the downtown area of Graham, it was shut down and people weren't allowed to be in the streets,\" Cooper told NPR. Cooper says shortly after that police began to pepper spray. Video streaming from Drumwright's Facebook page shows participants crowded on the sidewalk, with Drumwright leading people to a stage built for the  speaker portion of the event. During that part a man is heard angrily saying \"they're pepper spraying children.\" Later on, at the stage, Drumwright stops speaking to acknowledge a something happening just out of frame. Separate video shared by the Raleigh News & Observer shows confrontations between police and participants. Law enforcement are then seen using pepper spray. Sylvester Allen Jr., an activist in Alamance County, says police had attempted to take a generator being used by people speaking. \"The whole point was to rally and go to the voter polls,\" Allen told NPR. \"They wanted to send a message that we don't have any power.\" Reporter Rusty Jacobs with member station WUNC tweeted that at one point, police had said the permitted march was an unlawful assembly and ordered people out of the streets. Jacobs noted that officers began making arrests.

One of those arrested was Drumwright, who says he was charged with failure to disperse on command. Speaking to NPR's All Things Considered, Drumwright said they had worked with authorities in getting the march together. \"We were to leave that rally in just a few more minutes and head to the polls. This is something that we have worked on for the greater part of this month with the law enforcement agencies,\" Drumwright told NPR. In a statement issued Saturday evening, Graham police say organizers hadn't gotten clearance for a temporary road closure. The also justified the use of pepper spray, saying law enforcement officers issued several warnings to clear the road beforehand. \"As a result of actions that occurred within the rally, on courthouse grounds, the assembly reached a level of conduct that led to the rally being deemed unsafe and unlawful by unified command,\" the statement said. The Alamance County Sherriff could not be reached for comment. Drumwright contends participants were not in the road but on the sidewalk when police began using pepper spray. When asked if he thought this was an effort to suppress the vote, Drumwright said, \"I cannot say that that was what it was, but I can say that's what happened. There are people that did not get to vote today because they ended up in jail.\"",

This summer's massive protests over police brutality, spurred by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, demanded significant changes in policing. Those protests have moved some cities and states to \"reimagine\" what departments could look like through changes in funding and legislation. Some efforts stalled, like in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed. Some saw success, like in Colorado, New York and Virginia, which all passed sweeping new laws addressing use of force, funding and community oversight, among other things. The effects of those new laws won't be known for a while. Other efforts that deal with specific reform measures are on the Nov. 3 ballot in several cities and states. Here's a look at what changes are being sought: Seven local ballot initiatives center around civilian oversight of police, shifting money from criminal justice to social services, and evaluating the size of police departments. Los Angeles County: Measure J, Los Angeles County Community Investment and Alternatives to Incarceration.  This measure would amend the county's charter and require the allocation of money from the general fund (no less than 10% by the summer of 2024) for housing, mental health care and programs considered alternatives to incarceration.  The money could not be spent on the Sheriff's department and other county law enforcement agencies. Supporters say it resets county spending to address long standing inequities- especially in communities of color. Oakland: Measure S1 would strengthen oversight of the Police Department by building on an earlier measure approved four years ago which established a civilian based Police Commission. It expands the powers of the commission and the Community Police Review Agency (CPRA). It creates the Office of Inspector General, which would review cases of police misconduct and CPRA  investigations. It also makes the commission independent\u2014taking it out of the city and police department's chain of command.  Backers of the measure say it increases public trust and police accountability. San Diego, Measure B. In recent years, activists have pushed for a stronger community review board.  Measure B changes civilian oversight of the San Diego Police Department from the advisory Community Review Board on Police Practices to the Commission on Police Practices which would have the power to subpoena witnesses and conduct investigations into police officer misconduct. It would review complaints against officers and investigate all deaths that are a result of police interaction, including in-custody deaths. The commission would be independent of the Mayor and the city police department. San Francisco: Proposition D, Sheriff Oversight. The measure would set up two new oversight bodies for the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department.  The Sheriff's Department Oversight Board would make policy recommendations.  The Sheriff Department's Office of Inspector General would conduct investigations of in-custody deaths and complaints and make policy recommendations on police use of force.  The ballot question comes in the wake of misconduct allegations that have been made about the Sheriff's Department in recent years. The city's Proposition E calls for amending the city's charter to remove the mandatory police staffing level of a minimum of 1,971 full-duty sworn officers. Instead it requires the police department to conduct regular evaluations \u2014 every two years \u2014 and to recommend staffing levels in a report to the Police Commission. The Commission would hold a public hearing on the report and consider it when approving the Police Department's budget. City officials call the current staffing requirement arbitrary, the San Francisco Police Association says the department is understaffed and opposes the change San Jose: Measure G expands the authority of San Jose's independent police auditor to review reports and records related to officer-involved shootings and uses of force that resulted in injury or death. Currently the auditor does not have access to those documents. In September, the City Council approved a plan to work with the public to address several criminal justice issues including use of force complaints. Sonoma County: Proposition P calls for a yes or no on a measure to \"increase law enforcement transparency and accountability and to build public trust in County government and the Sheriff's office by expanding the authority and independence of a law enforcement oversight body. The measure would expand the powers of the Independent Office of Law Enforcement Review and Outreach(IOLERO) to investigate Sheriff related issues. It would also expand and revise the duties and power of the Community Advisory Council. The Sonoma County's Law Enforcement Association and Deputy Sheriff's Association oppose the measure while the former head of IOLERO supports it. Illinois has two advisory referenda on the ballot in DuPage County \u2014 an area  20 miles west of Chicago. Both measures are a response, perhaps, to the calls to \"defund the police.\" Historically, the largest portion of the county's budget, about 47%, has been dedicated to law enforcement, including the DuPage County Sheriff, the State's Attorney, the Public Defender and other offices. The Law Enforcement Budget Advisory asks voters whether the county should continue to consider law enforcement and public safety as its top budgeting priority. A second advisory initiative asks whether DuPage County should continue to fund and support training methods that decrease the risk of injury to officers and suspects.   In an editorial, the Daily Herald, a newspaper which covers DuPage County, suggests county officials filled the ballot with advisory questions to remove a ballot question that would require consolidating county government. In 2017, Akron was reportedly the first city in Ohio to provide a body camera for all police officers. In an effort to increase \"transparency and accountability,\" Issue 2 on the November ballot would require recordings from police body and dashboard cameras that document police use of force that results in death or serious injury be released to the public, as long as the release is permissible under state or federal law. Voters in Columbus, meanwhile, will decide whether the city should create a Civilian Police Review Board to carry out investigations of alleged police misconduct. The amendment to the city's charter would also create an Inspector General for the Police Department.  Columbus does not have a civilian police review board.  Supporters say this measure would increase public trust and police accountability.  In published reports, the head of the police union says the union is committed to change but calls the measure an attack on collective bargaining rights.

Portland's regular protests continued this week, staying mostly peaceful and without confrontations between police and demonstrators. Portland has seen months of  nightly protests following the death of George Floyd while in police custody.  With Measure 26-217 voters will decide whether to amend the city's charter  and create a new independent police oversight board that would have the power to discipline and fire police officers.  Currently, the police chief and the police commissioner handle discipline and a city agency, the Independent Police Review investigates complaints against police officers. Two cities have police reform measures are on the ballot \u2014 Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. On Oct. 26 \u2014 a week before Election Day \u2014 angry protests broke out in Philadelphia after police fatally shot Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man. Advocates who say they are creating a strategy to hold police accountable say the shooting is one reason why they are calling for a stronger civilian agency to investigate claims of police misconduct. Philadelphia, Question 3: Police Commission would amend the city's charter and replace the current Police Advisory Commission, which critics say has not provided effective oversight, with the Citizens Oversight Committee. Philadelphia, Question 1: Stop and Frisk asks voters whether city law should eliminate \"unconstitutional stop and frisk\" policing. The measure would not entirely ban the practice. It states an officer must have reasonable suspicion that a person is engaged in criminal activity in order to stop that person, and an officer can't stop someone based on \"their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religious affiliation or expression or other protected characteristic.\" In Pittsburgh, Ballot Question 3 asks whether voters should approve expanding the powers of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board to investigate police misconduct and improve community relations. The question would require police officers to participate in investigations of misconduct and officers could be terminated if they failed to cooperate. Demonstrators hold placards reading \"BLACK LIVES MATTER,\" \"Walter Wallace JR.\" and DEFUND PPD\" as they gather in protest near the location where Wallace, a 27-year-old Black man, was killed by two police officers in Philadelphia.

In Kyle, about 20 miles south of Austin,  Proposition D is a police department oversight proposal would amend the city's charter and authorize the city council to review police department procedures and set up an police oversight committee. Tumultuous protests in Seattle this summer led to an unsuccessful fight to slash the police budget by 50% and the resignation of the city's police chief. Now, there are four referenda on the ballot for voters in King County, which includes Seattle. Many of the recommendations were made by the county's Charter Review Commission and before the widespread protests over police brutality. King County Charter Amendment 1 would amend the county charter to require investigations anytime a person dies in the custody of law enforcement and to provide a public attorney to represent the family of the deceased during an inquest proceeding. King County Charter Amendment 4 would give the county's Office of Law Enforcement Oversight (OLEO) ability to subpoena witnesses, documents and other evidence in its investigations of law enforcement. King County Charter Amendment 5 would change the office of the sheriff from an elected position to an appointed one. Current King County voters elect the sheriff to a four year term. Under the amendment, the County Executive would appoint the sheriff subject to approval by the county council. King County Charter Amendment 6 would allow the King County Council to define the duties of the Sheriff's office instead of, as currently, by statute. Supporters say that would allow diverse voices to propose changes like providing alternatives to 911. Opponents, part of a Save the Sheriff's office campaign, say the measure is an attempt to defund the office. Several ballot measures for all voters in specific states address criminal justice issues well beyond policing and could bring significant changes. Here are some of the key initiatives: In four states \u2014 Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota \u2014 voters will decide whether their state will join 11 others where recreational marijuana is already legal. A medical marijuana initiative is also on the ballot in South Dakota and in Mississippi. In California, police reform bills, like a ban on the carotid chokehold and other neck restraints, did pass this year. Despite demands calling for overhauling the state's criminal justice system, several police reform bills failed or were never brought up for a vote. California residents will make those decisions directly now with a vote on three referenda on the statewide ballot. Proposition 25: Replace Cash Bail with Risk Assessments Referendum. This measure calls for voters to decide whether to keep the current bail system or uphold Senate Bill 10 which abolished cash bail but was put on hold before it took effect after activists gathered signatures for a referendum. SB10 would require judges to use, what are now considered controversial, risk assessment tools to evaluate whether a person should be released or kept in jail. Proposition 17: The Voting Rights Restoration for Persons on Parole. California allows people who have finished their prison terms to vote. A yes vote for Proposition 17 would allow people released on parole to do so.  The Prison Policy Institute estimates that move could restore voting rights for more than 119,000 individuals Proposition 20: Criminal Sentencing, Parole and DNA Collection Initiative- This measure changes sentencing laws passed earlier in California aimed at reducing incarceration. It restricts parole for offenses currently considered nonviolent. It also authorizes felony sentences (longer prison terms) for offenses currently treated as misdemeanors.  Crimes like unlawful use of a credit card or theft of a vehicle or firearm, all misdemeanors, could be charged as more serious crimes.  The measure also requires the collection of DNA for certain misdemeanors. Proposal 2: The Search Warrant for Electronic Data Amendment addresses how changes in technology affect privacy and crime. This measure is a constitutional amendment which would require a search warrant to access a person's electronic data and electronic communications. That's just in the same way current law protects a person's house or papers from unreasonable search or seizure. State Question 805: the Criminal History in Sentencing and Sentence Modification Initiative. Oklahoma has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country. This measure would amend the state's constitution and prohibit using a person's past nonviolent felony convictions to impose an enhanced sentence that would add additional time to the sentence of  a person convicted of a new nonviolent felony. The amendment would also allow people in Oklahoma convicted of a nonviolent felony currently serving time on an enhanced sentence to petition the court for a shorter sentence. Twelve states in the country have constitutional amendments, nearly identical to the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibit slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for people convicted of crimes. Advocates say the loophole allows states to force people serving prison time to engage in labor (for minimal pay) and making the change would not prevent voluntary opportunities. Voters in Nebraska and Utah will decide whether to remove the exception as they vote on Nebraska Amendment 1 and Utah Amendment C, the Remove Slavery as Punishment for Crime from Constitution Amendment",

            "article_content": "Sports teams around the U.S. have turned over their stadiums and arenas to be used as pandemic-safe voting sites. And it's possible these polling places could become the future of Election Day.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Over the summer, basketball players in the NBA decided to stop playing to shine a light on racial inequality and social justice issues. They eventually resumed but with a list of demands, including that NBA arenas be used as polling locations wherever possible. NPR's Miles Parks visited one of those arenas recently and watched as it was transformed into a voting supercenter in a matter of hours. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Throughout his eight-year career as the Washington Wizards starting shooting guard, Bradley Beal has scored more than 11,000 points. He's made two All-Star teams, and he's hit over a thousand three-pointers. But one thing he hasn't done in all that time - vote. BRADLEY BEAL: I can selfishly say I was that individual four years ago and maybe eight years ago. I was someone who didn't take registration seriously. I was someone who thought that my vote didn't count. PARKS: The arena Beal plays in, Capital One arena in Washington, will serve as a polling place this election mostly because of players like him and LeBron James speaking out. BEAL: Had a conversation with my parents, my grandparents, you know, who are still alive and just understanding what they had to go through in order to have their right to vote, in order to have their privilege for their voice to be heard, you know? And so for me, I clearly took that for granted for eight to 10 years. And so I definitely want to nip that in the bud. PARKS: In all, dozens of NBA arenas and other sports facilities nationwide will be used for voting this fall. And they'll fill a real need for election officials, who've had to consolidate precincts in many cases and search for spaces, especially in densely populated cities, that allow for social distancing. ALICE MILLER: We are at a place in time where the little - the smaller facilities no longer work. PARKS: That's Alice Miller. She runs the D.C. Board of Elections. And last week she was watching as dozens of her staff turned the concessions area of D.C.'s basketball and hockey arena into a voting center. MILLER: I think we're going to have, like, 20 check-in clerks. We normally would have three or four. We're going to have 20 ballot-marking devices, six ballot-on-demand machines which actually print the ballots out. We normally have two. PARKS: Of course, everything is set up as you'd expect during a pandemic. There's Plexiglas sheets between the check-in kiosks, gallons of hand sanitizer. And staffers are measuring to make sure voting booths are six feet apart. (SOUNDBITE OF TAPE MEASURE RETRACTING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Move it back some. PARKS: The arena solution also helps with poll worker recruitment, which has been a worry this year. Employees at this and many other arenas were able to volunteer to work as poll workers. Tramaine Frazier has worked at Capital One Arena since 2013. TRAMAINE FRAZIER: I'm a wardrobe clerk/lost and found. PARKS: But today she's learning how to use a voter check-in tablet. FRAZIER: Come here. I think I pushed too many buttons. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You're right where you need to be. FRAZIER: Oh, OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So this is where they start. FRAZIER: OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So when you're getting ready to process, you'll hit manual entry. If they don't have their registration card or their ID... FRAZIER: OK. PARKS: One of the toughest aspects of planning an election in the COVID era is the guesswork involved. D.C. mailed every voter a ballot, but officials weren't sure who would use them. I asked the facility operations manager for the D.C. Board of Elections, Arlin Budoo, how many people he thought would vote at the arena. He was watching staffers wipe off voting booths, and he just laughed. ARLIN BUDOO: We don't have an idea of it (laughter). I mean, we just can't say right now. PARKS: Even in a nonpandemic year, arenas like this could offer centrally located, massive spaces for voting. There could obviously be scheduling issues with things like concerts and sports. But Budoo says voters may demand it or something like it going forward. BUDOO: It's hard to predict that part. I would say this. The more you give people, the more they expect. So with us doing this with 2020, they may expect it. But that's above my pay grade. PARKS: As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 people have voted at the arena, and the average wait time in line was less than five minutes. Miles Parks, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "NPR's history podcast Throughline gives us insight onto the ongoing battle for the right to vote.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Who has a say in American democracy? The answer has changed many times since this country's founding. People of all races and genders can now vote. But over time, barriers have been put in their way. Here are the hosts of NPR's history podcast Throughline, Rund Abdelfatah and Ramtin Arablouei. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE: On February 26, 1870, just a few years after the Civil War had ended, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution was passed, granting all Black men the right to vote. It was a moment of hope, of progress. But it was soon met with intense resistance, especially in the South. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting, unintelligible). DAVID BLIGHT: This counterrevolution by the white South was wrecked upon Black America. It was wrecked upon free people. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE: This is David Blight, author of \"Frederick Douglass: Prophet Of Freedom.\" BLIGHT: The emergence of the Ku Klux Klan and many other imitators who will wage a informal, largely vigilante terror war against Black politics and the Black right to vote using intimidation and using virulent, you know, white supremacy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I remember my mother taking us to the back of the house and pulling down the blinds and closing the curtains because the Klan was marching. BLIGHT: And by and large, it succeeded by the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of that era we tend to call the Jim Crow era. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ABDELFATAH: The Jim Crow era would last almost a hundred years and would be defined by the violent, systematic oppression of Black Americans across the South. BLIGHT: Some of the most pernicious forms of voter suppression - I mean, blatant discriminations - poll taxes, you know, literacy tests. And there were all kinds of weird machinations that the Southern states went to to prevent Blacks from voting. CAROL ANDERSON: By the time the U.S. is getting ready to fight Nazis, only 3% of African American adults were registered to vote in the South. ARABLOUEI: This is Carol Anderson, author of \"One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy.\" ANDERSON: And the federal government, even if it wanted to, didn't quite have the mechanism to intervene. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Warnings of arrest, threats of jail terms and violence all failed to put out what burns in the hearts and minds of the youngsters. PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON: The command of the Constitution is plain. It is wrong - deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country. (APPLAUSE) ABDELFATAH: On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed the discriminatory voting practices of the Jim Crow era. This was a big deal. The federal government was finally taking a firm stance against voter suppression. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHNSON: At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: We'll hear argument first this morning in case 12-96, Shelby County v. Holder. Mr. Rein... ARABLOUEI: Fast-forward to 2013. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, decided that crucial parts of the Voting Rights Act were unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts explained the court's decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ROBERTS: I think what we're talking about here is that Congress looks and says, well, we did solve that problem, as everyone agrees. It's been very effective. Section 5 has... ANDERSON: Roberts ruled that racism wasn't like it was back in the '60s. I mean, I - we have overcome. ARABLOUEI: Of course, racial discrimination is still a grim reality of voting in America. And Shelby v. Holder only made things worse. BLIGHT: Voter ID laws have been passed in so many states, you can't count them now. I mean, all these methods the Republicans are using in many, many states - reducing hours of voting, reducing days of early voting, reducing numbers of polls, fighting now over mail-in ballots. ANDERSON: I mean, we like to treat this kind of disenfranchisement as some kind of relic of the past. No. In the 2018 election, I voted early so that I could drive folk to and from the polls because here in Georgia, they had shut down over 200 polling places and the majority of those in minority and poor communities. And one of the women that I drove - she was, like, 90. And we go to the polls. And they're, like, how are you doing, Ms. - you know, and they name her - call her name. And she's like, I'm fine. They're, like, we got to see your ID. And she's trying to get, with these 90-year-old fingers, this ID out of her wallet when they know her. She's able to get it out, and she votes. And we get back in the car. And she's like, mm hmm. I remember when I had to read something when I first tried to vote here in Georgia. And they were asking me all these questions - literacy tests. And so this woman who had to come through Georgia's literacy tests is now having to deal with Georgia's voter ID laws with a powerful civil rights movement and a Voting Rights Act in between those two moments. We live on the plane of aspiration of what this nation could be, but we're also so aware of how fragile, how tenuous progress is. And that's why we fight.

            "article_content": "Black Lives Matter protesters display wristbands reading \"I Voted\" after leaving a polling place this month in Louisville, Ky. Activists warn Black and Latino voters are being flooded with disinformation intended to suppress turnout in the election's final days.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Black Lives Matter protesters display wristbands reading \"I Voted\" after leaving a polling place this month in Louisville, Ky. Activists warn Black and Latino voters are being flooded with disinformation intended to suppress turnout in the election's final days. Murphy Bannerman first noticed the posts this summer in a Facebook group called Being Black in Arizona. Someone started posting memes full of false claims that seemed designed to discourage people from voting. The memes were \"trying to push this narrative of, 'The system is a mess and there's no point in you participating,' \" Bannerman said. She recalled statements such as, \" 'Democrats and Republicans are the same. There's no point in voting.' 'Obama didn't do anything for you during his term, why should you vote for a Democrat this time around?' \" Bannerman was alarmed. She had already been on high alert for these kinds of messages, because of her job as deputy director of Election Protection Arizona, a nonpartisan group that helps people vote. Black and Latino voters are being flooded with similar messages in the final days of the election, according to voting rights activists and experts who track disinformation. These tactics echo Russian election interference on social media four years ago when operatives working for the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency focused heavily on America's racial divisions, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference. \"No single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African Americans. By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016,\" the report said. This year, these campaigns are even more widespread, voting rights activists say. And while in most cases, it's not clear who is behind the disinformation, the intent is unmistakable: to depress turnout among people of color by fueling cynicism and distrust in the political process. What makes these hoaxes so powerful is not where they come from, but how successfully they tap into voters' worries. \"When you think about the 2016 Russian influence, especially among Black voters, it was basically bringing up internal discussions that Black people have been having for decades,\" said Dwight Bullard, political director for the New Florida Majority, a progressive voting rights group. Doubts about whether anyone's vote really matters, or whether politicians truly have Black people's best interests at heart are \"a discussion at the barbershop,\" he said. \"That's a discussion that happens around kitchen tables every weekend.\" Activist Andre Banks said these unwelcome suggestions that Black Americans sit out the election are the latest chapter in a long history of voter suppression. \"We are now talking about this misinformation as a part of the same trajectory as a poll tax, as a literacy test,\" he said. \"A sustained campaign targeted at Black Americans \u2014 and often brown Americans as well \u2014 to limit our political power, to limit our ability to shape the decisions that are made in this country.\" Those concerns spurred Banks to co-found Win Black, a campaign to guard against the kind of disinformation that spread online four years ago. One of the Russian efforts that got the most online engagement was a Facebook group called \"Blacktivist.\" Their strategy, Banks said, was \"masquerading as black Americans, drawing people into conversation and ultimately turning that conversation toward bad information and often toward a sort of deep cynicism that made people sort of less inspired to participate.\" It's hard to measure the precise impact of these efforts at the polls. Black voter turnout in 2016 was lower than in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 when President Barack Obama was on the ticket \u2014 but still high compared with earlier election cycles. The U.K.'s Channel 4 News and the Miami Herald have reported that President Trump's campaign intentionally targeted Black voters in swing states with Facebook ads intended to deter them from voting, citing internal data from the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign called the reporting \"nonsense.\" This year, Win Black and other groups say suppression efforts are being pushed widely, both online and offline, and by sources within the United States. \"We see a lot of these efforts happening all over the country, everything from robocalls to paid networks of trolls ... popularizing untrue information,\" Banks said. Last week, Win Black and a partner group in Texas put up billboards assuring voters it's safe to return their ballots by mail. That was in response to flyers that appeared in some majority-Latino neighborhoods claiming, falsely, that the U.S. Postal Service would collect voters' information from ballots and put it in a government database. (Election officials in many states say it is now too late for voters to return absentee ballots by mail and are encouraging them instead to deliver their ballots by hand or vote in person.) Groups tracking disinformation have also noted attacks on Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, such as false claims about her racial identity and her history as a prosecutor in California. \"There's been rampant misinformation about her record, who she is, what she's about,\" the New Florida Majority's Bullard said. Not all of the online disinformation campaigns targeting Black and Latino Americans are trying to suppress their vote. Twitter this month suspended accounts that were pretending to be Black supporters of Trump \u2014 some of which had gained thousands of followers. Separately, a photo of rappers Ice Cube and 50 Cent that had been doctored to make it look like they were wearing \"Trump 2020\" hats was shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, including by Eric Trump, the president's son. Trump later deleted his tweet, but it contributed to the spread of the manipulated photo, according to Zignal Labs, a company that tracks social media. With Election Day looming and the volume of false claims rising, activists are turning to social media to get the facts out. Win Black has launched a campaign with More Than a Vote, a voting rights group started by basketball star LeBron James, to help young Black and Latino voters resist attempts to silence their votes. Don't get sidetracked by a spicy tweet from some rando. pic.twitter.com/P4PT82e9I3 One video, from the comedy duo Desus and Mero, offers tips on spotting bad information. \"That wild meme your uncle sent you, with a conspiracy about COVID and mail-in voting?

With just days left until Election Day, both President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will head to the Badger State for dueling campaign events on Friday. Wisconsin has been a swing state \u2014 on and off \u2014 for more than a century. Four years ago, President Trump won it by less than 1 percentage point. This year is also expected to be close. With just days left until Election Day, both President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will head to the Badger State for dueling campaign events on Friday, further underscoring Wisconsin's importance in this year's race for the White House. There's been a recent surge in coronavirus cases around the state, and it's likely the optics of the two events \u2014 like their diverging approaches to the pandemic \u2014 will stand in stark contrast. Wisconsin is now a coronavirus hotspot with total cases surpassing 200,000 and hospital bed capacity at about 85%. On Wednesday, Wisconsin reported records for cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Since the pandemic began, the state has also been a ground zero for racial injustice protests. Unrest erupted in Kenosha, Wis., after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by police in late August. The shooting reverberated across both the state and nation, sparking protests in cities like Milwaukee \u2014 where, in 2016, Democrats were quick to blame low voter turnout in minority communities. In rural Wisconsin, it's been a rough year for the state's dairy farmers. President Trump's trade war with China sparked a drop in dairy exports. The coronavirus pandemic led to vivid scenes of farmers dumping milk due to decreased demand and plummeting milk prices. In 2019, Wisconsin led the nation in farm bankruptcies. Yet the president's support among farmers remains high. With these and other issues at stake, Morning Edition wanted to hear about what's motivating Wisconsin voters this election. We focused on the larger Milwaukee metro area for its economic and racial diversity. Milwaukee County overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, while its surrounding more rural counties are deeply Republican. NPR spoke to a dairy farmer in rural Washington County and checked in with an organization on Milwaukee's north side focused on driving Black voter turnout. Dairy farmer Rick Roden of West Bend, Wis. and his family\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Roden\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dairy farmer Rick Roden of West Bend, Wis. and his family Rick Roden, a married father of two young daughters, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. He works a family dairy farm with 700 cows in Washington County, Wis. Though COVID-19 cases are surging in the state, the virus doesn't look that bad from where he's standing. \"To me personally, the cases are rising in Wisconsin, really doesn't affect me much or make a difference to me. I might have had the virus already and I didn't know it,\" he said. Roden said Trump has handled the pandemic \"the best that he could with the information that they had at the time.\" He is more concerned about his farm. And he worries that his business will suffer if Joe Biden is elected. \"One of my fears if Joe Biden would win the election is he's talking about making mass mandates and kind of shutting the economy back down again \u2013 now maybe not to the extent it was in March \u2014 but we need these businesses open, we need these restaurants open that are going to consume our cheese and consume our dairy products,\" he said. Roden sees the nation as more divided than it was four years ago. Though some say Trump's policies and style \u2013 especially with respect to how he talks about women \u2014 have fueled those divisions, Roden doesn't see it that way. \"The president tells it like it is,\" he said. When the president sent federal troops to the streets of cities holding racial injustice protests, for example, it was a way to keep rioters accountable, he said. \"We're living in a different world today than we were a long time ago but this world is constantly changing. As far as equal rights to everybody, you know, women and Blacks have the same opportunities that we may have today, that maybe they didn't have years ago,\" he said. Angela Lang is founder of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities in Milwaukee.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Bence for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Angela Lang is founder of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities in Milwaukee. When Angela Lang needs motivation, she looks at a giant, bright green Post-It stuck near her laptop where she's written the number 22,748. It's how many votes President Trump won Wisconsin by in 2016. Barack Obama won the state twice. After the last election, Democrats were quick to blame the low voter turnout among Milwaukee's Black community as a reason for the narrow defeat. Lang said it felt like Black people in Milwaukee were being scapegoated. Wisconsin is an overwhelmingly white state, and in 2016, about 1.4 million eligible voters there didn't vote. \"I heard a lot of progressive folks, Democratic folks, a lot of white progressives that were blaming our community for the outcome of what happened,\" Lang said. So she decided to take action. She figured there had to be 22,748 or so people she could persuade to vote this time. That's how, in 2017, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC) was born \u2014 with the mission of increasing voter turnout among Milwaukee's Black community. Over the past three years, she and her co-workers have knocked on thousands of doors and explained how to register to vote. They've told people who have lost their right to vote because of felony convictions that it has been restored. They have held events like \"Civics Jeopardy,\" covering things like Black history, important dates in voting and the legislative branch. Early voting numbers out of Wisconsin indicate a rise in voter turnout. More than 1.6 million people have already voted across the state. That's more than half of the total turnout four years ago, according to the U.S. Elections Project. BLOC doesn't endorse any particular party. Lang said her group wants people to make up their own minds. BLOC does endorse candidates, and this election, all of them happen to be Democrats. \"It's important to know the power of our vote and that you can't win a statewide election if you don't engage Black and brown voters,\" she said. \"And that happened in 2016.\" Keith Johnson, 20, of Milwaukee recently voted for the first time.\n                \n                    \n                    Keith Johnson\n                    \n                \nhide caption Keith Johnson, an assistant manager at a Milwaukee Dollar Tree, has been skeptical about taking part in the voting process. Until this year, Johnson had never voted. He probably wouldn't have this year either. He'd seen some theories on the Internet about voting \u2013 inaccurate claims like that someone might take your ballot and change the name of the person you voted for. But a few months ago, his mom's friend Facetimed him. She works at BLOC, and she wondered if he was going to vote. She told him how to get an absentee ballot mailed to him. The logistics. The how. No one had ever told him that. And as for the why? His mom's friend didn't make any promises. She just said, you know, for a long time Black people couldn't. \"I'm probably voting for someone who couldn't do it back then, and just like making it up for them or just like helping out my people,\" he said. Johnson backs Biden. \"Ever since Trump became president, more of this racial stuff has been popping out more than ever,\" he said. Johnson also feels like other countries are starting to pass us by. Japan has better technology, he said. But there's something else, too. He's heard stories about Trump's finances. Johnson looks around the streets of Milwaukee. They're cracked and bumpy, and there are potholes everywhere. The roads tear up cars. He said he wants a president who pays his fair share of taxes. In 2018, Amari Rucker said she didn't even know who the president was. Now, thanks to her work with Angela Lang's organization, she's a passionate and civic-minded voter.\n                \n                    \n                    Amari Rucker\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 2018, Amari Rucker said she didn't even know who the president was. Now, thanks to her work with Angela Lang's organization, she's a passionate and civic-minded voter. Amari Rucker is a passionate and civically minded voter, motivated, she said, by the idea that it's important to hold elected officials accountable. When she started at BLOC in 2018, though, she didn't even know who the president was. \"I thought it was Obama still. I never knew Obama got kicked out,\" she said. \"I was lost.\" She might have stayed lost. She finished high school in 2016, had a daughter and got a job in a Milwaukee caf\u00e9. But she realized she reached a dead end, professionally. Then one day, her daughter's dad's mom came home talking about work. It was clear she loved her job, and that appealed to Rucker. \"I'm like, oh, this is one of those types of jobs where you learn, you move up, you learn some more and you move up. I'm like, oh, this is a good job for me,\" she said. It turned out to be. She knocked on doors, then cold-called once the pandemic started, trying to register voters. Many have been skeptical. She's worn them down. Now they call her when they have questions about voting. And she said it's been awhile since her work has taken her to someone who isn't planning on voting. That's progress \u2014 and results in a new feeling for her. \"You're changing the world. Like, you don't get that feeling every day,\" she said. Heidi Glenn adapted this story for the Web.",

Updated 4:45 p.m. ET Philadelphia, still on edge following days of protests and unrest that engulfed the city in response to the police killing of a 27-year-old Black man, Walter Wallace Jr., experienced a relatively quiet night Wednesday. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw vowed on Wednesday that the department would release \"in the near future\" 911 tapes and body camera footage worn by the officers involved with the killing. While she did not provide a timeline, Outlaw said the materials would be made public after meeting with members of the Wallace family \"to ensure they get an opportunity to view the materials first.\" If and when the release happens, it will be an extraordinary and rare step for the Philadelphia Police Department to take. \"Although previous police shootings of Black men in Philadelphia have sparked protests, the department has never before released police footage of an officer's shooting,\" The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. A message from President John McNesby. Please share. @FOPLodge5 @john_mcnesby pic.twitter.com/AJAKed7Xlw Releasing the footage and tapes is a move supported by John McNesby, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5. In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, he urged city officials to \"release what you have.\" \"We're calling on the city leadership to release the facts of this case. It's not hard,\" McNesby said. \"It's cut and dry. Release what you have. Support your officers, back your officers and let's get a handle on this thing.\" Police said Wallace 'advanced toward officers' with a knife Police said earlier this week that Walter Wallace was armed with a knife and \"advanced toward officers.\" When he did not drop the weapon, two officers fired at him several times, according to law enforcement. Wallace was experiencing a psychological episode on Monday, according to a family attorney. His mother attempted to calm him, the lawyer said, but was unable to and called 911 for an ambulance. But the police arrived first. The incident was captured on graphic cellphone video, which was posted to social media and quickly went viral. An Internal Affairs investigation launched There is also new video capturing an encounter between Philadelphia police officers in riot gear and three people in an SUV. The video, first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer, said Instagram user Aapril Rice, 30, livestreamed the video early Tuesday from her rooftop. The video shows a slow-moving SUV traveling along a street before being surrounded by several helmeted police officers with riot shields. The officers use batons to shatter the vehicle's windows, then forcibly removes the driver and a passenger. One officer then reaches into the back of the vehicle and lifts a toddler out. Police confirm to NPR that an internal investigation into the matter has been launched, but provided no other details. Resolution affirming peaceful protests The Philadelphia City Council on Thursday approved a measure that would bar the use of non-lethal crowd dispersal tactics, including the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on those peacefully protesting. It affirms \"Philadelphians' First Amendment rights to protest and peaceful assembly\" according to the resolution. The council added the timing of the bill's passage \u2013 in the wake of the Wallace shooting and on the eve of the upcoming election \u2013 was in part to preempt excessive force from being used on future protests. \"As Black Lives Matter protests demanding justice for Walter Wallace Jr. will likely converge with demonstrations related to the elections, Philadelphia's history of using tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray against its own citizens also looms large,\" according to a statement from the council. \"This resolution indicates Council's desire not to repeat the same mistakes,\" the statement continued. A city spokesperson tells NPR the Philadelphia's Law Department will review the measure, adding the \"we support the intent of the bill.\" Police Union says officers are 'being vilified' Hours after the shooting Monday, McNesby, the FOP president,  issued a statement supporting the officers involved, saying they were \"being vilified for doing their job and keeping the community safe.\" Following the Wallace shooting, parts of the city saw violent clashes between law enforcement in helmets and shields and protesters, some of them hurling objects at police. There were also reports of looting. Police said 30 officers were hurt during clashes late Monday and early Tuesday. During confrontations Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, police said 81 people were arrested, including 53 for burglary. Wednesday evening was different. Earlier in the day, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney issued an emergency order placing the city under a curfew from Wednesday, 9 p.m. to Tuesday, 6 a.m. While there were some reports of looting and confrontations, the tense confrontations that gripped Philadelphia for two nights never fully materialized, USA Today reported. At one point, the newspaper added, just 15 people gathered for a \"Justice for Walter Wallace Jr.\" protest in City Center, but attendees quickly went their separate ways.",

Members of a Quaker congregation in Maryland are so concerned that President Trump will prematurely declare victory when states are still counting ballots \u2014 a process that could take days \u2014 that they are ready to take to the streets in nonviolent resistance. They say such a scenario would amount to a \"coup\" \u2014 even if it involves legal fights and not military action. \"To use the word 'coup' in the United States just seems like such a foreign concept when we're supposed to be this beacon of democracy,\" said Alaine Duncan, an acupuncturist and Quaker who lives just outside Washington, D.C. \"But it doesn't seem like we're being a beacon of democracy right now.\" With Election Day less than a week away, anxiety, distrust and suspicion are running high. Activists and extremists on both the right and left are worried the other side will somehow steal the election, and they're making plans for what to do if they believe that's happening. Experts in global conflict warn that this is a toxic brew and that conditions are ripe for conflict and maybe even violence in the U.S. There's a good chance that no clear winner will emerge on election night, and experts are concerned about what will happen after that \u2014 especially if protesters and counterprotesters collide in the streets. Several human rights and conflict resolution groups that typically monitor elections abroad, mostly in fledgling democracies or places where sectarian violence could erupt, are now turning their attention to the United States for the first time. Tim Phillips, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Beyond Conflict, has worked in deeply divided societies in South Africa and Northern Ireland. He never imagined U.S. democracy would face similar challenges. \"We thought we were immune to it,\" he said. \"When we looked at our own problems, we thought: 'Of course we have some big issues, but we're in a sense immune from an us-versus-them mindset, a sectarian mindset, where there could be real conflict.' \" Experts see rising signs of potential violence around the election in the U.S.  They point to growing polarization along racial and identity lines, and extremist groups threatening the use of force. Another warning sign they've seen in other countries: political rivals seeking to gain total power \u2014 and cutting out the other side. \"We look for early signs so that we can come up with early interventions before all hell breaks loose,\" said Hrair Balian, director of the Conflict Resolution Program at The Carter Center, started by former President Jimmy Carter in part to ensure fair elections in the developing world. 'What we fear' Now Balian and the Carter Center are focusing on U.S. elections. The center is operating behind the scenes, working with local faith leaders in an effort to keep everyone calm. \"I never imagined that in this country, I would worry about the same things that I was worried about when I lived in Lebanon,\" said Balian, who has also worked in the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet states. Balian said he doesn't want to sound like an alarmist but some of the things he sees happening in this country are, frankly, alarming. \"What we fear is that guns, protests and elections do not mix well,\" he said. People on both sides of the political spectrum feel this rising tension, too. \"There's a lot of anxiety. I think there's some fear. I think there's some anger,\" said Duncan, the D.C.-area Quaker. \"You know, how could this be happening?\" Members of Duncan's congregation have been preparing for the days after the election with a series of virtual training sessions on Zoom. They talk about the Quaker tradition of nonviolent resistance and how they might apply those principles to the current moment. \"When coups are defeated, they're defeated very rapidly. And we're talking about three days to a week,\" said Michael Levi, who ran one of the sessions last week. \"So if there is going to be an attempted coup, we need a lot of people to act very quickly.\" They're also worried about a violent response from supporters of the president. President Trump has drawn a lot of criticism for telling his far-right supporters, some of whom have a track record of violence, to \"stand by.\" \"There is always a touch of fear that goes with armed groups that could show up to try to intimidate people,\" said Kierstyn Zolfo, a volunteer with the progressive advocacy group Indivisible. Zolfo lives in Bucks County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, where she's helping organize a demonstration for the day after the election, part of a nationwide effort called Protect The Results. \"It's important to support the fact that everyone's vote counts,\" Zolfo said. \"We feel that that's more important than letting fear rule our decisions.\" Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has recruited an \"army\" of citizen poll watchers, and the president often claims, without evidence, that mail-in ballots that have been widely used in this pandemic are rife with fraud. There's also widespread concern \u2014 particularly on the left \u2014 about the role self-styled militias could play after two protesters were fatally shot in Kenosha, Wis., earlier this year, and after the FBI says it thwarted a plot in Michigan to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But militia leaders interviewed for this story say that's not what they're about. \"We're not going to just go start a fight. It's not going to happen. I'm not going to go down to Chicago or Kenosha or Minneapolis or Washington, D.C.,\" said Walt Madsen, the head of a group that calls itself the U.S. Northern Militia. Downtown Portland, Ore., experienced weeks of unrest this summer. The demonstrations began in response to the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans killed by law enforcement.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Downtown Portland, Ore., experienced weeks of unrest this summer. The demonstrations began in response to the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans killed by law enforcement. Possibility for unrest is strong Madsen said he has been talking to other militia leaders, and many feel the same as he does. \"If Joe Biden does win the election. I'm not going to sit there and scream, 'He's not my president.' OK?\" said Madsen, an Iraq War veteran who's now a county supervisor in northern Wisconsin. \"I'm not going to go and take my militia and threaten the lives of other Americans,\" he said. In fact, some militia leaders say they are afraid of the protesters on the left. \"No matter what way the election goes, there's going to be people dissatisfied with the result, and the possibility for unrest is quite strong,\" said Michael Lackomar, a team leader with the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia. Lackomar said members of his group are preparing to protect their communities if there's rioting or violent unrest, like during protests earlier this year in Seattle and Portland, Ore. \"If you're coming at my house and my family's there, I'm going to do everything in my power and every tool in my box to make sure that my family is safe,\" Lackomar said. Police departments and the National Guard say they're preparing for tensions and the possibility of violence in the days or weeks ahead. Global conflict experts say it's not inevitable that the election or its aftermath will devolve into chaos. But they say it's crucial for political leaders on all sides to deescalate tensions in case there's a long contested election. \"Probably the biggest issue is the president of the United States right now, who has portrayed himself as somebody who, you know, is not necessarily interested in calming the waters,\" said Stephen Pomper, senior director for policy at the International Crisis Group. He added that Trump \"might actually court unrest in order to serve his political and personal goals.\" Still, Balian at the Carter Center hopes it won't come to that. \"We have become intolerant, we have started dehumanizing the other side,\" Balian said. \"We are at the edge of an abyss, and we better see this and try to step back before it is too late.\"",

This year, some are turning their attention to the U.S. election.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: For years, American human rights groups have monitored elections abroad, mostly in fledgling democracies or places where sectarian violence could erupt. Now, for the first time, some groups are focusing on the U.S. election. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, they're seeing warning signs of potential conflict or even violence ahead. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Fifty years ago, Hrair Balian fled Lebanon, the country where he was born, to escape from civil war and political turmoil and landed in the U.S. HRAIR BALIAN: I never imagined that in this country I would worry about the same things that I was worried when I lived in Lebanon. ROSE: Balian directs the conflict resolution program at the Carter Center, started by former President Jimmy Carter, in part to ensure fair elections in the developing world. Balian has worked in the Balkans and former Soviet states, though never on a U.S. election until now. Balian told me he doesn't want to sound like an alarmist, but some of the things he sees happening in this country - they're pretty alarming. BALIAN: What we fear is that guns, protests and elections do not mix well. ROSE: Experts in global conflict see rising signs of potential violence around the election here. There's a good chance that no clear winner will emerge on election night and deep concern about what will happen next, especially if protesters and counter-protesters collide in the streets. The Carter Center is operating behind the scenes, working with local faith leaders in an effort to keep everyone calm, while other conflict resolution groups are also sounding the alarm. Tim Phillips is the founder of the nonprofit Beyond Conflict. He's worked in places like South Africa and Northern Ireland and didn't think U.S. democracy would face the same problems. TIM PHILLIPS: The United States had been promoting democratic elections and democracy around the world. And when we looked at our own problems, we thought, of course, we have some big issues. But we're, in a sense, immune from an us-versus-them mindset where there could be real conflict. BALIAN: I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was having nightmares. ROSE: Hrair Balian says he and other experts know the warning signs of potential violence from their experience around the world. BALIAN: We look for early signs so that we can come up with early interventions before all hell breaks loose. ROSE: Balian says he's watched with a growing sense of dismay as he recognized more and more of those early warning signs in the U.S. The first warning sign - growing polarization along racial and identity lines. The country was polarized politically, and then came this summer's national reckoning over racial justice as protests turned violent in Oregon, in Kentucky, in Minnesota and Wisconsin. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST AMBIENCE) ROSE: In Kenosha, a teenager allegedly shot and killed two protesters this summer. That brings us to the second warning sign for conflict experts - when extremists start to take matters into their own hands. Those experts found it deeply alarming when the FBI said earlier this month that it had thwarted a plot by self-styled militias in Michigan to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRETCHEN WHITMER: I knew this job would be hard. But I'll be honest. I never could've imagined anything like this. ROSE: A third warning sign is when political rivals seek to gain total power and cut out the other side. But experts say there are reasons for optimism, too. Tim Phillips says U.S. democracy, the oldest in the world, is still strong. And he believes Americans are actually not quite as divided as we think. PHILLIPS: Are we going to see the levels of violence that I've seen in Northern Ireland or South Africa or Central America and Bosnia? I really don't think so. But that's not to diminish the real threat that acts of violence can have in this country. ROSE: Phillips says there is still time to de-escalate tensions before all hell breaks loose. But that would require our elected leaders to denounce violence before it is too late. Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF SYML'S \"GIRL (PIANO VERSION)\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Updated at 5:02 p.m. ET When police fatally shot 27-year-old Walter Wallace in Philadelphia on Monday afternoon, the issue of police violence and how it disproportionately affects Black Americans was once again thrust into the spotlight. Protests began nearly immediately after the news broke, with some instances of rioting as well as violence between demonstrators and the police. In the final days of the presidential election, the two leading candidates in the race, President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, have both focused most heavily on condemning any violence and looting as part of demonstrations against police brutality. Speaking at an event in Paradise, Nev., on Wednesday, Trump, a Republican, downplayed his moral opinion on the shooting itself, instead focusing his attention on the protests, which he said were the result of soft leadership from Democrats on the city and state level. \"It's a terrible thing. What I'm witnessing is terrible. And, frankly, that the mayor, or whoever it is, that's allowing people to riot and loot and not stop them is also just a horrible thing,\" he said. \"I saw the event \u2014 everybody did, it was on television \u2014 it was a terrible event. I guess that's being looked at very strongly. We have federal \u2014 the federal government is looking at it also. But the rioting in Philadelphia, you have to stop it. They have to stop it. It's a local thing, as you know,\" Trump said, adding that he would readily send in federal law enforcement to suppress any violent uprisings. \"You got to have law and order. You've got to have respect for our police,\" he said, trotting out his long-favored talking point of a police system crippled by Democrat inaction. Biden, the Democratic nominee, on Wednesday said that he would set up a commission to better deal with how police interact with people dealing with mental health issues, but he forcefully condemned any violence and looting during the protests. \"There is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence. None whatsoever. I think to be able to protest is totally legitimate. It's totally reasonable. But I think that the looting is just as the victim's father said, 'Do not do this. ... You're not helping. You're hurting. You're not helping my son,' \" Biden, who has been accused by Republicans as being soft on crime, said to reporters after he cast his early ballot near his home in Wilmington, Del. \"There are certain things we're going to have to do as we move along. ... And that is how we deal with how you diminish the prospect of lethal shooting in circumstances like the one we saw. That's going to be part of the commission I set up to determine how we deal with these. ... But there's no excuse for the looting,\" he said. Wallace's death comes following a summer pockmarked by police shootings and nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Both Trump and Biden have carved out stances on the matter, with Trump focusing his appeals to law enforcement and maintaining \"law and order,\" while Biden has acknowledged systemic racism in the United States and vowed if elected to more closely examine how to repair relationships between police and minority communities. Speaking at a campaign event in Bullhead City, Ariz., on Wednesday afternoon, Trump further sharpened his attack against the protests and connected the uprisings to Democrats. \"Joe Biden has surrendered his party to the rage-filled socialists, Marxists and left-wing extremists. And that's what you're going to have, and you can't let it happen. The Democrats have spent the entire year inciting violence, and hatred, and hatred against our police \u2014 our police. Without our police, we have very little,\" Trump said, adopting a familiar dark, less nuanced tone with his supporters. \"Last night, the city of Philadelphia was ransacked by violent mobs and Biden-supported people. These were all Biden-supported people. And he wouldn't even call them out. This morning, they said 'please call them out.' He doesn't want to get involved because he doesn't want to lose the radical left,\" he continued. \"Biden and [Kamala] Harris stand up, and they stand with the rioters and the vandals. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. It took generations to build the America we know and love, but if the radical left gains power, it will take them only a short period of time to destroy it.\"",

And they're making plans for what to do if that happens. Experts are warning this is a toxic brew and that conditions are ripe for conflict and, maybe, even violence. NPR's Joel Rose has been looking into all of this. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So you - I know you've been talking to people from across the political spectrum. I mean, as you listen to what they're saying, what are your impressions? ROSE: Well, people are really worried. I mean, on the right, they're concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots. They're hearing from President Trump, who is stoking those fears by claiming, without evidence, that the system is rife with fraud. And on the left, people are worried about another scenario. In their worst fears, Trump is ahead on election night and either his campaign or his Justice Department tries to end vote-counting prematurely. And disputes over vote-counting could go on for days or weeks. So activists on both sides are making plans to mobilize. GREENE: Well, what does mobilize look like? I mean, we've been hearing about these doomsday scenarios for weeks now about what might happen. Where could this all lead? ROSE: Well, I've been talking to experts on conflict resolution. Many of them monitor elections around the world. But this year, for the first time, they are turning their attention to the U.S. election. And they're worried about the potential for violence here, especially if protesters from different sides collide out in the streets. I talked to Hrair Balian.

DUNCAN: We are organizing affinity groups to take to the streets, if need be, to make life difficult if there is an attempted coup, a power grab, by the Trump administration. ROSE: They're so concerned that they're using the word coup to describe what might happen, even if it involves lawyers and not the military. For the last few weeks, they've been holding virtual training sessions on Zoom. They talk about the Quaker tradition of nonviolent resistance and about how they might apply those principles to the current moment. The sessions are led by fellow Quaker Michael Levy (ph). MICHAEL LEVY: When coups are defeated, they're defeated very rapidly. And we're talking about three days to a week. So if there is going to be an attempted coup, we need a lot of people to act very quickly. ROSE: They're also worried about a violent response from supporters of the president. President Trump has drawn a lot of criticism for telling his far-right supporters, some of whom have a track record of violence, to, quote, \"stand by.\" This weighs on Kirstin Zolfo (ph), too. Zolfo lives in Bucks County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, where she's helping organize a demonstration for the day after the election, part of a nationwide effort called Protect the Results. KIRSTIN ZOLFO: There is always a touch of fear that goes with armed groups that could show up to try to intimidate people. But I think it's important to support the fact that everyone's vote counts. We feel that that's more important than letting fear rule our decisions. ROSE: The Trump campaign has recruited a, quote, \"army\" of citizen poll watchers. And there's concern, particularly on the left, about the role self-styled militias could play after a teenager allegedly shot and killed two protesters in Kenosha, Wis., earlier this year, and after the FBI says it thwarted a plot in Michigan to kidnap Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. But the militia leaders I talked to say that's not what they're about. WALT MADSEN: We're not going to just go start a fight. It's not going to happen. And I'm not going to go down to Chicago or Kenosha or Minneapolis or Washington, D.C. I'm not going to go there. ROSE: Walt Madsen is the head of a group that calls itself the U.S. Northern Militia in Wisconsin. He's an Iraq war veteran who's now a county supervisor. Madsen says he's been talking to a lot of other militia leaders. And many of them feel like he does. MADSEN: If Joe Biden does win the election, I'm not going to sit there and scream he's not my president, OK? I'm not going to go and take my militia and threaten the lives of other Americans. ROSE: In fact, some of these militia leaders say they are afraid of the protesters on the left. MADSEN: No matter what way the election goes, there's going to be people dissatisfied with the result. And the possibility for unrest is quite strong. ROSE: Michael Lackomar is a team leader of the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia. Lackomar says the members of his group are preparing to protect their communities if there's rioting or violent unrest, like the protests earlier this year in Seattle and Portland. MICHAEL LACKOMAR: If you're coming at my house and my family's there, I'm going to do everything in my power and every tool in my box to make sure that my family is safe. GREENE: These voices, they're coming to us from our colleague Joel Rose, who is still with us. And, Joel, it sounds like both sides are saying, hey, we're not going to start the violence. But we have to be ready if the other side does something. I mean, so what do we make of this? ROSE: Well, you know, violence is certainly not a given. The experts I talked to say it is not too late to walk back from the brink. But they say it is really important for political leaders on all sides to de-escalate tensions in case there is a long, contested election. Stephen Pomper is with the International Crisis Group, which usually works overseas and is now monitoring this election. STEPHEN POMPER: Probably the biggest issue is the president of the United States right now, who has portrayed himself as somebody who, you know, is not necessarily interested in calming the waters and who might actually court unrest in order to serve his political and personal goals. GREENE: So Joel, what - how seriously are authorities taking the threat of violence? ROSE: Seriously. I mean, police departments and the National Guard are definitely thinking about this and strategizing about how to keep everybody safe in the days or weeks ahead. Like I said, widespread violence is not a given. It's maybe not even likely. But the takeaway for me is that the conditions are there for it to happen with the right spark in a way that would have been unthinkable eight years ago or even four years ago. And now it really is very thinkable. GREENE: NPR's Joel Rose. Joel, thanks for all this reporting. We appreciate it. ROSE: Yeah. You're welcome.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., leads a 232-to-197 Democratic majority in the House heading into the election. There are five current vacancies and oneLibertarian, former Republican Justin Amash, R-Mich., who left the party in 2019 in a clash over his plan to vote to impeach President Trump. Democrats hope to keep, and possibly expand, their House majority in 2020 by riding a rush of anti-Trump sentiment surging in cities and suburbs across the country. Recent polls have prompted political analysts to shift a number of close House races in favor of Democrats, who have sustained a significant cash advantage this election cycle. Republicans hope to win back some seats in 2020 by targeting the 30 Democrats representing districts where Trump won in 2016. Of those seats, 22 are held by freshmen Democrats who were part of the 2018 midterm wave that swept Democrats into power in the House. Five top targets for Republicans: Collin Peterson, D-Minn. \u2014 Peterson is one of the most conservative HouseDemocrats and has often faced difficult political challenges. He is the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, a job that carries a lot of weight in his farm-heavy district. But the area has grown increasingly Republican, with Trump winning 62% of the vote in 2016. Peterson has walked a fine line in attempt to fit his constituents. He voted against impeaching Trump but has voted with Democrats on most major bills. Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M. \u2014 It's a 2018 rematch in New Mexico. Torres Small is again facing former state Rep. Yvette Herrell, who she narrowly defeated by less than 4,000 votes. Polling in this district is slim but Trump won here by 10 points in 2016. Republicans have tried to tie Torres Small to more liberal Democrats and the Green New Deal. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla. \u2014 Florida is always a major battleground in a presidential election and this swingy Miami-area district may be one of the hottest contests in the state. Mucarsel-Powell defeated Republican Carlos Curbelo in 2018, winning just 51% of the vote. Curbelo was a frequent Trump critic when he was in Congress but he could not outrun the Democratic wave. Mucarsel-Powell now faces Carlos Gimenez, the popular Republican mayor of Miami-Dade County. Mucarsel-Powell has a significant cash advantage but the area is awash with national political ads, making this race as much about broader trends as local issues. Anthony Brindisi, D-N.Y. \u2014 Brindisi is another freshman Democrat running for reelection in Trump country. This is also another rematch. Brindisi is facing former Rep. Claudia Tenney, who he defeated in 2018 in a New York District went for Trump by 15 points in 2016. Trump remains popular here and his influence could help Tenney's chances at regaining her seat. TJ Cox, D-Calif. \u2014 It is a big year for rematches and Cox is one of them. He's running against former Rep. GOP David Valadao, who he narrowly defeated in a dramatic race in 2018. Cox was part of a major push by Democrats in 2018 to take over a string of GOP-held districts in Southern California. Cox initially planned to challenge a different GOP House member, Jeff Denham, but switched to run against Valadao. Valadao initially declared victory after the Associated Press called the race in his favor but Cox took the lead and eventually won several weeks later after mail-in-ballots were counted. Polling here is slim but Valadao led Cox in at least one early poll. Five top targets for Democrats: Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. \u2014 Van Drew won this seat as a Democrat in 2018 only to switch parties in December 2019 in opposition to impeaching Trump. Democrats think they can win again with the message that Van Drew put himself ahead of his constituents. His opponent Amy Kennedy, wife of former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, has been raising lots of money and recent polls show her ahead in the race. Don Bacon, R-Neb. \u2014 This is another rematch as Bacon faces Kara Eastman, a Democrat who he narrowly defeated in 2018. Eastman has benefitted from significant support from national Democrats and this district has been polling in favor of Joe Biden for president. Mike Garcia, R-Calif. \u2014 Garcia won this seat in a special election in May to replace Democrat Katie Hill who resigned amid personal controversy last fall. Garcia won that special election but California Democrats are expected to show up in droves in this presidential year, particularly with California Sen. Kamala Harris on the ticket as Biden's vice presidential running mate. Open Seat in Va. 5 \u2014 Once purple Virginia has been on a steady march towards Democrats for several years and many see this seat as a chance for them to solidify their hold on the state. Incumbent GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman lost his primary bid to conservative challenger Bob Good, an associate athletic director at the conservative religious school Liberty University. Good is facing Democrat Cameron Webb, a political newcomer and physician who served as a White House Fellow under both Presidents Obama and Trump. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters this week that a win for Democrats in this race, which could come from one of the states with an earlier poll closing time, is considered a sign of a potential blue wave in the country. Open Seat in Texas 22 \u2014 Democrats have invested big in Texas this cycle and they hope to win seats in suburban areas, like this district outside of Houston. Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni and Republican Troy Nehls are the top-polling candidates. Kulkarni has polled narrowly ahead and has been endorsed by by the Houston Chronicle and Biden. A pickup here would give hope to the longtime dream for Democrats of turning Texas blue.",

With a week until voting concludes this election season, the presidential candidates are making their final pitch to voters on the campaign trail \u2014 and on the airwaves. Joe Biden's campaign rolled out two, closing argument-style spots on Tuesday, amplifying themes the former vice president has promoted since he first launched his candidacy \u2014 casting the election as a decisive moment for the country's future and emphasizing the candidate's personal story and character. Meanwhile, new ads from President Trump attack Biden over trade and the economy, and emphasize the \"law and order\" message the president began deploying early this summer as protests over police brutality and racial injustice grew around the country. Biden ads \"I started this campaign saying we're in a battle for the soul of the nation,\" Biden says in an ad called Rising as images of him meeting voters on the pre-pandemic campaign trail flash on the screen. \"I believe that even more deeply today.\" The ad depicts images of parents with their children, then photos of polling places and voting booths, before landing on Biden addressing the camera directly and launching into language that's lately made up the closing of his stump speech. \"Character is on the ballot, the character of the country, and this is our opportunity to leave the dark, angry politics of the last four years behind us \u2014 to choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction,\" Biden says. \"I believe it's time to unite the country, to come together as a nation.\" The second Biden ad, In the Dark, features Jill Biden addressing the camera, interspersed with archival and family photos of her husband and their family as she narrates the story of Joe Biden \u2014 the man who's faced tragedy and, she says, guided by faith has been able to put his family's life back together again. \"Right now, a lot of families are hurting, and I know in my heart that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for these families what he did for ours: Bring us together, help us find light in the darkness, keep hope for the future alive in all of us,\" she says. The minute-long ads will air on cable and broadcast TV stations, including in 16 states \u2014 providing a window into the number of states the well-funded Biden campaign views as competitive. The campaign also announced it's launching five Spanish-language ads in 11 states. One that targets young Latinos specifically, Cancelado, talks about how the pandemic has canceled prom, graduation and jobs \u2014 and quotes the president saying, \"It is what it is.\" Polls have pointed to sagging Latino support for Biden compared with 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton in some places, including in Texas, where Democrats see a shot to turn the state blue for the first time in decades. Trump ads While Biden has made the president's handling of the pandemic a central feature of his campaign message, the new Trump campaign ads steer clear of the issue, keeping with the president's rhetoric that downplays the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the Trump campaign unveiled a national ad called President Trump Will Uphold the Law. The spot, which features an ominous voiceover as well as two veteran police officers, begins with headshots of Biden and Harris backed by outbursts of fire and sparks and then images of cars and cities burning. \"While America's cities burned, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fanned the flames, refusing to strongly condemn violence,\" the narrator says. One unnamed man, labeled onscreen as a police officer, tells viewers that \"Joe Biden's silence speaks loudly. He doesn't have our backs.\" Says another: \"In Joe Biden's America, we'll all be in danger. If you support the police, support Donald Trump.\" In its statement about the ad, the Trump campaign didn't say where it will air. Another ad released this week highlights a fracking technician in Pennsylvania. \"If Joe Biden's elected, he'll end fracking,\" she says. \"That will be the end of my job and thousands of others.\" Biden's climate plan calls for stopping new oil and gas permitting on public lands, but he has made a point recently of telling voters he will not ban fracking writ large. During a March primary debate, he appeared to go further in supporting a ban on all fracking but later said he misspoke. A third Trump campaign spot begins by proclaiming: \"Joe Biden doesn't support American workers\" and features archival footage of Biden talking positively about the North American Free Trade Agreement. According to an NPR analysis based on data earlier this month, more than $1 billion had been spent on television advertising in 13 states. At the time, Biden and allied groups had outspent Trump and pro-Trump groups on ads in six key states by a total of $240 million.",

            "article_content": "The Senate is to vote on Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination. Disinformation campaigns try to sway minds as voters head to the polls. And, COVID-19 cases reach record highs in many states.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: The Senate looks ready to confirm President Trump's third justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Amy Coney Barrett could transform how the court approaches abortion, gun rights and religious freedom. A final Senate vote is set for tonight, just eight days ahead of Election Day. GREENE: And we are joined by NPR's Carrie Johnson, who's been covering this. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So the White House nominated Amy Coney Barrett about 30 days ago. The Republicans were promising a very quick process here. Where do things stand with the Senate right now? JOHNSON: Republicans on the Judiciary Committee advanced Amy Coney Barrett to the full Senate late last week. That's after Democrats boycotted the vote. Democrats have mostly stayed in lockstep in opposition to this nomination, but they haven't been able to stop the process from moving forward. Yesterday, the Senate voted, largely along party lines, to advance the nomination. Republican Senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined the Democrats on that, but Murkowski says she's opposed to the process but will eventually vote to confirm Barrett. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sees this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lock in conservative control of the court. Here's what he said on the Senate floor yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: We made an important contribution to the future of this country. A lot of what we've done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election. It won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come. GREENE: Carrie, was McConnell there predicting the outcome of the presidential election? JOHNSON: David, to borrow a phrase from President Trump, we'll see what happens. But what is likely to happen soon is Barrett is likely to be confirmed tonight. And one question is whether Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, will be there after some of his aides tested positive for coronavirus. GREENE: Well, I mean, we should say Amy Coney Barrett did not answer a whole lot of substantive questions during those confirmation hearings. I mean, what do we know about what kind of justice she's likely to be? JOHNSON: You're right. She was incredibly cagey on things like voting rights, climate change and presidential power. Even so, we know she is a protege of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, very conservative. She may actually be more conservative than Scalia on gun rights. She's also written critical things about court rulings that upheld the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And she's a devout Catholic who says she believes life begins at conception. Remember, she signed a newspaper ad that called the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade a barbaric legacy. GREENE: Well, I mean, the court began a term earlier this month, right? How quickly might she be seated and hearing cases? JOHNSON: Pretty quickly, if history is a guide. She won't be able to deliberate on cases that have already been argued, but she could be on the bench as early as Tuesday, tomorrow... GREENE: Wow. JOHNSON: ...Certainly in time for the Obamacare argument that's coming on November 10. And there are other cases in the pipeline soon on religious freedom and LGBTQ rights and some abortion cases also making their way to the Supreme Court, too. GREENE: A lot of people wonder if there might be a case involving the presidential election, depending on how it plays out. Democrats tried to get Barrett to recuse herself from hearing any case involving President Trump and the election. She refused. So what do you expect to happen there? JOHNSON: If a case gets to the court, as President Trump has said he expects, it's just not clear what Barrett will do. She did tell senators she'd look at whether there's an appearance of a conflict to decide a case involving the political fate of the president. But the Supreme Court basically operates on an honor system, and no one can force her to recuse or sit on the sidelines. But, David, Democrats are warning if she takes part in a case that hands the election to President Trump, that could be enormously controversial and damaging for the court and for her own legacy. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: And, Carrie, let me ask you this. I mean, there's been all this talk swirling around the campaign on this question of whether Joe Biden, if he becomes president, might push to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court. In an interview that aired last night on CBS \"60 Minutes,\" Biden addressed this - sort of, right? I mean, what exactly did he say? JOHNSON: Joe Biden has struggled with how to respond to this pressure from left-leaning activists about adding seats to the court. And finally, he came upon an answer last night. Here's what - some of what he said to CBS' Norah O'Donnell. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\") JOE BIDEN: I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting out of whack. JOHNSON: In other words, he wants a commission, a high-level commission, to study this problem, not just adding justices, but a whole bunch of other possible measures, too. For some on the left, though, that's not enough. They say creating a commission will just delay the process further and not really speak to their efforts at big change that they want to see. GREENE: All right, NPR's Carrie Johnson as we await that Supreme Court vote later today. Carrie, thanks so much. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, so as millions of people head to the polls, social media, phone lines, email inboxes are all filling up with disinformation. MARTIN: Yeah, U.S. officials just last week - remember? - said Iran was using deceptive emails to threaten Democratic voters, but it's a much broader problem. Election officials and voter advocates are working to counter this growing wave of disinformation to try and prevent voters from being discouraged. GREENE: NPR's Pam Fessler has been following all of this. Good morning, Pam. FESSLER: Good morning. GREENE: What is the disinformation we're talking about here? What are we seeing? FESSLER: Well, we're seeing all kinds of it. You mentioned those threatening emails which looked like they were from a right-wing extremist group, the Proud Boys. But intelligence officials say they actually came from Iran as part of an effort to sow confusion and discourage voters. But that's just one example. There are a few others that I'm going to give you, with the caveat that all of these messages are false. Listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRERECORDED VOICE: Mail-in voting sounds great, but did you know that if you vote by mail, your personal information will be part of a public database that will be used by police departments to track down old warrants and be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts? GREENE: That's just amazing. FESSLER: Yeah, that was a robocall. It went to thousands of minority voters in Detroit and other cities this summer. And since then, two right-wing operatives have been charged with trying to intimidate these voters, which is a felony. More recently, early voters in Palm Beach County, Fla., got fake Democratic voter guides that listed the Republican congressional candidate, Laura Loomer. Voters have also been getting a lot of disinformation online, like tweets that say because of COVID restrictions, Democrats will vote on November 3 and Republicans will vote on November 4 and Facebook posts warning voters that their ballots will be rejected if a poll worker puts a mark on them or that the bar code on a mail-in ballot reveals your personal information. And it's all false. GREENE: I mean, you mention those two right-wing operatives who have been charged, but in general, I mean, can you talk about who's behind this stuff? FESSLER: Generally, we don't know. I mean, it's very hard to tell, but it's, you know, definitely coming from a variety of people who have different agendas. You know, there are clearly those who are trying to discourage voters of the opposite party from voting. There are the foreign actors, like Russia and Iran, who want to disrupt our elections. And there are also a lot of scammers. Some have been using fake voter registration sites and ballot-tracking services to trick people into sharing their personal data. And Oklahoma officials say a voter there got a text that her polling place had changed, and the attached phone number turned out to be for an escort service. GREENE: Oh. What is being done to stop this? FESSLER: Well, election officials, social media companies, advocacy groups are all trying to counter this disinformation as soon as they can, as quickly as they see it. The cybersecurity arm of the Department of Homeland Security has set up this new site called Rumor Control. And a lot of election officials are taking to social media. For example, Heider Garcia, the election administrator in Tarrant County, Texas, recently posted this video telling voters not to black out the barcodes on their ballots in response to online rumors because their votes might not count. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HEIDER GARCIA: So, please, I'm begging you, do not tamper with the barcode on your carrier envelope. Just mail it back or drop it off at our office. FESSLER: So these officials say that the most important thing for voters to do is to get their information from trusted sources and then make sure that they go vote. GREENE: All right, important advice there. NPR's Pam Fessler following all this. Pam, thanks a lot. FESSLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, so after tapering off, the number of coronavirus cases in the United States is now surging. MARTIN: Cases reached record highs in recent days in many states. Some areas are now adopting stronger restrictions aimed at trying to slow the spread. And the virus has reached the highest levels of government yet again. The chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, as well as others in Pence's office, have tested positive. CDC guidance is clear that you should quarantine after close contact with someone exposed to the virus, but the vice president is not doing that. GREENE: All right, one of many things to talk about with NPR's Allison Aubrey. Hi, Allison. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: Let's talk about the vice president first. I mean, he had close contact with his chief of staff, Marc Short, who has tested positive, but the vice president keeping up his campaign travel schedule. How is the White House justifying that? AUBREY: Well, the decision to keep his travel schedule intact was made in consultation with the White House Medical Unit, a spokesperson said yesterday. Pence's office says this is in accordance with CDC guidance for essential personnel. They're basically making the case he has essential work to do, including on the campaign trail. But public health experts are questioning this. Here's Josh Sharfstein of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He served in the FDA under President Obama. JOSH SHARFSTEIN: The vice president should be limiting interactions with others because he could be harboring the virus, and he could wind up becoming infectious. And so if there are essential activities that he needs to do in person, he should take extra precautions to do those. But otherwise, I think he should be staying at home. AUBREY: Especially given that around the country, David, including places Pence is scheduled to travel, such as Minnesota, the virus is circulating widely. GREENE: Which is such a big concern. I mean, you and I were talking not so many weeks ago about, you know, the numbers starting to come under control, it looked like. AUBREY: Yeah. GREENE: Not anymore, huh? AUBREY: No. The U.S. has been averaging about 68,000 new cases per day. This is about a 30% increase compared to just two weeks ago. In recent days, there have been record highs in several states - Utah, Tennessee, Illinois. In Chicago over the weekend, stronger restrictions took effect. So bars and restaurants must close earlier in the evening as part of a curfew in the city. Other parts of Illinois have stricter rules, too, so including limits on the number of people allowed to gather. And nationwide, David, there's certainly a lot of reminders to stay vigilant. GREENE: Well, one thing we're seeing, too - right, Allison? - is hospitalizations that are on the rise from COVID. AUBREY: Yes. GREENE: I mean, I hate to ask, but that often means that we're going to see a death rate that's going to climb. AUBREY: Well, there are still a lot of people dying - about 775 people per day in the U.S. on average. But that's a lot lower compared to the highs of last spring. Part of this, David, can be explained by the increase in cases among younger people, who are less likely to die, but there's been an improvement in treatment, actually. Physician Aneesh Mehta, who's an infectious disease expert at Emory University, is also a principal investigator for the NIH remdesivir trial. Last week, the FDA gave this antiviral drug full approval. ANEESH MEHTA: Remdesivir reduced recovery time to 10 days, compared to 15 days. And also importantly, remdesivir-treated patients had less use of mechanical ventilators and other advanced oxygen support techniques. AUBREY: Compared to people who didn't get remdesivir. And, you know, it's important to say this is not a home run treatment. It has not been shown to significantly prevent deaths among very sick people. But it does have benefits. And you combine that with all the other things doctors have learned, including when to use blood thinners, steroid medications, new research shows more hospitalized patients are surviving COVID-19. GREENE: All right, better treatments and then more survival in hospitals. That's good news. But these cases going up - a real concern. NPR's Allison Aubrey, thanks so much, as always.

            "article_content": "President Trump may be losing his lock on white voters, who were critical to his 2016 win. NPR discusses why more white voters are supporting Joe Biden and what it means for Trump's reelection bid.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Questions about how white people voted in the last presidential election kicked off barely 24 hours after Election Day 2016, and Democrats bore the brunt of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ROBERT SIEGEL: Is there a chronic problem for the Democrats with white, working-class voters? Has... CORNISH: The answer seemed to be yes. And at the time, there was a lot of media attention paid to the so-called white working class. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SIEGEL: Has the relationship between the party and that very, very large bloc in the population - has it been broken? CORNISH: Now, I was here on air that day after the election, watching my co-host, Robert Siegel, get into it with Michigan Democrat Debbie Dingell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DEBBIE DINGELL: I don't know that it's broken, but we as Democrats have to take a very strong look at what happened. CORNISH: What happened was Donald Trump won Michigan... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WOLF BLITZER: Let's take a look at the Electoral College map... CORNISH: ...And Wisconsin... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLITZER: ...With that win in Wisconsin. Look at how close he is. Right now, he has 257 electoral votes... CORNISH: ...And Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST: It's the first time Pennsylvania has gone red since 1988. CORNISH: This was the so-called blue wall of states where white voters had helped Democrats win for decades. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAKE TAPPER: And the wall comes tumbling down. This is the blue wall that Hillary Clinton had talked about. CORNISH: Now, the blue wall is shored up by white voters without college degrees. And yes, a lot has been said about how Trump won the majority of them. But polls show this year, for a Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden is showing historically high support with white voters, running nearly 50-50 with the president. And that is a problem for Trump's reelection strategy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CORNISH: Overall, in 2016, Donald Trump won white voters by 20 points, but this year... (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) CORNISH: Public opinion polls show Joe Biden outperforming Hillary Clinton with white voters in general. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) PAM HENKLE: Good afternoon. Winnebago Democratic. How may I may help you? CORNISH: Winnebago County, Wis., went for Barack Obama twice in 2008 and again in 2012 but then flipped to Trump in 2016. HENKLE: Six months ago, I was scared because I was here during the 2016 election, and we were so confident. But we've never seen stuff like this. This is unbelievable. CORNISH: Pam Henkle is a volunteer coordinator for Democrats in Winnebago County. That's southwest of Green Bay. In 2016, the party wasn't even sure it could keep paying rent on its headquarters. Now with all the donations flowing in, Henkle says they have enough in the bank to pay rent in advance for the whole year. HENKLE: Now I've got so many volunteers, I'm not even knowing where to put them. I did have another gentleman this morning come in and say he wouldn't vote Republican again and he was voting Democrat and took Biden signs. CORNISH: One thing Henkle says is accelerating the shift - the coronavirus outbreak in Wisconsin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My plan will crush the virus and will make Wisconsin greater than ever before. That's what's going to happen. CORNISH: In a visit to Janesville, Wisc., this past week, the president told a crowd of supporters not to worry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You know, we have a spike. You have a surge. But if you remember, two months ago, Florida had a big surge. CORNISH: But hospitalizations in Wisconsin have more than tripled in the past month. A couple hours south of Winnebago County, a field hospital just opened up on the grounds of the Wisconsin State Fair. HENKLE: One guy said he's been voting Republican for over 40 years, but he doesn't think he could go back to being a Republican because of the way they're thinking and the way they're supporting Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CORNISH: Pam Henkle spoke to NPR's Sam Gringlas. He's been talking to white voters in battleground states who aren't voting for Trump this year. Hey there, Sam. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So we've just hit Wisconsin. What's next? GRINGLAS: OK. So let's hop across the lake to suburban Michigan now because don't forget; when we talk about white voters, we're not just talking about blue-collar voters. We're talking about wealthier suburban voters too, like Nancy Strole. NANCY STROLE: I voted for Barry Goldwater, so I've been around a long time. GRINGLAS: She lives in this exurban part of Oakland County. And it's a place that used to be pretty Republican, think Mitt Romney-type Republican. But it's been getting a lot bluer over the last few years. Strole had voted Republican for a really long time. STROLE: I could not bring myself to vote for Trump. I just couldn't. GRINGLAS: In 2018, she actually started volunteering for the Democratic candidate for Congress who ended up flipping the seat blue. And when Strole went door-knocking that year, it was often women who would step outside, shut the door a little bit and say they were going to support the Democrat. STROLE: I can't speak for my husband, she would say, but she has my vote. GRINGLAS: Strole is 78, and she says it's not just women she's heard from. A lot of seniors don't want to vote for Trump either. They can't hug their grandkids right now because of the pandemic, and a lot of them see Trump as being somewhat responsible for that. Strole told me she's not just thinking about this one election but the country her kids and her grandkids are going to inherit. STROLE: I'm looking in the rearview mirror of my life, but that's not the case for my son and his wife and for my nearly 2 1/2-year-old grandson and my 9-week-old granddaughter. CORNISH: The Republicans like Strole couldn't bring themselves to vote for Trump in 2016. What are you hearing from voters who did? GRINGLAS: Well, first of all, I've talked to a lot of people who voted for Trump in 2016 and are planning to do it again. But then there's also people like Jim Diaz. JIM DIAZ: I'm 25 years old. And I'm from Charleroi, Pa., which is in the Mon Valley. GRINGLAS: He works in glass installation. He's a union member, comes from this long line of organized labor and Democrats. And he lives in western Pennsylvania, a part of the state that fell on hard times when a lot of steel jobs disappeared. Diaz liked Obama, still does, absolutely would have voted for him if he was old enough at the time. But when he turned 18, he voted for Trump. DIAZ: Listening to Donald Trump saying, like, we're going to bring these jobs back to America, I bought into it. Like, I really bought into it because I thought, like, man, like, you know, my family has seen some good times in America. And that was all thanks to the steel mill. But when that dried up, well, you've got to find other work. GRINGLAS: But since then, Diaz's political outlook has really shifted. A lot of it has been from joining the union, growing up, following politics more. But he also says Trump didn't fulfill the promises he made. And he said it felt like Trump was prioritizing the economy over safety during the pandemic. DIAZ: This is the United States of America. We can rebound. However, like, we can't just, like, reproduce people like our family members. Like, I can't get another mom, like, you know what I mean? Like, I can't, like, replace these people. Like, I just question whether he cared about us. CORNISH: It's interesting, Sam. Joe Biden has spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania the past few months but specifically in these white counties that President Trump had won by large margins. And obviously - and Biden has said this - that, you know, if his campaign can cut into those margins even a little bit, it would make a difference. GRINGLAS: Exactly. But we're also talking about places Hillary Clinton won in 2016 that Biden wants to do even better in. Across the state, right outside Philadelphia, I talked to Jane Scilovati. She's a special education teacher. And back in 2016, she basically saw the election as trying to pick between the lesser of two evils. JANE SCILOVATI: In the end, on a last-minute decision, I pulled the lever for Trump. SIEGEL: She kind of regretted it right away, but her doubts accelerated as the pandemic raged on. SCILOVATI: The more and more I watched him speak and blame other people, the more I realized that I'm not quite sure we're looking at a full deck here (laughter). GRINGLAS: Scilovati is going to vote for Biden this year. She even cut an ad with the teachers' union about why she's supporting him. SCILOVATI: Can't change what you did, right? You can just move forward and try and do what you can to sway people the other way (laughter). CORNISH: Does this seem like a permanent political realignment or just a reflection of this political moment that we're in right now? I mean, are these voters more or less becoming Democrats, or is this just a referendum on the president? GRINGLAS: Yeah, so I actually asked everyone I talked to this question. And I heard a lot of different answers. So I want to introduce you to two lifelong Republicans in Michigan, Mitch Monnin (ph)... MITCH MONNIN: I pulled the lever for Ronald Reagan. GRINGLAS: ...And Jeanette Phillips (ph). JEANETTE PHILLIPS: In my 20s, I joined the Republican Party as a lifetime member. It was very expensive to do, but I felt committed. GRINGLAS: And since 2016, both have become more and more dissatisfied with Trump. Monnin is a business owner, former Army Ranger. He voted for the libertarian in 2016. He has a son who's disabled, and Trump's behavior has really gotten to him. Remember that moment on the campaign where Trump mocked a disabled reporter. MONNIN: So in this case, I'm going to be voting for Vice President Biden not because I agree with his policies. I vehemently disagree with quite a few of them. But I truly believe that, at his core, that he is a fundamentally decent human being. GRINGLAS: Both Monnin and Phillips didn't like Trump's rhetoric when it came to the protests over racial injustice. She's voting for Biden for other reasons too. PHILLIPS: The Republicans have blown the deficit up. They don't care about the livelihoods of people who have lost their jobs. I lost my job three weeks ago myself. You know, they're clueless, I think, to what's going on. GRINGLAS: Would you call yourself a Democrat now, or is it you are fighting back against Donald Trump until he is out of office? PHILLIPS: I don't think I can vote for a Republican for the next 10 years. There has to be payback for what has just happened these last four years. GRINGLAS: Not only that but this lifelong Republican is now donating to the local Democratic Party and has signed up to be a Democratic precinct delegate with her daughter. Monnin is now proudly displaying a Biden sign in his yard. It's a big deal for him, but he doesn't see this as some kind of long-term shift if the Republican Party can step back and take a hard look in the mirror should Trump lose, he says. MONNIN: I do believe that this is a vote of this moment. It is singular in nature. GRINGLAS: And, Audie, here's a part of the conversation that really stuck with me. Everyone I talked to viewed this political moment as historic and recognized the weight of their votes. But Monnin actually asked for a copy of the full interview we did so he could send it to his daughter as a kind of historical record of this time. MONNIN: Forty years from now, people are going to ask, what were you - I truly think this is a watershed moment for us as a country, as a democracy. And the ability to be able to have her share that and have her children listen to that, I think, would be a pretty cool thing. CORNISH: Sam Gringlas, thanks for your reporting.

            "article_content": "President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have widely divergent views on health care issues.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have widely divergent views on health care issues. Health care was going to be the defining issue of the 2020 election before a pandemic and economic upheaval eclipsed pretty much everything else. But of course, the pandemic has highlighted many health policy issues. With a highly contagious virus spreading around the world, \"you might be thinking more about the importance of health insurance, or you may be worried about losing your job, which is where you get your health insurance,\" says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. \"The COVID pandemic and health policy are intertwined.\" Meanwhile, the choice between the two major presidential candidates on health policy could not be more stark. Drawing from President Trump's record on health care and former Vice President Joe Biden's policy proposals, here's a guide to where they stand. The Affordable Care Act The candidates' visions differ radically on the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care law, which was enacted in 2010. \"President Trump has \u2014 from Day 1 \u2014 pushed for repealing or overturning the ACA, and Joe Biden is pushing to build and expand on it,\" says Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments on the latest challenge to the ACA on Nov. 10. If the court does overturn the law, the president and Congress will have to work quickly to address the possibility of tens of millions becoming uninsured. One of the ACA's most popular provisions is protection for people with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage or charged higher premiums. Trump has promised to keep this part of the law but hasn't offered specifics on how, and policy experts warn it's harder than it sounds. Loading... Medicare and Medicaid When it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health programs that together provide coverage to 115 million people, Trump has promoted the private market and given states control, while Biden wants to expand eligibility to both programs. Trump has sought to bring drug costs down and provide more private plan options for beneficiaries in Medicare \u2014 the federal program for people over 65 \u2014 while supporting spending caps and work requirements for Medicaid \u2014 the state-run program for low-income adults, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities. Biden would allow people to enroll in Medicare at age 60 and would also try to create a new federal health program similar to Medicare, which he calls a public option. Loading... COVID-19 pandemic Biden has remarked often that he would \"listen to science\" in handling the pandemic, drawing a contrast with Trump, who has repeatedly contradicted his top health officials. Biden's proposals emphasize the role of the federal government leading the response, while Trump has delegated much to the states, says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. \"Trump's very clearly relying on governors and mayors to pick policies that they think are appropriate for their geography,\" he says. Early in the pandemic, Trump supported and signed a series of big congressional relief packages, but talks over a new one have stalled. \"His position has shifted back and forth about the importance of another COVID relief package,\" says Allison Orris, counsel for Manatt Health, a legal and consulting firm. If Biden were elected, she says, he \"would really focus on injecting money\" into these efforts, especially since many of the plans the Democrat outlines are expensive. Loading... Drug and health care costs This is the area where the candidates are most closely aligned. Both want to end surprise billing and bring down prescription drug prices, and they even agree on some ideas about how to do so. Trump has pushed hard on Congress to deal with surprise billing, and lawmakers got close in December but ultimately failed to agree on legislation. The president has used his executive authority to try to bring down drug prices \u2014 another Trump term might mean some of these efforts will go into effect. Trump has made some big moves on price transparency, issuing rules that would require hospitals and insurance companies to disclose negotiated prices to consumers, so they can shop around. This effort has \"kind of flown under the radar, but could actually have quite far-reaching effects,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation's Levitt says. For either candidate, fixing many of these thorny problems with health care costs needs to be done through new laws rather than executive action, Holtz-Eakin says. \"If you're in the White House, you have to learn how to get something through Congress,\" he says. Because lawmakers have such a key role, it won't be until after the election \"that we'll have some clues into how likely is legislative action\" on these measures, Orris says. The need to deal with the pandemic and the economic downturn could also slow these efforts down, she says. Loading... Other key health issues With so much attention on the pandemic, the public may have missed how different the candidates' views are on reproductive health, Levitt says. \"Reproductive health is also the area where President Trump has probably had the biggest and most tangible effect in health care,\" he adds. \"And Joe Biden's platform on reproductive health can almost be summed up by just: 'Do everything the opposite and undo everything that President Trump has done.' \" Many other key health issues have been made worse by the pandemic; addressing mental health issues, opioid use disorder and racial health disparities are all the more urgent and daunting because of how they intersect with COVID-19.

On Thursday, the committee voted to advance her nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 14. On Thursday, the committee voted to advance her nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. Updated at 10:51 a.m. ET Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee moved Thursday to advance the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, bringing President Trump's nominee within striking distance of confirmation and the court a step closer to a 6-3 conservative majority. Democrats boycotted the vote, pointing to what they called the damage Barrett would do to \"health care, reproductive freedoms, the ability to vote, and other core rights that Americans cherish,\" and the fact the vote took place even as voting was underway in the presidential election. The vote of 12 yeas and 10 abstentions followed a day of acrimony in which Democrats sought to deny Republicans a quorum to conduct the vote. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., rejected the assertion that at least two minority members were needed to proceed with the nomination. \"I will move forward,\" he said Wednesday evening. \"She deserves a vote.\" After the vote, Graham called it \"a groundbreaking, historic moment,\" adding: \"We did it.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Barrett's confirmation will have \"dire consequences for the nation, for the Supreme Court and our entire country for generations to come.\" GOP members of the judiciary committee cited Barrett's credentials and conservative bona fides, which include three years on the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and her history as a well-respected law professor at the University of Notre Dame, in pushing for her nomination to the court. The committee's vote marked a key milestone for Barrett ahead of her expected approval by the Republican-controlled Senate, which plans to vote in full on her confirmation on Monday. If approved by the Senate, Barrett's confirmation would represent one of the fastest in the court's history \u2014 just 30 days from the time the president announced her nomination to Monday's expected vote. Trump's nomination of Barrett following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September led to questions about the propriety of a president nominating a justice to the court during an election year. When Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in 2016, Republicans successfully blocked then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the court, citing the proximity to the election. Scalia's death came some nine months before that year's election. Ginsburg died with less than two months until the close of voting in the 2020 race. Republicans have argued that the difference between then and now is that in 2016, the White House and the Senate were held by different parties, while today the GOP controls both branches. Republicans say that represents a clear mandate from voters to make election-year decisions about the court, despite polling that shows the party facing an uphill battle both in holding on to the White House and maintaining control of the Senate. \"This has been a sham process from the beginning,\"  Schumer said ahead of Thursday's vote. \"Fearing a loss at the ballot box, Republicans are showing that they do not care about the rules or what the American people want, but are concerned only with raw political power.\" Voters appear closely divided on Barrett's confirmation. A Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday found that a razor-thin majority \u2014 51% \u2014 of voters approve of the Senate approving the judge's nomination. If confirmed, Barrett would be Trump's third appointment to the court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority on the bench. In the short term, her vote could prove decisive in the next several weeks as the court prepares to hear a pivotal case about the future of the Affordable Care Act and braces for the possibility of being called on to settle legal disputes that arise from the election. Longer term, Barrett could steer the court in a decidedly more conservative direction on everything from gun rights, religious freedom and the future of Roe v. Wade. With the political makeup of the court leaning further to the right, Democrats have recently begun floating the idea of expanding the number of justices on the traditionally nine-body bench \u2014 an effort that Republicans have derided as court packing. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has avoided providing a definitive answer on whether he supports expanding the number of justices on the court but has recently said he is \"not a fan\" of the idea. In an excerpt from an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes, Biden said if elected, he will \"put together a national commission \u2014 a bipartisan commission\" and ask it to report back to him in 180 days \"with recommendations as to how to reform the court system,\" because he says it's gotten out of whack.\"  \"It's not about court packing,\" Biden said.",

It's also the last, best chance for both candidates to make their arguments to a broad audience of the American public for why they should be president. After Thursday night, there won't be any opportunities like this left. That brings us to our questions about what we are watching for in this debate, which begins at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday and is set to last 90 minutes (follow live coverage here): 1. Will Trump engage in an actual debate? Trump's antics in the first meeting meant there was little to no debate on substance despite more than 200,000 Americans having died from COVID-19, an economy that remains shuttered in many places and racial unrest in the country. Will Trump have a repeat performance, or will he adhere \u2014 at least a little more \u2014 to rules and decorum, especially now with coronavirus cases spiking again? If history is a guide, don't bet on it. Remember when Trump promised he could be so presidential we'd all be bored? Well, we haven't been bored. 2. How low does it go? Joe Biden was understandably surprised by how Trump conducted himself the first time these two squared off. \"Will you shut up, man?\" Biden said, unable to get a word in edgewise. Biden tried to focus on people watching at home by talking straight to the camera. So how will he respond to those interruptions this time? Biden has maintained a low profile this past week, with few public events, likely for debate prep. Biden's only response so far to a questionable report about his son, Hunter, and his involvement in Ukraine was to get prickly with a campaign reporter who brought up the story. \"I know you'd ask it,\" Biden said to a CBS News campaign reporter. \"I have no response. It's another smear campaign, right up your alley. Those are the questions you always ask.\" Trump has never shied away from conspiracies or attacking family, so expect he'll bring it up. He has already prepped his attacks on the campaign trail, unabashedly calling Biden a \"for-profit cash machine,\" a \"vacuum cleaner\" and \"corrupt\" amid 2016-like rejoinders of \"lock him up\" at a rally on Saturday. Nothing is off-limits for Trump, and when his back is against the wall, he's not afraid to pull out any stops. Biden will likely need a more temperate response than his one to the CBS reporter, something more akin to what he did when Trump went after Hunter Biden in the first debate. \"My son, like a lot of people, like lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\" Biden said at the first debate. \"He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.\" This line of attack has a chance to spiral down a rabbit hole of attacks on children, going both ways, but Biden's campaign team doesn't want him sucked into the mud. They believe their winning place to be is focusing on issues affecting voters. 3. Can Biden keep up the momentum? With Biden's expanded lead after the first debate, there isn't much of anywhere to go but down. Biden now has a 10-point lead in an average of the national polls and leads in every competitive state, except Ohio and Texas, albeit much more narrowly than his national lead in many cases. So Biden's job Thursday night will be to maintain and solidify those leads. The bar for Biden in the first debate was practically on the floor. All he had to do was seem normal and competent and not mangle too many of his words, and he would be OK, given Trump's repeated attacks on Biden's fitness. He exceeded that, and since that debate, Biden had one of his best performances of the campaign with his town hall on ABC, which replaced the second debate after Trump chose to skip it because the debate commission wanted the candidates to be remote, given Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis. With this being the last debate, Trump will try anything to regain some momentum to get a repeat performance of running the table in 2016 and shrinking the gap in the final two weeks. The onus is on Biden to have a solid performance, handle everything Trump throws at him and close the deal. That's not the easiest task. 4. Will the moderator be able to ... moderate? The debate moderator is Kristen Welker of NBC News. As a White House correspondent, she has, at times, had a contentious relationship with the president. On Saturday, Trump was already predictably working the ref, calling Welker \"terrible and unfair.\" It's an unenviable position to be in to attempt to moderate a debate that involves someone like Trump who doesn't play by the rules. The debate commission says the following topics are to be covered: fighting COVID-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security and leadership. The commission is also instituting a rule that two-minute opening statements will be uninterrupted \u2014 and that the other candidate's microphone will be muted during that time. In a statement, the Trump campaign complained of the deck being stacked against it, lambasting \"last minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favored candidate.\" The campaign also said it believed this was supposed to be a foreign policy debate \u2014 despite no evidence of that being publicly stated. That all sets things up for another potentially contentious debate with Trump lashing out, not just at Biden but at the moderator. One test of how the 90-minute debate is moderated is if Welker can get through all the topics. And that's to say nothing of being able to get through them in a substantive way. 5. Will Trump commit to a peaceful transition of power? Trump has resisted unequivocally committing to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election. That's something that has separated the U.S. from other countries around the world and has maintained the country as a peaceful democracy, even when candidates and Americans sharply disagree about the direction the country should take. pic.twitter.com/JDS4zUXXJG Whether he means it or is just doing it to troll liberals and the media is unclear. But in the first debate, Trump declined to say he would discourage violence by his followers and not declare victory prematurely if results aren't known for an extended period. \"I'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it,\" Trump said, adding, \"I am 100% on board, but if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that.\" During a town hall with NBC on the night of what was supposed to be the second debate, Trump walked a similar line. \"They talk about 'Will you accept a peaceful transfer?' \" Trump said. \"And the answer is, yes, I will, but I want it to be an honest election and so does everybody else.\" Trump obviously does not want to give any indication at all that he's even thinking about losing. But does he clean up what has been a confusing and noncommittal line with less than two weeks to go until Election Day? Let's see if he's any more definitive in this debate.",

            "article_content": "Wind turbines near Dwight, Ill. and a pump jack in Cotulla, Texas. The presidential candidates have opposing views on the future of U.S. energy.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson and Loren Elliott/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wind turbines near Dwight, Ill. and a pump jack in Cotulla, Texas. The presidential candidates have opposing views on the future of U.S. energy. Despite the cascade of other crises this year, climate change has emerged as a key election issue. Two-thirds of Americans want the government to do more about it, and the same share of Biden supporters say it's very important to their vote. While not many Trump supporters overall agree, there's more concern among younger Republicans. The stakes are high as more Americans experience record heat, wildfires, hurricanes and flooding, and the two candidates could not be further apart. Joe Biden calls climate change an existential threat to our health, economy and national security. President Trump continues to question climate science. Here are six takeaways from Trump's first term on climate and energy, and the challenges he or Biden would face if elected. 1.  President Trump's push to boost fossil fuels is out of step with a fast-changing market Trump doesn't mention coal much these days, a sharp contrast to 2016 when he boasted to crowds that miners should \"get ready because you're going to be working your asses off.\" In fact, coal has continued its collapse. \"We just reached a big milestone,\" says Mary Anne Hitt of the Sierra Club. \"Sixty percent of the coal-fired power plants are now retired, or announced to retire.\" At times, Trump and his administration even tried and failed to save individual coal power plants, and the list of bankruptcies has grown. A major reason goes back to the Obama presidency, when incentives for wind and solar prompted a lot of construction. Once those facilities are built the fuel is free and coal plants just can't compete. Renewable energy has grown to 17% of the country's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, surpassing coal for the first time in over a century. As for oil and gas, Trump reversed plans to block construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and expanded federal areas open to drilling.  Production has indeed increased on his watch, though it's a trend that started under President Barack Obama with the rise of fracking for natural gas and the lifting of export restrictions. Still, oil and gas companies are feeling the pressure as more cities, states, businesses and utilities announce aggressive moves to decarbonize. Even some oil majors have pledged to become carbon-neutral. 2. U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are not falling fast enough Coal's decline has reduced energy emissions, but those from transportation have proved stubborn. And the Trump administration relaxed many climate regulations, including on tailpipe emissions. Overall, though, U.S. greenhouse emissions are going down and that will likely continue. But scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced far more dramatically, and soon, to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. A landmark 2018 report warned that even going past 1.5 degrees will have catastrophic consequences. The next few years will be crucial as a number of fossil fuel projects face uncertain futures, including the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, coal export terminals, and natural gas export facilities. If approved, they will lock the country into decades of additional emissions. 3. Biden's proposal to make the U.S. carbon neutral by 2050 is ambitious, but maybe not impossible First, Biden's $2 trillion climate plan is sweeping. Among his long list of pledges: rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, conserve large areas of land and water for biodiversity, stop offshore drilling in the Arctic, and massively invest in green energy and infrastructure like wind, solar, high speed trains and electric car chargers. Biden says this last part would provide \"good paying union jobs that put Americans to work, building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation.\" His goals for all this are to zero-out carbon pollution from the electricity sector by 2035, and make the entire U.S. economy carbon neutral by 2050. \"In the event of a major technological breakthrough, 2035 is possible,\" says energy law expert Scott Segal, a partner with Bracewell, whose clients include fossil fuel companies. Biden's plan relies on technologies that haven't been developed yet, or are not economical, so it includes a lot of money for research and development. Segal likes that it leaves room for some fossil fuels with carbon offsets and carbon capture, although that's a sore point with progressives. And he says it's smart to include both regulations and incentives to reduce emissions. \"It's a sign of a sort of maturity in approaching these issues,\" he says. Of course, the plan also calls for Congress to pass a law enforcing those carbon-neutral goals, which raises the next point. 4. A president can only do so much without action from Congress The Trump administration has rolled back or weakened dozens of environmental regulations, including those on coal plants, toxic chemicals, tailpipe and methane emissions, protections for waterways, and rules around a bedrock law that requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects. Now, the big question is how many of these will stick. Many have already been struck down in legal challenges and are being appealed. Some will no doubt end up in the Supreme Court, which is why the confirmation of a sixth conservative justice could affect U.S. climate policy. A major challenge is that the country's environmental laws are decades old. Climate change was not a pressing public issue when the Clean Air Act was passed, but the Obama administration pushed a legal interpretation that it applies to carbon emissions. An effective and enduring climate policy will require congressional action, which means Biden would likely need a Democratic-controlled Senate. 5. President Trump's second term would likely be more of the same When asked about climate change at the first presidential debate last month, Trump said, \"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air.\" But he condemns climate regulations as bad for jobs and the economy, and continues to dismiss the role of climate change in fueling extreme weather. \"I don't think science knows, actually,\" he erroneously told California officials at a recent briefing on record setting wildfires. Fossil fuel industries have wish lists for a Trump second term. Tom Pyle of the American Energy Alliance wants to overhaul federal offshore oil drilling. He doesn't like drilling bans, like the one Trump recently expanded in a move aimed at Republican led swing states. \"There's too much politics involved in that process,\" he says. \"We should be leasing areas where it makes economic sense to do so, and we shouldn't have these blanket bans.\" Pyle also would like to end special tax benefits for solar and wind. And he wants to re-litigate the so-called endangerment finding, a key 2007 Supreme Court decision that allows the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. 6. The pandemic has brought a new focus on climate justice COVID-19 has exposed racial inequities in health, and environmental justice advocates say air pollution is part of that. Preliminary research suggests people exposed to more fine particulate matter \u2014 which disproportionately affects low-income communities and people of color \u2014 may suffer worse outcomes from the coronavirus. That's drawn more scrutiny of the Trump administration's moves to ease air pollution limits, reduce environmental enforcement, and to maintain standards for soot that scientists say is harmful to human health. \"We have 100,000 people dying prematurely from air pollution every year and you're trying to increase that number,\" says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who left the Environmental Protection Agency after Trump's election and is now with the National Wildlife Federation. Biden's plan notes that climate change disproportionately hurts low-income communities of color. Among many other things, it calls for supporting climate lawsuits against polluters and targeting 40% of clean energy investments to disadvantaged areas. Michele Roberts of the Environmental Justice Health Alliance is from Biden's home state of Delaware, and says he was not always an ally. \"He was a filibuster for the political economy that was running the great state of Delaware,\" she says. But she thinks Biden's views have evolved. If he's elected, she says it will be important to hold him accountable for the promises he's making now.",

            "article_content": "President Trump has forged a friendship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. NPR discusses what might happen to U.S.-India ties if there's a change in the White House.  TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: As we approach the U.S. election, our international correspondents are looking at what the Trump presidency has meant for governments around the world. Today we take you to India, where President Trump has forged a relationship with that country's Hindu nationalist prime minister. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports on what a change at the White House could mean to the deepening relationship between the U.S. and India. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Namaste. Namaste. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: President Trump held a rally with Prime Minister Narendra Modi just before the pandemic at a cricket stadium in Modi's home state. And before that, he hosted the Indian prime minister for a Howdy Modi rally in Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: Howdy, my friends. FRAYER: Modi and Trump are both nationalists who've both been accused of discriminating against minorities, and they've had each other's backs. Trump's visit to Delhi coincided with anti-Muslim riots, which Trump was pressed to confront Modi about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We did talk about religious freedom. And I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom. FRAYER: Trump has been inclined to take Modi's word over that of human rights groups and the United Nations, who have noted a spike in hate crimes under Modi's Hindu nationalist rule. BIDISHA BISWAS: I think a Biden-Harris administration would speak up more. FRAYER: Bidisha Biswas is a political scientist at Western Washington University. She notes how Sen. Kamala Harris in the Democratic primaries was asked about Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority region, where the government has jailed politicians and protesters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: They are not alone, and we are all watching because so often when we see human rights abuses... FRAYER: That mere mention of Kashmir rattled India's political establishment. But Biswas says Harris's comments were actually in line with the positions of previous U.S. administrations. BISWAS: I don't think a Vice President Harris is going to upset that. And what she said about Kashmir honestly was a pretty mild statement, and it was pretty consistent. FRAYER: In fact, there's been a pretty consistent trend toward closer U.S.-India ties for decades, says Akriti Vasudeva at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington. AKRITI VASUDEVA: Since the George W. Bush administration, the United States has recognized India's potential as a natural balancer to China. It's been a proponent of the U.S.-India relationship due to India's strategic location, its potential as a market. FRAYER: Joe Biden has been part of that very U.S. foreign policy establishment for decades. He issued a video this year on India's Independence Day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: We share a special bond that I've seen deepen over many years. As a U.S. senator and vice president, I've watched it deepen. FRAYER: Biden promises to deepen ties on defense and trade, possibly without the tariffs Trump has imposed. He'd also restart cooperation on clean energy, which Trump dropped when he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. There is one signature Trump issue - immigration - that could be tricky for Biden. Trump sought to protect U.S. jobs by limiting H-1B visas for skilled workers. Indians are the biggest recipients. Kashish Parpiani is with the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai. KASHISH PARPIANI: Biden has promised that he's going to expand H-1B, and I think we are going to take that with a pinch of salt. Are you really telling me that an American economy that is under strain because of the pandemic, with 30 million people losing jobs, a Biden administration would prioritize expansion of foreign worker programs like the H-1B? I don't think that's going to be a priority. FRAYER: Not every Trump policy is likely to be overturned by a possible Biden administration. If Biden were to raise the issues of human rights, Kashmir or the environment, he's likely to do so in a way that does not jeopardize ever-closer ties with India, which are in both countries' interests.

At a rally, Fatima Goss Graves of the National Women's Law Center called the late justice the \"architect of our foundational rights\" in the U.S. She also delivered a litany against Trump nominee Barrett, saying this week's confirmation hearings left her \"without a doubt\" that Barrett would \"undermine our rights.\" Demonstrators gather to take part in the nationwide Women's March.\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Guzy for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A pro-life supporter argues with pro-choice advocates in Washington D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Guzy for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A demonstrator holds a sign saying Women's Rights Are Human Rights.\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Guzy for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"She will undermine our access to reproductive health care, to abortion from voting rights to climate change.

This article is co-published by ProPublica, Georgia Public Broadcasting and NPR. Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she pulled into the Christian City Welcome Center about 3:30 p.m., ready to cast her ballot in the June 9 primary election. Hundreds of people were waiting in the heat and rain outside the lush, tree-lined complex in Union City, an Atlanta suburb with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them Black. She briefly considered not casting a ballot at all, but decided to stay. By the time she got inside more than five hours later, the polls had officially closed and the electronic scanners were shut down. Poll workers told her she'd have to cast a provisional ballot, but they promised that her vote would be counted. \"I'm now angry again, I'm frustrated again, and now I have an added emotion, which is anxiety,\" said Kathy, a human services worker, recalling her emotions at the time. She asked that her full name not be used because she fears repercussions from speaking out. \"I'm wondering if my ballot is going to count.\" By the time the last voter finally got inside the welcome center to cast a ballot, it was the next day, June 10. The clogged polling locations in metro Atlanta reflect an underlying pattern: the number of places to vote has shrunk statewide, with little recourse. Although the reduction in polling places has taken place across racial lines, it has primarily caused long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where voter registration has surged and more residents cast ballots in person on Election Day. The pruning of polling places started long before the pandemic, which has discouraged people from voting in person. In Georgia, considered a battleground state for control of the White House and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of voting in Black communities like Union City could possibly tip the results on Nov. 3. With massive turnout expected, lines could be even longer than they were for the primary, despite a rise in mail-in voting and Georgians already turning out by the hundreds of thousands to cast ballots early. Since the U.S. Supreme Court's Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 eliminated key federal oversight of election decisions in states with histories of discrimination, Georgia's voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million people, yet polling locations have been cut statewide by nearly 10%, according to an analysis of state and local records by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica. Much of the growth has been fueled by younger, nonwhite voters, especially in nine metro Atlanta counties, where four out of five new voters were nonwhite, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office. The metro Atlanta area has been hit particularly hard. The nine counties \u2014 Fulton, Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall, Cherokee, Henry and Clayton \u2014 have nearly half of the state's active voters but only 38% of the polling places, according to the analysis. As a result, the average number of voters packed into each polling location in those counties grew by nearly 40%, from about 2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling place as of Oct. 9, the analysis shows. In addition, a last-minute push that opened more than 90 polling places just weeks before the November election has left many voters uncertain about where to vote or how long they might wait to cast a ballot. Voter registrations in nine counties in the metro Atlanta area have jumped sharply, but the number of polling places hasn't kept pace. As a result, those counties have many more voters assigned to each polling place than the state average. The growth in registered voters has outstripped the number of available polling places in both predominantly white and Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S. census data and recent studies. Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that about two-thirds of the polling places that had to stay open late for the June primary to accommodate waiting voters were in majority-Black neighborhoods, even though they made up only about one-third of the state's polling places. An analysis by Stanford University political science professor Jonathan Rodden of the data collected by Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that the average wait time after 7 p.m. across Georgia was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more nonwhite, but only six minutes in polling places that were 90% white. Georgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters for a polling place that has experienced significant voter delays, but that limit is rarely, if ever, enforced. Our analysis found that, in both majority Black and majority white neighborhoods, about nine of every 10 precincts are assigned to polling places with more than 2,000 people. A June 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School found that the average number of voters assigned to a polling place has grown in the past five years in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina \u2014 all states with substantial Black populations that before the Shelby decision needed federal approval to close polling places under the Voting Rights Act. And though dozens of states have regulations on the size of voting precincts and polling places or the number of voting machines, the analysis found that many jurisdictions do not abide by them. Georgia's state leadership and elections officials have largely ignored complaints about poll consolidations even as they tout record growth in voter registration. As secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, when most of Georgia's poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, now the governor, took a laissez-faire attitude toward county-run election practices, save for a 2015 document that spelled out methods officials could use to shutter polling places to show \"how the change can benefit voters and the public interest.\" Kemp's office declined to comment Thursday on the letter or why poll closures went unchallenged by state officials. His spokesperson referred to his previous statements that he did not encourage officials to close polling places but merely offered guidance on how to follow the law. The inaction has left Black voters in Georgia facing barriers reminiscent of Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a political science professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta who has studied the impact of the landmark Shelby decision on Black voters. Voter suppression \"is happening with these voter impediments that are being imposed,\" Jones said. \"You're closing down polling places so people have a more difficult time getting there. You're making vote-by-mail difficult or confusing. Now we're in court arguing about which ballots are going to be accepted, and it means that people have less trust in our state.\" In August, on the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and three Georgia voters sued the state and more than a dozen counties in federal court, alleging that some of the state's most populous areas have disenfranchised voters for more than a decade with long lines caused by inadequate staff, training, equipment and voting locations. The suit, which was dismissed after the judge ruled the parties had no standing to file, warned of upheaval on Nov. 3, Election Day. \"As bad as the situation would be in normal circumstances, the burden is made far worse by the global pandemic,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Absent judicial intervention, Georgia is set for more of the same (and likely far worse than it has ever seen) in November.\" Republican Brad Raffensperger, who took over as secretary of state in January 2019, has called for more resources and polling places, but he has been unable to push these changes through the GOP-controlled legislature. Raffensperger's office blames Democrats and county elections officials for opposing his efforts to improve access. \"As Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger pushed legislation that would force counties to expand polling locations and directly address these issues,\" Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said in an email. \"Unfortunately, every single Democratic Senator and Representative voted against this proposal saying that it would cause 'confusion.' Georgia voters deserve to know who is actually holding back progress and it isn't the Secretary of State's Office.\" Democrats and voting rights groups said they opposed the Raffensperger-backed bill because they believed it weakened state election supervision and made it harder for people to vote. The proposal shifted even more responsibility for elections from the state to counties, \"without the necessary training, funding or support,\" Lauren Groh-Wargo, chief executive of Fair Fight, a voting rights group founded by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, said at the time. A History Of Discrimination Georgia's history of voting violations stretches back more than a century, with poll taxes, literacy and citizenship tests, and intimidation that disenfranchised many Black citizens. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Georgia and eight other states with histories of discrimination were required to seek federal approval before making changes such as eliminating polling places in Black neighborhoods or shifting polling locations at the last minute. Dozens of counties and townships in six more states also had to seek approval. Then in 2013, in a case brought by Shelby County, Ala., the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the method for determining which jurisdictions had to seek approval, saying it was unconstitutional because it was outdated. The court suggested that Congress could pass new guidelines, but lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement, leaving the pre-clearance requirement unenforceable. Jones, the Morehouse professor, said the recent changes would clearly have required federal approval if not for the Shelby decision. \"All of these kinds of exercises ... would have had to be considered by the Department of Justice \u2014 or would not have been suggested because it would have been clear that the Department of Justice would have dinged them,\" she said. \"And part of that has to do with the importance of Black voters, particularly in the Democratic Party.\" Exacerbating Shelby's impact in Georgia was an explosion in voter registrations. Thanks in part to the state's \"motor voter\" law that updates records whenever a voter interacts with the Department of Driver Services, the state's voter rolls have swelled by a third since the 2012 presidential election. In two metro Atlanta counties, Gwinnett and Henry, the voting population shifted from majority white to majority nonwhite, contributing to Georgia's transition from red state to purple. Hundreds of people wait in line for early voting earlier this week in Marietta, Ga. Eager voters have waited six hours or more in the former Republican stronghold of Cobb County, and lines have wrapped around buildings in solidly Democratic DeKalb County.\n                \n                    \n                    Ron Harris/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hundreds of people wait in line for early voting earlier this week in Marietta, Ga. Eager voters have waited six hours or more in the former Republican stronghold of Cobb County, and lines have wrapped around buildings in solidly Democratic DeKalb County. As the number of voters was swelling, county officials across the state began a steady stream of closures of polling locations. By June 2020, Georgia voters had 331 fewer polling places than in November 2012, a 13% reduction. Because of added pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, metro Atlanta alone had lost 82 voting locations by the time June's primary rolled around. Nearly half of the state's 159 counties had closed at least one polling place since 2012. Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, and DeKalb County realigned dozens of precincts after some municipalities were annexed or newly established. Other counties cited changes in voter behavior, or tight budgets, but the Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica analysis found only nominal savings. In Union City, about 20 minutes southwest of Atlanta in Fulton County, the number of active voters has grown about 60% since 2012. Three polls were open for the June primary, with 9,000 voters assigned to the Christian City Welcome Center. Two additional polling places are being set up for Nov. 3, including one that will reduce the burden on the Welcome Center. Three others, however, will still have more than 5,000 voters each. In a September county elections board meeting, Fulton officials said the goal had been to add more polling places in 2020 to accommodate population growth. The coronavirus pandemic resulted in closures or relocations, but most sites have been reopened. Urban Congestion At The Polls The influx of voters meant that already overburdened polling places got even busier. Statewide, the number of voters served by the average polling place rose 47%, from 2,046 voters in 2012 to 3,003 as of Oct. 9, according to the analysis. Some rural counties have as many as 22,000 voters assigned to a single polling place. Forsyth County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, has grown its voter rolls by nearly 60% \u2014 or 60,000 voters \u2014 in the last eight years. Forsyth, a mostly white county about 45 minutes' drive north of Atlanta, now averages about 8,000 voters per polling place. Officials cut nine of its 25 polling places in 2013 and another after the 2016 election but added back five locations in 2019. No additional sites are expected to be opened for the November election. Fulton County added nearly a quarter-million voters while consolidating voting locations. When the coronavirus struck, the last-minute unavailability of two polling places forced the assignment of 16,000 people to vote in June at Park Tavern, a restaurant/event space that reported 350 voters in line before the first vote was cast. Six of Gwinnett County's seven most congested polling places serve predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. In Lawrenceville, home to one of the largest Black populations in the county, a judge ordered polls at the Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources to stay open late during the primary for the nearly 7,000 voters assigned there. It was one of 16 polling locations with missing voting machines on the morning of the primary election. Angela Maddox, a health care worker, cast her ballot there for the Aug. 11 primary runoff, when only local rather than statewide races were on the ballot. She said she was grateful that equipment was in place and low turnout meant no lines. The reports of voters waiting six hours or more in the primary were \"disgusting,\" she said. \"I know it's a big problem and it seems to continuously happen in Black communities,\" she said. \"That's where you tend to see a lot of the machines breaking down, or fewer machines, or any and everything to not count our vote, which is not fair.\" Angela Maddox didn't have to wait to vote in a primary runoff in August in Gwinnett County. She says reports of voters waiting six hours or more in the primary were \"disgusting.\"\n\n                    \n                    Stephen Fowler/Georgia Public Broadcasting\n                    \n                \nhide caption Angela Maddox didn't have to wait to vote in a primary runoff in August in Gwinnett County. She says reports of voters waiting six hours or more in the primary were \"disgusting.\" Gwinnett County officials obtained federal approval in 2010 \u2014 before the Shelby decision \u2014 to reduce the number of polls from 163 to 156, citing cost savings and operational efficiency. Since then, the county has kept the same number of polling places while adding more than 175,000 active voters. The average polling place handled 3,649 voters in the June primary and is set for 3,719 for November. Who's To Blame? Since the Shelby decision, the Georgia State Election Board, chaired by Raffensperger, has been the primary body for investigating and potentially sanctioning counties found to have violated election laws and procedures. But the election board has rarely investigated the sort of violations that the U.S. Department of Justice once stepped in to review under the Voting Rights Act. Since 2010, when Kemp began his eight-year stint as secretary of state, the board has heard hundreds of cases, citing individuals for such violations as wearing political gear to the polls, and rebuking counties for mishandling voter registrations or absentee ballots. But it has taken no action to examine the poll closures that have been approved post-Shelby and has allowed a backlog of dozens of complaints to accumulate. In 2015, Kemp's office sent the letter to county elections officials that included advice on closing polling places. In September, with Georgia in the national spotlight over its handling of elections, the board cleared a backlog of nearly 100 outstanding cases dating back to 2014 and referred several to the attorney general's office for further review. Among those was Fulton County's alleged mishandling of the June primary. The attorney general's office is still investigating. In early October, the secretary of state's office told four counties \u2014 Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett in the metro Atlanta area and Chatham County in southeast Georgia \u2014 that had long lines, absentee ballot problems and late opening or closing polls in the primary to avoid a repeat by providing weekly updates on poll worker training, polling places and line management plans. Besides the board's actions, the Georgia Senate considered a proposal filed in February and endorsed by Raffensperger. It would have required county elections supervisors to add more equipment or poll workers, or split up any precincts with more than 2,000 voters, if there was a wait longer than an hour measured at three points on Election Day. More than 1,500 of Georgia's 2,655 precincts have at least 2,000 voters \u2014 many of them in urban Democratic counties \u2014 and Raffensperger said at the time that voters should never have to wait more than 30 minutes. But the bill, SB 463, was opposed by Democratic lawmakers and voting rights groups, who argued that any revamping in an election year would cause confusion and create more ways to keep people from casting their ballot. \"Do you have any concerns about trying to change the rules of the game in the middle of an election cycle when we have so much litigation that is currently pending with respect to the state's handling of previous elections?\" state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat from Atlanta, asked during the floor debate. The bill originated in the state Senate, which approved it. The proposal then went to a state House of Representatives committee, where Republicans substituted a version that didn't address the polling place issue and barred the secretary of state and county elections officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters. Their redesign never reached a floor vote, eliminating any prospect of legislative changes in the 2020 session, which ended in June. That same month, after the primary election, Raffensperger held a press conference in Fulton County outside Park Tavern, which had processed more voters than 96% of the state's polling places. Flanked by posters highlighting recent election woes, he urged local officials to add poll workers and voting locations while improving technical support and training. \"We know that we need a more diverse pool of voting locations to spread the load of voters that we are anticipating,\" Raffensperger said. Nikema Williams, chair of Georgia's Democratic Party, said that while state officials took little or no action to stop widespread voting problems in nonwhite communities, local elections officials are also responsible, since they ultimately decide whether to close or open more voting sites. \"We added counties as a defendant in the [August] lawsuit because we want to make sure that we're getting this right,\" she said. \"And at the end of the day, what matters to us is that voters are not negatively impacted at any level of the electoral process.\" Although the judge chided Democratic officials for offering vague remedies and failing to provide sufficient evidence that long lines are likely in November, Phi Nguyen, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said there is plenty of evidence in plain sight. Nguyen's organization has challenged a number of Georgia election laws in court, including the \"exact match\" policy that blocks voter registrations that do not exactly match a state or federal database. AAAJA also filed a lawsuit that forced Gwinnett County to change its process for rejecting absentee ballots. She said the metro Atlanta counties' election administrators have not kept up with the wave of newer, more diverse voters, increasing the chances of disenfranchisement. Nguyen was a poll monitor at the Infinite Energy Center arena for the primary and did not leave until the final votes were cast, well after polls closed at 7 p.m. \"Georgia made national news because of the breakdown in our election systems,\" she said. \"Long lines are certainly an issue and they happen more often in under-resourced places, which tend to be where communities of color live.\" Changes Before Election Day Some counties in the metro Atlanta area have tried to increase polling locations before the November election. Just weeks before Nov. 3, Fulton County approved 91 new polling places, focusing on areas where the lines were longest for the June primary. Fourteen polling places \u2014 including two of the four polling places in Union City \u2014 will still have more than 5,000 voters assigned, but that's a sharp drop from the 60 sites that had more than 5,000 voters assigned for the primary election, said Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron. \"If you have fewer people assigned to a polling location, you have fewer people that are going to go to that location,\" he said. \"We had some polling places in June where we had 9,000-17,000 voters assigned to these locations, so what this does is it spreads everyone out amongst many more locations.\" The more than 16,000 primary voters who were assigned to Park Tavern are now split among five polling places, ranging from fewer than 1,500 voters to nearly 5,500. Park Tavern will remain a polling site, with about 4,300 voters. But widespread rejiggering of polling locations just weeks before a presidential election comes with its own risks. A 2018 study of North Carolina voters from Stanford University found that relocating polling places decreases turnout, especially for younger voters. For now, Fulton County officials are hoping for an 80% early voting rate to minimize voter confusion and other problems on Election Day, when the nation's eyes will once again be on Georgia. And they have doubled the election budget to $34 million, purchasing two mobile voting buses as polling sites to alleviate early lines and launching a massive outreach campaign to change voter behavior. There are more than 30 early voting locations, including a mega-voting site at Atlanta's professional basketball arena equipped with 60 check-in computers and 300 voting machines. On the first day of in-person early voting Monday, Oct. 12, officials recorded the second-highest single-day total in recent years. Statewide, a record 128,000 Georgians braved long lines that first day. Still, Kathy in Union City is worried that her vote won't be counted. \"When you look at the systemic issues that plague us as a society, oftentimes we're screaming but we're not being heard,\" she said. \"Historically, we have seen that services and resources for Black communities have always been very inadequate, and this is just an extension of that. ... How could there be such a huge disparity?\" This article is part of Electionland, ProPublica's collaborative reporting project covering problems that prevent eligible voters from casting their ballots during the 2020 elections.",

Donald Trump Read details of Trump's plans below. Biden's criminal justice plan allocates $20 billion toward a grant program geared at promoting crime prevention among state and local governments through programs addressing factors like literacy and child abuse. It incentivizes states to enact programs to reduce incarceration through measures like eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crime. Biden supports the \"immediate\" implementation of the SAFE Justice Act, introduced by Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott, which aligns with many of these policies. If elected, Biden says, he will push the Justice Department to investigate police and prosecutors across the country for questionable actions and misconduct and will create a separate task force on prosecutorial discretion to combat discrimination. Biden would also call on the Justice Department to increasingly focus on prosecuting hate crimes. The plan advocates for an increase in federal funding toward public defenders' offices as well. Biden does not support defunding the police. He has called for police reform and pledged to invest $300 million in programs that build community policing. He also supports establishing a national use of force standard. On drug policing, Biden wants to stop differentiating between crack and cocaine sentences, decriminalize cannabis and legalize it for medicinal purposes. (He notably does not call for federal legalization of recreational cannabis, leaving that to the states.) Biden would also focus on reforming the juvenile justice system, putting $1 billion annually in reforms as well as bettering youth community programs to do away with the \"school to prison pipeline.\" Biden also argues for ending cash bail, the use of private prisons and the death penalty. His plan stresses the importance of supporting formerly incarcerated people by providing guaranteed housing upon finishing a sentence. He also supports increasing access to educational, medical and mental health resources for those currently or formerly incarcerated. When speaking about protests over racial justice and police brutality, Trump has focused on his support for law enforcement and highlighted violent altercations from protesters. After weeks of protests over police brutality this summer, Trump signed an executive order that increased government grants for police departments that implement certain training regarding use of force and established a database that will track acts of police misconduct. Notably, the order does not completely ban the use of chokeholds by police. Instead, it restricts it \"except in those situations where the use of deadly force is allowed by law.\" In 2018, Trump signed the First Step Act, which lowered prison sentences for certain nonviolent offenders. But, for his second term, Trump has called for increasing penalties for anyone who assaults a police officer. Trump is also calling for continuing to require people charged with crimes to pay bail or remain locked up until their trial. Criminal justice reform advocates have called for ending cash bail, arguing that it punishes poor people who have not been convicted of a crime.

The Democrat also has plans for major issues like climate, education, health care, criminal justice and immigration. Biden came into the planned debates with a larger proposed agenda than Trump. And while incumbent presidents often run for reelection with fewer proposals compared with their opponent, Trump's campaign is noticeably light on policy. The Trump campaign has released a bulleted list of second-term agenda items, hammering home similar messages heard in 2016. Trump has also set an ambitious goal of distributing a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021 \u2014 a timeline largely disputed by health experts.",

Unlike Trump, Biden wants to use the full authority of the Defense Production Act to create additional personal protective equipment, which includes masks and face shields. Biden's plan would also increase drive-by testing twofold and calls for the creation of at-home tests and instant tests. He would additionally allocate increased federal aid to state and local governments, schools and local businesses affected by the disease. As for vaccine production, Biden would put $25 billion toward the manufacturing and distribution of an eventual vaccine. He does not explicitly call for a vaccine by a certain date. Biden would also create a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, meant to address the communities disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, an initiative started by his running mate California Sen. Kamala Harris in the Senate. After the pandemic ends, the task force would morph into an Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force. The plan also advocates for a return to Obama-era pandemic response procedures and calls for a repaired relationship with the World Health Organization, from which Trump withdrew in July. Biden pledges to rejoin on Day 1 as president. Trump's campaign has not released a full COVID-19 action plan for his second term, even after the president himself contracted the coronavirus. His agenda for battling the virus centers on having a vaccine widely available by the end of the year. Health experts, including those in the federal government, say that timeline is highly unlikely. Trump has promised that during a second term, he will hold China \"fully accountable\" for the spread of the virus. The White House has pledged to create 300 million doses of a vaccine by January 2021. The plan, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, outlines that \"steps will proceed simultaneously\" as government-funded companies continue with their research and trials of possible vaccines. As a part of this effort to accelerate the process, the government is supporting the development of possible vaccine candidates before they've demonstrated effectiveness \u2014 so that once something is proven to work, distribution could happen more quickly. Trump has also touted his own treatment and has vowed to make the drugs he had widely available, though it is unclear whether or when that could happen. The makers of his therapies have applied for emergency use authorization. Trump has used some of his authority under the Defense Production Act, but critics argue that the federal government should have used the powers of that law more broadly to direct the production of needed medical supplies. The White House has also tasked an interagency committee, led by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, with looking for ways the administration can address the pandemic's disproportionate impact on communities of color.

Donald Trump Read details of Trump's plans below. Biden has laid out a comprehensive plan to address racial disparities within the United States on issues ranging from health to policing, zeroing in on measures to advance economic equality, access to affordable housing, education and a fair criminal justice system. Biden pledges to support minority-owned small businesses by allocating $30 billion \u2014 10% of the $300 billion going toward research and development outlined in his jobs plan \u2014 specifically toward a Small Business Opportunity Fund, which would also leverage private investments. He also plans to invest $50 billion in venture capital specifically for Black and brown entrepreneurs, put $100 billion toward low-interest loans and provide educational and development opportunities for new entrepreneurs and students. Overall, he says, these investments through the fund will bring forward a gain of $150 billion. Biden also advocates for reforming the current Opportunity Zone tax deferral passed under the Trump administration to help distressed communities, assigning the U.S. Department of Treasury to increase supervision over organizations receiving the benefit. To boost homeownership within minority communities, Biden wants to create 1.5 million new homes and public housing units and provide up to $15,000 in tax credits for people buying their first homes. He also calls for an end to discriminatory housing policies, stressing the need to penalize financial institutions perpetuating such policies and outlining policies to strengthen renters' rights and provide more housing vouchers. On education reform, Biden wants to expand student loan forgiveness and make public universities as well as private historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions tuition-free for students with household incomes under $125,000. Trump has not outlined a broad policy plan to address racial inequity. Trump has repeatedly questioned whether systemic racism is a problem in the United States. He argues that his policies have helped Black Americans, in particular, often citing record low Black unemployment before the pandemic hit. Trump says his economic policies will help bring unemployment back to those record lows. On June 11, Trump spoke about a four-step policy geared toward building \"safety and opportunity and dignity.\" He highlighted a need for increased federal support toward minority-owned small businesses and addressed \"health care disparities,\" saying more funding should go toward medical facilities that serve largely nonwhite populations. Trump has also called for expanding Opportunity Zones, a tax deferral for distressed communities passed as part of the 2017 tax bill.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) To some consumers, NPR is the sane alternative to partisan shouting on cable news. For others, NPR is lulling its audience to sleep with reassuring false equivalence. Listeners have long told NPR that they find it appealing because of its approach to news as a story to be told, and the meaning of that story to be discovered. But times change, and there are signs that for NPR (and many other American newsrooms), that philosophy now repels some consumers who are driven to distraction by the lack of outrage. There have been moments in recent weeks, like the coverage of the president's COVID infection, when the NPR-as-a-breath-of-sanity argument has clear advantages. And there are moments, like the coverage of the first presidential debate, when NPR's presentation is so understated that some in the audience feel they've been handed a distorted picture. Within NPR, this is one manifestation of the existential questions confronting American newsrooms, where journalists \u2014 and citizens \u2014 are asking if the traditional tools of storytelling and analysis work in the Trump era. Journalist James Fallows of The Atlantic, a former NPR commentator, recently gave voice to this crisis with the cover story The Media Learned Nothing from 2016. He told me in an interview that he thinks NPR's coverage of national politics embodies this problem, while he finds the coverage of just about every other topic to be stellar. It bothers him so much that he said he recently began avoiding its politics stories. \"With NPR, I feel as if the coverage on everything except contentious national politics is inviting, careful, non-tendentious, but also doesn't waste time saying things that the reporter knows are not true,\" he said. \"NPR shows it has this muscle memory. It is possible to do interesting and also accurate coverage.\" This complaint arises often in the Public Editor's inbox. After comparing NPR coverage of topics that frustrated certain consumers (they sent in their complaints) with coverage that resulted in a mostly satisfied audience (a decided lack of complaining), I've identified two critical components that seem to separate news that annoys from news that satisfies. They are two basic tenets of journalism: tone and accuracy. In applying them to the particular work of NPR, I'd describe them as authority in the spoken delivery, and precision in the description of facts. When it comes to politics, NPR is strongest when journalists use their experience and knowledge to deliver clear observations and frame the story. Conversely, NPR veers toward journalistic impotence when directness is sacrificed in favor of an abundance of caution. When it works As soon as President Trump announced he was infected with COVID, through his release from the hospital four days later, NPR consistently broke new information while continually reinforcing a complex contextual picture. This Web story, \"White House Struggles To Explain, Contain Its Own Spiraling COVID-19 Crisis,\" and this Weekend All Things Considered recap of updates about the questions surrounding the president's treatment timeline, are just two examples of the dozens of stories across every platform that delivered a clear, authoritative narrative about Trump's condition. How did they do it? By taking the scant information coming out of the White House and combining it with the expertise of the reporters on the science desk and their sources, NPR was able to give its audience a more focused, precise view of the president's likely condition. Science reporters provided key questions to political reporters, who worked to nail down facts, like when the president received oxygen and what that might mean. These reports from Science Correspondent Joe Palca paint a picture of a patient's condition who is receiving the drugs the president received. Palca also joined the politics team on a Saturday installment of the NPR Politics podcast. The result was an informed audience that clearly understood that the president was sicker than his staff was letting on. I interviewed three editors and a correspondent about the coverage of the president's COVID infection, and they all agreed that NPR was at its finest because different departments of the newsroom collaborated particularly well. Unlike a purely political story, it helped that there were uncontested facts about the coronavirus and how it makes people sick, and how different medicines help a patient recover. Although partisanship can run through about everything these days, the science and health aspects made it easier for the journalists to identify the core focus of the story and stick with it throughout the weekend. \"The president of the United States, a 74-year-old man, had this infection that had killed a lot of people, especially people in his age group,\" said Managing Editor for News Terence Samuel. \"We did a lot of the politics, but it really was kind of a first principles kind of approach.\" Joe Neel, deputy senior supervising editor on the science desk, said there was a natural discussion about whether to lead with the politics or the science. From the White House, the flow of information was sparse. But it contained enough treatment details that the science desk could step in and challenge the rosy narrative. \"We went back and forth about it,\" Neel said. \"It's the Washington desk. No, it's our desk.\" Because the editors agreed about exactly what the story was and how to tell it, NPR gave its audience enough information to be informed, enough accountability to judge the details coming out of the White House, and some idea of next steps. It didn't fall into the trap of endless (or reckless) speculation. And it didn't give those trying to paint a factually incorrect reality undo sway. When it doesn't work By comparison, just before President Trump got sick, he debated his opponent Joe Biden. But there was wide consensus that it wasn't a debate at all, it was Trump being preposterous, petulant and a narcissistic bully, and Biden responding the way most adults without training in child psychology would respond. In the live blog that accompanied the debate, a succession of headlines hint at Trump's absurdity (\"Portland Sheriff' Does Not Support Trump, Racial Sensitivity Training Is Not Racist\"), yet never clearly describe the alarming nature of the evening. In the post-debate show that night, host Ari Shapiro started off by saying, \"It was one of the shouty-est, most chaotic debates in modern history. Right from the start the gloves were off.\" He's not wrong, but not accurate either. The passive construction of the sentence suggests equal responsibility for both candidates. Depending on which NPR product they got, audience backlash was swift. The less authoritative the presentation, the more the audience cried foul \u2014 complaining of false equivalence. On Twitter, Susan Hatch pointed out, \"Regarding the @npr post-debate postmortem, @arishapiro said \"they\" were fighting with the moderator. Biden didn't fight with the moderator. The both-siding your reporters do is offensive.\" The headline on the daily NPR News newsletter was equally distorted in its evenhanded tone: \"Debate Chaos In Cleveland.\" So was the headline on the NPR Politics podcast the next morning, which read, \"Debate: Trump Refuses To Condemn White Supremacy, Biden Pitches Directly To Camera.\" It's a classic debate reporting technique, but not appropriate for that particular debate. A daily politics podcast is exactly the place where the audience tolerates more expert insight and analysis, and NPR has more room to speak with definitive authority. Compare competitor FiveThirtyEight Politics' choice for a headline: \"Trump Interrupts To Point Of Chaos In First Debate.\" On Up First and Morning Edition the next morning, host Rachel Martin begins with, \"The instant reaction to last night's presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden from a whole lot of people was disgust.\" Host David Greene follows up with, \"Yet, despite moderator Chris Wallace's warnings, debate decorum was replaced with interruptions and a whole lot of schoolyard name-calling.\" After playing a montage of three Trump insults and four Biden insults, Martin pitches to National Political Correspondent Mara Liasson, who says, \"There was so much shouting, so many interruptions, mostly from the president, I think many voters probably longed for a commercial break.\" NPR's Live Specials Lead, Eric Marrapodi, who was in charge of the after-debate show, explained how the questions are written for the host. \"We wrote the introductions and questions factually correct and economical because we wanted to get to the why and not dwell on the what, since the audience had just heard the debate,\" he said. \"Our game plan going in was to spend as much time as possible on fact checking and analysis. We had long planned for the host to start with Mara Liasson ... the first thing she said was there were lots of interruptions, but Trump was the instigator.\" While on the air and on podcasts, the coverage of the first debate was mired in a stubborn attachment to presenting both sides equally, a column by Senior Political Editor and Correspondent Domenico Montanaro captured the night perfectly with this headline: Trump Derails 1st Presidential Debate With Biden And 5 Other Takeaways. He followed up with this piece of prose: \"If this was supposed to be a boxing match, it instead turned into Trump jumping on the ropes, refusing to come down, the referee trying to coax him off and Biden standing in the middle of the ring with his gloves on and a confused look on his face.\" Why wasn't that on the air? \"Domenico is a senior political editor and correspondent who has a lot of experience covering politics and presidential debates,\" Chief Washington Editor Shirley Henry said. \"He watched the debate and talked through his takeaways at length with a politics editor, who prior to that had also discussed with other Washington Desk editors whether there were any points potentially worth including in Domenico's story.\" The force of this column was noted by several NPR consumers, including the Twitter user who tweeted, \"NPR was far more accurate in its headline than other news outlets. Enough of this false equivalency.\" It was also the single most viewed story on NPR's website Wednesday, the day after the debate. NPR's choices As a national news outlet that reaches over 60 million citizens every week, NPR is more than a single newsmagazine show or podcast or website. It is the sum of all of those products, and yet each are not equal in weight. The newsmagazine shows, Morning Edition and All Things Considered, continue to be the ballast that defines NPR. Those shows are meant to be a journey of news discovery, guided by a host who asks questions that are then answered by reported stories, expert reporters and news sources. \"The host's job is to lay out what happened, illustrate it with the tape and then talk it through with reporters,\" said Morning Edition executive producer Kenya Young. Vice President for News Programming Sarah Gilbert added: \"Hosts are necessarily focused on setting the stage for an engaging conversation, a natural arc of discovery ... It's not a host's role at this network to lead off with a conclusion and expect everyone in the 'room' to confirm or echo it.\" It's important to note that this approach to news does not inevitably lead to less precise storytelling. However, it does take a significantly higher level of expertise and verbal acuity to deliver an exacting report. For the NPR style of news delivery to remain effective, the news shows must achieve the near perfection in clarity and precision demonstrated by the reporting on Trump's COVID infection and medical treatment. When hosts ease into a conversation with a neutral question or setup, then the reporter must next deliver definitive facts and the best insight possible. I asked every person who I interviewed for this column how individual NPR journalists develop that particular muscle. There is training and coaching for that, they all said. And, many added, NPR should probably do more of that training. And while it is doing all that it can to ensure that every story hits the mark, NPR must continue to experiment and evolve the voice and tone of the newer products that are rapidly gaining audience. For NPR to stay relevant, useful and competitive while preserving the core value that news is a journey of discovery, every story and every two-way has to be spot-on. Slight misses cause disproportionate harm, because the stakes for America are so high. In this polarized environment, where we are jumping from emergency to emergency, that's a mighty high goal for the spoken word, much of it delivered live. (It's a lot easier to write things down.) But that's the mission.",

Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on voting rights during Wednesday's confirmation hearing. Democrats are litigating Judge Amy Coney Barrett's record and outlook on voting as the Senate Judiciary Committee wraps up her three days in the spotlight this week. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said she worried about Barrett's longtime closeness with Justice Antonin Scalia in view of Scalia's antipathy toward the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court partly dismantled in a 2013 ruling. Feinstein asked Barrett about Scalia's criticism about sustained support for the Voting Rights Act, which Feinstein said he attributed to the \"perpetuation of racial entitlement.\" Barrett sought to clarify that she isn't Scalia's doppelganger \u2014 she said she shares his underlying philosophy but she wouldn't simply be a carbon copy of him on the Supreme Court. And she returned to her stock response in addressing the substance of Feinstein's question: that she won't opine about precedents or cases in view of her need to address them clean when she's on the bench. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois returned to voting rights questions during his portion of the morning on Wednesday by returning to a case Barrett handled on the appeals court. She wrote that a man involved who had been convicted of a crime should have his right restored to own a gun but not to vote, as Durbin described the situation. \"You made a distinction there that is hard to understand and difficult to explain,\" Durbin said. (Read more about that case and Barrett's record on guns here.) Democrats can't stop Barrett from being confirmed because Republicans have enough votes on their own, so Democrats have been raising criticism about what they call Barrett's political closeness to President Trump in view of Trump's comments expecting his election to be resolved by the Supreme Court. For Durbin, Feinstein and the others, Barrett's record and her views make her dangerous to the expansion of voting access that Democrats have made central to their political brand in recent years. The judge has tried to defend herself within the parameters of the limited answers she's willing to give, and on Wednesday she told Durbin he was getting it wrong: \"I've testified here that I believe voting is a fundamental right,\" Barrett said. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas further defended Barrett in his questioning period \u2014 arguing that in the case Durbin cited, Barrett was simply following the Constitution on the rights to vote and to bear arms.",

He says he resolved to run after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. Pledging to recover \"the soul of America\" from the polarizing Trump era, the 77-year-old white man won the Democratic nomination with the endorsements of many Black lawmakers and strong backing from Black voters. He has a unique place in American politics, both for serving as the running mate of the first Black president, and for choosing as his own running mate the first woman of color on a national ticket. In September's presidential debate, he called President Trump a \"racist\" who uses \"dog-whistle\" language. Trump, who insisted in the same debate that racial sensitivity training is itself \"racist,\" launched his campaign in 2015 with an attack on Mexicans as \"rapists,\" his way of promoting the immigration policies he has pursued ever since. He called for banning Muslims from entering the United States, told American lawmakers who are not white to \"go back\" where they came from, and defended Confederate statues. Yet in the debate, Trump managed to question his opponent's views on race by digging into Biden's past. \"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators \u2014 African-Americans are super predators \u2014 and they've never forgotten it,\" Trump said. The legislation said no such thing; it was Hillary Clinton who used the phrase \"super predators\" in the 1990s, and later apologized. But Biden was an architect of crime legislation in 1994, widely criticized today for disproportionate harm to people of color. It's part of a record on race that is as long as Biden's half-century political career.

As a young man he had a formative experience, traveling from his family's white neighborhood to a Black area to work as a lifeguard at a swimming pool. It's now named after him. As a young lawyer with political ambitions, he sometimes joined civil rights protests.

Biden Jr. Aquatic Center in Burton Brown Winchester Park in Wilmington, Del. It was renamed after former Vice President Joe Biden in 2017. The kind of role he played comes through in the stories of Bebe Coker, an activist affiliated with the NAACP, who befriended him in the early 1970s. She recalls him driving up to a protest, though \"he never had his own protest sign,\" and had to borrow one. He deepened his connection to the Black community with visits to Delaware State College (now a university), a historically Black institution. Tony Allen, a former Biden speechwriter who is now the university president, says Biden \"spent a lot of time here in the early years of his political career just engaging with faculty, staff and students. ... He wanted to get to know us and make sure that we knew him.\" Biden's visits appear to be what he was referring to when, in a 2019 campaign speech, he declared that \"I got started\" at Delaware State.   A conservative news outlet later used the remark to suggest Biden had claimed that he attended the school. Trump turned that into a taunt in the September debate: \"You forgot the name of your college,\" the president said.

Biden's early interest in diversity did not prevent him from parting ways with the mainstream civil rights movement on a major issue. After his election to the Senate in 1972, he became a critic of desegregating schools through busing. The Supreme Court had outlawed segregated schools with its Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. The struggle to enforce it started in the Deep South, and later moved north \u2014 where schools weren't legally segregated but neighborhoods, and thus neighborhood schools, were effectively so. Starting in the 1970s, judges ordered busing as a remedy, sending Black students to white-dominated schools, and sometimes the reverse. Historian Matthew Delmont, author of Why Busing Failed, says white residents resisted even in cities known for liberal politics. \"It was a classic liberal position to say, 'I'm in favor of school integration in Little Rock or Montgomery and Selma, but not so much in Boston, Chicago, New York or Wilmington.' \" Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., speaks to the press on Oct. 9, 1979.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Harrity/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Delmont says some white parents objected out of overt racism. Others knew historically Black and Latino schools were starved for resources. Biden became a leader among liberal lawmakers who tried for years to craft legislation limiting judicial authority to order busing. He even talked of amending the Constitution. He said busing wasn't working, and liberals should admit this even if it aligned them uncomfortably with \"the racists\" who resisted integration in the South. \"There is academic ferment against it,\" he said in a 1975 NPR interview. \"There are young Blacks and young white leaders against it. There is social unrest which highlights it.\" His stance drew criticism from the only Black senator at the time, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts. \"He can be against busing,\" Brooke said, \"but can he be against the Constitution?\" Studies eventually showed busing helped Black students without harming white students. But it never grew popular among white voters, and the Biden campaign referred NPR to Black supporters in Wilmington who also opposed it. Delaware State President Allen, born in 1970, said he was bussed for years and is skeptical of the concept. \"The notion that you can simply put a Black kid with a white kid, and somehow that will make the Black kid perform better, says something about what you think of the Black kid.\" Activist Coker says she was part of \"a very small group that opposed busing.\" She urged Biden instead to support fair housing laws, since integrated neighborhoods would produce integrated schools. He did. Historian Delmont says Biden was \"right\" to focus on housing, but \"you can't say you're in favor of housing integration and not also be fighting for school integration at the same time.\" In a presidential debate in 2019, Biden encountered a starkly critical perspective. Sen. Kamala Harris, his future running mate, said that as a child she had been part of the second class to integrate a school in California. She pressed Biden: \"Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America?\" Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden listens as Sen.

Today, integration by busing has largely faded. The Obama administration tried a more subtle approach: offering school districts grants to support their voluntary efforts at diversity. But many schools are still effectively segregated. Should Biden become president, he would confront some version of the problem that many cities faced in the 1970s. 'He did call it the Biden crime bill' Before Trump attacked the 1994 crime bill, Biden's fellow Democrats did. In a primary debate, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey blamed it for increasing the number of Black people behind bars. The legislation \u2014 formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \u2014 came in an era of soaring crime nationwide; in 1990, for example, New York City set a record with more than 2,000 murders in a single year. By 1994, the crime rate was dropping but still high. And Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, declared that \"my wife, mother, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, me and everyone else in America are literally changing their lifestyle.\" His legislative response was a collection of proposals by different authors, assembled in an election year and reflecting clashing approaches to crime. It included an assault weapons ban and money for social programs and crime prevention. Biden supported protections for women \u2014 known as the Violence Against Women Act \u2014 tucked into the crime bill.

But Clinton also supported a populist provision called \"three strikes you're out,\" directing that any person convicted of three crimes of certain kinds would be imprisoned for life. It was one of several punitive provisions. The bill created new federal crimes and expanded the number of crimes to which the death penalty applied. Researcher Inimai Chettiar of the Justice Action Network says the bill did something more harmful: it offered billions to states to build more prisons. Biden's defenders say he was skeptical of prison spending, but he took ownership of the legislation. \"He did call it the Biden crime bill,\" Chettiar says. Though one provision made it easier to release nonviolent drug offenders, the overall bill reinforced a longstanding trend toward incarceration. The U.S. prison population, already high in 1994, continued growing until it peaked at 1.6 million people in 2009. Then as now, people imprisoned in America are disproportionately Black.

But Chettiar, whose group pushes to reduce the prison population, credits factors other than prisons: economic growth, demographic change and better policing. Imprisonment, she says, may \"increase that person's likelihood of committing another crime upon release. We don't do a very good job at all of helping people get back on their feet.\" Biden's defenders note that many Black lawmakers supported the measure at the time. \"I voted for that crime bill,\" says Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, whose endorsement boosted Biden days before his state's vital 2020 Democratic primary. But he acknowledges the bill had \"unintended consequences.\" In recent years a bipartisan consensus has concluded that imprisonment went too far. The Obama administration offered clemency to some offenders. In 2018, even Trump, better known for demanding the death penalty for five innocent Black suspects in New York, signed sentencing reduction legislation. And while the 1994 crime bill offered states money to build prisons, Biden's 2020 crime plan proposes offering states money for alternatives to prison.

In his early career, he built pragmatic relationships with Southern segregationists who were among the most powerful figures in the Senate. In 1991, he presided over a famously uncomfortable spectacle. He chaired the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, a Black man accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, a Black woman. Biden's all-white, all-male Judiciary Committee sat in judgment during the televised confrontation. He later recruited Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman in the Senate, to join the committee. But as the years passed, he was criticized for jarring remarks on race, as in 2006 when he was recorded saying, \"You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.\" He was even accused of patronizing Obama in 2007 by describing him as a \"clean and bright and articulate\" Black man. When he accepted Obama's offer in 2008, perceptions of Biden changed. His friend Bebe Coker, the NAACP activist in Wilmington, says she was moved by his decision because \"I've never known any white male that would take second place to a Black man.\" Sen.

As the New York Times put it earlier this year, \"Obama was deeply worried about a backlash against a Black man at the top of the ticket, and believed that an older white running mate would ease fears in battleground states.\" Biden was soon campaigning on his white working-class roots in Scranton, in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Obama and Biden twice won Pennsylvania, along with other Rust Belt states. In 2020, Biden stands at the head of a diverse coalition, in an ever more diverse nation, and has chosen the first woman of color to be a vice presidential running mate. But part of his task is still reassuring the white majority. Trump has appealed to \"suburban housewives\" using old racist code, claiming that under Biden, \"low-income housing\" would \"destroy our suburbs.\" Biden tells white voters they have nothing to fear. At a campaign stop in Johnstown, Pa., early this month, Biden made it explicit. \"A lot of white, working-class Democrats thought we forgot them and didn't pay attention,\" he said. \"I want them to know \u2014 I mean sincerely \u2014 that I'm going to be your president.\" Jeevika Verma and Reena Advani produced and edited the broadcast versions of this story.",

Following the arrest of 13 people who plotted to kidnap the governor of Michigan and instigate a civil war, the state's attorney general warns American extremist ideology is on the rise \u2014 spurred in part, she says, by President Trump. Early reports of the thwarted plan suggested members of two militia groups, including one called the Wolverine Watchmen, were behind the conspiracy to violently overthrow the state government, abduct Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before next month's election and put her on trial for treason. But in an interview with NPR, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said multiple white supremacist and anti-government groups acted \"in concert based on a shared extreme ideology.\" Nessel on Thursday announced state charges against seven people related to the bizarre plan. They are all under arrest and accused of 19 state felonies, ranging from providing material support for terrorist acts to gang membership, among others. A joint task force investigation lasting several months culminated in the arrest of  Paul Bellar, 21,  Sean Fix, 38, Eric Molitor, 36,  Michael Null, 38,  William Null, 38, Peter Musico, 42, and  Joseph Morrison, 42. The FBI, which says the men began planning as early as June, charged another six individuals, who, according to a 15-page criminal complaint, tracked down the governor's vacation home and began building bombs. \"The people that we charged are affiliated with this Wolverine Watchmen group,\" Nessel said, adding that it is a Michigan-based group. \"But there are multiple white supremacy groups and militia groups that have been acting in accordance with one another.\" Investigators found the men's mission is what white supremacist groups call \"the Boogaloo,\" which Nessel described as an uprising or a second civil war. \"This effort to have a mass uprising nationally is something that we should be very concerned about because, again, it's not just a Michigan problem, this is an American problem.\" Gov.

Part of the recruitment effort took place during a protest at the state capitol over the summer where militia members stood on the steps holding guns and rifles. \"I think that those protests were used actually as recruiting stations to add more members and to find people that were angry with the governor, angry with the government, and frankly, I think encouraged by the words of our president,\" Nessel said. Individuals arrested in connection with the plot to kidnap the governor also schemed to overtake the state capitol and potentially kill a number of public officials there, and threatened to execute members of law enforcement, she said.",

Kamala Harris responds to Vice President Pence during Wednesday's debate in Salt Lake City. President Trump referred to California Sen. Kamala Harris as \"this monster\" in an interview on Thursday, a continuation of his pattern of attacking Black women with demeaning insults. The president has previously reserved the term \"monster\" for terrorists, murders and major natural disasters. Trump's verbal onslaught came the morning after Harris and Vice President Pence met for the vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City. It drew outsized attention as Trump continues to recover from COVID-19. In a telephone interview on Thursday morning on the Fox Business Channel, Trump referred to Harris as \"this monster that was onstage with Mike Pence, who destroyed her last night, by the way.\" \"I thought that wasn't even a contest last night. She was terrible. I don't think you could get worse,\" he added. \"And totally unlikeable. And she is.\" Trump's comments came in the final sprint of an election season dominated by the coronavirus and as the candidates are sparring over the format for future debates. And they landed during an election season in which Trump is facing a wall of opposition from female voters. Speaking to reporters in Arizona, Harris declined to comment, other than to call Trump's remarks \"childish.\" But Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did respond, calling the comments \"despicable\" and \"so beneath the office of the presidency.\" \"It's obvious he has great difficulty dealing with strong women, great difficulty,\" Biden added, as he praised Harris' debate performance. Kelly Dittmar, with the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said these types of attacks are similar to the approach that Trump took in 2016 when engaging with or attacking women who challenge his power or the power of those around him. \"When he does this, he's also speaking to a contingent of voters, particularly white male voters, who support him and who are key to his base, who we know from multiple studies done on the last election that their levels of both sexism and racial resentment were actually pretty strong indicators of their support for Trump,\" she said. The president has a history of ridiculing and denigrating political opponents, often by the use of nicknames. But when speaking about women and particularly women of color, Trump's comments take on a different tone. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement that Harris would join the ticket, Trump described her as \"nasty,\" a term he often uses for his female opponents. He described her questioning of Brett Kavanaugh as disrespectful during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and he has amplified false and racist conspiracy birther theories aimed at the senator, a Black woman who is the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica. \"Calling her monstrous is really an attempt to dehumanize her, it's an attempt to diminish her, and it's obviously an attempt to dredge up long-held tropes and stereotypes about black women being out of control, being mean and angry,\" said Adrianne Shropshire who leads the group BlackPAC, which works to mobilize African American voters. Trump has also engaged in high-profile confrontations with other women of color, including the four Democratic congresswomen of color sometimes referred to as \"the squad.\" Last year, the president said that Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts should \"go back\" to the countries they came from. He has called Rep. Maxine Waters of California a \"low-IQ individual.\" He has clashed with female reporters of color and called a former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman \"that dog\" and a \"crazed, crying lowlife.\" \"I think it is shocking and not surprising, and that's awful coming from the president of the United States\" said Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications at EMILY's List, of Trump's comments about Harris. \"I think he very much wants to run against Kamala Harris, because he believes that he can do to her probably more than what he did to Hillary Clinton. It's him playing to his basest instincts.\" Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, said these types of gendered attacks are often directed toward female candidates because it calls their likeability into question. \"We know from our research that likeability is a non-negotiable for women candidates \u2014 voters say they will not vote for a woman they do not like, but they will vote for a man they do not like,\" Hunter said. The challenge there, though, is that voters often have trouble explaining what being \"likeable\" means to them. And the notion itself is ripe with gendered expectations. Tina Tchen, the president and CEO of TIME'S UP Now, has been frustrated by seeing Harris fall victim to attacks that she says have nothing to do with the substance. \"Regardless of what you may think about her positions on policies, I think people recognize this is an accomplished, experienced woman of color who deserves the historic place that she is in right now,\" Tchen, who previously served as first lady Michelle Obama's chief of staff, said. \"To attack her, you know, with these kinds of ad hominem just so sexist and racist and misogynistic attacks, we have seen some vicious attacks against her that have nothing to do with her qualifications or the positions on issues.\" Tchen and other leaders have started an effort to put pressure on media outlets to avoid racist and sexist tropes in coverage of Harris and other women seeking office. Shropshire described Harris as a \"clear\" and \"focused\" debater who effectively countered repeated interruptions from Pence. \"She was firm, but not in a way that falls into people's stereotypes,\" Shropshire said, noting that if Harris was not in \"complete and utter control\" of herself she would fall victim to long-dated racist tropes and stereotypes about black women who are often unfairly denigrated as \"angry.\" \"She's not allowed to do what Joe Biden did on the debate stage and tell Donald Trump to shut up,\" Shropshire said. That was a reference to the moment during the first presidential debate when, less than 20 minutes into the proceedings, Biden turned to Trump and asked, \"Will you shut up, man?\" \"Imagine if she had,\" Shropshire said of Harris. \"The ridiculousness that we would have seen, not only from the Republican Party, but others as well. They would have declared that she was hysterical, that she was rude. It would have come from all sectors.\"",

Updated at 9:51 p.m. ET Democrats on Thursday made it clear they felt President Trump was at least in part to blame for an alleged scheme to kidnap the governor of Michigan, citing the president's divisive rhetoric that has often found support among white supremacists and other hate groups. The FBI said it had foiled a plot by militia members to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and take her to a secure location in Wisconsin for \"trial.\" Six men have been arrested and are facing federal charges. In a coordinated move, seven more people with ties to a far-right militia group are facing state charges in Michigan pursuant to the state's anti-terrorism act. In a Thursday press conference, Whitmer thanked law enforcement for their efforts to bring \"these sick and depraved men to justice.\" She also pointed to language by the president, particularly Trump's recent refusals to condemn white supremacists, as inciting this sort of political violence. \"Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups, like these two Michigan militia groups. 'Stand back and stand by,' he told them. 'Stand back and stand by.' Hate groups heard the president's words not as a rebuke but as a rallying cry, as a call to action,\" she said. Whitmer was referring to one of Trump's responses in the Sept. 29 presidential debate in which he declined to condemn white supremacy. After days of criticism, he did condemn white supremacist groups in a TV interview. There was not any evidence that those involved in the alleged kidnapping plot were motivated by Trump, but Whitmer accused the president of legitimizing the actions of violent hate groups through his rhetoric. \"When our leader speaks, their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet with, encourage, or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions, and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.\" On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted praise for the Justice Department for its work in thwarting the alleged plot. \"I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence,\" he said. \"Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President!\" ...I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer\u2014open up your state, open up your schools, and open up your churches! White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday accused Whitmer of \"sowing division\" in her remarks. \"President Trump has continually condemned white supremacists and all forms of hate. Gov. Whitmer is sowing division by making these outlandish allegations. America stands united against hate and in support of our federal law enforcement who stopped this plot,\" McEnany said. Whitmer and Trump have been frequent critics of one another in recent months, sparring over the coronavirus crisis and how best to resolve it. In April, protesters frustrated with Whitmer's stay-at-home order, some armed, entered the state Senate gallery and tried to access the House chambers. The next day, Trump said Whitmer should \"give a little\" and that the protesters \"are very good people, but they are angry.\" The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal. Earlier in the month, he tweeted \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN,\" along with other states \u2014 an apparent opposition to governors' stay-at-home orders. LIBERATE MICHIGAN! Former Vice President Joe Biden, who hopes to unseat Trump in the Nov. 3 general election, also sought to connect the president's rhetoric to domestic terrorism. \"White supremacists and these militias are a genuine threat. I've got to compliment the FBI and the police agencies for what they did and how they stepped up. But look, the words of a president matter,\" Biden said. \"They can cause a nation to have the market rise or fall, go to war or bring peace. But they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger. And I just think it's got to stop. The president has to realize the words he utters matter.\" Biden said both he and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, had spoken to Whitmer about the incident.",

Gretchen Whitmer, shown here last month, was allegedly a target of a militia's kidnapping plot.\n                \n                    \n                    Michigan Governor's Office via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, shown here last month, was allegedly a target of a militia's kidnapping plot. Updated at 7:06 p.m. ET The FBI says it has thwarted a plot by militia members to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and six people are facing federal charges. In a coordinated move, Michigan is pursuing state felony charges against seven people with ties to a militia called the Wolverine Watchmen. In a statement early Thursday, Whitmer said two militia groups \"were preparing to kidnap and possibly kill me.\" But in a later interview on NPR's All Things Considered, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said that \"multiple white supremacy groups and militia groups have been acting in accordance with one another.\" Whitmer thanked law enforcement officer on Thursday afternoon for foiling the alleged conspiracy. \"I'll be honest, I never could have imagined anything like this,\" she said. Michigan has been a hot spot for disagreements over shutdowns and other restrictions Whitmer ordered to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 actions that allegedly sparked the plot against her. The governor noted those disagreements on Thursday and called for unity. \"We are not one another's enemy,\" Whitmer said. \"This virus is our enemy.\" Criticizing President Trump's recent remarks on white supremacists, Whitmer said his widely condemned \"stand back and stand by\" comment about the Proud Boys was taken by hate groups as a rallying cry, not a rebuke. \"Let me say this loud and clear: Hatred, bigotry and violence have no place in the great state of Michigan,\" Whitmer said. The FBI said the Michigan militia group had already been on its radar because its members had attempted in March to acquire the home addresses of local law enforcement officers with the goal of attacking or killing them. The agency said it collected information about the kidnapping plot from informants and undercover agents. Over the summer, the conspirators allegedly began training for a potential attack on Whitmer's vacation home or the governor's official summer residence, according to a criminal complaint released Thursday. A federal charge of conspiracy to commit kidnapping has been filed against six people: Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. All are Michigan residents except for Croft, who is a resident of Delaware. Fox discussed the kidnapping in a recording from late July, the complaint says: \"Snatch and grab, man. Grab the f*****' Governor. Just grab the b****. Because at that point, we do that, dude \u2014 it's over.\" After abducting Whitmer, Fox allegedly said, the governor would be taken to a secure location in Wisconsin for \"trial,\" according to the complaint. In addition to the six people facing federal charges, state charges have been lodged against another seven who are either members of Wolverine Watchmen or are associates of that militia, the state attorney general said. They're now facing 19 state felony charges that range from gang membership and providing material support for terrorist acts to charges of carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony. \"There has been a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,\" Nessel said on Thursday. \"These groups often seek to recruit new members by seizing on a moment of civil unrest and using it to advance their agenda of self-reliance and armed resistance. This is more than just political disagreement or passionate advocacy, some of these groups' mission is simply to create chaos and inflict harm upon others.\" Michigan's Capitol in Lansing was the epicenter of dramatic protests during the spring and summer, with demonstrators \u2014 including many who carried rifles \u2014 gathering to denounce the governor's coronavirus emergency orders. Whitmer and other officials were also the targets of online threats. \"We have legislators who are showing up to work wearing bulletproof vests,\" Whitmer said in May. The alleged plot against the governor included a range of complicated details, including purchasing a Taser and spending around $4,000 to buy explosives to blow up a bridge leading to Whitmer's vacation home, according to the criminal complaint. Repeatedly, the men involved discussed their desire to kidnap the governor before the national election on Nov. 3, the complaint says. The alleged kidnapping conspiracy is described in the complaint signed by FBI Special Agent Richard J. Trask, whose past work includes fighting domestic terrorism. \"In early 2020, the FBI became aware through social media that a group of individuals were discussing the violent overthrow of certain government and law-enforcement components,\" Trask says in the complaint. The group included Fox and Croft \u2013 who decided they should get others to join their cause and \"take violent action against multiple state governments that they believe are violating the U.S. Constitution,\" Trask says. In early June, Fox and Croft met with around 13 people in Dublin, Ohio, the complaint says. \"The group talked about creating a society that followed the U.S. Bill of Rights and where they could be self-sufficient. They discussed different ways of achieving this goal from peaceful endeavors to violent actions,\" the complaint says. \"At one point, several members talked about state governments they believed were violating the U.S. Constitution, including the government of Michigan and Whitmer. Several members talked about murdering 'tyrants' or 'taking' a sitting governor.\" Once again, the decision was made to recruit others into the effort, Trask says in the complaint. That's when Fox reached out to a Michigan-based militia group, he adds. One of the group's members had already been in touch with the FBI over concerns about plans to target and kill police officers. With a new conspiracy allegedly taking shape, that person agreed to become an informant, the complaint says. Agents were able to record or otherwise monitor many interactions \u2014 including a meeting where Fox confiscated cellphones and put them in a box \u2014 but one participant was wearing a recording device.",

            "article_content": "A week after the first presidential debate, Democratic nominee Joe Biden appears to be pivoting to his closing argument. On Tuesday, Biden gave remarks in Gettysburg, Pa.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Joe Biden appears to be pivoting to a closing argument. As President Trump battles the coronavirus infection and after a panned debate performance, his Democratic opponent was in Gettysburg, Pa., today. There, Biden tried to frame his campaign in the context of American history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Today, once again, we are a house divided. But that, my friends, can no longer be. CHANG: Correspondent Scott Detrow covers the Biden campaign and joins us now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good afternoon, Ailsa. CHANG: All right, so I'm trying to visualize this. Biden was out there speaking, overlooking this Civil War battlefield. What do you think he was trying to do with this setting? DETROW: Biden's been running on a lot of different policy plans, but they all really play second fiddle to the main theme of his campaign - that he's trying to, as he puts it, restore the soul of America. So he went to this historic place, the site of one of - not only one of the key battles of the Civil War but also where Abraham Lincoln reframed the idea of American democracy in the Gettysburg Address. And Biden spoke directly to voters that he thinks are just tired of division and worried about how tensions keep getting amped up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather, they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare. DETROW: And Biden went on to repeat a promise that he has made throughout the campaign that if he wins, he will be a president for the entire country, not just the people who voted for him. And though he did not say it out loud, that is a clear contrast to how President Trump governs and campaigns. CHANG: So let me understand this. Would you say that this promise that he's making is more a promise about tone? DETROW: You know, a large part of it is. Biden insists that there are ways to disagree on the path forward without making politics all about personal destruction and us versus them. But he did also make sure to work the major policy themes of this year and this campaign into this message. So he talked about racial justice, policies that help poor and middle-class people. I think this was clearly a moment the campaign thinks that he can reframe all of its goals into one final big, sweeping pitch to voters. CHANG: All right. And then that big, sweeping pitch - can you talk about some other closing arguments that we're hearing from other Democrats right now? DETROW: Yeah. Earlier today Michelle Obama released a 24-minute video speech. And she had clearly worked on it for a long time, but it was especially striking viewed in the aftermath of President Trump yesterday, still sick but dramatically taking off his mask as he returned to the White House and telling people not to be worried about the pandemic. Here's what Obama said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE OBAMA: If you are a parent like me, you're feeling the consequences of this president's failure to take this pandemic seriously. DETROW: And Obama had a lot of very specific examples in the speech about how the pandemic has strained and endangered families, and she summed it up with this line. It's a simple choice, really - a chance for a fresh start or four more years of this. And though a lot of nervous Democrats may not want to hear this, the fact is Joe Biden is in a very good place right now. Poll after poll shows Biden with increasingly commanding national leads, leads in key states. And all of this enthusiasm from Democrats and urgency is giving him almost unlimited money to make his case. And as one example, the Biden campaign is now reportedly spending nearly $6 million in Texas. So President Trump clearly sees this happening. He says he's very eager to get back on the campaign trail and have that next debate even though he's still fighting coronavirus himself. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Detrow. Thank you, Scott. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Updated at 5:55 p.m. ET Joe Biden, who's long critiqued President Trump as a voice of division and a uniquely dangerous threat to American values, appears to be sketching out a final, unifying message to voters with four weeks left in the 2020 presidential campaign. Speaking Tuesday afternoon overlooking the battlefield where Union soldiers tilted the tide of the Civil War in Gettysburg, Pa., the Democratic nominee tried to frame his call for unity within the arc of American history. \"Today, once again, we are a house divided,\" Biden said, echoing the words of President Abraham Lincoln. \"But that, my friends, can no longer be.\" He went on: \"As I look across America today, I'm concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope is elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for the mediation of our differences. Rather, they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare. Instead of treating the other party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end.\" Biden went on to repeat a promise he makes in nearly every campaign speech: that if he wins, he'll govern for all Americans, not just his base of supporters. While Biden didn't mention Trump by name, the contrast was clear. The remarks came as Trump's polling continues to crater following a much-criticized debate performance and amid his decision to continue minimizing the threat of the coronavirus despite being hospitalized himself with COVID-19. Much of Biden's speech was about tone and discourse, but he also referenced broad policy goals he's campaigning on, including a call for racial justice and police reforms as well as economic policies aimed at poor and middle-class Americans. Since he launched his presidential campaign in April 2019, Biden has repeatedly returned to the idea of a \"battle for the soul of America.\" Tuesday's speech was a clear effort to place his campaign's closing arguments \u2014 both visually and in its tone \u2014 into that sort of lofty and high-minded narrative. Gettysburg was, of course, one of the most important battles of the Civil War, where the Union side in 1863 repelled a Southern invading force. Along with a simultaneous Union victory at Vicksburg, Miss., the battle gave the Union and the Lincoln administration renewed momentum and set into motion the Union's ultimate victory two years later. In late 1863, Lincoln reframed both the aims of the war and the fundamental goals of American democracy with his Gettysburg Address. Biden's speech comes on the same day that one of the most powerful voices in the Democratic Party, former first lady Michelle Obama, delivered her own closing argument with a 24-minute online video. \"Right now, our country is in chaos because of a president who isn't up to the job,\" Obama said, before ticking off all the ways the pandemic has disrupted everyday life for millions of Americans, and how the Trump administration continues to downplay its severity. \"It's a simple choice, really: a chance for a fresh start, or four more years of this.\" The past week and a half has been hellish for Trump's reelection chances. Before the debate, The New York Times published Trump's long-secret tax returns, showing that he paid little or no federal income taxes over nearly two decades. And in the days after the debate, the president, the first lady and others in their orbit announced positive tests for the coronavirus. Amid the chaos, Biden may see a chance to expand the electoral map. Recent national polls from CNN and NBC News give Biden large double-digit leads and put him comfortably above 50%, while Trump hovers at or around 40%. Most polls in key swing states give Biden durable leads as well. The campaign has now reserved nearly $6 million in ads in conservative Texas, according to multiple outlets in that state. The Biden campaign has long focused on six key swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida. But Democratic fundraising has gone into an even higher gear since the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Trump's push to fill the liberal icon's seat with conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett in the final weeks before the election. The seemingly endless supply of cash has allowed Biden to outspend Trump in most key swing states. Now Biden can commit resources not only to Texas but Georgia, Ohio and Iowa as well \u2014 all states that, if Biden is winning, mean he's likely already secured the 270 electoral votes needed to be president. As Trump continues to sow doubt about the outcome of the election, many Democrats hope for a blowout victory, thinking it is the best way to protect themselves against the president's efforts to question or overturn the results. Event after event in recent weeks has made that outcome more of a real possibility. The Biden campaign is eager enough to capitalize on that opportunity that it has, ironically, departed from its extremely cautious approach to campaigning during a window when the Democratic candidate may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Biden stood about 15 feet from Trump for 90 minutes last week when Trump may have been contagious. Biden said he's confident he wasn't exposed and has taken three tests \u2014 all negative \u2014 since Trump announced he tested positive for the virus. The campaign has promised to release the results of all coronavirus tests going forward. Biden has continued to travel to Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 though, in a departure, he has at times worn a mask while delivering speeches. The Biden campaign has adjusted to Trump's illness in other ways, too. In the immediate wake of the president's hospitalization, Biden's campaign pulled its negative ads from television. That move drew criticism from some Democratic allies. Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Biden said \"we shouldn't have a debate\" next week if Trump is still infected with the coronavirus.  \"I'm not sure what President Trump is all about now. I don't know what his status is. I'm looking forward to being able to debate him, but I just hope all the protocols are followed.\" Asked if he would feel safe debating Trump, Biden said, \"I think if he still has COVID, we shouldn't have a debate.\" Still, if Biden's ad makers were to craft a new attack ad, it would probably look like what Trump did all on his own Monday night: Stride back into the White House, dramatically rip off his mask and then record a video minimizing a virus that has killed 210,000 Americans, suggesting it's really no big deal. Biden didn't directly comment on those actions in Monday night's NBC News town hall appearance in Miami, but he did repeatedly nod in their direction. \"He has some of the best health care in the world,\" Biden told moderator Lester Holt. \"I'm happy it was available to him. It should be available to the president of the United States of America. But the vast majority of Americans, the vast majority of people here in this audience, your cameraman, if, God forbid, something happened to them, they don't have that access to that care.\"",

            "article_content": "Catholics guided by their faith may be torn between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Opposition to abortion pushes them to Trump, but an emphasis on Catholic social teachings may push them to Biden.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are paying close attention to Catholic voters. Catholics narrowly supported Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016. They have voted Democratic in other elections, though, and those shifting loyalties may have to do with where their Catholic values lead them. NPR's Tom Gjelten says church teachings can pull Catholics in different directions. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Here in Westmoreland County, Pa., Catholics are by far the biggest religious group, and they are seen as swing voters. For those Catholics whose voting is driven by what they've learned in church, two values stand out. First is what the U.S. bishops say is the preeminent issue - opposition to abortion. That's what matters to Elaine Gowaty. ELAINE GOWATY: You cannot be a true Catholic if you do not believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death. So abortion is not an option. GJELTEN: But there are other parts of what Catholics call the social teachings of the church. In Gina Cirelli's case, it's what she learned from the nuns in her Catholic elementary school. GINA CIRELLI: I was taught to respect others, treat others with dignity and respect, treat your neighbor as the way that you would like to be treated. And that's not what's happening in the White House right now. GJELTEN: In this politically polarized climate, the divisions among Catholics have to do with which of these Catholic teachings they emphasize. Those who feel most strongly about abortion are more likely to support Donald Trump. Those who focus more on how to treat their neighbors and those in need may lean to Joe Biden. But maybe they have something in common. CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON: The dominant value that causes Catholic voters to vote either direction has to do with the dignity of the human person and how to construe that. GJELTEN: Christopher McMahon teaches Catholic theology at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa. MCMAHON: In one direction, the dignity of the most vulnerable, the unborn, the ones that must be cared for and protected. And then towards the other end, it's the vulnerable of the minority, those who've been oppressed by economic injustice and warfare. GJELTEN: In either case, McMahon says, a Catholic sensibility is at work. MCMAHON: That you have this power and this responsibility in your vote to defend the dignity of the human person. GJELTEN: But how exactly to interpret that responsibility. Catholics themselves may not be entirely sure. Gina Cirelli, educated entirely in Catholic schools, thinks Donald Trump spreads hate. She's a pro-Biden Democrat, actually a Westmoreland County commissioner, but she calls herself pro-life. And the more her party embraces abortion rights unconditionally, the more estranged she feels from her party leaders. CIRELLI: A majority of Americans are right in the middle, and unfortunately, the two national parties have gone so far to the right or to the left, we really don't have representation in D.C. right now. GJELTEN: As for Elaine Gowaty, she supports Donald Trump. But as a Catholic, it means accepting that Trump calls people names and throws insults around. As a Catholic, those are things she was raised to keep to herself. GOWATY: Sometimes he says what I'm feeling, and I don't want to say anything like that, but he does. And you know what? It's not bad. GJELTEN: At this point, it's a rare Catholic voter who is undecided. One of the few is Abby Bogdan, who teaches physics at a local university, Seton Hill. Homeschooled in a Catholic family, she says her political views are shaped by her Catholicism. And like other Catholics, she says the top value is recognizing the worth and dignity of a human person. ABBY BOGDAN: Both parties hold positions that I think are fundamentally not in keeping with that value. So in some ways, I don't feel like I can vote for either candidate. GJELTEN: Like other Catholics, she sees how valuing human life can lead in different directions. But unlike others, she has not been able to resolve that tension. BOGDAN: I mean, I think abortion is a big one, but so is immigration. The handling of the pandemic is an issue. Health care in general is an issue. I think the divisive rhetoric is actually a manifestation of not respecting other people. INSKEEP: One of the voters who spoke with our colleague, Tom Gjelten in Pennsylvania. And, Tom, I gather there is one more undecided Catholic voter whose voice we didn't hear in that story. GJELTEN: That's right, Steve. It's an African American woman, one of just a couple in her parish. She says she's already encountered a lot of racial hostility, and she worried that if she were quoted, it might have put a target on her back. She is deeply opposed to Donald Trump because she thinks he empowers that same racial hostility that's directed against her and her family. On the other hand, she's not a Democrat. When she was 17, she told me, Steve, she had an abortion. She told me it's haunted her for her entire adult life. She said, I feel like I killed my own child. She views abortion as an intrinsic evil and cannot support a party that thinks abortion should be legal. INSKEEP: How does she seem likely to vote then? GJELTEN: She says she still doesn't know. I checked with her yesterday. You know, it comes down to this core central value of the dignity of the human person, the same value that other Catholics have talked about. Figuring out how to apply that can be difficult. INSKEEP: Tom, thanks for that insightful reporting, always appreciate it. GJELTEN: You bet. INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Gjelten. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Catholics are seen as swing voters, and the Trump and Biden campaigns are pushing for their support. In Pennsylvania, Catholics are almost evenly divided in their support of the two major parties.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: President Trump is battling COVID even as his reelection campaign continues. One focus is the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Catholic voters in that state are seen by both sides as a key swing group. NPR's Tom Gjelten has been talking to some of those voters about the upcoming election and has this report. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Murrysville, 20 miles east of Pittsburgh, sure looks like Trump country. There's no missing the Trump Victory Center on Carson Avenue, a huge Trump banner above the door, a big American flag alongside. But Westmoreland County, where Murrysville is located, was for decades solidly Democratic. MARY TERKA: I was a Democrat until 2004. GJELTEN: Mary Terka (ph) switched parties for one reason - abortion. If you're not pro-life, she says, you don't make the cut. She says if it hadn't been for abortion, she would have stayed a Democrat. TERKA: Because I do feel it is better to have both parties represented equally. It got to the point where there were no pro-life Democrats. I thought - you know what? - I'm done. I'm Republican at heart because of that one particular issue. GJELTEN: And why did that issue stand out above all others? TERKA: When it comes to matters of morals, my Catholic faith - I'm Catholic right down to my little toes. I really am. GJELTEN: The official view of the U.S. Catholic bishops is that abortion offends God. And as Republicans and Democrats became entrenched on opposite sides of the issue, Catholics began trending Republican. In the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which Donald Trump won in 2016, about a quarter of the electorate is Catholic. Kevin Hayes co-founded a Catholics for Biden campaign here. He wants to improve on previous Democratic efforts. KEVIN HAYES: The Clinton campaign did not do as much faith outreach, and they also made the abortion issue more of a divisive one. GJELTEN: Hayes thinks this year could be different. Joe Biden is himself a Catholic, and his Biden volunteers are encouraging fellow Catholics to move beyond single-issue voting. HAYES: I'm pro-life. I'm against abortion. But my pro-life beliefs are more than just anti-abortion. I really do believe in kind of conception to death pro-life, and there's a lot of issues that are involved there - a lot of life issues beyond just being born. That's what we're trying to get out to Catholics. GJELTEN: U.S. bishops say abortion is the preeminent issue for Catholics. But in a document on faithful citizenship, they also highlight economic justice, health care, immigrant rights, racial discrimination and the environment. And they say Catholics should let their consciences dictate their voting in light of all church teachings. Here in Westmoreland County, that resonated with Donna Fisher (ph), especially after she saw some Catholic messages on Facebook. DONNA FISHER: You are committing a mortal sin if you vote for a Democrat - and then I started seeing posts from the other side to say, no, no, you can form your own conscience. And I don't know that all Catholics know that. GJELTEN: Fisher wants to hear that message in her own parish. FISHER: Some people just go in line because they hear that abortion is the main issue so you've got to base your vote on that. So I would really prefer to see a lot more information that, no, you're allowed to look at all the issues and say, this candidate fits better than that candidate, even though that candidate might be closer on this one issue. GJELTEN: But back at the Trump Victory Center in Murrysville, it's pretty simple. MICHAEL KORNS: The life issue obviously is No. 1. GJELTEN: Michael Korns is a former chair of the Republican Party here in Westmoreland County. He's a Catholic who attends Mass weekly. KORNS: We are definitely trying to talk to Catholic voters who care deeply about issues of life and issues of culture. And there is such a clear distinction between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and the Democrats that it's, I think, difficult for somebody who's a conservative Catholic to ignore that. GJELTEN: It may come down to how many conservative Catholics there are here. Westmoreland County is 95% white and overwhelmingly Catholic. Trump won the county last time by 31 points. But 2020 is a different year for Catholic voters like Cheryl Tachs (ph). CHERYL TACHS: I just feel like we have become very toxic these last couple years. And I - I'm really worried about what the next four will bring depending on who is in in power, so to speak. GJELTEN: Who is in power in America will depend partly on who wins in Pennsylvania, and who wins may depend on how Catholics here will vote. Tom Gjelten, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Wisconsin is one the key swing states where presidential candidates are fighting for every last vote. With a month left before the election, this is what's on the mind of Wisconsin voters.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Of course, Wisconsin is one of the key swing states where presidential candidates are fighting for every single vote. We're taking a closer look at that state as part of a series that focuses on what voters around the country may be thinking. Reporter Maayan Silver of member station WUWM in Milwaukee joins us. Maayan, thanks so much for being with us. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: Of course, we ought to begin with the latest - President Trump's announcement that he's tested positive for coronavirus. He had two rallies planned in Wisconsin. And we should note the state, of course, has become a COVID hot spot. Those rallies have been canceled. What do you hear from his supporters? SILVER: Yeah, so even though the president tested positive, supporters I spoke with still stood by his handling of the pandemic. So I went to Waukesha yesterday. It's a Republican stronghold. And I caught some voters. Most said China was to blame and if the president did downplay anything, it was to prevent panic. But some were concerned about the president. Here's what Alan Ciesemier, who's a retiree, said. ALAN CIESEMIER: He should've been wearing a mask, in my opinion. It's nice to say everyone should wear a mask, and I think it's the right thing to do. The trouble is, how do you enforce it? SILVER: Seasmire mentioned masks. We should note that the Republican lawmakers in the state filed a motion to block the governor's mask mandate here. And over 17,000 people in Wisconsin have become infected in the past week alone, including U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, who just announced this morning that he tested positive for the coronavirus. And some hospitals in the state are actually struggling to cope. SIMON: President Trump won Wisconsin in 2016, and that represented a dramatic shift in the way the state had voted for more than 30 years. What do you see there now? SILVER: Yeah, the state tipped in Trump's favor, in part because Democrats did not turn out voters around the state, including Black voters in Milwaukee. It's a strong voting bloc for the party. There's also a pronounced urban-rural divide here, with cities being oases of Democratic voters and the more rural areas trending Republican. But some Republican voters of 2016 might flip this year. So I spoke to Kim Regner (ph), who's a hemp farmer from rural Cedar Grove. She voted for Trump in 2016 but won't this time around. KIM REGNER: I think a lot of it is just the demeanor that he gives. He doesn't seem like he's really supportive of a lot of people. And certain things, he's morally, I find, kind of repulsive. And I just - I'm very afraid that he's more just for himself. SILVER: So Regner said she didn't see Trump as a true Republican. And we should also note that Wisconsin tends to have one of the highest turnout rates in the country. So really, it could be neck and neck. SIMON: Racial justice protests and counterprotests have become local, personal issues there in Wisconsin following the August police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. How do you think this has affected voters? SILVER: So most conservatives I spoke with liked Trump's law and order message, but no one really said it was convincing them to vote for him. They pretty much already liked him. Democrats, though, did say that they were motivated by the rights of Black people. So here's Greg Adams Sr. (ph). He rode his bicycle to Port Washington's farmers market. GREG ADAMS SR: I'm 67. I just turned 67 this week. And we're still talking about some of the same issues that I marched for when I was 12 years old. My dad used to take me to marches, and we're still talking about that. But we have a president who is divisive, who talks divisive and sends cues to people. SIMON: And what do you hear from rural voters who, in Wisconsin, tend to vote Republican often? SILVER: So I went to a farmers market and a fall festival in rural areas of Wisconsin. On the way, I saw lots of houses and farms with Trump signs and American flags. But it really wasn't COVID or the Supreme Court vacancy that was top of mind for these voters. Some said they support Trump because of the economy. They like his tax cuts and trade war with China. Many were social and cultural conservatives. They were concerned about the Second Amendment and things like that. SIMON: And quickly, undecided voters - are there any? SILVER: There are a few. Most people were strongly in one camp or the other, but Ashley Heun was pretty in the middle on politics and torn who to vote for. ASHLEY HEUN: Democrats - I do like their platform on health care ideas. Republicans - I'm very pro-life, and that's probably where I kind of lean that way often. SILVER: The biggest issues for her are economic - taxes and help for small businesses like hers. She's watching to see how things develop this month. SIMON: Maayan Silver, thanks so much for being with us. SILVER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has a relatively short record as a federal judge, but a long track record as a conservative lawyer and law professor. Barrett met Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Republican senators ahead of her confirmation hearing that begins Oct. 12. As part of the process, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a 65-page questionnaire Barrett answered, along with 1,800 pages of documents, 150 speeches and writings, and nearly 100 opinions she has written and more than 800 appeals in which she participated. Here are highlights from the questionnaire: The White House contacted Barrett a day after Ginsburg's death Barrett says she received a call on Saturday, Sept. 19, from Pat Cipollone, counsel to the president, and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to discuss the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death the previous day. A day later, she says, the two men called her again and asked her to come to Washington. Trump called her later that day to confirm the invitation. On Monday, Sept. 21, three days after Ginsburg's death, Barrett met with Trump, Vice President Pence, Cipollone and Meadows in Washington, where Trump offered her the nomination and she accepted \u2014 pending vetting. What Barrett would recuse herself from Barrett said she'd recuse herself from cases involving her husband, Jesse Barrett, and her sister Amanda Coney Williams, both attorneys. She also said she'd recuse herself from those cases involving Notre Dame, where she taught law, and from matters in which she participated in while a judge on the court of appeals. But it is what's not in the list of recusals that's more interesting: Barrett did not say she would recuse herself from cases related to the outcome of November's presidential election. Trump has made Barrett's confirmation a key election issue, noting that a full complement of nine justices should hear the case if the election is legally challenged. Senate Democrats have called for Barrett to publicly recuse herself from any election-related cases before the court because of Trump's comments. Her silence on the matter is likely to add to their uneasiness about her nomination. Role in Bush v. Gore case Barrett previously provided \"briefing and research\" assistance in Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that decided the 2000 election, while she worked as an associate at Baker Botts, the law firm that represented then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush. \"I worked on the case on location in Florida for about a week at the outset of the litigation,\" Barrett wrote in her questionnaire. \"I worked with Stuart Levy, a partner at the firm, while the case was in Florida courts. I did not continue working on the case after my return to Washington.\" The Supreme Court ultimately decided the case in Bush's favor. Speaking engagements with conservative groups Barrett has a long history of talking to conservative groups that share her philosophy. Her questionnaire lists a total of 25 appearances before the conservative Federalist Society, whose leaders helped Trump screen his potential nominees for the Supreme Court, including this one. Sixteen of Barrett's Federalist Society appearances occurred after she became a federal judge in November 2017. In terms of her other speaking engagements, she has spoken multiple times before the Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a Christian group run by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization that represented a funeral home in a pivotal LGBT employment-discrimination case that came before the Supreme Court in the 2019-2020 court term. According to its website, the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, was founded in 1993 with the stated goal of advocating, training and funding legal cases on the issues of \"religious freedom, sanctity of life, and marriage and family.\" When asked in 2017 during her confirmation hearings for the 7th Circuit about her connection to the group and its anti-LGBTQ worldview, Barrett replied: \"I would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law.\" Previous disclosure forms show that between 2015 and 2017, when she became a judge, Barrett received $4,200 in honoraria from the ADF and $7,000 from the Federalist Society, and she went on 10 Federalist society-funded trips. Fix The Court, a non-partisan judicial watchdog group, reports that Barrett's most recent financial disclosure form in 2019 listed investments of $3.1 million, in addition to her ownership of two homes in South Bend, Ind., one that she lives in with her family, and another that has, in the past, been rented out.",

A grand jury indicted the Texas sheriff on charges of destroying or concealing video in an investigation into the death of Javier Ambler, a Black man who died in police custody last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Williamson County Sheriff via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody was booked on Monday on a $10,000 bond. A grand jury indicted the Texas sheriff on charges of destroying or concealing video in an investigation into the death of Javier Ambler, a Black man who died in police custody last year. A Texas sheriff has been indicted on felony charges of tampering with evidence in the case of Javier Ambler, a Black man who was killed by police last year during a traffic stop that escalated into a high-speed chase caught on film by a reality television show. Sheriff Robert Chody, who turned himself in, was arrested and booked on Monday. He was released shortly after posting $10,000 bail. The Williamson County grand jury indictment accuses Chody of intentionally destroying or concealing video and audio recordings of the fatal encounter, which was filmed for the television show Live PD. Jason Nassour, a lawyer with the county attorney's office, was also indicted on the same felony evidence-tampering charge. According to the indictment sheriff's deputies J.J. Johnson and Zach Camden first tried to pull Ambler over for allegedly failing to dim his headlights. But the routine stop became a 22-minute car chase with a helicopter and the television crew in tow. During the chase, Ambler struck a number of vehicles and eventually disabled his own. By then, the pursuit had crossed over into Travis County. Body camera footage from an Austin Police Department officer, offers a disturbing record of Ambler's final moments: The 40-year old postal service worker was tased four times as pleaded repeatedly for officers to stop. He repeatedly cried out in agony, telling the deputies he suffered from congestive heart failure and exclaiming, \"Save me. I can't breathe.\" He died at the scene, where Chody and Nassour were also present. The case went largely unnoticed by the public for months until an investigation by the Austin American-Statesman and local news station KVUE provided a detailed account of Ambler's death and uncovered the destruction of the raw and unaired Live PD footage. The show was canceled in June and according to the Statesmen, the production company held on to the footage at the request of investigators. But after some time, the recordings were destroyed. Live PD was a ratings hit for A&E and had been on the air for four years. But amid nationwide protests against police brutality and a slew of recorded incidents of excessive use of force against people of color, the cable network moved to yank the show off the air. The reports of the destroyed footage prompted Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick and Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore to open a joint investigation into the matter in June. Live PD producers have since told KVUE that they only disposed of the recordings after they were told by Chody's office that the investigation was completed using body camera footage and dash camera video. Dan Abrams, the host of the show, explained the program's policies on retaining raw footage on his podcast, the Dan Abrams Show, saying: \"The show has a policy of not retaining video for more than roughly 30 days. The reason for that is that we didn't want to become a video repository for either side \u2014 prosecutors, for defense, et cetera. We didn't want to become an arm of law enforcement. We didn't want to become an arm of defense attorneys, et cetera. So we had this policy in place about not retaining videos.\" But investigators from the Austin Police Department and the Travis County District Attorney's civil rights division say they were still relying on obtaining  the footage, KVUE reported. Chody, who is up for reelection, addressed the indictment and ongoing investigation by the Williamson County District Attorney in a news conference hours after he made bail. He categorically denied allegations that he attempted to impair the investigation and said he would later provide ample email correspondence as evidence that he willingly cooperated with all aspects of it. Reading from a lengthy prepared statement, the sheriff attacked Dick, whom he called \"petty,\" and accused him of acting \"in a vindictive and politically motivated manner by seeking an indictment in this case.\" Chody said Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore took \"no action for 19 months\" and suggested she only agreed to launch the investigation \"to try to save herself during a runoff election.\" Chody's attorney, Gerry Morris, also dismissed the charges, claiming the sheriff was a \"scapegoat\" for Dick and Moore's own failures. \"To say that this is critical evidence is baloney,\" Morris said. \"There was a chopper in the air that followed Ambler,\" and several vantage points of the incident from a variety of bodycam videos, he said. He added: \"The videos show that [Chody's] deputies did nothing wrong.\" Chody's office fought the release of body camera footage and other documents related to Ambler's death. They were only provided to news outlets after the sheriff was compelled by the Texas Attorney General's Office,which  said it could not withhold the records. Travis County District Attorney Moore on Monday said a grand jury there could potentially bring additional charges against Chody and Nassour, as well as deputies Johnson and Camden for excessive use of force.",

Military names can echo down through the ages, a fact underlined by the current fight in Washington, D.C., between President Trump and Congress, which has voted to strip the names of Confederate generals from several Southern Army bases. The president has vowed that won't happen, but the battle might not be resolved before Election Day. The Navy, meanwhile, has quietly charted a new course. A supercarrier now on the drawing boards will be christened the USS Doris Miller. It's the first supercarrier to be named for an enlisted sailor and the first to be named after an African American. Most supercarriers are named for U.S. presidents \u2014 the USS John F. Kennedy. USS Ronald Reagan. USS Abraham Lincoln. Henry Kissinger called them \"100,000 tons of diplomacy,\" and that power has long been reflected in the Navy's conventions for naming them. Doris Miller, who went by \"Dorie\" in the Navy, was one of the first American heroes of World War II. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, as his battleship, the USS West Virginia, was sinking, the powerfully built Miller, who was the ship's boxing champion, helped move his dying captain to better cover, then jumped behind a machine gun and shot at Japanese planes until his ammunition was gone. As a Black sailor in 1941, he wasn't supposed to fire a gun even. This means that when he reached for that weapon, he was taking on two enemies: the Japanese flyers and the pervasive discrimination in his own country. \"One of the ways in which the Navy discriminated against African Americans was that they limited them to certain types of jobs, or what we call 'ratings' in the Navy,\" said Regina Akers, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command. \"So, for African Americans, many were messmen or stewards. Dorie Miller was a messman, which meant that he basically took care of an officer, laid out his clothes, shined his shoes and served meals.\" ''He should be recognized and honored\" Akers said much of the attention at the time, and since, has been on Miller firing the anti-aircraft gun, which he wasn't even trained to do. In fact, it's a moment Hollywood briefly portrayed in several movies about the attack. But Akers said what Miller did afterward is just as important: He began pulling injured sailors out of the burning, oil-covered water of the harbor, and was one of the last men to leave his ship as it sank, and continued getting sailors to safety afterward. An official Navy commendation list of those whose actions during the attack stood out mentioned a Black sailor. But it didn't bother to name Miller, a 22-year-old sharecropper's son from Waco, Texas. \"It made two lines in the newspapers,\" said Frank Bolden, who was a war correspondent for The Pittsburgh Courier, one of the leading Black newspapers of the day. He spoke in an interview with the Freedom Forum before his death in 2003. \"The Courier thought he should be recognized and honored. We sent not a reporter, we sent our executive editor to the naval department. They said we don't know the name of the messman. There are so many of them.\" Miller receives the Navy Cross from Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, during a ceremony on board the USS Enterprise on May 27, 1942.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. Navy/National Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption Miller receives the Navy Cross from Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, during a ceremony on board the USS Enterprise on May 27, 1942. A pivotal moment The paper though wasn't about to give up, Bolden said. The Black press knew that by getting this unnamed sailor proper recognition, it could undermine a stereotype that African Americans weren't any good in combat. \"The publisher of the paper said, 'Keep after it,' \" Bolden said. \"We spent $7,000 working to find out who Dorie Miller was. And we made Dorie Miller a hero.\" This was a pivotal moment, said Akers, the Navy historian. \"And so the African American community just swells up with pride,\" she said. \"But at the same time, they're mad at the Navy for not having formally shared what Dorie Miller did.\" Black leaders at the time were already pressuring President Franklin D. Roosevelt for more opportunities for African Americans in the booming war industry and in the military. Roosevelt barely averted a march on Washington at one point. Miller was awarded a letter of commendation, but the Black press campaigned for a medal. And Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, wanted to take the bold step of upgrading that commendation to the Navy Cross, then the third-highest honor for heroism. Nimitz understood the value of a diverse force made up of sailors who felt they were being treated fairly. \"So in Nimitz's mind the award would be good for the Navy and contradict the institutional racism that the Navy was known for,\" Akers said. Roosevelt, eager to keep the nation united behind the war effort, agreed. Suddenly, Miller was in the spotlight. \"Miller I mean, in just like the flip of a switch, becomes a celebrity,\" Akers said. \"He becomes one of the first heroes, period, of the war, but certainly one of the first African American heroes of the war. He was on recruitment posters. His image was everywhere.\" Miller had a low-key personality, and while he backed the idea of expanded opportunity in the Navy, he was hardly a radical. But because of what he had done at Pearl Harbor, suddenly the Black newspapers such as the Courier had a powerful weapon they had been looking for, said Baylor University history professor Michael Parrish, co-author of Doris Miller, Pearl Harbor and The Birth of the Civil Rights Movement. \"He was a catalyst that gave them a lot of strength very early in the war. And they were determined to promote him publicly,\" Parrish said. Parrish said that in war after war, African Americans had fought for their country, hoping their service would be rewarded with more rights, only to have their hopes dashed. Until Miller stepped behind that gun. \"Things came together at Pearl Harbor for Doris Miller and for the civil rights movement, probably to maximum effect,\" Parrish said. \"So World War II was really the turning point in that long struggle.\" Even before Miller formally received the medal, the effects of what he had done, trumpeted by the Black newspapers, began to have an effect. The Navy started training Black sailors for jobs such as gunner's mate, radioman and radar operator. Later it began commissioning Black officers. After the war, in 1948, President Harry S. Truman ordered the military desegregated, a major milestone for the nation. All of that, Parrish said, can be traced to Miller. This wasn't lost on Black America, even as the changes Miller helped spur were just gaining momentum. There were songs, and even poets were inspired. In 1943 Langston Hughes wrote: \"When Dorie Miller took gun in hand Jim Crow started his last stand ...\" Another renowned Black poet, Gwendolyn Brooks, was at once oblique and ferocious in \"Negro Hero /To Suggest Dorie Miller.\" \"In a Southern city, a white man said, Indeed I'd rather be dead. Indeed, I'd rather be shot in the head Or ridden to waste on the back of a flood Than saved by the drop of a black man's blood. Naturally, the important thing is I helped to save them. Them and a part of their Democracy Even if I had to kick their law into their teeth In order to do that for them ...\" Baylor professor Parrish has a personal connection to the story. His father was a sailor aboard another ship at Pearl Harbor, just a few hundred yards from Miller during the attack. Parrish said he got a startling lesson when he asked what his father knew about Miller's exploits. \"He looked at me and he shook his head and said, 'I never heard of him at the time,' \" Parrish said. \"White and Black military personnel lived in two separate worlds. That's because white people and Black people, along with other people of color on the homefront, lived in two separate worlds.\" Miller speaks during a war bond tour stop at the Naval Training Station in Great Lakes, Ill., on Jan. 7, 1943.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. Navy/National Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"It was probably long overdue\" The decision to name the new supercarrier for Miller was made by Thomas Modly, who was acting secretary of the Navy until April. \"I think it was probably long overdue,\" Modly said. He said he asked a small group of retired Black admirals he had met to recommend a name. He asked them to try to find an African American enlisted sailor, if possible. \"And someone from World War II, because that was a point at which the country was really united,\" he said. \"And African Americans who served were still in a lot of places growing up under Jim Crow. And so it required a lot of bravery and patriotism.\" The retired admirals consulted with an historian, Modly said, \"and literally, they came back to me within five days and said it has to be Doris Miller. And the story of Doris Miller is an incredible one, so they didn't need to convince me.\" It simply seemed like the right thing to do given the U.S. Navy's diversity, he said, especially compared with the navies of other nations. \"The Navy is made up of every single element of our population; it's probably the most diverse representation of the country. We have about 340,000 active-duty sailors, and they come from every part of the country, every skin color, every ethnicity.\" Miller didn't live to see the lasting effects of his heroics. He went back to sea in the Pacific, and in 1943, his ship was torpedoed and sank. Miller was among the hundreds of sailors who died. His body was never found. His name, though, still graces schools, roads and community centers around the country. And the Navy, which at first wouldn't even share that name, will soon give it equal footing with the names of presidents. Akers, the Navy historian, said Miller was a good role model for sailors, a history lesson in trying to do the right thing. \"Despite the fact that he was denied certain basic constitutional rights because of the racism in our society at the time, Dorie didn't let that deter him,\" she said. \"It didn't lessen his patriotism, his love for country, his determination to serve and to give the Navy his very best, and that says a lot. That says a lot.\"",

Updated at 4:30 ET President Trump leaned into his economic record Friday as he attempted to attract Black voters with a pledge to try to secure more lending for African American business owners. Trump unveiled what he called the \"platinum plan\" for Black economic empowerment at a campaign event in Atlanta. But during wide-ranging remarks, Trump spent more time telling people why they shouldn't vote for  Democratic rival Joe Biden than he did describing his campaign pitch to African Americans. \"No one in politics today has done more to hurt the Black community than Joe Biden,\" Trump said at the ballroom event. \"Joe Biden should not be demanding your support; he should be begging for your forgiveness,\" he told supporters. Ja'Ron Smith \u2014 a White House adviser who spoke to NPR in his personal capacity ahead of the event \u2014 said Trump's goal is to have the federal government invest in institutions that lend to Black businesses. The campaign said in a news release that Trump proposes to increase lending through community development financial institutions and would aim to direct up to $40 billion in government funds to leverage as much as 10 times that amount through the private sector. That funding would need to be negotiated with Congress. The campaign also envisions grants for microlending and organizations that can help Black entrepreneurs grow their businesses, Smith said. \"Today is historic because for the first time you have a Republican president and a Republican agenda that's focused on the economic empowerment of the Black community,\" Smith told NPR in an interview. Ja'Ron Smith, a top Trump adviser, says Republicans are focused on economic empowerment issues for the Black community.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ja'Ron Smith, a top Trump adviser, says Republicans are focused on economic empowerment issues for the Black community. Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2016. His campaign has opened field offices in predominantly Black communities in swing states as Trump tries to improve on that support. In a tight election, squeezing out a few more votes could make a difference. The campaign faces an uphill battle. Polls show Black voters overwhelmingly support Biden and give Trump low marks for his job performance. Biden discussed his economic plan for Black Americans earlier this week at an event in Charlotte, N.C., pledging to invest more money in historically Black colleges and universities and leverage $150 billion in new capital for Black-owned businesses. Before the pandemic, Trump would often point to record low Black unemployment as one of the major achievements of his administration. But that argument is harder to make since the pandemic because the economic downturn has hit African Americans hard. Even before the pandemic, when Black unemployment was at record low levels, it was still around twice the level of white unemployment. Trump's plan also includes a proposal to make Juneteenth a federal holiday \u2014 and a proposal to enshrine a national database of police misconduct into law. Trump called for establishing the database in June after George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis. Both these proposals would require action by Congress. Since Floyd's death, Trump has made repeated calls for \"law and order\" in response to nationwide unrest over racial discrimination and systemic racial bias in police departments. Critics charge that Trump has inflamed tensions and has not addressed concerns voiced by Black voters about their treatment at the hands of the police. Smith pushed back against these critiques. \"The president has talked about law and order with compassion,\" Smith said. \"We want to be tough on those violent individuals that victimize people in the community.\" Alana Wise contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Demonstrators took to the streets in downtown Atlanta on Wednesday night to voice anger over a Kentucky grand jury's decision not to charge three Louisville police officers directly in the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in March. Police said they arrested 11 people while dispersing crowds, according to NPR member station WABE in Atlanta. Hundreds gathered at the city's Woodruff Park around 7 p.m. and eventually made their way to the Georgia Capitol. Chants of \"say her name\" and \"what do we want? Justice\" rang through the streets, the station reported. #BreonnaTaylor #Atlanta #protests \ud83d\udcf8 by @CalstonChris pic.twitter.com/3HXyx1s0Hv At times the demonstrations grew tense, with some yelling at National Guard troops, referring to them as \"pigs\" and \"murderers,\" according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Just before 10 p.m. local time, Georgia state troopers used tear gas to disperse a crowd near the Capitol, the newspaper reported. Atlanta police deploy tear gas on violent Black Lives Matter rioters after repeated warnings to disperse.  https://t.co/10BQGQiR1A Tear gas deployed in Atlanta tonight as protestors descend on the Capitol angry over no charges in Breonna Taylor\u2019s death. pic.twitter.com/OZpMs9eW3l \"We're not satisfied with the results, a settlement is not enough, the charges were not enough,\" Taron Harris, 22, told The Journal-Constitution outside the Capitol. Harris was referring to the $12 million settlement the city of Louisville reached with Taylor's family last week in a wrongful death lawsuit. \"We're here to say enough is enough, and we want justice. And that's all we wanted. We don't care about money, we don't care about anything else,\" Harris told the paper. A Kentucky grand jury Wednesday returned an indictment for one of the three Louisville Metro Police Department officers involved in the fatal shooting.  Brett Hankison, who was terminated in June, has been charged with three counts of wanton endangerment over shooting into neighboring apartments. The grand jury did not announce charges against the other two officers. The Taylor case has also made its way into this year's hotly contested U.S. Senate special election race in Georgia. Democratic candidate the Rev. Raphael Warnock said the decision not to charge the officers involved in Taylor's death was \"a gross negligence of justice.\" Warnock is pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was once co-pastor. Not charging all the cops responsible for Breonna Taylor\u2019s death is a gross negligence of justice. It devalues the life of Breonna Taylor. Black lives matter. We will not have #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor until all the cops involved are held accountable. \"Not charging all the cops responsible for Breonna Taylor's death is a gross negligence of justice,\" Warnock tweeted. \"It devalues the life of Breonna Taylor. Black lives matter. We will not have #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor until all the cops involved are held accountable.\" According to a Monmouth University poll published Wednesday, Warnock is in a virtual tie with GOP candidates Rep. Doug Collins and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat earlier this year. In July, Loeffler, a co-owner of the WNBA franchise the Atlanta Dream, objected to the league's move to dedicate the 2020 season to social justice reform. The league highlighted the Black Lives Matter movement, and several players wore special uniforms honoring Taylor. Her criticism of the league's stance drew backlash, including from the players union, which tweeted, \"E-N-O-U-G-H!\" For her part, Loeffler took to social media to express her outrage over two Louisville police officers being shot during protests following the grand jury's decision. \"The violent mob is out of control,\" Loeffler tweeted. \"We need to get tough and #BackTheBlue before it's too late.\" The violent mob is out of control.Enough is enough.

Updated Saturday at 5:22 p.m. ET President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and is a favorite among social conservatives. They, and others on the right, view her record as anti-abortion rights and hostile to the Affordable Care Act. If confirmed, the 48-year-old Barrett would be the youngest justice on the Supreme Court and could help reshape the law and society for generations to come. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the court in 2018, President Trump passed over Barrett, giving the nod instead to then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh. At the time, Trump told Barrett supporters that he was \"saving\" her to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, should the justice retire or die, sources say. Behind the scenes, though, Barrett's interview with Trump then did not go particularly well, say sources close to the process but who are not authorized to speak publicly. She had conjunctivitis, had to wear dark glasses during the interview and was \"not at her best,\" as one source put it. But this week, Barrett's interview seems to have gone far better. Moreover, these sources say, she has the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who views her as a judge with a clearly proven conservative track record. What kind of judge would Barrett be? Barrett was raised in Metairie, La., a suburb of New Orleans. Her father, Mike, was an attorney for Shell Oil, and her mother was a stay-at-home mom. Barrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School for girls, then graduated with honors from Rhodes College, a Presbyterian-affiliated school in Tennessee, followed by graduation, summa cum laude, from Notre Dame Law School. She clerked for the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, and during her clerkships, she was nicknamed \"The Conenator\" by fellow law clerks \"for destroying flimsy legal arguments,\" the Chicago Tribune reported. Afterward, Barrett briefly practiced law and then taught for 15 years at Notre Dame Law School in South Bend, Ind. She is married to Jesse Barrett, a former prosecutor now in private practice, and the couple have seven children, one with Down syndrome and two adopted from Haiti. They live in South Bend, and she commutes to Chicago \u2014 almost an hour and 45 minutes away \u2014 where the appeals court sits. Barrett has been a federal judge for three years. She has written about 100 opinions and \"several telling dissents in which Barrett displayed her clear and consistent conservative bent,\" The Associated Press noted of her judicial record. From guns and sexual assault on campus to health care and abortion rights, Barrett has shown herself to be a conservative jurist and legal thinker in her rulings and academic writings. \"The dogma lives loudly within you\" Barrett's confirmation hearing for the appeals court in 2017 raised hackles on both the right and the left. The left saw Barrett as a socially conservative mirror image of Scalia, famous for his conservative approach to constitutional interpretation and passionate dissents from the high court's abortion- and gay-rights rulings. Barrett, like Scalia, is seen as an \"originalist\" or \"textualist.\" It's a philosophy that looks strictly at the text of the Constitution or statute and tries to apply original intention from the framers. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, in particular, infuriated Republicans when she ticked off a list of the nominee's writings and speeches about faith and the law. \"The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern,\" Feinstein told the nominee. Barrett responded, \"If you're asking whether I take my Catholic faith seriously, I do, though I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge.\" Republicans charged that Feinstein's question betrayed an anti-Catholic bias, and Barrett was confirmed by a 55-43 vote, with three Democrats voting in favor of confirmation, and two not voting. Barrett is a member of a particularly conservative Christian faith group, People of Praise. Newsweek reported that the group \"teaches that husbands should assume authority as the head of the household.\" (Her parents are also members, and her father was a coordinator of the group's Southern chapters.) The New York Times reported that People of Praise \"grew out of the Catholic charismatic renewal movement that began in the late 1960s and adopted Pentecostal practices such as speaking in tongues, belief in prophecy and divine healing.\" If confirmed for the Supreme Court, Barrett would be the sixth Catholic justice. All but Sonia Sotomayor were nominated by Republican presidents. Justice Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but now lists himself as Episcopalian. Two other justices \u2014 Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan \u2014 are Jewish. Barrett has also received thousands of dollars in honoraria for appearances from the Alliance Defending Freedom, according to a 2017 financial disclosure posted by Fix the Court, a group that seeks to reform the Supreme Court and federal court system, advocating for term limits and cameras in the courtroom. ADF describes itself as advocating \"for religious liberty, the sanctity of human life, freedom of speech, and marriage and family.\" ADF represented Jack Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cake shop and declined to bake a cake for a same-sex couple celebrating their marriage. Barrett reported receiving $4,200 from ADF in the disclosure, which covers 2016 through the first four months of 2017. Barrett has been critical of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 abortion decision, but in 2016, she suggested that the court most likely would hollow out the decision, leaving the basic right to abortion in place, but allowing states wide latitude to make abortion difficult to obtain. \"I don't think the core case, Roe's core holding that women have a right to an abortion, I don't think that would change,\" Barrett said in a discussion at Jacksonville University. \"But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, you know, how many restrictions can be put on clinics, I think that will change.\" That, however, was before Trump's election and the composition of the court moved more starkly to the right, making the outright reversal of Roe more plausible. Similarly, the future of Obamacare could be at stake with Barrett's nomination. The court is scheduled to hear a third challenge to the law the week after the election. Twice before the court has upheld much of the law, but that could change now, with a possible Barrett vote pivotal. Indeed, she criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning in upholding the Affordable Care Act. \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" Barrett wrote in 2017. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did \u2014 as a penalty \u2014 he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\" Precedent In her academic work, Barrett has written dismissively about the doctrine of respecting the Supreme Court's precedents, known as stare decisis. \"I tend to agree with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it,\" she wrote in a 2013 law review article.

Guns While on the 7th Circuit, Barrett wrote that the Second Amendment did not necessarily ban people convicted of felonies from owning a gun. She declared a Wisconsin law, barring anyone convicted of a felony even if they aren't convicted of a violent crime, to be unconstitutional. \"[L]egislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns. But that power extends only to people who are dangerous,\" Barrett wrote in a 37-page dissent. Her reliance on originalism also came through a few lines later: \"In 1791 \u2014 and for well more than a century afterward \u2014 legislatures disqualified categories of people from the right to bear arms only when they judged that doing so was necessary to protect the public safety.\" Immigration Barrett voted to uphold the Trump administration's \"public charge\" rule, which \"adds barriers for immigrants seeking green cards if they rely on public benefits, food stamps or housing vouchers,\" Courthouse News Service reported. The 7th Circuit blocked the administration's ability to enforce its interpretation of the public charge rule in Illinois. Barrett wrote in a dissent that the Department of Homeland Security's definition is not \"unreasonable,\" especially considering that \"the text of the current statute ... was amended in 1996 to increase the bite of the public charge determination.\"",

She is actively campaigning for Joe Biden to win Pennsylvania, a key swing state in the election. Tanisha Long expects to be busy in the run up to the 2020 election. For the next six weeks, Long, who founded an unofficial Black Lives Matter chapter for Pittsburgh and Southwestern Pennsylvania, plans to make get-out-the vote videos, host mail-in voting webinars and work to enfranchise eligible incarcerated people in order to turn out voters she says \"no one's talking to anymore.\" Long's concern is this: she sees the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden making the same mistakes in Pennsylvania that Hillary Clinton made in 2016. Long believes the Biden campaign is failing to do enough to engage traditional Democratic constituencies. \"I just can't have that happen again, it's really stressing me out,\" she says. Donald Trump famously lost the popular vote in 2016 by over 2.8 million votes but secured a victory in the electoral college by winning razor thin margins in key swing states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are focused on these states, looking to get support from voters who either sat out 2016 or might be persuaded to vote for the other side. In Pennsylvania, that has meant a disproportionate interest in white suburban voters. Trump won them over by larger margins than expected in 2016, including just outside Pittsburgh in Washington County. Sheridan Newsome, 21, walks by a mural in Pittsburgh's Homewood neighborhood.

Despite receiving the consistent support of Black communities, many voters here say Democratic leaders have largely failed to effectively address enduring problems like police violence, discrimination and income inequality that have disproportionately hurt Black residents in Pittsburgh. But a tightly contested 2020 election in Pennsylvania could be decided at least in part by people outside those suburbs. This includes Pittsburgh's Black residents, 22 percent of the city's population, who are usually considered a reliable Democratic constituency. And yet, Democrats could have their work cut out for them. Despite receiving the consistent support of Black communities, some voters here say Democratic leaders have largely failed to effectively address enduring problems like police violence, discrimination and income inequality that have disproportionately hurt Black residents in Pittsburgh. 'For voting, it takes a personal touch' Writer Damon Young, 41, is a life-long Pittsburgher who founded the website Very Smart Brothas and wrote the memoir What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker. He says he was alarmed \u2014 but not surprised \u2014 by a widely publicized report out of the city of Pittsburgh's Gender Equity Commission last year that found that while white Pittsburgh residents have better health outcomes and quality of life than the national average, the city is one of the worst in the country for Black people, and particularly for Black women. Black residents deal with higher infant mortality rates, lower wages, worse educational outcomes, and higher incidences of cardiovascular disease and cancer. All this in a city that often ranks on the list of the country's most livable cities. \"That's the thing,\" Young says. For Young, this kind of long-term inequality can make it hard to persuade Black residents to turn out. \"It can be a hard sell. If someone says 'We've had nothing but Democratic mayors in Pittsburgh my entire life, and well, it doesn't affect me. There's still this violence happening, there's still no jobs, the schools are better in the white communities, that hasn't changed with Barack Obama being president or Bill Peduto being mayor. So why should I care?' \" he says.

Young's friend Jasiri X, the 37 year-old hip hop artist who runs the community organization 1Hood, says he used to vote as an independent. Then he realized that Pittsburgh's strong Democratic party history means that the primaries are where the important politics happen, so he had to become a Democrat to vote in the local elections that mattered. Though he's now a Democrat, he sees the party's establishment as detrimental to Black Pittsburghers. \"We're comfortable doing things the way they are but that's harmful to me as a Black person. It's been harmful to my community for years. So I'm somebody looking for bold, innovative change,\" he says. To help push the party in a more progressive direction, Jasiri X is working to help people vote with a new nonprofit he helped create called 1Hood Power. \"What I didn't see in 2016 was an investment in Black-led organizations to actually speak to Black people, to have those important conversations, to get Black people to the polls,\" he says. \"For voting, it takes a personal touch.\" Young and Jasiri X both plan to vote for Biden, though they aren't enthusiastic about him or his running mate, Kamala Harris. Simply put, Young believes his life depends on Biden defeating Trump in November. And it's up to white voters to get it done. \"We talk about how Black women, Black voters, Latino voters will decide it. No. White people will decide the election,\" he says. \"If he wins again, it's not because we weren't engaged. It's not because we didn't come out. It's because white people came out and ignored the four years of evidence of Donald Trump being an unrepentant racist and a misogynist and a terrible businessman.\" 'A fighting chance' Lisa Cunningham, 58, has lived in the Hill District, one of Pittsburgh's historically Black neighborhoods, for about 45 years. She's worried about a lot of the things Young and Jasiri X identified as issues that might lead people to be reluctant to vote for Democrats, or to vote at all. \"Jobs, fairness, economic disparities, racism. You have people sitting on top of us up there and they're looking down on us down here,\" Cunningham says, gesturing to the skyscrapers downtown. But her enthusiasm for Biden \u2014 and for voting \u2014 remains strong. \"I adore him,\" she says about Biden, \"I know he will give us equality and he will give us a fighting chance.\" Cunningham says she'd rather risk catching the coronavirus to be able to cast her ballot in person than trust mail-in voting, even though her daughter had COVID-19.

She ran in Braddock, Pa., a town in the greater Pittsburgh area and one of the few that still has an active steel mill. \"We don't get a lot of Black women running for office. We don't get a lot of progressive folks running for office in western Pennsylvania,\" she says, \"I can't lead folks to a place that I'm not willing to go myself.\" Lee, a lawyer, unseated Democratic incumbent Paul Costa who had been in office for 20 years. She became the first Black woman elected to represent Southwestern Pennsylvania in the state house. She campaigned against a fracking proposal in Braddock and went door to door speaking with people about environmental racism, cyclical poverty and racial and economic justice. But when she was running as an incumbent in the Democratic Party primary in early 2020, the Allegheny County Democrats endorsed her opponent, a white man. Lee won the primary handily anyway, with 77 percent of the vote, all but assuring a second term. Lee's differences with the Democratic party establishment are profound. She was a delegate at this summer's virtual Democratic National Convention and voted against the party's official platform.

But he also can't imagine ever voting for Biden. Lenny  McAllister, 48, grew up in the Penn Hills area of Pittsburgh, where he still lives. His father was raised in East Liberty. His mother was from the nearby Homewood neighborhood, which was once middle class and later declined, and where  McAllister spent a lot of his childhood. He says his anti-abortion and pro-school choice beliefs are cornerstones of his politics. He ran for Congress in 2016 as a Republican in Pennsylvania's 14th district (he lost) after securing the nomination in a write-in campaign, but says he could not bring himself to vote for Trump because of his faith. He made that decision before the election \"when Mr. Trump said in 2015 that he never felt that he had to ask God for forgiveness, just figured he would fix it himself.\" As a Christian, he says, he understands that \"you can't fix everything yourself.\" \"When I heard that,\" he says, \"that was enough for me to take a step away.\" But  McAllister also can't imagine ever voting for Biden, in part because a crime bill he shepherded through the Senate in 1994. \"His 1994 crime bill disproportionately impacted communities such as Homewood, where literally generations of fathers and mothers spent disproportionate amounts of time in jail,\" he says.

As one of few active Black Republicans in Pittsburgh,  McAllister admits that the party has a problem embracing diversity. \"There's not a lot of Republicans that try to connect to different and diverse portions of the nation. I think that when we say 'we love America,' we love America in the sense that we love what we're familiar with. We don't love Damon Young or Summer Lee when they disagree with us,\" he says. And McAllister is troubled by many of the same problems facing his city, his community and his nation as Young and Lee: racial health disparities, discrimination and police violence. \"Damon Young is never going to be my enemy. Summer Lee, as a hardcore, left-leaning Democrat is never going to be my enemy,\" he says. Ariel Worthy, government and accountability reporter at WESA, contributed to this story.",

Ed Markey, D-Mass., is leading an effort to ensure climate is addressed at every presidential debate this cycle. When President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden face off Tuesday night in the first presidential debate, there's one topic they're not expected to get asked about: climate. Thirty-six senators, spearheaded by Ed Markey, D-Mass., signed a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, urging that climate change receive more attention. Fox News moderator Chris Wallace plans to ask the two candidates questions from a series of topics ranging from their individual records, the Supreme Court, COVID-19, the economy and the integrity of the election. The senators point to various climate crises \u2014 including the wildfires in the West and the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 writing, \"The climate crisis isn't coming, it's here.\" \"It is critical that every debate includes questions that ask the candidates what they would do to address climate change and environmental injustice. Without these topics, any discussion on the economy, racial justice, public health, national security, democracy, or infrastructure would be incomplete,\" the letter reads. A recent poll from Climate Nexus, Vice Media Group and other climate groups, found that 74% of voters said it was important to ask about climate change during the debates. In an NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll earlier this month, climate became the top priority for likely Democratic voters. An additional topic Wallace plans to address with the candidates is \"Race and Violence in our Cities.\" The framing of the topic has drawn criticism from some corners for conflating the issues of race and violence, with many seeing it as characterizing the nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality as inherently violent themselves. President Trump frequently campaigns on the idea of \"law and order\" and has pushed for law enforcement crackdowns in cities because of the protests, some of which have led to violence.",

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We head now to Nevada, which is getting a lot of attention from both major party candidates in the final stretch of the election season. Democrats won the state in 2016 but narrowly, which makes it a prime target for Republicans. From member station KUNR in Reno, reporter Paul Boger has more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Four more years. Four more years. PAUL BOGER, BYLINE: Last weekend, several thousand mostly maskless people crowded onto the small runway of the Minden-Tahoe Airport, about an hour south of Reno, to see President Trump at his first campaign stop in Nevada since the start of the pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering). PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Beautiful. What a crowd this one is. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering). TRUMP: And you've got thousands and thousands of people outside that have taken buses here. BOGER: Nevada's unemployment rate is the highest in the country. But many voters, like Steve Lopez (ph), give Trump credit for the economy before the pandemic STEVE LOPEZ: I did not vote for Trump in the last election. But since then, he has proven himself to me, and I will - oh, I regret having not voted for him. BOGER: Recent polls give former Vice President Joe Biden a narrow lead over Trump in Nevada. Trump came to the area around Reno because it's the one part of the state that's up for grabs. Republicans tend to win big in the rural counties while Democrats do well in Las Vegas and surrounding suburbs. Washoe County, where Reno is, was historically conservative but has trended towards Democrats in recent years. So what do Republicans need to do to win Nevada? Elliot Malin (ph) says they have to organize and knock on doors. ELLIOT MALIN: People want to hear from you. They want to see. So that retail politics is very much a part of the fabric of Nevada politics. BOGER: Malin is a Republican political consultant who's worked on statewide campaigns. He points to how Democrats have mobilized union members to get out the vote. A growing issue for Republicans here is the state's new vote-by-mail law. Nevada is the only swing state where all active registered voters will be sent an absentee ballot. During his visit, Trump repeatedly attacked Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak over the law to cast doubt about the outcome in November. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: He was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots. BOGER: And Nevada Republicans like state party chair Michael McDonald are amplifying that language. MICHAEL MCDONALD: You have to unite together to make sure we take back Nevada. This is not an election, ladies and gentlemen. We are at war. We're at war for democracy. This is what it's about. BOGER: Despite the heated talk, many people here seem to have tuned out the election. At a farmer's market in Reno, it's hazy due to wildfire smoke from the Sierra. Many voters say their minds are already made up. Trump's response to civil and racial unrest has left some voters with a bad taste. Larry Burnett (ph) is a retired broadcaster. He says the president's use of force on protesters around the country is worrisome. LARRY BURNETT: What I'm concerned about is what we saw in Portland, where he brought in unmarked law enforcement people in unmarked vans. I'm afraid we may see that around the election, too, to scare people. BOGER: There are still some undecided voters in the crowd. Autumn Spencer is a stay-at-home mom. She considers herself a conservative but isn't sure she can vote for Trump. AUTUMN SPENCER: I feel very mixed because honestly, financially, we're still doing well with Trump. We are. Like, and I've always been very conservative. But I don't know. He's just kind of an awful human being. BOGER: The question for Trump is whether voters like her will hold their noses and vote for him anyway. For NPR News, I'm Paul Boger in Reno.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden leads President Trump in the presidential election nationally by a substantial margin, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. But he is underperforming with likely voters of color.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: There's only about six weeks until Election Day. Some voters are already casting ballots. And former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead President Trump nationally by a substantial margin - at least that's according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. There are some important nuances in these numbers, and we're going to get to them with NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Welcome back. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. CORNISH: I want to start with the headline. What are the figures that support that? MONTANARO: Well, to start with - this is the first time this election cycle we asked about likely voters, and of those most likely to vote, Biden leads 52 to 43. That's about the same as we have it with the wider universe of registered voters, and it's also about where the race has been for months in our poll and others. You know, it's really remarkable how steady it's been, actually. Even when you add in libertarian nominee Jo Jorgensen and the Green Party's Howie Hawkins, Biden's still ahead by seven, and he's at 49%. What really jumped out to me, though, in this poll is how Biden is doing with white voters, specifically whites with a college degree. I mean, this is remarkable. According to 2016 exit polls, Trump won this group 48-45. In our poll, Biden leads with them 66 to 31. CORNISH: What are Biden's vulnerabilities? MONTANARO: Well, you know, the biggest problem for him is that he's not doing as well as Hillary Clinton did with nonwhite voters. And, mainly, our pollsters are saying, that's coming from Latinos. If there's a warning sign for him, it is that. And Latinos play an important role in states like Florida, which are key to, you know, the Electoral College and could determine the election because, as we all know, the national popular vote doesn't decide who wins. CORNISH: What did the poll tell you about what's foremost on voters' minds? MONTANARO: Well, this really does tell you everything about why we're so divided in this country. I mean, depending on what party people are in, they care about very different things. For Democrats, the top issue is now climate change, and that's a shift from just before the 2018 election, when health care was top of mind for Democrats. Second is coronavirus, then health care more generally, the economy and race relations. But for Republicans, very different - the top issue for them continues to be the economy and jobs, head and shoulders above anything else, followed by abortion, crime and guns - all culture issues - with coronavirus behind that. So maybe that helps make some sense for why it seems like both parties aren't just from different planets but different universes. CORNISH: Can I ask a little more about coronavirus? What do voters think about the - I don't know - the public health messages that they're getting on COVID-19? MONTANARO: Yeah. Well, first of all, the thing that jumped out to me is that those saying that they're going to get vaccinated when one comes available has dropped from 60% last month to just 49% now, and that's driven by a decline with independents and Republicans. Public health experts are still the most trusted sources of information. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say they trust them, but that's down 15 points since March. Almost all of that is driven by Republicans, which indicates Trump's campaign against some public health officials has stuck with his base. But it's not like Trump is trusted on this, you know? I mean, only a third of people said that they trust the information they're getting from their president on coronavirus. CORNISH: Anything else jump out at you? MONTANARO: I mean, the biggest thing here that jumped out that was aside from all the rest is that, you know, we've been tracking views of Black Lives Matter and protests across the country, and we've seen a decline in support. After George Floyd's death, 62% in our poll in June supported the protests, said they were mostly legitimate as opposed to mostly people acting unlawfully. Now Americans are split 48 to 45. And when it comes to Black Lives Matter, still a majority of people have a favorable view, but unfavorable views have gone up in the last month from 34% to 40% - big racial and generational splits, and most of the movement, again, comes from downward shifts with Republicans. CORNISH: Domenico, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In austere, starkly divisive remarks, President Trump on Thursday said he would create a commission to promote \"patriotic education\" and announced the creation of a grant to develop a \"pro-American curriculum.\"  The move is largely political \u2014 a reaction to a growing push by some academics for schools to teach an American history that better acknowledges slavery and systemic racism. In the speech, Trump decried what he said was a \"twisted web of lies\" being taught in U.S. classrooms about systemic racism in America, calling it \"a form of child abuse.\" He reprised themes from a speech he gave in July at Mount Rushmore. \"Teaching this horrible doctrine to our children is a form of child abuse, the truest sense,\" Trump said. \"For many years now, the radicals have mistaken Americans' silence for weakness. They're wrong. There is no more powerful force than a parent's love for their children. And patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country.\" The federal government does not have jurisdiction over school curriculum. Trump decried \"a radical movement\" working against telling a more flattering version of U.S. history as Democrats' efforts to smear the country for political gain. The president's remarks reflect a growing outcry among Republicans against recent moves to tell a more evenhanded version of the nation's history, including its early foundational reliance on slave labor and the longtime disenfranchisement of and systemic racism against racial minorities. In particular, Republicans have taken offense to The New York Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning \"1619 Project,\" which detailed the country's history from when the first enslaved Africans were brought to America's shores. \"Critical race theory, the 1619 Project, and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda, ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together.  It will destroy our country,\" the president said Thursday. Trump said schools need to focus instead on \"the legacy of 1776,\" when American Colonies declared independence from Great Britain. The newly formed committee, Trump said, will be called the \"1776 Commission\" \u2014 a further dig at The Times' project. \"American parents are not going to accept indoctrination in our schools, cancel culture at work or the repression of traditional faith, culture and values in the public square,\" Trump said. Trump blamed \"the left,\" aided by the media and unnamed corporations, for \"a vicious and violent assault on law enforcement\" and said violent protests in recent months \"are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools.\" In a shot at his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump said he would add a statue of Caesar Rodney to the National Garden of American Heroes park \u2014 a proposal he first made in his Mount Rushmore speech. A statue of Rodney, a slave owner who signed the Declaration of Independence, was removed from Wilmington, Del., this summer amid protests against police brutality and systemic racism. Trump criticized Biden for not speaking out about it. Statues paying homage to the Confederacy and other slave owners and racists have been among the most divisive issues in Trump's ongoing culture war against Democrats. Following his remarks, the phrases \"Trump Youth\" and \"Hitler Youth\" trended on Twitter, with some likening the president's new education project to the indoctrination of young people in Nazi Germany.

            "article_content": "An ad for Joe Biden's presidential campaign ran nationally during last Thursday's NFL game.\n                \n\n                    YouTube\n                    \n\nhide caption An ad for Joe Biden's presidential campaign ran nationally during last Thursday's NFL game. The NFL is back, and as millions of people tune in for the sort of live communal TV event that has been missing through much of the pandemic, they are also getting a dose of presidential politics during the commercial breaks. On Thursday night, when some 20 million people tuned in to watch the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the Houston Texans, Joe Biden's campaign was there with a minute-long campaign ad. Sixty seconds is a lot of real estate when it comes to the NFL and those ads don't come cheap. And this is only the beginning. Politics and beer ads will mix all season. A Biden campaign aide confirms to NPR that they already have reservations to run at least one ad nationally during each NFL game between now and Election Day.  Tracking firm Advertising Analytics says those prebookings add up to $25 million. \"I've never seen that before in a presidential race,\" said Ad Analytics' John Link. \"That is the first time we've seen something of that magnitude.\" Link isn't sure whether the Trump campaign will match that (they didn't on Thursday), but he is expecting it to spend big on ads during football games this fall. While the Biden campaign's ad was part of the NBC broadcast feed and hit every TV tuned in nationwide, the Trump campaign purchased $1.1 million in ads in 21 local TV markets in swing states, according to Ad Analytics. In theory, that could have allowed Trump's team to tailor its message to the issues important to individual states and regions. But, on Thursday at least, the Trump campaign aired the same ad about the \"great American comeback\" in every market. The ad starts with the line \"in the race for a vaccine, the finish line is approaching.\" During last Thursday's NFL game, the Trump campaign aired this ad in 21 local TV markets in swing states.\n                \n\n                    YouTube\n                    \n\nhide caption During last Thursday's NFL game, the Trump campaign aired this ad in 21 local TV markets in swing states. In a way, the return of NFL football is a welcome development for President Trump, long a football fan \u2014 another part of pre-pandemic life that is back. But, even as that first game was played, there were constant reminders that nothing is normal, from the socially distanced mostly empty stadium to Kansas City coach Andy Reid's fogged up face shield. The Biden campaign ad called \"Fresh Start\" that aired nationally played to the reality that life is not back to normal. \"We need to get control over the virus,\" the narrator says midway through the ad. \"Donald Trump failed. Joe Biden will get it done.\" In addition to that national buy, Ad Analytics found Biden's campaign also aired seven different ads in 18 local media markets during the game. That means Biden's team was trying different messages for different markets. The local ad targeting can give a sense of the campaign's priorities, and in a way there's not much unexpected. Biden's ads aired in the so-called \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won two of those states, Nevada and Minnesota. Meanwhile, Trump's local ads aired in a lot of states he won in 2016: Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and the blue wall states. His campaign also made a buy in Fargo, N.D., which has some overlap with Minnesota, a state Trump is hoping to flip Republican. The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story. A Biden campaign aide suggested that Trump's campaign is strapped for cash and was trying to cherry pick states that are most critical to his reelection. For the Biden campaign, a national buy is just more efficient, the aide said, because they have so many states on their target list. It also means people watching football in Texas, for instance, will see his pitch too. According to polling averages, Biden trails narrowly in Texas, a state that is traditionally an easy win for Republicans but has been gradually getting more Democratic. Spending a lot of money targeting Texas wouldn't really make sense for the Biden campaign, but having his ads air there can't hurt when that same ad is also airing in North Carolina, Florida and Michigan. For Trump, there has been some question about whether his campaign would advertise during NFL games because of his longstanding active campaign against NFL players who kneel for the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. Already in this nascent season, the calls for racial justice have been loud and clear from league-sponsored advertising to players staying in the locker room during the anthem. Last month, Trump said he was working to get the NFL restarted \"as long as they stand for our national anthem, as long as they honor our flag and our country,\" Trump said. \"If they start kneeling I'm not going to help them much. They might come back but I'm not going to be watching. Neither will a lot of other people.\" It's not clear whether he watched, but millions of others did. And with those local ad buys, Trump's campaign was trying to reach them. Kneeling or not, the power of the NFL to reach TV audiences is undeniable. \"The NFL, even pre-Covid, is the most powerful advertising vehicle,\" said Link. \"In some markets, you get Super Bowl-like numbers on a Sunday.\"",

The 2020 presidential campaign heads into the fall stretch with a dizzying pace of news developments threatening to upend the contest. But NPR interviews with voters across the country around Labor Day weekend found that most are locked into their support for either President Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The small contingent of undecided voters said they are unenthusiastic about their choices. In a conventional presidential race, any one of the grave issues in the headlines now \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic and Trump's own words about the \"deadly threat\"; a battered economy leaving millions of people jobless and businesses shuttered; the debate about a vaccine; media reports on Trump's comments about service members; wildfires engulfing the West \u2014 could turn the race for one candidate. The president's handling of the coronavirus remains the central factor in the campaign, and Democrats want to keep it that way. More than 190,000 Americans have now died from the virus. National polls consistently show Biden with a lead, but the contest will come down to an electoral map that hinges on many of the same places that gave Trump the edge four years ago. NPR's interviews found his harsh \"law and order\" rhetoric is resonating with some voters, and the fact that some unrest is happening in states that are competitive politically is causing both campaigns to ramp up attention and resources in those places. For those deciding to back Biden, meanwhile, the vote appears to be less about enthusiasm for him and more about getting rid of Trump. Here is what NPR learned from conversations with voters in several key states: Trump retains loyal support in battleground states' rural areas The president's support is still strong in the rural communities where he surged in 2016. NPR's Scott Detrow talked to Trump backers waiting to hear the president at his rally in Latrobe, Pa., last week. The president won that area by 30 percentage points in 2016, and the massive crowd that showed up for his event during the pandemic shows the deep support he still has from his loyal base. Even one dairy farmer who acknowledged that Trump's trade policies didn't always benefit him personally told Detrow he was still all in for the president. \"We'll do our part. We'll do our part when it comes down to it,\" Mike Sever said. Another voter affected by the virus and who remains unemployed doesn't blame Trump. \"First off, has there ever been a pandemic to take over the world like this in such a short period of time? I think that Trump did the best that he could, considering the circumstances,\" Amy Taylor, a fitness instructor, told Detrow. (These interviews with voters were conducted before the news broke that Trump told author Bob Woodward in February that the virus was \"deadly stuff\" and that in March, he said he deliberately \"wanted to play it down\" to avoid a panic.) The president's focus on more rural areas may have limited yield. While his core voting bloc \u2014 white voters without a college degree \u2014 made up a large percentage of nonvoters in 2016 and could turn out in greater numbers this year, an analysis of census data by NPR and the Brookings Institution indicates that his base is shrinking.

But Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won a tight Senate race in 2018, and the party sees an opportunity in 2020. The state has experienced an influx of retirees, but also includes more minority voters \u2014 especially Latino voters. KJZZ's Jimmy Jenkins talked to voters at a farmer's market in Phoenix, where some undecided voters said they were not thrilled with their choices. Kevin Wood told him, \"I'm an independent, but this year, it's a clear choice. Gotta go one way, so we're gonna go the Biden way.\" He cited the Democrat's temperament as a key factor. But the national attention on protests has Trump supporters who rallied for him at the state Capitol last weekend pledging to stick with him. \"He's my law-and-order president. That's who he is. And the other ones are for chaos and no order,\" Ralph Ruggiero, who was carrying a \"Liberty or Death\" sign, told Jenkins.

KTEP's Angela Kocherga visited El Paso, one of Texas' few strongholds for Democrats. Party members believe one factor that could make places like Texas competitive is their effort to pump up youth turnout \u2014 a bloc that tends to have the lowest turnout rate, but one that leans Democratic. But Kocherga found younger voters in El Paso were split on whether their vote would even matter \u2014 a sign the party still has work to do. David Ashcroft, a 21-year-old waiter, appeared repelled by both candidates. \"It kind of makes me sick to my stomach just knowing that I put one of these people in office,\" he told Kocherga. \"The best thing for me is just to not vote.\" Amanda Kilcrease, a 20-year-old college student, said, \"It just feels like if Trump wins again, like, then \u2014 and I didn't vote, I would have guilt with that, too, that I didn't take a small action that could have had an opposite outcome. But I'm also not happy with the outcome of Biden. I just want to stress that.\" A \"law and order\" message in crucial Wisconsin The killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May triggered a national movement calling for racial justice. But the Trump campaign seized on the unrest \u2014 sometimes violent in several urban areas across the country \u2014 to argue that Democrats were soft on crime and that if Biden won, the threat against law enforcement would grow and spread to the suburbs. The theme was prevalent throughout the Republican convention, with a focus on protests in Kenosha, Wis., following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man paralyzed after being shot multiple times in the back in late August. The incident put the issue that the president has been focused on front and center in a state Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016. Both the president and Biden visited Wisconsin last week \u2014 with very different messages. Trump lauded local law enforcement and highlighted local businesses damaged by riots. Biden met with Blake's family and called the president's rhetoric divisive, blaming him for further polarizing the country at a time when race relations are fragile.

Maayan Silver, from WUWM, talked to voters in the area, many of whom suggested the back-and-forth over the issue was simply reinforcing their positions on the two candidates. Jan Kaminski, one voter who didn't say which way she was planning to vote, said she watched the conventions and seemed more swayed by the GOP message. \"Well, there is something to be said when they say all these major \u2014 these cities that are having problems are run by Democrats. I didn't know that,\" Kaminski told Silver. \"You know, you have to ... look what they did in Kenosha when the National Guard came in and enough backup came. You know, the rioting and all that stopped.\" But one former supporter of Trump's who expressed concerns about looting and unrest in Wisconsin did tell Silver she couldn't back him again. \"He just wants people to riot. He instills riots and discord,\" said Karen Cayman, who lives in an area north of Milwaukee. Like other key swing states, the effort by the Trump campaign to push up votes from rural parts of Wisconsin could help him again. But Democrats vow not to have a repeat of 2016, when turnout dropped in urban areas like Milwaukee and Madison, and Hillary Clinton's campaign appeared not to pay enough attention to the state. Additionally, activists \u2014 seeing an uptick in people coming out for demonstrations \u2014 vow that a focus on racial justice issues is motivating people not just to protest, but to vote. Lauren Cross, involved in the Kenosha protests, told Silver about those on the streets: \"I think, like, all the people out here are voting against Trump in some capacity.\" Two Midwestern states give the campaigns reasons for hope Both the president and Biden have visited Michigan in recent days, and the state was part of the \"blue wall\" of three Midwest states that flipped and supported Trump, handing him the White House in 2016. WKAR's Abigail Censky visited one town, Williamston, that is competitive this time around and where there appears to be a split. Its congressional district backed Trump in 2016 but elected a Democrat, Elissa Slotkin, to Congress in 2018. Todd Gardner said that there still is a lot of support for Trump, but that he's prepared to back \"anybody but Donald Trump.\" He's attracted to Biden's pitch to return to a high level of civil discourse. \"My hope is that the tone of the presidency can return to what used to be normal,\" he told Censky. \"I think this has not been a normal four years of a president, and I really would like to get back to people not shouting at each other. I know we live in a divided nation, but it just seems he's made it more divided than it has to be.\" Republican state Rep.

Dale Lueck represents Aitkin and the surrounding area in rural Minnesota. Minnesota voted for Clinton in 2016, but a combination of the reaction to the looting in Minneapolis and broader local economic issues are boosting GOP prospects in the state. Minnesota Public Radio's Mark Zdechlik talked to Gretchen, a registered Democrat in Aitken, a rural town in the northern part of the state. She declined to give her last name because of concerns about the impact on her business, but she said she is disillusioned by Democrats now, pointing to unrest in Minneapolis earlier this year and in other cities, and said even though she backed Clinton four years ago, she cannot get behind Biden. \"The Republican Party is kind of speaking to my heart more than the Democrats so I think I'm going to have to vote Trump this time,\" Gretchen said. While Gretchen was among a small group of voters who were moving to a new party in 2020, many voters whom NPR and station reporters talked to had strong feelings about why they were sticking with their preferred candidate. Sheri Holman, a Michigan union member who is among a bloc in the state who abandoned Democrats for Trump in 2016, is sticking with the president, even though she admits she doesn't like him personally. \"He's a strong \u2014 he's got a strong backbone,\" she said. But she isn't convinced that after Election Day the country will move past the intense partisan split. \"I'm sure there'll be riots no matter which way it goes,\" she says.

            "article_content": "Generation Z is the most diverse and digitally connected generation in the U.S. As the general election nears, NPR talks with three young Los Angeles voters about the issues that matter most to them.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: I have been getting to know some of the youngest people who will be voting in this year's election - Gen Z. Born after 1996, they are the most racially diverse and digitally connected generation in U.S. history. Their formative years have been pockmarked by recession, war, a climate crisis, mass shootings, the aftermath of the 2016 election, endless videos of police violence and now a global pandemic. And so I wanted to know, what shape do their political opinions take? About 24 million Gen Zers will be eligible to vote in November. And for many of them, this will be their very first presidential election. We'll be talking to conservative Gen Z voters in a later show. But we're going to start this series right here in LA where Gen Zer's lean overwhelmingly progressive, like James Kweisi Butler in Koreatown. JAMES KWEISI BUTLER: This is my little humble abode here. CHANG: Oh, this is gorgeous. Also gorgeous - Butler's little, very obedient dog, Milo. BUTLER: This is my son. This is my pride and joy. I'm a single father of one, right, Milo? CHANG: Butler is 22. He is a professional model, dancer and actor. And his apartment doubles as a studio for his fourth passion. BUTLER: And I just take my condenser microphone and I prop it up. And then... CHANG: This is where he tapes videos for his YouTube channel. BUTLER: ...Energy and things to talk about with you all. It has been a wild year for sure. So my name is James Kweisi, and I'll see you in my next video. Bye. And I will not get arrested again. OK. CHANG: Butler, who's queer and Black, uses YouTube as a journal of sorts, where he pours out thoughts about his personal life and his politics. He was arrested six times the last few months, mostly for staying out past curfew during the racial justice protests. BUTLER: It's like, what? There's no curfew to protesting. Like, they don't have a curfew on killing Black people. OK? So why am I going to listen to the same people who are oppressing me? I'm saying [expletive] you. But then when you tell me to go home at 6, I'm like, OK, yes, master. No. Like, my ancestors, my people, we've done that for too long. CHANG: Butler was raised in the foster care system until he was 15 years old. They were rough years. Even joyful memories from back then, like the election of Barack Obama as president, carry specks of pain. BUTLER: I, like, cried by myself. I was young as [expletive]. I was, like, 10, 11, but I cried because a Black man was president, and I was just in a house that told me I have to shave my head off because only girls can have long hair. CHANG: How much do you think your years in foster care, like all the interaction you had with social workers and lawyers and foster parents - how much do you think all of that affected your confidence in the system today? BUTLER: Huge. Because I was around these cops and, like you said, lawyers and social workers all the time. And to hear their conversations was sickening, honestly. CHANG: What do you mean? BUTLER: The lack of true support and, like, care that they have for these children. So many children are abused through the foster care system and ignored. CHANG: And Butler's loss of confidence in the foster care system eroded his confidence in the political system, too. BUTLER: Why do you want to still bow down to a constitution that was [expletive] up and written hundreds of years ago? We're not in hundreds of years ago. When that was written, women, children and Black people were property. Why do we still look at that as our, like, model? Like, do you know what I mean? CHANG: Do you want to blow up the Constitution? Is that what you're saying? BUTLER: Oh, I would love that. But we just need to change it. We need to change it. We need to update it, you know? CHANG: Still, he is going to vote for president this year. And right now, the only feasible choice for him is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. But it is a ticket that comes with baggage, he says. He thinks too many Black people were arrested under Harris' watch as a prosecutor. That said, what he does appreciate about this ticket is that Biden is positioning a Black woman to potentially become the next president of the United States. BUTLER: We need to hear from Black women. Black men need to hear from Black woman. Black people need to hear from Black women. White people need to hear from Black women. We need to hear Black women voices amplified and loud - loud. CHANG: Because right now, Butler says, the political system only works for rich, white people. So he started a group called the Black Future Project, which pushes for racial justice and demands criminal justice reforms like defunding the police. For Butler, that is just a small step towards dismantling an entire system that is rotten at its core. Of course, not all Gen Zers are intent on blowing up the system. Some are ecstatic just being able to participate in it for the first time. Hi, Manny. Nice wheels. Do you skateboard everywhere? MANNY CRUZ: Yes, I actually do. I'm trying to work on getting my license and taking my permit test. So right now, I'm skating everywhere I go. CHANG: Oh, really? Manny Cruz, who just started college at Cal State Dominguez Hills, met me at a park in Culver City. It's a five-minute skateboard ride away from the two-bedroom apartment where he lives with several family members. CRUZ: It's my mom, my brother, his fiancee, my two nephews, my little brother, my dog and my bunny (laughter). CHANG: And your bunny? CRUZ: (Laughter) Yeah. CHANG: Cruz just turned 18 a few months ago, right in time for the presidential election. So how does it feel being able to vote for the first time this year? CRUZ: It's overwhelming because of, you know, everything going on. And it's like, wow, it can really make a difference what I choose to do. CHANG: But Cruz feels he still has so much to learn about the political system. He didn't grow up talking about politics with his parents, who came from Oaxaca, Mexico, 19 years ago. CRUZ: In, like, a household coming from an immigrant family, you're more focused on your education. You're more focused on getting by yourself. CHANG: And getting by became even more of a focus when the pandemic hit. Both his mother, who cleans houses, and his brother, who's a barber, lost work. So Cruz took on double shifts at In-N-Out Burger to help the family get through the pandemic. He says living this reality while watching the Trump administration's hostile actions towards immigrants, it's one of the reasons he's voting for Joe Biden. And he says the problem isn't President Trump himself; it's what his victory in 2016 revealed about Americans. CRUZ: You can be angry at Donald Trump all you want. But ultimately, we as a country chose to put him there. In reality, he's just exposed a lot of things within ourselves. A lot of people voted for him because they shared a perspective that he had. CHANG: And what is that perspective? CRUZ: I'm not by any means saying the Republicans are racist, but I will say just generally a lot of people who I've seen support him tend to have a lot of racist perspectives. CHANG: Year after year, the Hispanic vote is more consequential. In fact, Pew Research Center says 1 in 4 Gen Zers in the U.S. is Hispanic. And with that growing influence, Cruz says it is up to the Latino community to get informed and to vote. CRUZ: With a new candidate comes new possibilities. So I feel with my first time being able to vote, I can take a step towards that possibility of a difference. So I feel it matters a lot, and I wish everyone knew that, too. CHANG: But other Gen Zers we talked to, they feel that sitting out the presidential election is actually a better way to send a message. That's how it is for Ina Morton. I met up with her at Pan Pacific Park, where she had protested against racial injustice just a few months ago. INA MORTON: Yeah, just all around here, I remember people being, you know, kind of stacked on the sides of the hills, as well as... CHANG: Morton is 20. She's half Filipina, half white, a student at Occidental College. And she has no intention of voting for any presidential candidate this year. MORTON: What I would say was the last domino to fall for me was seeing Bernie get shut out this year after being shut out in 2016. I didn't think he was a perfect guy. I didn't love him or see him as, like, this cult of personality. But I saw him as, like, a very real change to what the legacy of politics in this country had been. CHANG: And Morton says watching Sanders get shut out reminded her how far off track the Democratic Party has gotten. According to Pew, Gen Z is the country's most pro-government, anti-Trump generation. But Morton says Democrats should not count on Gen Zers to be automatic allies. MORTON: When the Democratic Party coalesced around Joe Biden, I remember unregistering from the Democratic Party that day. CHANG: Really? MORTON: Yeah. CHANG: That's how against Joe Biden you are. MORTON: Yeah. I mean, it's not just... CHANG: Why? What does he represent to you that is wrong? MORTON: Yeah. It's not just Joe Biden. I mean, it is, really, the Democratic Party as well. CHANG: Morton says she's grown to resent over time the sorts of positions Democrats continue to take. And since Biden will probably win a blue state like California anyway, she's not going to give him her vote. MORTON: If I am voting for a candidate who, you know, is the left of two but it's still anti-health care, anti-social housing, I am negotiating for the better of two odds. But at the end of the day, I'm still negotiating for my defeat. CHANG: And so she's devoting herself to grassroots organizing. She started working for local politicians at the age of 14 but now thinks that grassroots organizing is a more direct path to change. Morton now leads a coalition of groups that demand racial justice, environmental justice and housing rights for all. I listened to her talk about the Black Lives Matter movement... MORTON: And wanted to stand, you know, in solidarity with BLMLA. CHANG: ...The welfare system... MORTON: Having a mutual aid format instead of, like, this idea of a welfare system. CHANG: ...The housing crisis... MORTON: So many people who are either unhoused or who will likely become unhoused. CHANG: ...And the environment... MORTON: If I live for another, like, 50 or 60 years, the climate is going to start getting pretty unlivable. CHANG: ...And I came away wondering... What is it that you grew up with that thinks - makes your generation sound the way you sound right now? MORTON: Yeah. I think there's so many things. Like, I don't remember a life pre-9/11. So I have grown up under the guise of what so many people would describe as a surveillance state. Like, I don't know what it's like to live in a country where the U.S. hasn't been bombing children in the Middle East. And I've seen, like, even under the most progressive presidents to date, Barack Obama, you know, protesters are still brutalized in Ferguson and Standing Rock. And then the same thing is happening again. And I think now is a time to, like, have a little faith in the idea of being radical and re-imagining what the world could look like. CHANG: Re-imagining the world isn't exactly easy, but Morton says, it is worth a try. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a summer of unrest over police violence, you might think that suing the police is a way for the families of those killed to get justice. It can be, but the amount of justice available \u2014 in monetary settlements from cities and towns \u2014 may depend on the local politics of where the killing happened. That's according to an NPR analysis of civil case settlements in 2015, the year following protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the police killing of Michael Brown. We chose 2015 both because it was the immediate aftermath of the Ferguson protests and because it was long enough ago that most of the cases would have been resolved. During that year, we found 93 police cases in which an officer killed a person who had not been armed with a gun or other weapon. Of those cases, we found that 29 of them \u2014 nearly a third \u2014 ended in a settlement for the families of those killed. To find and categorize the cases, we reviewed reports in other media, as well as documents from courts and local governments. The largest settlements stemming from those deaths occurred in counties that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In the counties that voted for Clinton, there were 61 fatal incidents. Twenty of those cases settled for a total of more than $50 million, or about $2.6 million per case. Most of the settlements were for more than $1 million. In the counties that voted for candidate Donald Trump, there were 31 deaths. Eight of those cases were settled, for a total of $14 million, or about $1.8 million per case. Three settlements topped $1 million. (One death that led to a large settlement occurred in a city that straddles three counties where the presidential vote was mixed. It was excluded from our tally, as was one settlement for which the amount was not disclosed.) Now, six years after Ferguson, civil rights lawyers say there may be new connections developing between the courts and popular opinion on police. Black Lives Matter protests have been polarizing, they say, and are hardening political divisions about law enforcement on both sides. The latest Ipsos/NPR poll out Sept. 3 backs this up: Three out of four Democrats support recent protests in the wake of the Kenosha, Wis., shooting of Jacob Blake, while fewer than 1 in 10 Republicans do. Lawyers say that if such divisions extend to legal disputes over police behavior, there can be stark differences across the country \u2014 in terms of localities' inclination to settle cases and of local jurors' willingness to hold police officers accountable. Dave O'Brien, an Iowa lawyer who exclusively represents civil rights plaintiffs, spoke with NPR just after losing a jury trial in a police brutality case in Sioux City, a conservative town in a conservative state. It was a case he expected to win. And while he says he doesn't want to read too much into a single case, he blames the loss on a community backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement. \"I've previously had a lot of success with true-blue conservative (jurors) \u2013 somebody who believes in individual liberty and not allowing the government to take advantage of an individual,\" O'Brien says. \"Those people, I love on my juries. But my reading of this case was that as a result of Black Lives Matter, the backlash has pushed them towards a pro-police stance that they previously didn't take.\" O'Brien says that he used to be able to persuade conservative gun owners to cherish the civil rights he was fighting for in police brutality cases, just as they value their right to bear arms. But something has changed. A protester stands face to face with police during demonstrations over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., in August.\n                \n                    \n                    Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protester stands face to face with police during demonstrations over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., in August. In conversations with potential jurors during jury selection, he says jurors \"just felt like Black Lives Matter was a bit too much of an overreaction and anti-police. We had to overcome it, and we didn't do it successfully.\" On the other hand, in more liberal Los Angeles County, veteran civil rights lawyer James DeSimone is seeing a different effect. \"I do believe that the jury pools here in California have become more open to finding police liable in appropriate cases,\" he says. \"As more people become aware that not all police officers can be believed, that in circumstances of excessive force, police officers should be held liable, that makes our job easier.\" Clark Neily, a former trial lawyer and vice president for criminal justice at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says NPR's findings and what they suggest about the current political moment aren't surprising. \"This probably reflects, to some extent, the plaintiff's lawyers and the defense lawyer's projections about what's likely to happen if the case proceeds to trial and there is a verdict,\" he says. The Cato Institute has called for increased legal accountability on the part of police, particularly by ending the legal doctrine of qualified immunity, which has insulated them from liability. \"We have a persistently racially disparate criminal justice system,\" Neily says, \"The communities of color tend to bear the brunt of the most significant pathologies in the system. It's especially acute now with the frustration and resentment that is spilling out into the street.\" But some lawyers wonder whether the legal environment this year and next will look more like the aftermath of 2014's Ferguson protests in some cities, and in others, just the opposite. \"The cases where I had the most success and the largest settlement values was when the riots in Ferguson were going on,\" says Missouri attorney Joshua Roberts. \"The cities down here were, 'We want to get this out of the news, we want to get this resolved.' And they were a lot less cantankerous to deal with.\" Currently, though, the climate in southwest Missouri is \"very pro-law enforcement,\" he says. In this summer of protests, William O. Wagstaff III, a New York civil rights attorney, says he routinely convenes groups of people of different demographic backgrounds to react to the facts of particular cases. He says he doesn't want to make \"outdated assumptions\" about them. \"I have noticed a shift in perspectives from people I would previously consider to be liberal and sympathetic to issues of racial inequalities in policing,\" Wagstaff says, \"because they believe the rallying cry for accountability has gone too far.\" For families of those killed by police to file suit, they must first believe they can fight city hall and find a lawyer who agrees. And if local politics seem pro-police, families may be discouraged from filing a suit at all. In fact, about half the deaths NPR reviewed did not result in a lawsuit. To Sherene Mayner, the town of Paris, Texas, where her son, Garrett McKinney, was killed by police in 2015, seemed pro-police and wary of outsiders \u2014 as some there called her son after his death. Mayner, who works as a Realtor in Austin, says her son suffered from schizophrenia and physically attacked the officer after being Tased. She says the small-town climate in Paris inhibited her from asking questions about Garrett's death. She fights back tears as she recounts that months later, the Highway Patrol officer who shot Garrett during a struggle was awarded a Purple Heart by the Texas Department of Public Safety in connection with the shooting.\"He just shot my son, and no one called me to say, 'I'm sorry,' \" she says, remembering seeing a photo of the officer, Timothy Keele, displaying his award. \"That always bothered me,\" she says, \"He got this award, and he's all smiling and grinning when he's getting this award, and I'm like, 'Oh, you've got to be kidding me.' \" So far, Mayner has not filed a lawsuit in the shooting.",

            "article_content": "The 100th day protests in Portland, Ore., looked a lot like many of the days before: groups marched and met peacefully, and then, at night, police clashed with protesters.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: With the election less than two months away, demonstrations over racial justice are leading to confrontations - sometimes violent - with police and armed right-wing groups. This is what's happened in just the past 24 hours. In Louisville, Ky., ahead of the Kentucky Derby, armed far-right militia members marched through the streets to confront Black Lives Matter supporters protesting the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in that city. There was only a small scuffle, and heated words were exchanged. In Rochester, N.Y., yesterday, police used tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse hundreds of people gathered to protest the death there of Daniel Prude, who died after being restrained by local police in March. And in Portland, Ore., a milestone was reached yesterday. For the 100th consecutive day, people took to the streets to protest racial injustice. Police declared a riot, launching tear gas, impact munitions and making arrests. NPR's Nathan Rott is in Portland, and he joins us now. Good morning. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What happened last night? ROTT: So given how high the concerns were, it was actually a pretty normal night. And I - normal being a admittedly weird word to use for a night where tear gas was fired in a residential neighborhood. But there were a lot of worries that things were going to be worse, given that two people have been shot and killed in the last week. One was a man who was shot here in Portland after sort of counter-protesting the protesters and then the other being a man that authorities believe was involved in that first shooting. He was killed by federal police in Washington on Thursday. There was a memorial for Aaron J. Danielson, the counter-protester I mentioned. He's a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer. With those extra people here, there were concerns that last night's protests were going to be a lot more intense. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But that turned out not to be the case. What happened? ROTT: Well, you know, you had hundreds of protesters gather again, but I did not see any counter-protesters there at the vigil we were at earlier. People were saying, you know, let's be peaceful. The confrontations that I saw were mostly between protesters and the Portland police, which had declared the gathering a riot not long after it started at 9 p.m. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So how are people in the community holding up after so many nights of tensions? ROTT: You know, I think it's important to remember that Portland's a really big place. And... GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right. ROTT: ...Given how the situation here is being portrayed by certain people, you know, the president of the United States among them - these protests are only happening in small parts of the city. That said, you know, some of the people I've talked to last night said that they were just kind of tired. One was Ramone Mills (ph). And I asked him what he thought about the hundred days of protest, and here's what he said. RAMONE MILLS: I think it's been maybe 45 days of protests, 50 days of riots. Do I see it end anytime soon? No. ROTT: So Mills - you can hear there - was just frustrated because he supports Black Lives Matter, but he thinks what's happening in parts of Portland is not productive. And as a Black man who says he's been profiled and abused by police, he thinks there needs to be police reform, but he just does not think that this is the way to do it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So with this backdrop, do you think that these protests are going to continue if people in the community feel like maybe they've gone on too long? ROTT: You know, I think, you know, people are going to be frustrated, but there's no reason that these protests wouldn't keep going. Today, there are more protests planned. Tomorrow, on Labor Day, there's expected to be another caravan of Trump supporters that are coming to Portland. Remember, it was a similar setting that led to that fatal shooting last week. So I think these protests are going to continue well into the future, and hopefully they don't become as violent as some of them have become in the last week. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nathan Rott. Thank you so much, Nate. ROTT: Thank you, Lulu. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As the nation grapples with questions of racial justice, Americans are increasingly polarized, according to a new poll, with Republicans far less likely to support protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake than previous demonstrations. More Americans support than oppose recent protests after the shooting in Kenosha, Wis., according to the poll by the research firm Ipsos, provided exclusively to NPR. But sharp divisions are emerging along racial and political party lines. Two-thirds of Black respondents support the protests, compared with just over one-third of whites and less than half of Hispanics. The division among party affiliations is even more stark: 3 out of 4 Democrats say they support the protests, compared with fewer than 1 in 10 Republicans. The poll of 1,008 U.S. adults was conducted Aug. 28-31. The margin of error for the overall sample is 3 percentage points. Loading... These divisions have become even more entrenched since the spring, when George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody sparked protests across the country. Nearly 45% of Republicans told Ipsos in June that they supported demonstrations against police brutality. \"There is a significant shift at the partisan level,\" said Mallory Newall, a pollster at Ipsos, which has been tracking public opinion about racial justice protests for months. \"You are seeing a certain segment of the population that is the Republican base responding to how the president is communicating around these issues.\" President Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday, while former Vice President Joe Biden plans to travel there Thursday. The two presidential candidates have offered dramatically differing views on the protests. Trump met with police and toured a section of Kenosha damaged by rioting that followed the shooting of Blake, a 29-year-old Black man who was left paralyzed, according to his family. The president called violence that erupted at the protests \"domestic terrorism\" and defended Kyle Rittenhouse, the young white man who's accused of shooting and killing two protesters in Wisconsin. Biden told reporters on Wednesday that protesting and free speech is a right, but he denounced violence and looting. The former vice president again blamed President Trump for stoking division and violence for political gain. About one-third of poll respondents said they didn't have an opinion about how Trump and Biden have responded to protests and demonstrations taking place in Wisconsin and across the country following Blake's shooting. The Ipsos poll took place before Trump's visit to Kenosha. \"Amidst all of the rhetoric around this issue, a fair number of Americans remain at least somewhat ambivalent,\" Newall said. When poll respondents did register an opinion, only about one-quarter said they support President Trump's response to the protests, according to Ipsos. That included just 6% of Democrats. \"He is adding a lot of gasoline to a fire that's already kind of burning on its own,\" said Laurie Dozier, a Democrat from Cleveland. \"I think that he likes it. He likes exciting his base,\" said Dozier, who is Black. \"He thinks it's good for his numbers. He's all about the polling numbers.\" The president's response to the protests has been overwhelmingly popular with one group: Republicans. Nearly 69% support him. \"I don't believe what they're doing is good for the Black community,\" Edward Bluemel, a Republican from the Chicago suburbs, said about the protesters in Wisconsin and elsewhere. Bluemel, who is white, says it was \"very excessive\" for police officers to shoot Blake seven times in the back. But he blames Democratic mayors and governors, saying they allowed protests to become violent, echoing one of Trump's frequent talking points. \"They're out there rioting and looting and burning. It's just like a crime spree,\" Bluemel said. \"I really believe that the Democrats, they're letting this go. Just because there's an election coming up, and it'll make the Republicans look bad.\" Loading... Ipsos also asked poll respondents to rate how other political figures and institutions responded to the protests. More than 4 in 10 people said they supported the response of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as NBA players who decided to boycott several playoff games last week in protest. But here, too, the reactions broke down along familiar partisan and racial lines with few Republicans expressing support for how NBA players and Black Lives Matter responded, compared with overwhelming support from Democrats. A majority of respondents reported paying either a \"great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" of attention to Blake's shooting; only 9% said they haven't heard anything at all. Still, when it came to the reactions of local officials \u2014 Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is leading the investigation into Blake's shooting \u2014 most respondents didn't know how to rate their response. The poll did reveal a few areas of agreement. For instance, three-quarters of all respondents said violence and damage caused by some protesters discredits the goal of achieving racial justice. On his visit to Kenosha this week, President Trump denied that there is systemic racism in U.S. institutions. But the Ipsos poll found that a majority of Americans disagree. More than half of respondents said racism is built into the U.S. economy, schools and police departments. And only 30% agreed that \"America is not a racist country.\" When asked about the future, a large majority of whites and Republicans say it's likely that police treatment of Blacks will improve in coming years. But Black respondents are much more pessimistic; 2 out of 3 say that is not likely to happen.",

Updated at 4:45 p.m. ET Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Thursday with Jacob Blake's family and members of the community during a visit to Kenosha, Wis. Protests against the police shooting of Blake, who was severely wounded and left paralyzed by local law enforcement, are ongoing. Describing his phone call with Blake, who is still hospitalized but out of intensive care, Biden said, \"He talked about how nothing was going to defeat him. How, whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up.\" Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived in Kenosha two days after 2020 rival President Trump made a controversial trip to the city. Trump, who visited Kenosha against the wishes of the mayor, did not meet with Blake's family when he was there Tuesday. Trump visited businesses damaged by riots and held a roundtable largely focused on praising law enforcement, but he did include the pastor for Blake's mother. Meeting with the Blakes Blake's attorney, Ben Crump, in a statement on Thursday described Biden's in-person meeting with the family \u2014 including Blake's father, sisters and brother, with Blake and his mother joining by phone \u2014 as a \"very engaging\" 90-minute conversation. \"The family was grateful for the meeting and was very impressed that the Bidens were so engaged and willing to really listen. Jacob's mother led them all in prayer for Jacob's recovery,\" Crump said. \"Mr. Blake Sr. talked about the need for systemic reform because the excessive use of force by police against minorities has been going on for far too long,\" the statement continued. \"Jacob Jr. shared about the pain he is enduring, and the vice president commiserated. The vice president told the family that he believes the best of America is in all of us and that we need to value all our differences as we come together in America's great melting pot. It was very obvious that Vice President Biden cared, as he extended to Jacob Jr. a sense of humanity, treating him as a person worthy of consideration and prayer.\" Hate \"only hides\" During the community meeting Thursday afternoon, Biden painted Trump's rhetoric as divisive and his presidency as sanctioning violent racism. \"The words of a president matter,\" Biden said at the social-distanced event. \"I thought you could defeat hate. It only hides. It only hides. And when someone in authority breathes oxygen under that rock, it legitimizes folks to come on out,\" he continued, pointing to the 2017 white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Va., where an anti-racism protester was killed. \"I hadn't planned on running for anything again after my son had died ... until I saw those people come out of Charlottesville carrying torches,\" he said. The Biden campaign had previously described Trump's appearance in the state as \"self-centered divisiveness accompanied by zero solutions.\" \"Trump failed once again to meet the moment, refusing to utter the words that Wisconsinites and Americans across the country needed to hear today from the president: a condemnation of violence of all kinds, no matter who commits it,\" it said. Wisconsin is an important battleground state, which Trump won by just more than 20,000 votes in 2016. The Aug. 23 shooting of Blake rattled a country already facing more critical examination of American race relations and the way police have historically wielded power and used violence against its Black citizens. Blake was shot multiple times in the back at close range in front of his young sons, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. During protests against that shooting, which had at times resulted in rioting and property damage, two people were shot and killed and a third wounded. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Illinois resident and pro-police counterprotester, faces homicide charges. Loading...",

The old metal gumball machine is still there - standing in a corner near the door. It's scorched and some of its plastic is melted but it's still standing there. But very little else inside what was The Good Taste Ice Cream Shoppe in Kenosha is recognizable as the blackened remains of the roof, walls, tables, chairs, and other fixtures are scattered about in heaps of charred wood and twisted and scorched metal. It's one of several shops on this busy commercial strip on 22nd Avenue in Kenosha's mostly Black Uptown neighborhood that were burned to the ground or severely damaged during a few nights of rioting last week in Kenosha. The fires also destroyed second floor apartments above some of these shops; dozens of residents lost nearly everything and are now homeless. As residents of this city of 100,000 along the shores of Lake Michigan between Chicago and Milwaukee clean up the damage, they lament the violence and destruction that left this and other swaths of their city damaged or destroyed. But many said they understand the anger and frustration that led to it.

The shooting of Jacob Blake on Sunday, Aug. 23, set off a series of protests that gave way to violence for three straight nights. Downtown Kenosha, storefronts and vehicles were damaged. A used car dealership, a furniture store and the state parole office were burned to the ground. But the destruction was much greater in Kenosha's Uptown area. Walking down 22nd Ave. with his young son, Kenneth Smith, 42, takes in the damage in disbelief. \"It's sad, it's really sad. There's no other word for it but just sad, man,\" Smith said. \"To look at it like this and to see it how it was just a week ago, it's sad.\" Smith ticked off the businesses he'd once patronized that are now damaged or destroyed: The Mexican ice cream shop called The Good Taste. A men's clothing store called Trends. Uptown Pantry, the convenience store.

But says he doesn't believe anyone local would have torched those shops, \"because why would they? You know, you got a lot of people in this area that eat in the Uptown area. I don't see 'em burning down a place that they spend money at on a regular basis.\" \"This is one of the ways that \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 people know how to take out their anger, because peaceful protests since the '60s have not evidently been too effective,\" says Eric Vines, 58, who was walking down the block surveying the damage with his brother, both of whom were born and raised in Kenosha. \"I'm not saying this is the proper way to do it, but it's gotten a lot of attention.\" Angela Elliott (C) takes a picture in front of a mural she helped to create on the boarded windows of a business in the Uptown neighborhood of Kenosha, WI on August 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Angela Elliott (C) takes a picture in front of a mural she helped to create on the boarded windows of a business in the Uptown neighborhood of Kenosha, WI on August 28. Since the fires, a stream of volunteers, many of them white, have come to Uptown to help clean the area and install plywood. On this day, the volunteers were painting the plywood, mostly with generic inoffensive messages like \"Peace and Love\" and \"Kenosha Strong.\" Some include Bible verses and messages of faith. Asked whether he thought the volunteers came to 22nd Avenue often before all this, Vines, who is Black, laughed. \"Obviously and evidently, we can look around and see that, no. The [answer] is no,\" he says. \"But it's just unity, that's what it is. It's people having empathy and love for each other. That's what this is. And I appreciate that.\" \"I don't even know how long it will take all this to come back, or if it will. I hope it does,\" Vines says.

Keye Voigt, a public insurance adjuster, was working inside a salon on 22nd Avenue. He said he's working for multiple businesses in Kenosha, many of whom he guessed may not reopen. \"Covid crushed them. Kenosha's having its own issues, obviously. With the current state of affairs, a lot of these businesses aren't going to make it,\" he said. One of  Voigt's clients had been offered just $5000 by the insurance company, he said. Another's claim had been denied entirely because the insurance company said the fires fell under a policy exemption for acts of terrorism. The city of Kenosha has not yet released an estimate of the total damage, but Voigt guessed it would be in the tens of millions of dollars. \"This is the last thing people need right now, is their building being burned down, their business being destroyed. So I hope it ends,\" says Voigt. The recovery could be especially difficult because Black Kenoshans are already at significant economic disadvantage compared to their white neighbors.

Southeast Wisconsin is by some measures the most racially segregated region of the country, and the economic conditions for Black residents in this region rank among the worst in the country in a number of metrics. A study published in July by Marc Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, laid out a sobering list of statistics about the status of Black residents in the region in 2020. \"On almost all of the indicators... from poverty to employment to general income trends, to income inequality, incarceration trends, school segregation levels \u2014 Black Milwaukee ranked either the worst or next to worst among the nation's fifty largest metropolitan areas,\" Levine says. \"And in fact, on most indicators that I've looked at, the status of the Black community in Kenosha is actually slightly worse than Milwaukee.\" A sign stating \"#KENOSHASTRONG\" sits on a pile of bricks in front of a destroyed building in the Uptown neighborhood of Kenosha, WI.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A sign stating \"#KENOSHASTRONG\" sits on a pile of bricks in front of a destroyed building in the Uptown neighborhood of Kenosha, WI. The median Black household in the Milwaukee area earns just 44% of the median white household. Among the nation's largest metro areas, Milwaukee has the second-lowest Black home ownership rate. School segregation in the Milwaukee area, measured by how likely Black children are to attend a school where students are 90% non-white, is essentially unchanged since 1965. A white high school dropout has about the same likelihood of having a job as Black high school graduate. Here in Kenosha, a third of Black residents live below the poverty line, while just 13% of white residents do. A Black worker in Kenosha earns about half that which a white worker earns. It's not just that Black Kenoshans are worse off than their white neighbors; it's that they're worse off here than almost anywhere else in the country on almost every measure. \"In most communities, there isn't this uniformity of poor standing on all of these indicators,\" Levine says. \"The startling thing is how almost uniformly on almost any indicator of consequence that one looks at, [southeast Wisconsin] ranks worst.\" A man rides a scooter past a boarded-up Uptown Pantry in Kenosha, WI.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A man rides a scooter past a boarded-up Uptown Pantry in Kenosha, WI. Another startling aspect of the study, Levine says, is how little the trends in Southeast Wisconsin have changed over the years. \"In some communities (elsewhere around the country), there have been improvements on a number of indicators,\" he says. But not in Milwaukee and the cities of Racine and Kenosha. Levine points to segregation levels as a key indicator, where even in notoriously segregated cities like Chicago and Boston there have been slight improvements. \"Because segregation is the linchpin separating Black Americans in their neighborhoods from economic opportunities. Milwaukee has had only a tiny decline.\" says Levine. \"And that does make us stand out.\" \"It's very divided and it always has been,\" says Tanya McLean, who was born and raised in Kenosha, and she says she found out just how much so when moving back here after college and serving in the military.

So what does that say?\" McLean adds.  \"I mean, the jobs are lacking here. The opportunities are lacking. Something has to change here or this (unrest) is going to continue.\" All of this plus a history of poor relations with Kenosha police have laid the groundwork for the current discontent, Black residents say.

And the reason she says she has very little hope is \"because of Trump being in office. I mean, he is inciting hate and people are drinking the kool-aid.\" But Revere says local leaders deserve criticism for the wide racial inequities and racially biased policing, too. At a huge protest march and rally Saturday, she carried a sign calling for the resignations of Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth and the city's Police Chief Daniel Miskinis. Beth has a history of racially charged comments.

Many young members of the Republican Party are not supporting him and worry about the future of the GOP, given that it's now defined by Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks during the first day of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., where he was unanimously supported by delegates for reelection. Many young members of the Republican Party are not supporting him and worry about the future of the GOP, given that it's now defined by Trump. Lizzie Bond was just shy of being old enough to vote in the 2016 presidential election. She supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the primary. But when Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presidential nominee, Bond made a different choice: She supported Hillary Clinton's campaign instead. \"You know, it was actually a harder decision to decide who I wanted to support within the lineup of Republican candidates than it was to decide whether to support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\" said Bond, who is now 21 and a senior at Duke University. In 2016, Bond joined a group of Republican women campaigning for Clinton, saying that a \"character question ... just made it impossible for me in good conscience to support President Trump.\" She still holds that view today. Bond, who sits on the board of Republican Women for Progress, has no plans to support President Trump's reelection campaign and said that it's \"hard not to think that the future of the Republican Party is doomed.\" \"The party is failing to speak to people like me who are pretty reasonable. I'm a person of faith, and so the character issues are deeply, deeply troubling to me,\" Bond said. \"Those who are generally more conservative in their policy preferences, the party is really not speaking to us, making decisions a lot more difficult for us. In terms of having the next generation of voters, candidates and supporters of the party, good decisions are not being made to ensure longevity.\" While Bond says the Republican Party is failing to reach voters like her, last week's Republican National Convention made clear that Trump and his allies are making a concerted appeal to a new generation of voters. The four-day affair showcased figures like Charlie Kirk, a co-founder of Turning Point USA, and Madison Cawthorn, who recently won a congressional primary in North Carolina. \"I just turned 25. When I'm elected this November, I'll be the youngest member of Congress in over 200 years,\" Cawthorn said in his speech. \"And if you don't think young people can change the world, then you just don't know American history.\" Born after 1996, members of Generation Z tend to lean left like their millennial counterparts. And even among the universe of young Republicans that does exist, research suggests that Trump's appeal with these voters may have its limits. Research from CIRCLE, a research center at Tufts University, found that nearly 1 in 5 young voters who backed Republicans in 2018 plan to support Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden this year. Mike Brodo, a 20-year-old student at Georgetown University, suggested that young Republicans may be turning away because Republicans are not talking about the right issues. He pointed to things like the accepted science of climate change, LGBTQ rights and racial injustice. Brodo was active in politics during high school but said he became disillusioned when he got to campus and found himself uncomfortable with the level of polarization. He and other young Republicans recently launched gen z gop, a group aimed at reaching disaffected young Republicans. \"I think it came to a point this summer where I said I needed to do something about this,\" he said. \"If we don't fix this right now within the party, we're going to have a problem going forward.\" For his part, Brodo said it would take a \"complete 180\" for him to support Trump's reelection. Right now, he says he's planning to support Biden. \"If Biden can stick to a message that unifies the country, that focuses on the optimism of what America can be, I think that I will likely vote for him,\" he said, adding that he hopes Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate. Many of the young Republicans we spoke with described the surreal feeling of coming of age in this political climate. Grace Klein, an 18-year-old freshman at Arizona State University, crystallized that sentiment in one memory from a few years back. \"I still remember sitting in this restaurant with some friends, being like, 'Oh, wouldn't it be, like, the weirdest thing if the race ended up being Trump versus Hillary,' and we were like, 'Oh my goodness, that would never happen. That would be so awful,' \" she recalled. Klein was 13 and 14 during the 2016 Republican primary and watched the debates alongside members of her family, which she described as very conservative. Ben Carson, a candidate that year and now a member of Trump's Cabinet, was one of her role models. She personally preferred Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. She described herself during the primary as \"very against Trump,\" and even during the general election she saw him as the lesser of two evils and said he \"rubbed me the wrong way.\" But four years later, things have changed. \"I'm going to be voting for the first time in November, and I am an adamant supporter. I will 100% vote for him,\" Klein said. Klein said that Trump has exceeded her expectations, though there are still things she doesn't agree with. She explicitly mentioned some of Trump's tweets. But she also said that his record and values have helped her look past his \"personality flaws.\" One issue, she said, was more important than any other in explaining her political identity: abortion. \"I believe that the right to life starts at conception,\" Klein said. \"If a candidate doesn't support that, I will not support them.\" Like some of the young Republicans who were concerned about the future of the party, Klein also expressed concern about the level of polarization, particularly on campus. While she says she has seen left-leaning peers on campus with stickers on water bottles or notebooks that express their political preferences, Klein said that she would be \"very, very selective\" in public displays of her own values. \"I would be very, very scared for my safety to wear a Trump hat on campus,\" she said. \"I think we've just seen so much of people, whether verbally or physically, just attacking people.\" Kerlyn Mondesir, a 19-year-old student at Coker College in South Carolina, said the most important issue for him as a conservative is standing up for the Constitution. He described himself as a \"a Romney, McCain, a slightly Reagan, Sen. [Tim] Scott conservative.\" \"A moderate-leaning conservative that instead of doing partisan politics, I would focus on bringing both sides together while keeping the founding principles in my rear view so I can go back to them,\" he explained. He was initially open to supporting Trump in November. But for now, he said that seems unlikely. \"Every day I teeter the line between Vice President Biden and the Libertarian candidate, Jo Jorgensen,\" Mondesir said. And back in North Carolina, Bond is facing the same \"difficult decision.\" \"Being in college at this time as someone who is deeply conservative, who really cares about the future of the party, it's been very hard,\" she said. Ultimately, she said it's unlikely that either Trump or Biden will get her vote this fall.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's running mate relies heavily on her experience as a district attorney and California attorney general. In those positions, she's navigated criticism from both the left and the right.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Before she was a senator, before she was the first woman of color on a major party ticket, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris was San Francisco's district attorney and later California's attorney general. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Scott Shafer and Marisa Lagos have this look at Harris' evolution as a prosecutor. MARISA LAGOS, BYLINE: Ten years ago, Kamala Harris won the narrowest of victories to become California's first female and first Black attorney general. It was a tough race, says Suzy Loftus, a longtime deputy of Harris'. Law enforcement unions had overwhelmingly backed Harris' opponent, LA's Republican DA Steve Cooley. SUZY LOFTUS: Steve Cooley spent a lot of money trying to suggest that Kamala Harris hated law enforcement. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: To build those relationships with local DAs, sheriffs and police, Loftus points out that the first thing Harris did when she became attorney general was to visit all 58 California counties. LOFTUS: And it was incredibly effective because I think there's nothing like actually getting to talk to someone, especially who's been so vilified. LAGOS: Four years later when Harris ran for reelection, police groups largely supported her. But she soon found herself at odds with another key constituency - progressive Democrats. SHAFER: Deadly police shootings were in the news, and Democrats in the California State Legislature were pushing a bill to require independent investigations of deadly use of force. LAGOS: In 2015, Sacramento Assemblyman Kevin McCarty authored a bill to require the attorney general to take away investigations of police shootings from local DAs, who, he says, have an inherent conflict of interest. KEVIN MCCARTY: You know, it's like, you know, a high school baseball game and looking out there and seeing the umpire is the uncle of one of the star players. Are you going to trust that umpire to call balls and strikes fairly? The answer's no. LAGOS: Harris opposed the bill, and it died. She also declined to support another bill requiring police officers to wear body cameras. That didn't sit well with the Black caucus in the legislature. They saw her as on the wrong side of the fight. SHAFER: Such is the pressure faced by an attorney general, especially one who is a Black female, says LaDoris Cordell. She was an independent police auditor in San Jose. LADORIS CORDELL: There's this fine line. You're the top cop, but you're also a prosecutor, which is representing the people. And oftentimes, those two things are not compatible. LAGOS: And, says Cordell, investigations of police shootings are in some ways a no-win situation. CORDELL: The feeling is that people are passing around this hot potato. When these shootings happen, they're very controversial. The public is very aware. There are protests. And it's sort of like, you know, people just don't really want to handle them. SHAFER: Kamala Harris says her opposition to the bill wasn't based on fear of catching a hot potato but rather concern about interfering with local prosecutors. LAGOS: Harris knew firsthand how that felt. In 2004, some San Francisco officials pushed the then-state attorney general to take a murder case away from her office after she declined to seek the death penalty. Loftus, Harris' his longtime deputy, says that experience cut deeply. LOFTUS: But I think she fundamentally always believed it's a local prosecutor's job to do the right thing and not to punt. SHAFER: Now that she's in the Senate and on the presidential campaign trail, Harris has been outspoken on policing issues, introducing legislation to ban chokeholds, racial profiling and no-knock warrants. LAGOS: Debbie Mesloh, a longtime adviser to Harris, says she's not taking those positions because she's changed her mind. The difference is she's now a lawmaker, not a law enforcer. DEBBIE MESLOH: Having worked with her for so long, these were conversations we would always have. You know, she may have not been having them externally, but this is the Kamala that I have known and seen for 20 years. SHAFER: Mesloh says that because of who Harris is, a Black, South Asian woman and the daughter of civil rights activists, she was often expected to align herself with liberals pushing for change from the outside. LAGOS: But for most of her career, she's been a prosecutor, working to change the system from the inside. For NPR News, I'm Marisa Lagos. SHAFER: And I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco.

He will not be meeting with Jacob Blake's family.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump plans to visit Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday \"to see the people that did such a good job for me\" during the protests. He will not be meeting with Jacob Blake's family. President Trump on Monday declined to condemn the actions of the 17-year-old suspect in the shooting of three protesters against police brutality in Kenosha, Wis., claiming, without evidence, that it appeared the gunman was acting in self-defense. Kyle Rittenhouse has been charged with six criminal counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, for the shooting last week that left two protesters dead and a third injured. An investigation is ongoing, which the president also acknowledged. The incident occurred during the third night of unrest following the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back multiple times at point-blank range. When asked during a Monday press briefing whether he would condemn the Illinois teen's actions, Trump defended Rittenhouse, suggesting that it appeared to him that the shooter was acting in self-defense. \"He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like,\" Trump said, noting the incident was under investigation. \"I guess he was in very big trouble. He probably would have been killed.\" Graphic video from the chaotic scene only tells a partial story. The shooter's alleged actions have split onlookers on party lines, with Republicans painting Rittenhouse as sort of tragic figure \u2014 a martyred patriot whose extreme actions were born of Democrat failures to quell violence on their streets. Democrats, meanwhile, have taken a dimmer view of the situation, pointing to the president's increasingly divisive rhetoric and past endorsements of violence against protesters, as evidence of a clear message to renegade gun owners to feel that they can act with impunity in the name of \"law and order.\" Trump, who has made violence in \"Democrat cities\" a key talking point against 2020 rival Joe Biden, plans to visit Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday \"to see the people that did such a good job for me\" during the protests. When asked whether he was worried that his presence, which comes against the Kenosha mayor's wishes, might inflame an already-heated situation, Trump said: \"Well, it could also increase enthusiasm, and it could increase love and respect for our country. And that's why I'm going.\" The president will not, during this trip, meet with the family of Blake, the man whose shooting and subsequent paralyzing sparked the Kenosha uprisings, citing a wariness of attending a meeting that Trump said would include the family's attorney. \"I thought it would be better not to do anything where there are lawyers involved. They wanted me to speak, but they wanted to have lawyers involved, and I thought that was inappropriate, so I didn't do that,\" he said.",

Read more about Markey's win here. Massachusetts voters are to cast ballots Tuesday in one of the last state primaries of the year. While many voters will head to the polls in person, most people planning to cast ballots in the primaries have already voted, according to Massachusetts officials. On Monday, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin told reporters that hundreds of thousands of ballots had already been cast, either by mail or through early voting. There are two key races to watch in Massachusetts, and both feature a younger Democratic challenger taking on an older incumbent. Senate (Democratic) \u2014 Markey vs. Kennedy Since 2018, several prominent longtime Democratic politicians have faced competitive reelection challenges from younger, more progressive opponents. The Massachusetts Senate primary veers from that narrative, because Sen. Ed Markey, who's 74, is the candidate who has garnered progressive support in his high-profile campaign against Rep. Joe Kennedy III, though the 39-year-old shares similar positions. Markey has served in the Senate since 2013 and was a congressman for 37 years before that. He co-authored the Green New Deal with New York progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who supports his campaign. Markey has also been endorsed by his colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Kennedy, who also supports the Green New Deal, is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and has served in Congress since 2013. In late August, he was endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Some Democrats, including former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, criticize Kennedy for seeking a higher political position during the 2020 election season. Frank told WBUR's Anthony Brooks last year that Democrats should work to unseat Republicans, saying diverting resources from that effort is \"a terrible mistake.\" Kennedy has criticized Markey's record on racial justice. Markey opposed court-ordered busing to desegregate Boston Public Schools in the 1970s and voted for the 1994 federal crime bill that's blamed for contributing for mass incarceration. Despite being the challenger, Kennedy entered the race as the perceived favorite. But Markey now holds an 11-point lead, according to a polling average from RealClearPolitics. Massachusetts has an all-Democratic congressional delegation, so it's highly likely that the winner of the primary will go on win in the general election this November. (There are also competitive primaries to fill the House seat Kennedy is giving up.) Loading... 1st Congressional District (Democratic) \u2014 Neal vs. Morse Progressives are hoping for an upset in Massachusetts' 1st Congressional District as longtime Rep. Richard Neal faces a challenge from Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse. Neal, 71, is a leader in the House of Representatives, serving as chair of the Ways and Means Committee. He has been in Congress for 32 years and has the endorsement of Pelosi as well as Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, who is a Republican. Morse, 31, was elected mayor of his native city at just 22. He has the support of Ocasio-Cortez, the climate group the Sunrise Movement and the Justice Democrats, a progressive political action committee. Morse is campaigning on key progressive issues including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. One recent issue in this race: vague allegations of impropriety against Morse, who's openly gay, which led to an investigation of him by the University of Massachusetts. Additional revelations led Morse to say he has been vindicated and, he says, have helped his campaign with donors and volunteers. Loading...",

George during her inauguration on Jan. 8, 2004, as San Francisco's district attorney. In the center is Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan.\n                \n                    \n                    George Nikitin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kamala Harris receives the oath of office from California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George during her inauguration on Jan. 8, 2004, as San Francisco's district attorney. In the center is Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan. Three months after becoming San Francisco's district attorney in 2004, Kamala Harris faced a trial by fire. Harris had just won her first run for office by positioning herself slightly to the right of her liberal predecessor and by promising to run a more professional office as the city's top prosecutor. She pledged to tackle domestic violence and sex trafficking and stand up for those who had felt ignored. And she had promised never to charge the death penalty \u2014 a promise that was put to the test when a 29-year-old police officer, Isaac Espinoza, was shot and killed by a gang member. Nevertheless, Harris kept her promise, announcing before Espinoza's funeral that her office would seek life without the possibility of parole. At the time, Harris said she believed that the majority of San Franciscans wanted to see \"the most severe crimes be met with the most severe consequences\" and that in this liberal city, life without parole would likely be the most severe consequence a jury would hand down. But former police officers' union president Gary Delagnes says the timing of Harris' announcement alienated many in the San Francisco Police Department. \"By having a press conference before the kid was even in the ground to announce that she was not seeking the death penalty, I mean, it was such a cold political move that, I mean, it just showed a complete lack of compassion,\" he said. But while the timing of her announcement poisoned the young prosecutor's relationship with the police union, even Delagnes acknowledged that she made the right call in a progressive city where opposition to the death penalty is strong. \"Obviously, no San Francisco jury was going to convict a 19-year-old African American man \u2014 they're not going to give the death penalty to somebody in that situation, and I said that from the beginning,\" he said. Harris' office did get the conviction and sent Espinoza's killer to prison for life, without the chance for parole. Breaking boundaries Throughout her time in politics, Harris has found herself caught between two very different groups that see themselves in her: law enforcement and progressive activists pushing for a more racially just legal system. Harris is now the Democratic nominee for vice president and in recent years has been outspoken about the need for systemic change to policing and criminal justice in America. But long before she was the second Black and first South Asian woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, when she became district attorney of San Francisco and then attorney general of California, she was considered an outsider by many in the world of law enforcement, says Debbie Mesloh, a longtime adviser to Harris. \"I recall many situations where people who had been in leadership within the DA's office or within the police department seemed to struggle with her leadership,\" Mesloh recalled. \"That first meeting with the District Attorneys Association of California, she was the only woman to walk in that room. She was one of, I think, three people of color.\" Mesloh said that throughout her career, Harris has had to absorb \"subtle and not-so-subtle messages that were sent to her of, you know, 'Who do you think you are? You need to know your place. You know, you may have won an election, but there's only one of you. We outnumber you.' \" Mesloh said Harris never let those messages intimidate her. Wanting a seat at the table Suzy Loftus, who worked under Harris as both a deputy district attorney and assistant attorney general, said the conviction of the policeman's killer was important to Harris \u2014 and consistent with her principles. And, she said, Harris learned from the case. \"She made the decision quickly, announced it quickly and recognized later that there were so many people who were so deeply impacted in that moment and in grief and in pain. And that loss was exacerbated by an announcement in the middle of it. So I think she endeavored to learn from her mistakes,\" said Loftus. That lesson? Don't rush out to make an announcement \u2014 take into account the public's pain and grief. But, Loftus said, it didn't make Harris a different or more cautious politician. \"I think by function of being a prosecutor, you're more careful,\" Loftus said. Jim Stearns, who ran Harris' first campaign, said that while the Espinoza decision soured some in law enforcement on Harris at the time, it also won over many voters, making her something of a political star in San Francisco. \"I think what galvanized the city for her was this was the first time people could remember that a politician made a difficult promise, like, 'I will never enforce the death penalty,' and actually did it under the most incredible pressure,\" he said. Stearns said there has been a tension throughout Harris' career: between what's expected of her as a member of law enforcement and what's asked of her by progressive activists who see themselves in her. \"Kamala has always wanted to have a seat at the table,\" he said. \"So it would be a mistake to see Kamala or to expect from Kamala that she is ever going to stand outside of the system and demand the kind of wholesale changes that people who stand out of the system want.\" That tension would play out most dramatically when Harris took on her next job, as attorney general of the state of California. \"Someone ... who's been so vilified\" In 2010, Harris won the narrowest of victories to become California's first female and first Black attorney general. It was a tough race. Law enforcement unions had overwhelmingly backed Harris' opponent, Los Angeles' Republican district attorney, Steve Cooley, who used those endorsements to paint Harris as anti-police. To build relationships with local prosecutors, sheriffs and police officers, the first thing Harris did when she became attorney general was to visit all 58 California counties. Loftus, her longtime deputy, planned the tour. \"It was incredibly effective, because I think there's nothing like actually getting to talk to someone \u2014 especially who's been so vilified,\" she said. Four years later, when Harris ran for reelection, police groups largely supported her. But she soon found herself at odds with another key constituency: progressive Democrats. Deadly police shootings were in the news, and Democrats in the California State Legislature were pushing a bill to require independent investigations of deadly use of force. Sacramento Assemblyman Kevin McCarty authored a 2015 bill to require the attorney general to take away investigations of police shootings from local district attorneys, who, he said, have an inherent conflict of interest. \"You know, if you're at a high school baseball game looking out there and seeing the umpire is the uncle of one of the star players, are you going to trust that umpire to call balls and strikes fairly? The answer is no,\" said McCarty. Harris opposed the bill, and it died. She also declined to support another bill requiring police officers to wear body cameras, even though she was the first to mandate them at a state agency, the California Department of Justice. Still, her opposition to statewide legislation didn't sit well with the California Legislative Black Caucus. They saw her as on the wrong side of the fight. Sen. Holly Mitchell, a Los Angeles Democrat and member of the Legislative Black Caucus, told the Los Angeles Times in 2016 that Harris' \"absence is noticeable,\" adding that \"people are looking to her for guidance and direction.\" Now a lawmaker, not a law enforcer It's not surprising for an attorney general to face such pressure \u2014 and that's especially true for one who is a Black female, said LaDoris Cordell, who was an independent police auditor in San Jose. \"There's this fine line. You're the top cop, but you're also a prosecutor which is representing the people. And oftentimes those two things are not compatible,\" she said. Investigations of police shootings are in some ways a no-win situation, Cordell contends. \"The feeling is that people are passing around this hot potato. When these shootings happen, they're very controversial. The public is very aware. There are protests, and it's sort of like, you know, people just don't really want to handle them,\" she said. Harris said her opposition to the bill wasn't based on fear of catching a hot potato, but rather concern about interfering with local prosecutors. She knew firsthand how that felt: In 2004, some San Francisco officials pushed the then-state attorney general to take the Espinoza murder case away from her office after she declined to seek the death penalty. Loftus, Harris' longtime deputy, says that experience cut deeply. \"I think she fundamentally always believed it's a local prosecutor's job to do the right thing and not to punt,\" she said. Now that she's in the Senate and on the presidential campaign trail, Harris has been outspoken on policing issues, introducing legislation to ban chokeholds, racial profiling and no-knock warrants, as well as to make lynching a federal crime. In her speech accepting the Democratic nomination, she called out systemic racism in America, naming two recent victims of police violence, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Mesloh, Harris' longtime adviser, said she's not taking those positions now because she has changed her mind: The difference is that she's now a lawmaker, not a law enforcer. \"Having worked with her for so long, these were conversations we would always have,\" Mesloh said. \"She may have not been having them externally, but this is the Kamala that I have known and seen for 20 years.\" Mesloh said that because of who Harris is \u2014 a Black, South Asian woman and the daughter of civil rights activists \u2014 she was often expected to align herself with liberals pushing for change from the outside.

Updated at 4:44 p.m. ET Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday forcefully pushed back against President Trump's campaign message that voters wouldn't be safe under a Biden administration. \"The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now he's trying to scare America,\" Biden said in remarks at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Biden called Trump power hungry and lambasted the president for what Biden sees as a lack of moral leadership \u2014 a common refrain from the former vice president on the campaign trail. \"We are facing multiple crises \u2014 crises that, under Donald Trump, keep multiplying,\" Biden said. \"COVID, economic devastation, unwarranted police violence, emboldened white nationalists, a reckoning on race, declining faith in a bright American future. The common thread? An incumbent president who makes things worse, not better. An incumbent president who sows chaos rather than providing order.\" Biden's trip to Pennsylvania comes amid national protests in response to police violence and the recent police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. That shooting has led to several days of unrest in the city, which resulted in the shooting deaths of two people, allegedly by an armed vigilante. In Portland, Ore., a man was fatally shot during a night of confrontations between Trump supporters and counterprotesters. \"[Trump] can't stop the violence because for years he has fomented it,\" Biden said. \"He may believe mouthing the words 'law and order' makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is.\" Trump, who will travel to Kenosha Tuesday and then Latrobe, Pa., on Thursday, apparently watched Biden's remarks and tweeted that in his view, Biden is \"blaming the Police far more than he's blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters.\" (Biden told reporters after the event that he hopes to soon be able to go to Kenosha as well.) Just watched what Biden had to say. To me, he\u2019s blaming the Police far more than he\u2019s blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie supports! Trump continues to present himself as a \"tough on crime\" president, a message that was front and center during last week's Republican National Convention. In a statement after Biden's remarks, Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said: \"As predicted, Joe Biden today failed to condemn the left-wing mobs burning, looting, and terrorizing American cities.\" But Biden indeed doubled down on an earlier statement condemning the violence that has come out of various protests, saying on Monday: \"Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple.\" He added that those who loot and burn buildings should be prosecuted. \"You know my heart,\" Biden added in Pittsburgh. \"You know my story, my family's story. Ask yourself: Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really? I want a safe America, safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops.\" Biden said Trump looks at instances of violence as his \"political lifeline.\" \"He keeps telling you if only he was president, it wouldn't happen,\" Biden said. \"If he was president, you'd feel safe. Well, he is president, whether he knows it or not. And it is happening. It's getting worse, and you know why? Because Donald Trump adds fuel to every fire.\" Biden argued that he would be able to unite the country and foster healing, saying he would abandon the divisive language Trump uses and get both police and those fighting for racial justice to the table to bring about lasting change. Biden then seemingly tried to use Trump's tactics against him, saying the real fear that Americans feel comes from the destabilization that has happened because of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his plans to undermine Social Security programs and his relationship with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Never before has an American president played such a subservient role to a Russian leader. It's not only dangerous \u2014 it's humiliating and embarrassing for the rest of the world to see. It weakens us,\" Biden said.",

Tony Evers (left) speaks at a news conference held Thursday in Kenosha, Wis., to discuss recent civil unrest surrounding the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was shot several times in the back in front of his children. Updated 10:14 a.m. ET The Wisconsin state Legislature is scheduled to officially convene Monday for a special session on police training requirements and policy standards. But GOP lawmakers aren't expected to be present, nor are any debates or votes expected to happen. The special session, called by Gov. Tony Evers, who Sunday asked President Trump not to visit the state, puts on display the policy stalemate between the Democratic governor and the state's Republican-controlled Legislature after a police officer shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., a little more than a week ago. The shooting spurred several days of unrest in the city, including the shooting deaths of two protesters. For months, Evers has urged lawmakers to consider bills that would set statewide standards for police use of force and ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, but Republicans have argued they need more time to craft their own proposals. Less than 24 hours after Blake's shooting, the governor signed an executive order compelling the Legislature to convene in a special session. However, neither state law nor the state Constitution requires lawmakers to participate in debate or to vote on any bills during a special session. They may simply convene and immediately adjourn. They did just that for a session Evers called last November to address state gun laws. Republican state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who is in the middle of a campaign for Congress, was silent for several days following Blake's shooting and the governor's call. On Friday, his office confirmed the Senate will officially convene on Monday without any senators present. In a prepared statement, Fitzgerald said he expects lawmakers to consider a variety of proposals related to policing \"in the coming months.\" He said he would like those bills to include legislation to increase penalties for violence against police. \"The riots in Kenosha and Madison this week further demonstrated that first responders are performing their public service duties at great risk to their personal safety,\" he said. Another proposal from a different Republican state senator, unveiled last week, would penalize local governments for shifting money from their law enforcement budgets to other things such as public health or education initiatives \u2014 a move many activists are calling \"defunding the police.\" State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos argues that Evers is being disingenuous and partisan in calling the special session. \"We have an opportunity to bring people together to find solutions,\" Vos said shortly after Evers called the special session. \"Instead, the governor is choosing to turn to politics again by dictating liberal policies that will only deepen the divisions in our state.\" As an alternative, Vos announced a legislative task force on \"racial disparities, educational opportunities, public safety, and police policies and standards.\" Similar past initiatives on subjects such as homelessness and adoption have taken several months to produce legislation. Meanwhile, Wisconsin Democrats are meeting Republicans' resistance to convene with anger and frustration. \"We've got 400 years of systemic racism in this country, and if we don't do something about it, we'll be repeating Kenosha in cities all over our country and in our state,\" Evers said Thursday. \"I'm counting on the Republicans to show up next Monday.\" Democratic state Sen. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee issued a statement last week that she was \"sick to [her] stomach\" at the GOP's resistance. \"The question for us, Wisconsin, is when are we going to make Republicans do their jobs, or do we continue to sit idly by and watch this state burn?\" she said. Late last week, a woman from Burlington, Wis., began a petition drive to try to recall Gov. Evers, citing in part his response to the aftermath of Blake's shooting. The state Republican Party is not affiliated, but state Democrats did sharply criticize the move.",

            "article_content": "The challenge facing Donald Trump as he seeks reelection is trying to convince voters that he'll solve during his second term the problems America is experiencing during his first term.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST: Intelligence officials say Russia is working to harm Joe Biden's bid for the White House just as it did Hillary Clinton's. So why then has the Trump administration just ended election security briefings to Congress? We'll start there with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Debbie. ELLIOTT: So the election now 65 days away - and now we hear that National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe told the Senate and House intelligence committees on Friday that they will only now get written updates about election security from here on out. Why? LIASSON: According to the president, the reason is, quote, \"you have leakers on the committee.\" The national intelligence director says it's to help ensure that the information is not, quote, \"misunderstood or politicized,\" even though the last briefing documented that Russia still is hard at work trying to influence the 2020 elections. As you can imagine, Democrats reacted with outrage. They think this is a complete betrayal of the president's constitutional responsibility to allow the Article I branch, Congress, to do oversight. Adam Schiff, who's the intelligence committee chairman in the House, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement saying this is a betrayal of the public's right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy. The intelligence belongs to the American people not the agencies which are its custodians. What they're going to do about it remains to be seen. ELLIOTT: We're going to hear from an intelligence committee member elsewhere in the program. But, Mara, what do you think this is all about? LIASSON: Well, the president doesn't like oversight. He doesn't like any mention that Russia might be trying to help him, which is what the intelligence community has been saying they are doing (ph). You know, breaking norms is a feature not a bug of this administration. And this is another norm broken. He has defied subpoenas last week. During the Republican National Convention, he used the White House as a partisan political backdrop, which is illegal, even if it probably isn't enforceable - violation of the Hatch Act. And then you have this extraordinary event of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, being asked by Democratic members of Congress for reassurance that he would refuse to let the military be used in the election. It's amazing he has to be asked that. But Democrats are worried that Trump won't leave office if he loses or he'll try to use law enforcement at the polls to intimidate voters. Trump has already said he's going to send sheriffs and other law enforcement U.S. attorneys to the polls. He says it's to watch out for fraud, but this is where we are at 60-odd days before the election. ELLIOTT: You watched the Republican National Convention. The conventions are now over. What's your take now that it's done? LIASSON: Well, I think the Republican convention had two messages. One was to fire up the base, lots of red meat. But also there was a new message, which is there is a secret Donald Trump you don't know, and he's warm and empathetic and not racist. And (laughter) there was a lot of time spent describing this president who we don't see in his daily television appearances or tweets. The Republicans worked hard to create a permission structure for voters who might like the president's policies but not his behavior, particularly white non-college women for whom Trump's behavior is annoying but not disqualifying, women who might be looking for a reason to come back to Trump. And then, of course, there was the message to suburban America; be afraid. Be very afraid. The Republicans think that the riots are working for them, that people are now more concerned about the looting and the vandalism than they are about racial justice. And here is what presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said to Fox News on Thursday about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLYANNE CONWAY: The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who is best on public safety and law and order. LIASSON: So there you have it. There are a couple of polls that have shown Black support for Black Lives Matter plummeting from July to August. ELLIOTT: Briefly, Mara, we do have violence right now. What's going on in Kenosha - there was deadly violence overnight in Portland, Ore. How does the White House make the case that Trump can end the unrest with a second term? LIASSON: Well, that is a very good question. It's as if the Republicans are saying, watch the videos of what's happening right now. That's what will happen if Biden is elected. It's a hard argument to make. Usually reelection campaigns are referendums on the incumbent, and they're - 70% of Americans think the country's on the wrong track. In the past, that has been a very bad sign for the incumbent. But maybe we're so tribalized that that doesn't matter anymore. We'll find out soon. ELLIOTT: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The two lawmakers face each other in a Democratic primary this Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), center left, and  Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), center right (R) during a 2017 protest against Trump administration immigration policies. The two lawmakers face each other in a Democratic primary this Tuesday. Voters in Massachusetts are facing a decision that many wish they didn't have to make. For years now, they've been represented in Washington by both the scion of the country's most famous political dynasty, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, and Sen. Ed Markey, a progressive stalwart who co-sponsored the Green New Deal. Only one can win another term after Markey and Kennedy square off in a Democratic primary Tuesday. When Kennedy decided to challenge Markey for his Senate seat, some Democrats in Massachusetts wondered: Why? \"That is exactly how I felt,\" said Raul Silva, a 58-year-old civil engineer from Newton, the Boston suburb where Kennedy lives. Silva has met Kennedy a couple of times and likes him. But he likes Markey, too. \"I think they're both very effective legislators, and it's unfortunate that we can't have both in D.C.,\" he said. In a deep blue state, the winner of the Democratic primary is likely to take the general election in November. Whether the victor is Markey or Kennedy may not make much difference on policy because the candidates agree on most issues. Voters like Theresa Mattus, a 73-year-old retiree from Millbury, are finding it hard to separate the two. \"I'm, like, 51% Kennedy and 49% Markey,\" she said. Recent polls give the edge to Markey, but it's been a close race for months. Large-scale mail-in voting \u2014 new in Massachusetts this year because of the novel coronavirus \u2014 adds a twist. Kennedy knows that he or his opponent could make a compelling closing argument, and it might be too late because some voters submitted their ballots weeks ago. \"It's a wild thing where I've got an Election Day that lasts a month,\" he said. \"Every day you're going to wake up, and somebody's going to be casting ballots.\" One way Kennedy has tried to make sure those ballots are for him is to criticize Markey's record on racial justice. Markey opposed court-ordered busing to desegregate Boston Public Schools in the 1970s and voted for the 1994 federal crime bill that many Democrats now acknowledge has contributed to mass incarceration of minorities. Kennedy also has the endorsement of the parents of D.J. Henry, a Black college student killed by police in 2010, who say Markey did little to help their family. \"If you truly are a champion for change, if you're on the right side of social justice issues, act that way when the cameras aren't on you,\" Danroy Henry Sr. said on social media this month. Markey has apologized for disappointing the Henrys but insists his civil rights record is strong, overall. And he has fired back at Kennedy, who as an undergrad at Stanford in the early 2000s joined Kappa Alpha, a national fraternity with deeply racist roots. \"He's changed his position on the racist fraternity \u2014 that's his own words \u2014 that he was in for 20 years, and he only left that fraternity one month before this campaign,\" Markey said in a recent debate. Kennedy has said he was previously unaware of the group's history. But his former membership remains problematic, said Matthew Hughey, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut who has studied fraternities. \"For someone to join KA means, to me, you don't have a lot of Black friends,\" Hughey said. \"Because if you had a lot of Black friends, if you had a lot of friends of color, someone would say, 'Hey, man, do you know about that organization?' \" Some voters complain that the sniping between Markey and Kennedy \u2014 particularly on racial justice \u2014 has been frustrating to watch. Count Daunasia Yancey among them. \"I, personally, am not interested in a pissing contest between these two wealthy white men,\" said Yancey, the founder of Black Lives Matter Boston. Markey didn't grow up with the privilege of Kennedy, but race and class are two more ways the candidates are similar today. The contest could be decided, in part, by one of their few big differences: Kennedy is 39. Markey is 74.",

            "article_content": "We look at a remarkable week in sports, where pro-athletes in NBA and MLB stood up to owners and managers and delayed games in solidarity with those who are protesting racism and police violence.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: No music for sports this week, not many games either as many pro athletes called a halt to their seasons to express solidarity with protesters in Kenosha and other places. The Milwaukee Bucks refused to play their playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The LA Lakers and Clippers even voted to boycott the remainder of the playoffs. The WNBA, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and even Naomi Osaka in tennis followed. NPR's Tom Goldman joins us. Tom, thanks for being with us. TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: And a lot of solidarity in the world of sports this week. Also a lot of raw emotion, wasn't there? GOLDMAN: Incredibly raw, anguish. Here are three voices. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) DOMINIC SMITH: For this to continuously happen, I mean, it just shows just the hate in people's heart. (Crying) And being a Black man in America, it's not easy, so... DOC RIVERS: It's amazing to me why we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back. TROY VINCENT: And I got a 22-year-old and a 20-year-old and a 15-year-old (crying) that I'm trying to prevent from being hunted. GOLDMAN: That was, Scott, Dominic Smith of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, Doc Rivers, head coach of the NBA's LA Clippers, and Troy Vincent, a former NFL player who now works for the league. Their words, you know, searing, right? And they really helped push forward what has to be called a mass protest in U.S. sport. SIMON: This week really seemed to be a breaking point. And how did we get from Colin Kaepernick being considered an outcast not long ago to major league sports joining national campaigns of protest? GOLDMAN: A lot of things not changing. Kaepernick took a knee to protest police violence and social injustice a few years back. The same things are being protested now. But Kaepernick and the few who joined him, as you mentioned here, were isolated, and he's still shunned by the NFL. This week, such a stunning difference, you know? The cumulative effect of one tragic event after the next, most notably George Floyd's killing in May and now with Jacob Blake, even though the case may be more complicated than we initially thought, after the Kenosha police union report. Still, seven bullets in the back have proved to be a tipping point. And the protesting athletes aren't isolated this time. They are now together and realizing their collective power and demanding that team owners, very rich and very connected people, listen and work with players to effect change. SIMON: And there've been a lot of commitments, promises for change announced over just the past few days, haven't there? GOLDMAN: There have. Basketball's return today is tied to an action plan. Players in the league are forming a social justice coalition focusing on voting access and police and criminal justice reform. Also, as of right now, 13 NBA arenas have committed to being converted to voting locations for the general election. In another sports league, the NFL's Baltimore Ravens have staked out an action plan notable for its detail. I mean, some of what it's calling for - Senator Mitch McConnell bringing the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act of 2020 to the Senate floor for vote, state and federal-mandated accreditation and national standards of care and policing. Will this all work, Scott? We don't know. But athlete anger isn't going away anytime soon, nor is the player's belief in their collective power. You know, they've shown they can shut down the entertainment and force people to listen. SIMON: As journalists, we have to point out that not so long ago, the NFL and the Ravens were charged with covering up and minimizing domestic assault charges against one of their best-known players. Is it - how do major league sports franchises get to the moral high ground now? GOLDMAN: Well, you know, through this process and listening to the players and, you know, as part of the momentum of this whole thing, there is a sense, I think, if you stake out a claim now against the player's action, it's going to be tough on you. SIMON: NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman, thanks so much for being with us. GOLDMAN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The games are set to resume Saturday. The NBA and its players union announced a plan to use arenas as polling places in the upcoming election as part of an agreement to resume playoff games on Saturday. The deal comes after three games were postponed Wednesday, sparked by the Milwaukee Bucks refusing to play their scheduled game against the Orlando Magic. The players staged the walkout in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis. Thursday's games were also postponed. At a meeting Thursday, the players agreed to resume the playoffs on Saturday after the league agreed to a plan to promote social justice and civic engagement, according to a joint statement released by the NBA and the players union. \"We're all hurt, we're all tired of just seeing the same thing over and over again and everybody just expects us to be OK just because we get paid great money,\" said Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Chris Paul, who is the players union president, according to The Associated Press. \"We're human, we have real feelings and I'm glad that we got a chance to get in a room and talk with one another and not just cross paths and say good luck in your game today.\" The league has committed to create a social justice coalition, work with elections officials to convert NBA arenas into polling places for the 2020 election and create advertising spots to promote \"greater civic engagement in national and local elections.\" \"These commitments follow months of close collaboration around designing a safe and healthy environment to restart the NBA season, providing a platform to promote social justice, as well as creating an NBA foundation focused on economic empowerment in the Black community,\" the statement said. Using arenas as polling places will provide a safe in-person voting option for communities vulnerable to COVID-19, according to the statement. The plan, which applies to arenas that the franchise owns and controls, also includes using some facilities for voter registration and ballot receiving boards if the deadline to establish a polling place has passed. Three teams already offered their spaces as polling places in July as election officials across the country scramble to find rooms large enough to allow for adequate social distancing. The Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons and the Bucks have committed their arenas to be voting sites. After staging their walkout this week, the Bucks players, led by star point guard George Hill, called on elected officials in Wisconsin to hold police accountable for shooting Blake seven times at close range, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down, according to his attorney. \"For this to occur, it is imperative for the Wisconsin state Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction and take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform,\" Hill said. Shortly after the Bucks refused to play, the two other games that night were also postponed. To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the NBA has been finishing its season in a bubble \u2014 with virtual fans \u2014 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Fla. The NBA teams' decision not to play set off a chain reaction in the world of sports. Baseball and hockey games and football practices were postponed on Thursday in the name of promoting conversations around racial equality and policy brutality. The move is not the first step the NBA has taken to promote racial justice. Since restarting the season late last month, the majority of players and coaches have taken a knee during the national anthem to protest systemic racism. The phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is also painted across the court during games, and athletes can now wear jerseys with social justice messages on the back. \"We look forward to the resumption of the playoffs and continuing to work together \u2014 in Orlando and in all NBA team markets \u2014 to push for meaningful and sustainable change,\" the NBA and players union said in their statement.",

            "article_content": "President Trump formally accepted the Republican nomination for President last night. We go over the major talking points of his speech.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Some of our colleagues were also watching last night, including NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and our senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Good morning to you both. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: We have some analysis and some fact-checking here as well. And, Ayesha, I just want to recall - four years ago, then-candidate Donald Trump gave his first convention speech, said, I alone can fix it. Now he's running for reelection. What's the sequel? RASCOE: In a lot of ways, he basically said that he is fixing the country. But that's a picture that does not line up with what a lot of Americans are seeing. One thing that really stood out was this line where he talked about his response to the coronavirus, which has now killed 180,000 people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. RASCOE: Of course, he delivered this line with more than a thousand people sitting outside not socially distanced and many without masks. Trump also said there would be a vaccine by the end of the year or maybe sooner. That is way more optimistic than current science suggests. INSKEEP: We've already heard some of how he addressed protesting and racial justice. What was his overall message there? RASCOE: You know, there was just a lot of talk of law and order, condemning rioters and conflating protests and riots. There was also a lot of praise for law enforcement. Here's some more on that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country - and that's the overwhelming majority - are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. RASCOE: This is an argument that Trump has made, you know, for decades now - that police need to get tougher. And law and order's the main thrust of his reelection campaign. You know, it's - Trump is being critical of Biden for the 1994 crime bill. But at the same time, Trump himself is talking about increasing prison sentences and prosecuting people to the full extent of the law. INSKEEP: Domenico Montanaro is still with us, and I want to ask about the president's vision for the next four years. He promised a convention of hope and optimism. I think it's fair to say that didn't happen. I don't have a really clear vision of what the president would do with four more years. But he was - there was a lot of energy put into what Joe Biden would supposedly do with those four years. MONTANARO: Yeah - because, you know, President Trump really needs to turn this into a choice. He needs to make Biden unacceptable because for his record so far, when it comes to handling of coronavirus or race relations in the country, most people don't think he's doing a very good job at either of those. So if it's strictly about his record, he's putting himself at a disadvantage. But they also put out pretty contradictory messages about Joe Biden. They've really struggled to put some specifics against Biden's record because he's been in the public eye for almost half a century. I mean, on the one hand, they're saying Biden's a Trojan horse of the left and of Black Lives Matter but at the same time saying that he's put too many African Americans behind bars because of the crime bill. So it's kind of - which is it? - if you're watching this. Two big attacks that were worth fact-checking last night - one we heard a lot is that Biden wants to defund the police. When they talk about that Biden had said, quote, \"yes, absolutely,\" this wasn't about defunding the police. This was about redistributing funds to invest in social services that police are often asked to step in to do. But he actually wants to put more money into police forces (laughter), which is something that has actually, ironically, upset a lot of progressives. Trump has also said that Biden's plan to stop coronavirus is to, quote, \"shut it down.\" But that's not true. Biden's plan is to massively invest in testing, contact tracing along with finding a vaccine and better treatments. He was asked in an interview with ABC, if the flu and coronavirus combined this fall and the winter, would he shut it down - and - if the country's medical experts recommended that? He said if they did recommend that it was necessary, that he would do that but he was not planning on doing that because the economy needing to get open would only be able to do that if coronavirus was solved. INSKEEP: Ayesha, can we be clear about the apparent violation of law here? We mentioned there's a 1939 law. It has been updated over the years. It limits political activity by federal employees. How, if at all, did it apply to the event last night? RASCOE: Well, you know, other than - so President Trump and Vice President Pence are not under the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act does not apply to them. But all other federal employees, everybody that works at the White House - Cabinet secretaries, everybody that works in the administration - are not supposed to be engaging in this sort of political activity and on federal property. The White House is federal property. And there's no way that this was pulled off without workers at the White House helping them. And so that would be a violation of the Hatch Act. INSKEEP: And the high officials, of course, who came were sitting there on federal property, engaged in political activity. So when you look back at this week - which contains several moments like this, by the way - Domenico, what did you take away? MONTANARO: Well, look. I mean, this was all about trying to make the culture war stick to Joe Biden. You know, they wanted to make it less about Trump because he's not doing very well on coronavirus and race relations, as we noted. But people have pretty set beliefs about who both of these guys are. And if you were looking for a plan on coronavirus, you didn't get much of one, just a promise of a fast-tracked vaccine and him taunting the virus, frankly, saying, together we will crush the virus. And they really tried to sell, overall, a version of Trump that, frankly, most Americans don't recognize or see every day - you know, that he values women, African Americans, that he's done a good job on the pandemic. That runs pretty counter to what the public is seeing on a daily basis. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Ayesha Rascoe. Thanks to you both. RASCOE: Thank you. MONTANARO: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "President Trump laid out his vision for the next four years and attacked his Democratic rival Joe Biden as he accepted the Republican nomination on the final night of the party's convention.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: With the White House as his stage, President Trump accepted his party's nomination last night at the Republican National Convention. He attacked Joe Biden and framed voters' choice in November this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. MARTIN: The president made a lot of claims, some of them false. NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe's on the line with us to give us the details, give us the facts. Good morning, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Good morning. So let's just start out big picture. How did President Trump paint the next four years under his leadership? RASCOE: In a lot of ways, he painted a picture that he is fixing the country. But the picture that he painted does not line up with what a lot of Americans are seeing. One thing that stood out is his line about how he talked about his response to the coronavirus, which has now killed 180,000 people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing low-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. RASCOE: He delivered this line with more than a thousand people sitting outside, many without masks and no social distancing. Trump also said that there would be a vaccine by the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. But that's way more optimistic than current science suggests. MARTIN: So this address happened as racial protests continue across this country. Did the president address that? RASCOE: He - there was a lot of talk about law and order and condemning rioters and really conflating protests and riots. You know, this is a message that Trump has come back to over and over again. It's the main thrust of his reelection argument. You know, vote for Trump, or you won't be safe, even though these things are happening while Trump is president. MARTIN: So we heard Democrats last week really frame up an existential threat from Donald Trump getting four more years in the White House. Trump has tried this week to turn that around on Joe Biden and Democrats. How did he do in laying out that choice last night? RASCOE: The messages were kind of all over the place. There was, you know, kind of the idea that Biden is a Trojan horse of the left, you know, and - but at the same time that he has put too many, you know, Black people in jail because of the crime bill. There was also two big attacks that need some fact-checking. We heard a lot of this idea that Biden wants to defund the police. That's not true. Biden has not said that he wants to defund the police. He actually wants to give police more money, but he wants to redistribute them in a different way. And that's upset some progressives. And also, Biden has not said that he wants to shut down the country. He said he would listen to experts and do that if it was needed. MARTIN: NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. Thank you. RASCOE: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Attorney General William Barr is not slated to speak at the Republican National Convention, but Barr has acted as a loyal surrogate \u2014 pushing the Trump campaign message in recent interviews.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Attorney General William Barr did not speak at this week's Republican National Convention. But that doesn't mean he's sitting silently on the sidelines during the campaign. Instead, Barr has been a very public face and voice as the nation gears up to vote. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas has this story. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Traditionally, attorneys general try to steer clear of talking partisan politics, especially during a presidential campaign. The idea is to avoid even the perception of trying to tip the scales of the election. This summer, however, Attorney General William Barr has charted a different course. He's done at least seven sit-down interviews with national broadcasters since early June in which he has tackled politically charged issues head on. He's echoed the president's unfounded view of mail-in voting... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM BARR: It absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud. LUCAS: ...And the media's coverage of recent racial justice protests. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARR: The American people are being told a lie by the media. LUCAS: But, perhaps, most notable are the political attacks Barr has made against Democrats. In an interview on Fox News, he accused them of shredding the country's norms to try to drive Trump from office. He's accused them of being hellbent on total victory, tearing down the system and running people's lives. Barr also had this to say on Fox about racism in the middle of an election campaign in which that very topic has become a hot button issue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARR: The racism in this country - look no further than our public education system. That's a racist system maintained by the Democratic Party and the teachers' union. LUCAS: Legal experts and Justice Department veterans say it is not the attorney general's job to engage in partisan politics. And they say that, with these sorts of statements, Barr is doing exactly that. FRED WERTHEIMER: He has been operating as a political operative and a campaign aide to the president rather than as attorney general of the United States. LUCAS: That's Fred Wertheimer, the founder of the left-leaning watchdog group Democracy 21. He says Barr has publicly gone after Democrats, pushed his own conservative ideological views and echoed Trump's partisan talking points on topics front and center in the presidential race. WERTHEIMER: Barr is free to have any views he wants. But he's not free to exercise those views as attorney general of the United States. LUCAS: The reason for that, Wertheimer says, is because the attorney general's job and the Justice Department's mission is to ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. WERTHEIMER: How are those Americans who he attacks on ideological grounds supposed to conclude that he is going to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for them? You can't possibly conclude that. LUCAS: Democrats and some DOJ veterans also have mounting concerns about Barr's handling of the department's investigation into the Russia probe. Barr has made repeated suggestions that investigators have dug up surprising and troubling information that could benefit the president. Barr's critics accuse him of violating department policy by discussing an ongoing criminal investigation. DONALD AYER: Generally, we do not comment on the existence of investigations. And we never comment on the substance of what we are finding. LUCAS: That's Donald Ayer. He served as deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration. AYER: So he's been violating that rule itself categorically. LUCAS: It is also department policy to avoid taking any action that could possibly influence an election. On Capitol Hill last month, Barr refused to commit to not releasing a report from the investigation of the Russia probe before the November vote. But he has said he's committed to a free and fair election and has promised that the department won't take any action to interfere in that. Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington.

Holtz questioned Democratic candidate Joe Biden's Catholic faith. The 2020 presidential election is likely once again to feature religion as a campaign issue, if the Republican and Democratic conventions are any indication. Speakers at the Republican National Convention this week touted the religious credentials of their own candidates, but they were equally determined to question the faith of their opponents, with Joe Biden their main target. Former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz told the convention that the Democratic candidate is a Catholic \"in name only,\" citing his support for abortion rights. As a practicing Catholic, Biden has long had reservations about abortion rights, but after launching his presidential campaign, he modified his views. In fact, Biden's position is one shared by many Catholics. Despite the church's strong opposition to abortion, a 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that 48% of U.S. Catholics say abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases,\" while 47% said it should be illegal. In an interview with MSNBC, Biden called Holtz's comments \"preposterous\" and said his private beliefs relative to Catholic doctrine were \"different than my imposing that doctrine on every other person in the world.\" The president of the University of Notre Dame distanced the school from Holtz on Friday, saying in a statement that \"we Catholics should remind ourselves that while we may judge the objective moral quality of another's actions, we must never question the sincerity of another's faith.\" Attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, even came during an opening prayer. Orthodox Rabbi Aryeh Spero on Wednesday invoked America's \"Judeo-Christian tradition\" and asked God that it be upheld, \"especially now, when to our horror, it is being challenged.\" President Trump, Spero said, \"has stood up fearlessly against those who are corrupting the term social justice. ... May God protect him.\" In his acceptance speech, Trump joined in the criticism of his opponents' faith commitments. \"During the Democrat Convention,\" he said, \"the words 'Under God' were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from.\" Trump failed to note that the instances to which he referred were in caucus meetings at the side of the convention and that during the convention, the pledge was recited several times with the phrase \"Under God\" included. In a speech in Cleveland this month, Trump claimed that Biden's agenda would \"hurt the Bible, hurt God. He's against God,\" Trump said. In their convention last week, the Democrats appeared more focused on defending their record on religion than in challenging that of their opponents. Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic candidate, came closest to questioning the Trump-Pence record. Buttigieg, who is married to a man, has criticized the administration's invocation of religious freedom arguments in support of institutions that do not recognize a right to same-sex marriage. In his convention speech, he asked, \"Will America be a place where faith is about healing and not exclusion?\" The comments were not specifically aimed at Trump or Vice President Pence, though they recalled a remark Buttigieg made about Trump's religious beliefs in an interview with USA Today in spring 2019. \"I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith,\" Buttigieg said, \"but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God.\" On Thursday, Biden likewise signaled a willingness to go on the offensive when it comes to religion and politics. Responding to the attacks on his Catholic faith, he noted that they were made on behalf of a president \"who hardly ever darkens the door of a church.\"",

Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, appeared at the march via a prerecorded video, telling the crowd that the nation is on the verge of something it's never before seen. The senator from California is the first Black and first Asian American to be nominated as a vice presidential nominee by a major U.S. political party. \"If we work together to challenge every instinct our nation has to return to the status quo ... we have an opportunity to make history, right here, right now.\" During the speeches Friday, news broke that President Trump had granted a full pardon to Alice Johnson, the 65-year-old Black woman whose life sentence he commuted in 2018, with the help of reality television star Kim Kardashian West. Johnson was a featured speaker Thursday at the Republican National Convention. In his acceptance speech Thursday, Trump underscored his self-proclaimed moniker as the \"law and order president\" while accusing Democratic challenger Joe Biden of being someone who repeatedly tears down America. Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday night to decry racism and demand police accountability. Jacob Blake shooting looms over march The march also came on the heels of another high-profile shooting, that of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wis., on Sunday. Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back at close range. He is paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family's lawyers. The shooting was captured on video and went viral on social media, sparking days of demonstrations that turned deadly this week. A 17-year-old from Illinois faces homicide charges in connection with a Tuesday night shooting in Kenosha that killed two protesters and injured a third. The suspect, a white male, reportedly has ties to a militia and is a staunch supporter of law enforcement. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic also loomed over the event, with many in the crowd wearing facial coverings. It was clear, however, particularly on the main stage, that not everyone was following social distancing protocols.",

            "article_content": "Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris made counter remarks Thursday as President Trump is set to give his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: I want to turn now to politics because the Democratic ticket made itself visible today ahead of the final night of the Republican National Convention. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris spoke about the pandemic along with ongoing racial unrest in Kenosha, Wis. NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow was at her remarks in Washington, D.C., joins us now. Hey there, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. CORNISH: So we know Harris's background - right? - as a prosecutor. What was her overall message on what's been happening in Kenosha? DETROW: Well, in a week where Republicans have really ramped up their law and order warnings about protests that have been violent at times, and many Democrats have started to worry that maybe those framings are resonating with voters, it was interesting to me that Harris made it clear that she and Joe Biden are firmly on the side of the protesters. She said that she and Biden spoke to the family of Jacob Blake, who's the man who was shot at seven times by Kenosha Police and is now paralyzed. And she also said she understands why protests have broken out again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: People are rightfully angry and exhausted. And after the murders of Breonna and George and Ahmaud and so many others, it's no wonder people are taken to the streets. And I support them. DETROW: She was quick to separate peaceful protests from looting and acts of violence. And she made a very specific point there to tie in to those acts of violence this Illinois teenager who's been arrested and charged with murder for allegedly traveling to Kenosha and then shooting protesters in some sort of vigilante attempt. CORNISH: Because she's speaking on the same day President Trump is delivering his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, people are talking about this as a prebuttal. I understand Harris zeroed in on how the president has handled the pandemic as well. What stood out to you? DETROW: Yeah, she echoed some central attacks that we've heard from Biden and now Harris throughout the campaign that President Trump did not take the pandemic seriously at first, that he still doesn't take it seriously. One thing I noticed was that given our collective short-term political memories and how short they are, Harris made a point to walk through key moments in meetings from the spring from the early days when President Trump told governors states needed to take the lead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRIS: Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. And he was petty and vindictive. DETROW: She said Americans really have a choice here between a government that will take this pandemic seriously or not take it seriously. CORNISH: And final thoughts, Scott, Joe Biden himself finally coming out and speaking more, right? DETROW: Yeah. He and Harris had both laid low over the last week. It's a real contrast to Trump being out there every single day trying to make news during the Democratic convention. But Biden did two TV interviews today. Harris was out there. They clearly wanted to get their message. And, notably, Biden is going to air a two-minute ad during the speech tonight.

            "article_content": "President Trump is scheduled to address the final night of the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn of the White House in what could be a pivotal speech ahead of the November election.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: It is the final night of the Republican National Convention, and President Trump is expected to deliver a blistering critique of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Trump is also set to talk today about restoring law and order in the country. Here he is earlier today commenting on Kenosha, Wis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will put out the fire. We will put out the flame. We will put out the vandalism because the vandalism and the looting is ridiculous. CHANG: With me now to talk about what to expect tonight are NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson and NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe. Hey to both of you. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: All right, Ayesha, I want to start with you. What do you think we'll be hearing from the president tonight exactly? RASCOE: This is really a moment with the unrest in Kenosha, Wis., where the president will present himself as a defender of America, defender of the suburbs, really. And that's what we've heard throughout the week. It's a message that's really geared towards a mostly white audience, a message about fear and really fear of the cities. I was in Baltimore last night for Vice President Pence's speech, and he got huge applause lines when he talked about there will be law and order. And tonight, I expect we'll hear more of that from President Trump. He'll blame Democratic mayors and governors for the unrest and say if Joe Biden wins, it will get worse. Joe Biden, of course, is speaking out against this. In television interviews today, you know, he made the point that Trump is in charge right now with all of this is happening. And he said - and Biden said that Trump is rooting for violence. I do expect, though, that we'll hear Trump condemn violence on all sides. That has been the line that the White House has taken so far. CHANG: Well, how much do you think President Trump will be speaking directly about Jacob Blake? This is the Black man who was shot by police in Kenosha. RASCOE: It's not clear that he will mention him directly or even the alleged white vigilante who shot and killed two protesters. You know, talking about the victims was a part of the strategy that we saw from Kamala Harris, you know, Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate. She gave a - sort of a prebuttal speech. Here's a little bit from her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: Jacob Blake, shot seven times in the back in broad daylight in front of his three young sons - seven times in the back in broad daylight in front of his three young sons. As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr. Blake pierced the soul of our nation. RASCOE: So Harris is definitely focusing on Blake. She also criticized Trump for his coronavirus response, which she said made things worse than they had to be. And she argued that on the coronavirus, the biggest test of Trump's presidency, she argued that he failed. CHANG: Well, Mara, let's turn to you now. I mean, how much is this law and order message playing with voters so far, you think? LIASSON: Well, there's no doubt the Trump campaign feels the tide is turning for them on this issue, that people are becoming more concerned about rioting than they are about racial justice. There was a new poll out today from Marquette University in Wisconsin that shows white support for the Black Lives Matter movement has evaporated since June. It was plus 25 positive back then. Now it's evenly split. And the fact that this unrest is happening in Wisconsin, one of the three blue wall states that got Trump to the White House last time, he only needs to hang on to one of them to win this time as long as he keeps all his other states. And Wisconsin is considered probably the easiest one for him to keep because there are an awful lot of Trump-like voters there. Sixty percent of the Wisconsin electorate is white, non-college. So he has a pool to fish in there, and this is the Trump campaign strategy, to use the law and order message to find people who look like Trump voters but didn't vote in 2016 and get them to come out this year. CHANG: OK. So the campaign is looking to expand its support among white nonvoters. But, you know, at the same time, Mara, what we've been seeing at this convention, we've been seeing the Republicans feature a lot of Black speakers, other people of color as speakers throughout this week. What do you think is the message that they're trying to convey here? LIASSON: Well, one of the messages they're trying to convey is that Trump is not a racist. They want to reassure, especially white suburban women, that regardless of what you hear from Trump, he is not racially insensitive. Nikki Haley was the most effective messenger on this. She said, it's fashionable for Democrats to call America a racist country. I don't think that's true, but people don't like to be called racist. They didn't like it when Hillary called Trump's supporters deplorable in 2016. That's why Trump made such a big deal over that comment. And all this week, the Republicans have worked really hard at the convention to address all of Trump's deficits, whether it's about COVID or the economy or character, and certainly about race. And that's why - what those Black speakers were there for. CHANG: OK. So a big moment tonight for the president. Real quick, I want to go to each of you with just one quick parting thought ahead of the speech. Ayesha, let's start with you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Tonight is the last big scripted moment and crafted message for Trump. And so after this, he's going to be going back to doing rallies and tweets. And I will be interested to see if he will stick to his message. CHANG: And, Mara, real quick. LIASSON: Well, after this, the next big thing is the debates. I can't think of a campaign where debates will be more important. It's going to be the best opportunity the Trump campaign has to prove their point that Biden has lost a step or two, or as Trump says - likes to say, Biden is shot. The problem is, at his convention, he gave a pretty presidential address (unintelligible)... CHANG: All right. LIASSON: ...From the Oval Office. So now they're switching to say Biden is a really good debater. CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson and Ayesha Rascoe. Thanks to both of you. LIASSON: Thanks. RASCOE: Thank you.

The Bucks and other NBA teams boycotted their games following the police shooting of a Black man in Kenosha, Wis. Updated at 2:45 p.m. Top White House officials are brushing off the significance of NBA protests this week over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. President Trump also weighed in, lamenting Thursday that the NBA has become \"like a political organization,\" but saying he didn't know much about the protests. \"I know their ratings have been very bad because I think people are a little tired of the NBA, frankly, but I don't know too much about the protests,\" Trump said during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \"But I know their ratings have been very bad and that's unfortunate. They've become like a political organization and that's not a good thing. I don't think that's a good thing for sports or for the country.\" In interviews Thursday, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser and the president's son-in-law, discounted the player strikes. \"Look, I think that the NBA players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they're able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially,\" Kushner told CNBC. \"So they have that luxury, which is great.\" On Wednesday, the Milwaukee Bucks said they would not play against the Orlando Magic in protest over Blake's shooting. The 29-year-old Black man remains hospitalized after he was shot seven times in the back by a white Kenosha police officer on Sunday, sparking days of protests in Wisconsin. A 17-year-old from Illinois is under arrest after three protesters were shot, two fatally. The NBA later postponed all three playoff games scheduled for Wednesday. The WNBA and MLB followed suit, postponing games Wednesday night. \"We're tired of the killings and the injustice,\" Milwaukee Bucks guard George Hill told ESPN on Wednesday. The Bucks quickly put out a statement calling on the Wisconsin Legislature to reconvene. Lebron James, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, tweeted a message of support for the striking Bucks players. The Lakers did not play a scheduled game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. \"F*** THIS MAN!!!! WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT,\" James tweeted. On Thursday, Kushner told Politico he would reach out to James. \"Look, let's both agree on what we want to accomplish and let's come up with a common path to get there,\" he said. Kushner pointed to the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill Trump signed into law in 2018, as evidence that the White House has taken tangible action on social justice issues. But the president has frequently decried protests by professional athletes, namely Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice. \"I think with the NBA, there's a lot of activism, and I think that they've put a lot of slogans out,\" Kushner said on CNBC. \"But I think what we need to do is turn that from slogans and signals to actual action that's going to solve the problem.\" Marc Short, Vice President Pence's chief of staff, was asked on CNN whether his boss might weigh in on the NBA strike. \"I don't know that you're going to see the administration weigh in on that one way or the other,\" Short said. \"In my mind, it's absurd, it's silly.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh told reporters Thursday that the president will mention what happened in Wisconsin in his nomination speech Thursday, talking broadly about unrest in American cities such as Minneapolis, Seattle, Chicago, Portland, Ore., and now Kenosha. Trump and Pence have often portrayed American cities as violent and lawless, deploying those descriptions to bolster their warnings about a Joe Biden presidency. \"We will have law and order on the streets of America,\" Pence said during his convention speech Wednesday evening. \"Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities.\" Both Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, have weighed in with messages of support for the player strikes. \"This moment demands moral leadership,\" Biden tweeted. \"And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good. Now is not the time for silence.\"",

Updated at 1245 p.m. ET There's one line that has endured from the convention speech Donald Trump gave four years ago: \"I alone can fix it.\" His message about what was at stake in the 2016 election was downright apocalyptic. \"Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation, the attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life,\" he said. It was a time of relative peace and prosperity. Fast-forward to 2020: the nation in upheaval over racial justice; more than 1,000 people die from the coronavirus every day, and millions more are out of work and school because of the pandemic. Against that backdrop, the president is set on Thursday to deliver his sequel address in front of a crowd on the South Lawn of the White House \u2014 a speech that comes at a critical moment in his reelection campaign. Leading up to the speech, Trump has been making many of the same arguments. \"I'm the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos,\" he said last week \u2014 even though the images of urban riots he often describes are things that have happened on his watch after his lofty \"fix it\" promise. He blames Democratic governors and mayors for the violence. On the coronavirus, the greatest challenge of his presidency, Trump also has shrugged off responsibility. He blames China, where the pandemic originated, and largely delegated responsibility for fixing the problem to state governors. He has also blamed Democratic governors for economic woes, falsely accusing them for shutting down their states \"until after the election's over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible.\" At times, in his speeches and his all-caps Twitter complaints directed at his own government, it seems as if Trump is running as the challenger rather than the incumbent. In his speech, he will seek to cast the election as a choice between a weak establishment candidate in Democratic opponent Joe Biden \u2014 and himself. \"At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas,\" Trump is expected to say, according to excerpts reported by Politico and confirmed by his campaign. \"We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that's not because they don't have one. It's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee,\" he is set to say. Trump's backers say he remains the upstart outsider, even though he's the incumbent. \"Why do you have a bunch of failed Republican establishment figures, stalwarts of the bureaucracy coming out and endorsing Biden? He's always going to be an outsider,\" said Sam Nunberg, who advised Trump in the early days of his 2016 campaign. Trump's supporters at the Republican National Convention have spent three nights building the idea of Trump as a near-messianic figure \u2014 that truly he's the only one who can fix it. Last week, Trump reflected on that line. \"You know when I made that statement, I was a little embarrassed by it. Because it sounds so egotistical,\" he said. \"But there's no other way to say it. We have to win the election.\" In 2016, Trump had a second theme in his convention speech \u2014 that he was a voice for the \"forgotten man and woman.\" Focus groups of voters loved that message, said Frank Luntz, a pollster and political messaging guru. But \"I alone can fix it\" did not test well, and Luntz said it would be a mistake for Trump to revive that theme in his sequel speech. \"If he's about 'I alone can fix it,' then the public will think, 'Well, wait a minute. Over the last six months, you haven't.' And that is the wrong message for him at the very wrong time,\" Luntz told NPR. He said Trump needs to be honest with the public in his speech: Acknowledge things the way they are, and that the pandemic is not in the rearview mirror. On the coronavirus, that hasn't typically been the president's approach. But Trump has been known to surprise, especially on the occasion of big speeches that are read from a teleprompter.",

He stressed a law and order message as protests over racism and policing continue.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Pence speaks on the third day of the Republican National Convention at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He stressed a law and order message as protests over racism and policing continue. Follow live coverage of the RNC all week at NPR.org/conventions. President Trump's campaign was forced to deal with sudden focus on two major news stories \u2014 mounting national unrest about racial injustice after another shooting of a Black man by police in Wisconsin, and Hurricane Laura, which is threatening \"unsurvivable\"storm surge \u2014 on the third night of the Republican National Convention. Vice President Pence spoke to a live audience at Fort McHenry in Baltimore as the keynote speaker and loyal partner of the president's. While he touched on both developments, his law-and-order message quickly pivoted to attack Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the Democratic leaders who threaten basic freedoms and an economy recovering from a coronavirus pandemic. Republicans turned to several high-profile women to highlight issues like education, health care and the effort to combat the opioid crisis as a way to win back support from female voters, specifically suburban women, who helped the GOP win the White House four years ago. As polls continue to show the president trailing Biden, the Trump campaign worked to make the November election a choice between two starkly different visions for America's future, rather than running on the president's record over the past four years. Here are three takeaways from the third night of the RNC: 1. Republicans highlighted a law-and-order message as the nation grapples with racial unrest that speakers didn't acknowledge Convention organizers planned a focus on law and order, with a lineup of top Republicans describing the party's commitment to law enforcement and support for the \"thin blue line.\" But a dizzying series of developments once again focused the nation's attention on issues of systemic racism and injustice. Jacob Blake, a Black man in Kenosha, Wis., was shot multiple times in the back by police on Sunday. The episode, caught on video, spurred protests in Kenosha for the past four nights, and Kyle Rittenhouse, a white male teenager, was arrested for killing two people at a protest. In the hours leading up the convention, NBA teams boycotted playoff games, and Major League Baseball postponed some games. Pence was the one speaker who did make a reference to the situation in Wisconsin, but he didn't acknowledge the serious blowback that it triggered in communities across the country, or offer any commitment to address the underlying issues. Instead he grouped it in with mentions of other incidents across the country in recent weeks. \"Let me be clear: the violence must stop \u2014 whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha,\" he said. He vowed that the Trump administration stood for cracking down while Democrats didn't favor a hard line. \"We will have law and order on the streets of America. Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities.\" He also warned, \"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.\" As they did earlier in the week, Republicans inaccurately argued that the Biden-Harris ticket would defund the police. While Pence and other Republicans focus on violence related to protests, the demonstrations grew from outrage over police brutality, particularly shootings of Black people. The Trump administration's use of the military to crack down on protests has also drawn criticism. Several speakers used heated rhetoric about crime and threats to the suburbs \u2014 a strategy the president's campaign has used in campaign ads, before the pandemic shifted the political conversation in the spring. \"From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant. There's looting, chaos, destruction and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can't \u2014 good, hard-working Americans \u2014 are left to fend for themselves,\" South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said. While the mostly taped segments on Wednesday didn't have time to specifically weigh in on the developments in Kenosha, several Black speakers were featured to push back on Democrats' claims that President Trump is racist, and reach out to those who may feel uncomfortable with some of the president's rhetoric. Clarence Henderson, one of the civil rights activists who was part of sit-ins in the South in the 1960s, vouched for the president. \"His policies show his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50,\" he said. Only 17% of registered Republican voters are nonwhite, according to data from the Pew Research Center. In comparison, 40% of Democratic voters are people of color. 2. Republicans featured speakers and messages aimed at regaining slipping support from suburban women President Trump's support from both college-educated and working-class white women helped him win key battleground states in 2016, but it has dropped significantly. Wednesday's program included a mother who advocated for school choice; second lady Karen Pence talking about her work promoting art therapy with veterans; and Lara Trump, the wife of Trump's son Eric, boasting about the record low unemployment numbers for women since World War II. Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary, recounted her personal story of deciding to undergo a preventative double mastectomy in 2018 after being diagnosed with the genetic condition for breast cancer. She said the president called her even though she had only met him a few times, saying she was \"blown away\" by his personal interest. The story was part of an attempt to show a softer side of the president. \"I know him well now and I can tell you that this president loves the American people, stands by Americans with preexisting conditions, and supports working moms,\" she said. McEnany did not acknowledge that the Trump administration is supporting a lawsuit that would dismantle the requirement that insurers provide coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Kellyanne Conway, who was the first female campaign manager to run a successful presidential campaign, cited Trump's willingness to appoint women to top positions. She also addressed the opioid crisis, a crippling epidemic that has hit communities across the country. \"Rather than look the other way, President Trump stared directly at this drug 'crisis next door' and, through landmark, bipartisan legislation has helped secure historic investments in surveillance, interdiction, education, prevention, treatment and recovery. We have a long way to go, but the political inertia that cost lives, and the silence and stigma that prevents people in need from coming forward is melting away,\" said Conway, who is stepping down at the end of the month. Although the president and most speakers so far this week have largely avoided talking about the coronavirus pandemic, Pence, whom the president tapped to head up the coronavirus task force, followed first lady Melania Trump's move to connect with people who are struggling after months of uprooted routines and economic hardship. \"After all the sacrifice in this ... year like no other \u2014 all the hardship \u2014 we are finding our way forward again,\" Pence said. \"But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who have lost loved ones. We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve.\" 3. Republicans tried to shift the November election from referendum on Trump to a choice between starkly different visions Reelection campaigns are traditionally a referendum on the incumbent president, but the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus in recent months has given Joe Biden a consistent lead in both national polls and polls in key battleground states. Unable to gain traction on the administration's record in recent months, the Trump campaign reverted to a traditional approach of framing the election as a choice \u2014 with speaker after speaker on Wednesday maintaining that Democrats were prepping a massive shift to government control over all aspects of life and trillions in dollars of tax increases, while the Trump-Pence ticket was preserving freedom and a good economy. \"Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left,\" Pence said. Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst also used the frame in her remarks. \"Freedom, prosperity and economic growth under a Trump-Pence administration; or the Biden-Harris path, paved by liberal coastal elites and radical environmentalists. An America where farmers are punished, jobs are destroyed and taxes crush the middle class.\" This strategy continued Tuesday night's effort to juice the GOP base, with dire language. \"Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline. But we're not going to let it happen,\" Pence pledged. (Read more about the rhetoric around \"socialism\" here.) This effort is likely to be an uphill battle for the GOP. The Democratic ticket has worked to avoid getting into specific policy proposals and instead stuck to a slogan of \"fighting for the soul of America.\" Progressive Democrats who have pushed for major new federal programs like \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal have been frustrated that Biden hasn't backed those sweeping proposals. Biden emerged from the wide Democratic primary field as the more pragmatic choice who would be less vulnerable to attacks from the president, and more palatable to wavering independents and Republicans who are concerned about Trump's policies, or more recently, his handling of the coronavirus.

There are three words never far from President Trump's lips this summer: \"law and order.\" As the country has recoiled against police brutality, sparking protests across the country, Trump has used the well-worn phrase over and over again in speeches, at times tweeting it in all caps. LAW & ORDER! The message took center stage again at the Republican National Convention, as Trump presents himself as a \"tough on crime\" leader protecting the suburbs from the violence of U.S. cities. It's a variation on a theme that has been central to Trump's political rise, and now Trump is betting that it will help get him reelected. \"The words 'law and order' are words that Democrats don't like to use,\" Trump told a crowd in Minnesota last week. \"They don't think they're politically good. There's nothing wrong with law and order. There's law and order, and you shouldn't be ashamed of it.\" Critics say Trump's focus on cracking down on \"inner city\" crime harkens back to racist campaigns from the likes of segregationist George Wallace in the 1960s. President Trump surrounded himself with supportive law enforcement officials, signing an executive order on reforms this summer after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump surrounded himself with supportive law enforcement officials, signing an executive order on reforms this summer after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police. NPR examined the way Trump has talked about \"law and order\" over the years, using a database compiled by Factba.se, a website that collects all of Trump's public statements. The specifics of Trump's rhetoric have evolved over time to fit a changing political landscape. But, certain themes \u2014 such as allowing the police to get \"tough\" \u2014 have remained the same. Trump's first major foray into public commentary on crime happened in 1989. Trump, then a real estate developer, took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the death penalty against five Black and Latino boys accused of attacking a woman in Central Park. \"What has happened to law and order ...?\" Trump said in the ad. \"Let our politicians give back our police department's power to keep us safe. Unshackle them from the constant chant of 'police brutality,' which every petty criminal hurls immediately at an officer who has just risked his or her life to save another's.\" The five boys accused of the crime were exonerated years later. Trump has never apologized for the ad. In the years leading up to his run for president, Trump often talked about crime in relation to terrorism, calling for swift executions. In his first campaign for the White House, Trump linked urban crime to illegal immigration, even though studies have shown that people in the country illegally are not more likely to commit crimes. \"Many of these gang members are illegal and they're tough dudes. They will be out of there so fast, your head will spin,\" Trump said in 2015, talking about Chicago and Baltimore. Throughout 2016, Trump made the case that electing him would make these cities safer. Now, as president, he has placed the blame for crime mostly on local Democratic leaders. He argues that reelecting him will protect the rest of the country from the turmoil of U.S. cities. We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!)... \"If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America,\" Trump said earlier this month. Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Quinton Lucas said Trump may have changed his villain, but Trump's core message has remained the same. \"It's playing on fear of Black people, of Black leadership, of Democratic leadership. It's embarrassing. It's awful,\" Lucas told NPR. Lucas is a Black Democrat and took office as mayor last year. Kansas City has been one of the targets of some of Trump's rhetoric. The Trump administration recently sent federal agents to Kansas City to combat a spike in crime that included the shooting death of a 4-year-old boy. President Trump holds a photo of LeGend Taliferro, a boy killed in Kansas City, Mo., during a White House news conference.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump holds a photo of LeGend Taliferro, a boy killed in Kansas City, Mo., during a White House news conference. Lucas said he was blindsided by the federal government's action, which he argued is a short-term political move that will not be a long-term solution. \"We're not enemies, right? I don't want people murdered in Kansas City,\" Lucas said. \"I just want us to work together, rather than just seeing this used as pure political points in a time when we don't need to divide America or Kansas City even more.\" Trump's rhetoric and actions are not helping to deal with actual root causes of crime, like the lack of services and opportunities, said Tracy Siska, the head of the Chicago Justice Project, which pushes for data-based solutions to violence in the city. \"It's completely rebuilding that social fabric in those communities,\" Siska said. \"Everyone says in Chicago and around the community, 'We're not going to arrest our way out of it.' And then all they do is try to arrest their way out of it.\" Loading...",

            "article_content": "Some evangelical voters had misgivings about President Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Four years later at the Republican National Convention, many say those doubts are gone.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Vice President Mike Pence often quotes the Bible in his speeches. Pence referenced this passage in the Old Testament during a surprise visit to the Republican National Convention on Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: I just can't help but think of those ancient words. Who am I? And who is my family that you've brought us this far? And I want to thank you for the honor of this day. (APPLAUSE) GREENE: Pence has helped President Trump shore up white evangelical voters. And as the vice president gets ready to address the GOP convention tonight, NPR's Sarah McCammon speaks with some of those evangelical voters. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: It's Sunday morning before the Republican National Convention, a time when many delegates would be in church. So they're doing the next best thing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Let's do a little pray song, \"God Is So Good.\" UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) God is good. God is so good. MCCAMMON: A couple dozen mostly white evangelical delegates are spaced out several feet apart in this hotel conference room in uptown Charlotte, some wearing masks. They sing praise songs and say prayers for the upcoming convention and the November election. GINGER HOWARD: And, God, Joe Biden has been saying, we're in the battle for the soul of a nation. But, oh, no. We are in the battle between good and evil. And we will not let him hijack that term in the name of Jesus. MCCAMMON: Ginger Howard, an RNC delegate from Georgia, prays that evangelical voters will turn out in force. HOWARD: We ask in the name of Jesus that you would touch their hearts and if they are not registered to vote, they would register. MCCAMMON: Four years ago, many evangelicals expressed misgivings about Trump's moral character and language. But for some, like Janssen Willhoit, a delegate from Vermont, that's changed. In 2016, Willhoit was a delegate for former Ohio Governor John Kasich, a vocal critic of Trump who spoke at the Democratic National Convention this year. JANSSEN WILLHOIT: My church loved me four years ago for going there and staying strong in my convictions. But I'll be honest with you, they're not Kasich fans now. MCCAMMON: Willhoit also has come around. Like many evangelicals, he says Trump has followed through on the things he promised four years ago, including efforts to restrict abortion. As a whole, white evangelical voters have largely continued to favor Trump even as his support among other groups has slipped. WILLHOIT: I do hope and pray that our president is reelected so that what is good, what is right, what is true can prevail. MCCAMMON: Jason Ballard (ph) is a Southern Baptist pastor at a church outside Charlotte. He also sees the election as an important battle in an escalating war between good and evil. He wasn't an early Trump supporter either. But to him, Trump is holding the line against cultural changes he finds disturbing. JASON BALLARD: I think our Christian values are being assaulted by culture. And I think we need someone who is willing to stand up and say, this does not reflect what I believe. MCCAMMON: Ballard and other evangelicals point to things like anti-discrimination protections requiring vendors to provide services for same-sex weddings and social distancing rules that have limited church gatherings during the pandemic. BALLARD: And, I think, the fear that we have is that, ultimately, that anytime I preach that if you don't believe in Christ and his death on the cross, his resurrection, you're going to hell - that's going to turn into hate speech. MCCAMMON: Eliana and Jamie Smith (ph) recently moved from Charlotte across the state line to a quiet, semi-rural neighborhood in York, S.C. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Aw, man. JAMIE SMITH: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's peace and quiet when the kids aren't running around. (LAUGHTER) MCCAMMON: His wife, Eliana Smith, is wearing a shirt that says love life in big letters with a drawing that looks like a fetus in the womb. Smith was disturbed by the Obama administration's efforts to require health insurers to cover contraception. She points to litigation from religious groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order of nuns that has fought for an exception to that rule. That group won their case at the Supreme Court this summer thanks in large part to justices appointed by Trump. ELIANA SMITH: And I feel like he is the only one that's kind of keeping it at bay and saying, no, no, no. We're going to continue to do Christmas. And we're going to protect religious freedoms. And we're not going to force the Little Sisters to do what they don't feel is right for them to do. MCCAMMON: Most theologically conservative Trump supporters are white. But there are exceptions. Eliana is Hispanic. She was born in Colombia. And her husband, Jamie, is Black. Eliana says she doesn't see Trump as a racist. Although, she doesn't like everything she hears. E SMITH: But once again, that goes back to, am I more interested in having a man who's articulate and can tweet everything perfectly? Or am I interested in having a president whose policies will support my Christian agenda? MCCAMMON: Many conservative evangelical voters feel Trump has delivered on that agenda. And they're even more eager to vote for him this time around and defend the ground they've gained over the last four years. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Charlotte. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

She empathized with those struggling with the coronavirus in her remarks.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption First lady Melania Trump arrives to speak to the Republican National Convention from the White House on Tuesday. She empathized with those struggling with the coronavirus in her remarks. The second night of the Republican National Convention presented a more positive message about a second Trump term after opening night's bleak picture of rising crime, unrest and extremist policies the GOP said the Democratic ticket had in store for the country. First lady Melania Trump, who rarely speaks at length, struck an empathetic tone for the country, which is still struggling with the coronavirus. Her speech stood out from the bulk of the program, which largely sidestepped the issue that is the central one voters are likely to consider in November's election. The president, who has demonstrated he doesn't accept most political norms, blurred the lines between the official and the political \u2014 staging key segments of the 2020 convention program from the White House. A series of speakers tapped into many of the culture war issues that the Trump campaign hammered on four years ago, in an effort to rally his loyal supporters to the polls. The GOP, whose leadership is largely white and male, also featured younger and more diverse speakers. Here are some takeaways from the Tuesday lineup: 1. Melania Trump acknowledged the nation's struggles with the coronavirus and racial unrest while others sidestepped those crises in favor of an economic message The first lady spoke from the White House Rose Garden, and her remarks were a departure from most other speakers, who sidestepped two of the chief challenges facing the country \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest. \"I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy, COVID-19, swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,\" she said. Although there was no explicit acknowledgment of the massive scale of the toll of the virus \u2014 more than 178,000 Americans have died so far \u2014 she showed more empathy than her husband has in recent months. \"My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one. ... I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.\" The first lady also touched on the racial unrest in the country. \"It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history,\" she said. But she added: \"I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice, and never make assumptions based on the color of a person's skin.\" She recalled how people underestimated her husband four years ago, and argued he fought then for people who felt alienated from politics and Washington and would do so again in a second term. And the first lady said what you see is what you get with her husband, and another term means more of the same from the president, who uses social media to vent and opine. \"Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,\" she said. \"Whether you like it or not, you always know what he is thinking.\" Other speakers sought to credit President Trump for an improved economy. They said his trade deals, tax cuts and deregulation have brought new opportunities. But those speeches glossed over the reality that the economy has been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, appeared to put the devastating impact of the virus \u2014 with more than 20 million still unemployed and many retail and hospitality industries on the verge of collapse \u2014 in the rearview mirror. Kudlow said, \"We've hit a turning point. And now the recovery has begun.\" Even though the Trump administration has acknowledged more federal help is needed for individuals and businesses, Kudlow said, \"All signs point to a self-sustaining recovery.\" He branded the tax cuts \"a roaring success\" and said that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would reverse all of the GOP's policies. Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds praised the administration's help to businesses and farms during disasters, like the recent derecho that damaged homes and crops in the state. \"Because of President Trump and his leadership, our country is able to bounce back from setbacks and see opportunity grow and thrive.\" 2. In keeping with this norm-busting convention, the RNC program mixed official business with politics President Trump hosts a naturalization ceremony for new citizens in a prerecorded video broadcast during the RNC on Tuesday night.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Committee on Arrangements for the 2020 Republican National Committee via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump hosts a naturalization ceremony for new citizens in a prerecorded video broadcast during the RNC on Tuesday night. With delegates unable to hold a traditional convention of sign-waving crowds in a jam-packed arena, the Trump campaign decided to use a mix of locations. The one that played a starring role on Tuesday night was the White House. Political events are traditionally held off campus, but questions about violations of the Hatch Act \u2014 which bars federal employees from working on campaigns \u2014 were set aside. The White House legal counsel has underscored that it doesn't apply to the president and vice president, but up until now members of both parties have taken pains to avoid conducting overtly political actions on federal property. That changed with the 2020 GOP convention. Appearing in two separate taped segments that were announced as surprising additions to the program, Trump oversaw a naturalization ceremony and announced a presidential pardon from the White House during the prime-time televised convention program. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, administered the oath to five new citizens in the East Room. The president also told the story of Jon Ponder, who Trump said represented \"a beautiful testament to the power of redemption.\" Ponder founded a program for the reentry of inmates into society after serving a 10-year prison sentence in Nevada for bank robbery. On camera, the president reunited Ponder with Richard Beasley, the FBI agent who arrested and later befriended him. With a reality show flair, Trump announced a full pardon for Ponder. Both episodes blurred the lines between what would typically be considered official White House business and political theater. On Thursday night the president will accept his party's nomination for a second term on the South Lawn of the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also broke with precedent, becoming the first top U.S. diplomat to participate in a political convention in modern history. He taped a speech in Jerusalem, where he was on a taxpayer-funded trip as part of his duties as secretary of state. In his speech Pompeo noted that the administration took an action that evangelicals who backed Trump in the 2016 election urged for years \u2014 moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Pompeo called the city the \"rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.\" 3. Spotlight on culture wars showed the campaign's effort to energize Trump's base With a deeply divided country and only a small margin of voters still undecided in the final 10 weeks of the campaign, Trump needs his loyal supporters to turn out in November in high numbers. Tuesday's program featured popular figures who railed about the media for disregarding them and ignoring issues they care about. Eric Trump, the president's second-eldest son, said that in the 2016 election \"the silent majority had no one fighting for them \u2014 in either party.\" He lit into the news media, who he said \"mocked these patriots \u2014 and 'the flyover states' in which they lived. They ignored the Trump flags.\" Nicholas Sandmann, the MAGA hat-wearing Catholic high school teenager whose interaction with liberal activist Nathan Phillips at a January 2019 protest near the Lincoln Memorial triggered widespread coverage on social and mainstream media, received prime billing at the convention. The circumstances of his encounter with Phillips were inaccurately reported by several major media outlets. Sandmann talked about what he called the experience of being \"canceled.\" \"Canceled is what's happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left,\" Sandmann said. \"Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened, and often the media is a willing participant.\" Sandmann delivered his remarks in front of the Lincoln Memorial, and donned a MAGA hat at the end of his speech. Tiffany Trump, the president's youngest daughter, said the press and technology platforms misrepresent the true state of the country. \"If you tune in to the media, you get one biased opinion or another,\" she said. \"And if what you share does not fit into the narrative they seek to promote, then it is either ignored or deemed a 'lie,' regardless of the truth. This manipulation of what information we receive impedes our freedoms.\" 4. Republicans gave a big stage to diverse and younger voices as it struggles with the minority and youth vote The Trump campaign only received 8% of the Black vote in the 2016 election, and the GOP's standing among minorities has remained low. Efforts to boost support in key battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin continue, but Democrats argued repeatedly in last week's convention that the president's policies have had the most negative impact on Black and Latino communities. Convention organizers gave some of the prized convention slots to rising stars this week in an effort to counter the Democrats' narrative. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron took issue with some of Joe Biden's comments, which he said assumed the African American community is monolithic. \"Mr. Vice President, look at me. I am Black,\" Cameron said, addressing Biden directly. \"We are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. My mind is my own, and you can't tell me how to vote because of the color of my skin.\" But Cameron's influence with Black voters may be undermined by criticism of his office's investigation of the Breonna Taylor case. The 26-year-old Black woman was fatally shot in her home in March by Louisville police, and activists have demanded accountability of local law enforcement. Giving a national stage to Cameron followed Monday night's hopeful closing speech from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate's only Black Republican. (There are two Black Democrats in the Senate.) Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who talked about her immigrant parents from India, was another speaker the party elevated, with many including her on lists of future presidential candidates.

Four years ago, older white voters played a big role in helping to elect Donald Trump president, especially in key battleground states like Florida and Pennsylvania. Robert Griffin, who's with the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, says to win a second term, Trump needs them to turn out in even bigger numbers. \"It's not just that Trump had to sort of hold steady,\" Griffin said. \"He actually had to increase his margins a bit relative to 2016.\" Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic challenger, is working hard to make sure that doesn't happen, airing ads aimed at seniors critical of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic response. One shows a pair of elderly retirees peering out from their home, where they're sheltering in place. \"While I don't blame Donald Trump for the virus, I blame him for his lack of action,\" Donna says. The group Republican Voters Against Trump is also webcasting video testimonials from older white voters who say they're switching to Biden. \"It's OK that we voted for Donald Trump in the first election,\" says a man identified as Joseph in Florida. \"Do I want a Democrat? Do I want Joe Biden? Not really. But four more years of Donald Trump will be disastrous for the country.\" What this key group of seniors told NPR Polls suggest more seniors are feeling this way, so NPR recently reached out to a random group of older voters who cast ballots for Trump in 2016. Many said they are deeply troubled by the president's behavior. \"He's not exactly the most trustworthy individual,\" said Marty Stango, 77, who lives near Jacksonville, Fla. \"He definitely will throw out things that are absolute lies.\" \"I really don't think his character is great, you know?\" said Doris Harrington, 82, who lives in Des Moines, Iowa. \"His morals are not my morals.\" A lot of seniors who backed Trump four years ago also told NPR they're tired of his tweets and dislike his use of profanity, and many rate him poorly on his handling of the pandemic. But NPR heard something else from these voters: a reminder of just how hard it is these days to actually change people's votes. Troubled by Trump but sticking with him Stango in Florida said he's not yet switching to Biden: \"Right now at least, I'm for Trump.\" Harrington in Des Moines agreed. For all her misgivings about the president, she's actually enthusiastic about a second term. \"Even though his character might be bad, he is supporting religious freedom, religious rights, right to life, which the Democratic Party [is] not.\" Marty Stango says he thinks President Trump is often dishonest, but he's not comfortable voting for Joe Biden in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Hilda Zeller Stango\n                    \n                \nhide caption A lot of older Trump voters interviewed by NPR echoed these ideas, saying they like Biden but think his party has moved too far to the left. This is a voting bloc that is far more white and rural than the U.S. as a whole. Many told NPR they reject the argument that Trump is racist and are troubled by Democrats' embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement. Robin Tunnel, 64, lives in Midlothian, Texas. She thinks Trump is \"un-presidential\" and \"a bully,\" but he shares her views on race. \"I just don't understand this kneeling for the flag. I think that that is just horrible,\" Tunnel said. \"Trump would never do that.\" Defections could cost Trump key states NPR did find some older white Trump voters who said his behavior has caused them to waver. They're giving Biden a serious look. \"Today I would vote for Donald Trump, but the strength of my confidence is waning and it could definitely change,\" said Michael Barbone, from Odessa, Fla., who at age 59 lands on the edge of the senior voting group. Griffin, the pollster, says these responses aren't surprising. The data don't suggest a huge shift among seniors who voted for Trump. But he thinks it's clear there is enough softening of support to put Trump's reelection at risk. \"The reality that it's happened appears to be confirmed by a lot of different pollsters. That's really problematic for him,\" Griffin said. Still, the polling data and NPR's interviews suggest this key group of voters remains in play, still reachable by both sides with just over two months to Election Day.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden will take center stage Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention, accepting the party's nomination for president decades after his first presidential run.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: More than 30 years after his first run for president and after some big early losses in this year's primary, Joe Biden accepts the Democratic presidential nomination tonight. The former vice president's remarks cap off the fourth and final night of this all-virtual Democratic National Convention. I'm joined now by NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid and senior political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hello to you both. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Thanks for having us. FADEL: So, Asma, we'll start with you. You'll be in the room tonight for Biden's remarks in Wilmington, Del. Set the scene a little bit. KHALID: Yeah. You know, Leila, he'll deliver a speech in kind of strange surroundings. He'll be in the same city where his national political career first began. Yeah, he'll be in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., as you mentioned. But if it's anything akin to last night's remarks with Sen. Kamala Harris, there will be, you know, some cameras in the room and a couple dozen socially distant reporters but no, you know, big, cheering crowds in an arena with stadium seating, and that's all because of the pandemic. So Joe Biden won't be able to rely on applause lines to kind of carry him through. And I'm really fascinated by this, Leila, because, you know, what arguably might be one of the most important speeches of his political career will also be perhaps one of the most unusual. FADEL: Definitely. Domenico, do we know from the Biden campaign what he intends to say tonight? MONTANARO: Yeah. According to the campaign, they said that he's going to stress unity, which is something that he's done from the beginning of his campaign. His opening campaign event in Philadelphia was all about that despite these divisive times. And he's going to stress resilience to overcome hardships and crises, which Biden knows something about from his personal life experience, and will lay out, they say, a vision for the path forward. FADEL: Now, Asma, you've reported on Biden through his primary campaign and also reported on how a number of progressive groups feel about him. How do you think this unity message might be received? KHALID: I think that's an interesting question, Leila, and in part because, you know, as you mentioned at the top, that Biden has long been a part of public life. We're talking about a man who spent nearly 50 years in public service. And the Democratic Party today that he is leading is not the same party as it was when Joe Biden entered the Senate in the 1970s. He has certainly evolved, and we've seen that with a number of his current policies. But even as he's adopted more progressive policies around, say, the economy or climate change, he still physically represents an old guard of the party. He is a 77-year-old white man that is leading a party that has been hungry for change around issues of racial justice. And the nostalgia that he speaks of - the bipartisanship, the uniting the country even in divisive times - this is a message that some progressives in the party have told me they've been skeptical of. And so I'll be watching to see how Joe Biden's message is able to be convincing to them or not. FADEL: Now, Domenico, let's take a step back, look at this week as a whole. What did the Democratic party hope to accomplish? MONTANARO: Well, you know, part of why Biden was able to win the primary was because people saw him as the most likely, most able to defeat President Trump. And he's come in with a lead into this convention. He - and their goal is to lock in the people who, you know, have been on his side who might be persuadable and to appeal to some of those new voters who Asma is talking about who should be on board but maybe aren't totally sold on Biden. So there's a lot on the biography side for Biden to soften him up a little bit. The Democratic Party, of course, is diverse - they wanted to highlight that - not just racially and ethnically but generationally as well. And Democrats wanted to showcase a more optimistic vision for America compared to what they've seen the last 3 1/2 years of what they see as darkness under President Trump. They also wanted to reach out to those persuadable voters who might be disaffected by Trump. And in appealing to them, they're saying, in a way, make this an asterisk election. You know, you might not agree with Biden and the Democrats on everything, but Trump is a threat to democracy. And that's something that former President Barack Obama drove home last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you are going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can, and tell your family and friends how they can vote, too. KHALID: And, Leila, I find that message, the emphasis on voting, to be so critical to what we've heard from Democrats all week. If there is one central throughline of this convention, to me, it has been the emphasis on voting. We heard Michelle Obama, the former first lady, make this point on the first night of the convention. She was actually wearing a necklace with the words vote on them. Hillary Clinton made this point last night. She made it very personal, using her own defeat as this cautionary tale as to what can happen if not enough people vote. And I will say, I cannot really remember a convention in recent memory with such specific and repeated appeals to voting, emphasizing, you know, that it's not just about you making sure you get out to vote. You got to make a plan as to how to do this. FADEL: So a sense of urgency with them. Sticking with you, Asma, Kamala Harris is said to be at Biden's speech tonight. And one thing that struck me hearing her last night was her specific references to her immigrant roots. She's the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. Did that strike you? KHALID: It did. It did seem like she was speaking more openly about her immigrant roots than some of what we heard during the primary cycle. And part of this is she was trying to emphasize the universality of her own story. We are a country where a number of people have immigrant roots. You know... FADEL: Right. KHALID: Tonight we'll hear from another mix of people, folks like Sen. Cory Booker and Tammy Duckworth. But one thing I think that's worth remembering is, as Domenico said, this is a Democratic Party that is trying to appeal to various generational and racial diverse aspects of its coalition. FADEL: And next week it will be the Republicans' turn to make the case for why Donald Trump deserves four more years. NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Asma Khalid, thank you. MONTANARO: You're welcome. KHALID: You're welcome. FADEL: And we'll have live special coverage of tonight's convention starting at 9 p.m. Eastern. You can follow updates at npr.org. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

She spoke about her upbringing and her family and her background as a prosecutor.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks in Wilmington, Del., during Night 3 of the Democratic National Convention. She spoke about her upbringing and her family and her background as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris made history with her formal nomination as the first Black woman and person of Asian descent on a major party's national ticket. The 55-year-old California senator used much of her first prime-time address as Joe Biden's running mate to tell her own story before turning her fire on President Trump. Former President Barack Obama, who has mostly stayed on the sidelines as Democrats blasted President Trump's policies over the past 3 1/2 years, took off the gloves and questioned Trump's fitness for the job. Here are four takeaways from Night 3 of the Democratic National Convention. 1. Harris introduced herself and began to prosecute the case against Trump Speaking in a quiet and mostly empty hall in Wilmington, Del., Harris used much of her speech to tell her story \u2014 and try to link it to the stories of other children of immigrants and their experiences. With some political observers already setting expectations that this national introduction could determine the success or failure of a future Harris presidential campaign \u2014 given that her running mate is 77 \u2014 Harris faced the test of connecting with people who were taking a first look and energizing those in the Democratic base who have been less than enthusiastic about Biden as their standard bearer. Harris received national attention for her debate performances during her primary run and for her questioning of top Trump administration officials from her perch in the Senate. But this was the first time many Americans heard about her mother and father, immigrants from India and Jamaica, respectively. Harris highlighted her upbringing in the 1960s when she attended civil rights marches as a small child. \"In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a stroller's-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called 'good trouble,' \" she said. Harris talked about her husband, Doug Emhoff, his two children from a previous marriage who call her \"Momala,\" her extended family and even her sorority sisters. But she soon pivoted to the traditional role of a vice presidential running mate \u2014 attacking the opposing ticket. Harris made it personal about Trump, even though her hardest-hitting lines didn't explicitly mention his name. Noting her background as a prosecutor fighting for victims of sexual assault and taking on big banks, Harris said, \"I know a predator when I see one,\" followed by a studied pause. She later talked about the impact of inequities in the country \u2014 in health care, education and opportunity, and the fight to combat racial injustice. \"There is no vaccine for racism. We've gotta do the work,\" she said. \"For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us.\" The virtual convention format inevitably lessened the drama of Harris' speech. She paused to mark the moment when she accepted her party's historic nomination \u2014 something she said her late mother could not have imagined. But there were no cheers or TV shots of emotional female supporters in a crowded hall. While the goal was to fire up those who have been waiting for a woman of color to be celebrated on the national stage, the event came across as serious but without the energy of an audience. As Harris finished, Biden made a surprise appearance, socially distanced, but there was no traditional balloon drop. 2. Democrats hammered away at a theme: Make a plan to vote Speaker after speaker Wednesday reminded Americans \u2014 and then reminded them again \u2014 that they need to vote in the 2020 election. Democrats are growing increasingly concerned about the president's rhetoric raising questions about the legitimacy of the November vote. Party leaders worry that people will be reluctant to vote in person because of the coronavirus pandemic. They expect an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots and are planning a robust effort to make sure voters cast their ballots early or mail them in time to be counted. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump appointee and campaign donor, is facing tough questions on Capitol Hill about reforms he put in place in the U.S. Postal Service that some fear would slow mail delivery. Under pressure, he suspended the reforms until after the election. Obama warned in his speech that Republicans were counting on people not showing up in November. In this image from video, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during the third night of the Democratic National Convention. She emphasized the importance of voting.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this image from video, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during the third night of the Democratic National Convention. She emphasized the importance of voting. \"Do not let them take away your power,\" he said. \"Don't let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you're going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote, too.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren closed her remarks, as did others, by offering information on how to vote: \"Whether you're planning to vote wearing a mask or vote by mail, please, take out your phone right now and text 'VOTE' to 3-0-3-3-0.\" And Hillary Clinton, who lost in 2016 to Trump, reminded viewers that many voters sat out that election because they didn't think their vote mattered. She warned, \"This can't be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election. \" 3. Presidents' Club rules went out the window as Obama unloaded on his successor Obama has kept a mostly low profile as Trump has worked to dismantle many of the policies Obama worked over eight years to put in place. Like other former presidents, he has adhered to the unofficial rule that public criticism of the occupant of the White House is off-limits. In this image from video, former President Barack Obama speaks Wednesday night at the convention, touching on President Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this image from video, former President Barack Obama speaks Wednesday night at the convention, touching on President Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis. That changed Wednesday night when Obama unleashed his contempt for the former businessman and reality TV star who took his place in 2017. \"For close to four years now, he's shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves.\" Democratic convention organizers presented a string of speakers who argued that Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic conclusively makes the case that he doesn't deserve a second term. Obama linked Trump's management of the crisis to lives needlessly lost. \"Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't,\" Obama said. \"And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\" But as tough as the former president's rhetoric was about Trump, his mostly reserved demeanor and steady delivery didn't come across with the same urgency as his wife's remarks about Trump on Monday night. Michelle Obama's warning about four more years of a Trump administration was blunter: Trump, she said, \"is clearly in over his head.\" WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN? Like his wife, the former president warned that things are going to get rougher as Election Day nears. \"This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes to win,\" Obama said. And Obama said this election isn't just about the White House, calling on voters to vote \"like never before, for Joe and Kamala, and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country we love stands for, today and for all our days to come.\" Trump was evidently watching Obama's speech. He tweeted a false claim he previously made about the former president and questioned Obama's support for Biden's candidacy. 4. Female party leaders vouched for the Biden-Harris ticket Convention organizers faced some criticism for giving too much airtime to party elders \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 at the expense of the next generation of leaders. Wednesday's lineup was heavy on popular women, and they contrasted Biden's commitment to issues such as health care, gun control and child care with Trump's policies, which they argued threaten the economic future of women. These speakers also took on the task of presenting the policy agenda for a Biden-Harris administration. The bulk of the convention program up until now has been about attacking Trump. Former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, whose grave injuries from a mass shooting in Tucson in 2011 continue to make speech difficult, appeared in front of an American flag and delivered a brief but firm message. \"Words once came easily. Today I struggle with speech. But I have not lost my voice,\" said Giffords, now the leader of a group pressing for new gun restrictions. \"We are at a crossroads. We can let the shooting continue or we can act.\" In this image from video, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., speaks during Night 3, recounting Joe Biden's support for her after a mass shooting.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this image from video, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., speaks during Night 3, recounting Joe Biden's support for her after a mass shooting. Giffords recounted how Biden comforted her after the shooting and she remains a key Biden ally. But her appearance also carried a collateral political purpose \u2014 her husband, Mark Kelly, is running against Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally. Warren, a former rival of Biden's in the primaries, spoke from a shuttered child care center in Springfield, Mass., and blamed the Trump administration for a laundry list of problems facing working families because of the coronavirus pandemic. \"This crisis is bad and didn't have to be this way. This crisis is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him. On Nov. 3, we hold them all accountable,\" Warren said. \"I love a good plan, and Joe Biden has some really good plans,\" she said. \"Plans to bring back union jobs in manufacturing and create new union jobs in clean energy. Plans to increase Social Security benefits, cancel billions in student loan debt and make our bankruptcy laws work for families instead of the creditors who cheat them.\" Similarly, Clinton name-checked issues effectively on the ballot in November, arguing that they demand a vote for Democrats. \"Vote for parents struggling to balance their child's education and their safety. And for health care workers fighting COVID-19 with no help from the White House. Vote for paid family leave and health care for everyone. Vote to protect Social Security, Medicare, reproductive rights and our planet,\" Clinton said. The former Democratic presidential nominee also vouched for Biden's character, the four-day convention's central theme. And as one trailblazing woman to another, she predicted a coming torrent of attacks on Harris. \"I know a thing or two about the slings and arrows coming her way.\" Loading...",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris' acceptance speech is expected to be the highlight of the third night of the Democratic convention. Former President Barack Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are set to speak, too.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Kamala Harris takes center stage tonight. The all-virtual Democratic National Convention continues this evening. The California senator will accept the party's vice presidential nomination. Also set to speak tonight - former President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid joins us now from Delaware with a preview of the evening. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. FADEL: So one criticism from some younger voters is that the convention's first two nights have featured a number of older party stalwarts and fewer younger voices. Tell us about that. KHALID: Yeah. And, Leila, last night was a good example. You know, there was this 17-person keynote address that featured up-and-coming rising stars in the party, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, representative from New York, also spoke briefly. But the roster was largely many of the older folks within the party, and it seemed to suggest to some of the younger voters I've heard that there was a lot of nostalgia for what the old Democratic Party used to be. You know, you heard from Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, Colin Powell - who was actually a former Republican secretary of state. And then there was this video that celebrated the relationship that the Bidens have had with the late Republican Sen. John McCain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED KAUFMAN: They'd be going at it on the floor, and you'd think, oh, these guys must really, really, really dislike each other. And they'd be having dinner that night together. KHALID: And, Leila, that's not exactly - that vision of bipartisanship isn't exactly what some younger Democrats see when they look at the current Republican Party. But looking at tonight's lineup, there are some issues highlighted that really do matter to younger folks, especially gun control and climate change. The party's going to hear from Emma Gonzalez. She's a survivor of the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and is now a vocal gun control activist. And there'll also be a panel conversation with a group of young climate activists. FADEL: So we've got those issues. But, tonight, women are being highlighted. What's - why's that? KHALID: Well, this week marks 100 years since the 19th Amendment was ratified, giving women the right to vote, and so we're going to see that reflected in some of the programming. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren will speak. And, you know, as you mentioned, Hillary Clinton - who famously talked about shattering that highest glass ceiling, when she lost to President Trump - she's also going to speak. And then, of course, there's Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's newly announced running mate. And it's worth pointing out that for all the focus on the racial diversity she brings to the ticket, that there is also a sense of gender diversity that she'll bring to the ticket and that women, as a whole, are a crucial voting bloc for the Democratic Party, and they need to ensure that women voters turn up on Election Day. FADEL: So this is Harris' biggest stage. What are you expecting to hear from her tonight? KHALID: Leila, a campaign aid said that you can expect to hear Senator Harris talk about her own life, her personal story, and how that might resonate with other Americans. So we\u2019ll hear more, you know, perhaps, about her own personal biography, which is an unprecedented story in American politics. You know, she is the country\u2019s first woman of color on a major party ticket. She\u2019s the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. Senator Harris also intends to lay out a vision for a more inclusive America and make the case for electing Joe Biden. You know, this is one of the primary responsibilities of a running mate, is to prosecute the case. And Senator Harris gave us a preview of what she might do in that regard last week, when she was first rolled out as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. FADEL: So former President Obama is set to deliver remarks right before Harris. What might we expect from him, and how does it indicate his role in the party now? KHALID: You know, Leila, I think he's one of the most interesting people we're going to hear from in the convention because he is one of Joe Biden's most effective surrogates, and some folks within the party see him as the possible bridge between Joe Biden and some of these younger disaffected voters. He can also obviously speak to the working relationship that they had in the White House and, specifically, Joe Biden's role in the economic recovery during the Great Recession.

            "article_content": "Former Georgia House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams (center) and \"rising stars\" in the Democratic Party speak during the second night of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Democratic National Convention via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Georgia House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams (center) and \"rising stars\" in the Democratic Party speak during the second night of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday. The second night of the Democratic National Convention began with a montage of young elected leaders \u2014 17 of the party's \"rising stars\" delivering a joint keynote from across the country. But the convention's first two nights also prominently featured speakers more reminiscent of bygone political eras than the current one, like Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, Colin Powell, Cindy McCain and Caroline Kennedy. That lineup has made some young people wonder whether the party is emphasizing nostalgia over the kind of forward-focused vision for the country most likely to entice younger voters. When convention organizers unveiled the speaker list last week, a group representing more than 200 convention delegates under age 35 wrote an open letter calling for more generational diversity in the program. Joseph Mullen, an 18-year-old Bernie Sanders delegate from Florida who founded the Young Delegates Coalition to bolster the voices of millennial (ages 24-39) and Gen Z delegates (ages 18-23) in the party, says it's not just a question of representation. Appeals for a return to normalcy fall flat with many young voters. \"We are in such a critical state as young people where we are watching climate change erode the shorelines down here in Florida,\" Mullen says. \"We are watching our peers and fellow students be killed in school because of gun violence. These are urgent catastrophes in our country. These are things that are impending, right in front of our faces. And to me, it feels like we don't have the time to say we're going to go back to the old model of politics.\" Before showrunners added the 17-person keynote address and other tweaks to the agenda, Mullen said the average age of a confirmed convention speaker was 62 years old and the whole week originally featured only two elected officials under age 40: Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Tuesday's keynote was a welcome addition, Mullen says, but when members of the Young Delegates Coalition gathered for a virtual watch party Tuesday night, two squares on the convention bingo cards they printed for the night encapsulated their frustration. The squares were to be marked off when someone complained about Bill Clinton speaking too long or Ocasio-Cortez speaking too little. Zenaida Huerta, a 22-year-old Sanders delegate from California, says the party missed an opportunity with young voters by not featuring Ocasio-Cortez more prominently. \"Her speech really was an emotional and passionate plea and full of imagery of the pain that Americans and young Americans, frankly, are quite familiar with,\" Huerta says. \"Young Americans right now are leading marches against racial injustice across America, and they're the ones suffering the most under this economic system.\" Huerta says the rawness that Ocasio-Cortez captured in just over a minute did more to speak to young voters than any of the septuagenarian talkers who got more time. Prentiss Haney, executive director of the Ohio Student Association, says the speaker lineup makes him think the campaign is making a calculated choice about which voters are most likely to show up and help Joe Biden across the finish line this fall. Haney points to a poll released in June by the Alliance for Youth Action that found 43% of persuadable young voters had not been contacted by the Democratic Party or the Biden campaign. \"Young people are not confused about the choice or the stakes,\" Haney says. \"What they want is to be acknowledged around their political agency, and to understand what's the path forward? What's the long arc?\" From Michigan, 27 year-old state Rep. Mari Manoogian helped deliver the opening keynote. It was pretaped, but by 10 o'clock Tuesday night, she was just getting a chance to grab some dinner after the segment aired. Manoogian attended her first convention as a high-schooler with her dad. She says that the Biden campaign has been serious about engaging young people beyond just the convention and that the keynote made that clear. \"This is not the first time I've had any interaction with the campaign before or with folks who are working to get Biden and [Kamala] Harris elected,\" Manoogian says. \"This is a deep relationship that we've built with them. And they listen to us. They take our opinions very seriously. And that, to me, is showing that, you know, not just when it matters for television, but when it truly counts, they're taking young, progressive leadership seriously.\" Matthew Nowling, interim president of the College Democrats, says you have to look at the convention week as a whole. On top of daytime programming for young people and progressives throughout the week, he says there is plenty for young people to like on the main stage, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former first lady Michelle Obama. \"I don't know how many of my friends are sitting through the whole thing,\" he says. \"But I do know that people are on social media and seeing different clips from it, like I know that my Twitter feed was inundated with clips of Michelle Obama. We grew up with Barack and Michelle Obama, so I saw a lot of nostalgia about that and her message really connecting.\" Wednesday's night's convention lineup will kick off with Emma Gonzalez, one of the founders of March For Our Lives, and include a conversation with young climate activists. But these slots are still relegated to a few minutes at the beginning of the night, before most major networks begin to carry the programming. During the primary campaign, Biden struggled to gain significant traction with young voters \u2014 a key demographic the Democrats will need to turn out in November. On Super Tuesday, for example, exit polls showed that Sanders won 18- to 29-year-old voters in every state but Mississippi. According to Pew, Gen Z is projected to make up 1 in 10 eligible voters in 2020. Cameron Kasky, who helped found March For Our Lives in response to school shootings, says candidates like Sanders and Andrew Yang were exciting during the primary because they had a new game plan for the country. Now, it's about a binary choice between Biden, 77, and President Trump, who is 74. Even though that's the reality of this moment, Kasky says there are still things the campaign can do to keep young people engaged. \"If the campaign focuses on letting it be about Joe sharing the mic with people and lifting up different stories, that could be really effective, Kasky says. After organizing a youth-led movement to curb gun violence, Kasky says he's learned politicians need to prove they're listening to young voters, not just paying them lip service. \"When we were working with young organizers and going to different cities around the country, we'd be sitting down with local March for Our Lives chapters. And people would say, 'The one constant the one thing we've dealt with with politicians on both sides of the aisle is they're just not listening to us.' So if Biden's campaign is able to go out there and say, 'We hear you and we really do want you to have a seat at the table,' that's going to be effective.\" Loading...",

For our next entry, Nashville-based soul singer Devon Gilfillian examines how the pandemic created space for a national dialogue on race with his new song, \"Cracks in the Ceiling,\" which he wrote after a difficult conversation with a close friend. \"All of the songs that I love that I have written come out of conversations [where] I sit down with somebody and we talk for an hour, three hours \u2014 our hearts are connected, our minds are connected,\" Devon Gilfillian says. \"And if all those things come together, you will find an amazing song.\" The musician says that his new song \"Cracks in the Ceiling\" came from one such situation: Gilfillian, who's not a fan of the president, sat down to talk with a friend who had voted for Donald Trump. \"I saw light bulbs go off in many moments talking about my understanding of Black history in this country,\" Gilfillian recalls. \"He told me about his Christian upbringing and watching The Dukes of Hazzard and not knowing that the Confederate flag was a racist symbol until recently.\" \"Those conversations are scary,\" he continues. \"You feel like you might walk away without a friend.\" Together they came to a middle ground, but Gilfillian was still thinking about that conversation days later when he did a songwriting session with Natalie Closner Schepman and Allison and Meegan Closner \u2014 three sisters who make up the Portland, Ore.-based band Joseph and provide back-up vocals on \"Cracks in the Ceiling.\" NPR's David Greene spoke to Devon Gilfillian about piecing together the lyrics to \"Cracks in the Ceiling\" while chatting with the members of Joseph about civil rights, how he hopes the world has stopped for a reason and about seizing the moment to address systemic racism with open conversations.

The white St. Louis couple who attracted national attention for brandishing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters in June will be back in the spotlight next week, this time as speakers at the Republican National Convention. Joel Schwartz, one of the lawyers for Mark and Patricia McCloskey, confirmed to NPR Tuesday the couple has been invited to take part, but it remains unclear on what day, as final details are still being worked out. Another attorney, Albert Watkins, tells NPR there has been \"ongoing contact with the White House\" since the June 28 incident and President Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows reached out to the couple. The couple will be joining the RNC remotely via video link, Watkins says. Officials with the RNC did not immediately return NPR's request for comment. The McCloskeys face felony charges for waving firearms \"in a threatening manner\" at demonstrators as they marched through the couple's neighborhood en route to the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, who lives nearby. The couple, both attorneys, said they armed themselves because they felt threatened by the protesters. Images of the incident went viral on social media. President Trump also retweeted an ABC News video on June 29, without comment, showing Mark McCloskey holding a black semi-automatic rifle and his wife holding a silver pistol. The couple were shouting at protesters as they walked by their home. In the clip, several protesters can be seen recording the couple with their cellphones as drumming and chants of \"Let's go\" can be heard. A couple pointed guns at protesters in St. Louis as a group marched toward the mayor's home to demand her resignation. https://t.co/5EqDd43QCd pic.twitter.com/KWNaif77ch A circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, Kimberly Gardner, announced last month that both of the McCloskeys face one charge of unlawful use of a weapon, which is a class E felony. \"It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest, and while we are fortunate this situation did not escalate into deadly force, this type of conduct is unacceptable in St. Louis,\" Gardner said in a statement. The incident has drawn both ire from Black Lives Matter supporters and praise from Second Amendment activists. It has also attracted the attention of several Republicans who railed against charges brought by the city of St. Louis. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted after the charges were announced, \"This is an outrageous abuse of power.\" This is an outrageous abuse of power https://t.co/WWftfcqXdZ Hawley also said the case should be dismissed, while also calling for an investigation into the office that brought charges. \"Dozens of violent criminals go free but homeowners facing trespassers on their own property are prosecuted. All the more reason for a SEARCHING Justice Dept investigation of the Circuit Attorney's Office,\" Hawley tweeted. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has floated the idea of pardoning the McCloskeys should they be convicted, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.",

            "article_content": "Updated at 7:22 a.m. ET Michelle Obama didn't mince words Monday night. After mostly staying out of the political fray during President Trump's tenure in the White House, she used her prime-time Democratic National Convention slot to deliver a blistering indictment on his policies and ability to lead. \"Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.\" The bestselling author and popular former first lady was the closer for Democrats on the first night of the convention. In a taped appearance sitting in what looked like a living room with a Biden sign behind her, Obama said she \"hates politics,\" but she proceeded to give the most political and personal speech of the night. She reprised her 2016 Democratic convention tag line, describing her strategy for responding to then-candidate Donald Trump: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Obama acknowledged that some weren't sure the Democratic Party should stick with that approach. But she defended staying true to it, saying, \"Going high is the only thing that works, because when we go low, when we use those same tactics of degrading and dehumanizing others, we just become part of the ugly noise that's drowning out everything else. We degrade ourselves. We degrade the very causes for which we fight.\" But for the 2020 version, Obama suggested there are times when hitting back is necessary, saying, \"Going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty.\" Wearing a gold necklace with letters that spelled V-O-T-E, the former first lady made an urgent plea for Americans to show up in 2020. \"We've got to vote early, in person if we can. We've got to request our mail-in ballots right now, tonight, and send them back immediately and follow up to make sure they're received. And then, make sure our friends and families do the same. We have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner and maybe breakfast too, because we've got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.\" That message could be viewed as at odds with advice from public health experts who warn that Americans need to social distance during the coronavirus pandemic and avoid crowded places. Joe Biden, 77, has held few public events and has stuck to just a handful of low-key events with small numbers of voters in his home state of Delaware or neighboring Pennsylvania. Loading... Obama warned against complacency and noted that people deciding their votes didn't matter led to Trump's victory in 2016. She also made it clear people who may not be completely sold on Biden needed to get behind the party's nominee. In a reference that could include rapper Kanye West's lackluster candidacy for president, Obama said, \"This is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning.\" President Trump responded to the former first lady in a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, criticizing the record of the Obama-Biden administration and mocking the timing of Michelle Obama's endorsement of her husband's vice president. Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren\u2019t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late &  unenthusiastic endorsement..... Many of the speakers during Monday night's lineup focused on issues of racial injustice in an effort to build a case that Biden is the right candidate to heal a country still reeling from the aftermath of George Floyd's death while he was in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Floyd's family members appeared for a moment of silence as part of the programming. But Obama's speech only briefly touched on that issue, when she mentioned Floyd and another African American, Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in Louisville, Ky., five months ago. Obama noted, \"Stating the simple fact that a Black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office.\" The former first lady did discuss her personal experience getting to know Biden during her husband's presidency, outlining Biden's own struggles and ability to empathize with others. \"His life is a testament to getting back up, and he is going to channel that same grit and passion to pick us all up, to help us heal and guide us forward.\" But a central message of her speech was focused on painting a dark picture of what she described as the state of the country and the current president's character and impact on children. At one point Obama said those in the next generation \"see our leaders labeling fellow citizens enemies of the state while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protesters for a photo op.\" Former President Barack Obama is slated to speak on Wednesday night about his former vice president, and it's likely he will include more firsthand accounts of Biden's leadership and involvement in some of his administration's biggest accomplishments, such as enacting major health care reforms and addressing the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. On Twitter, he also echoed his wife's push for people to get out and vote. As Michelle said, we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. So make sure you have a plan to vote. Vote early. And tell everybody you know to register to vote at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. https://t.co/rAUsWHusbV Michelle Obama referenced the divisions in the country, saying, \"I am a Black woman speaking at the Democratic convention.\" But even as Biden announced the historic pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate \u2014 making her the first Black woman and the first person of Asian descent to be nominated as vice president by a major political party \u2014 she did not spend any time marking that dynamic in her speech. Instead, she used the speech to paint a picture of what she believes is at stake for the country if the president is reelected. Obama warned: \"If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we don't make a change in this election. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.\"",

Biden will accept his party's nomination at this week's Democratic National Convention. When former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. becomes the Democratic Party's official nominee for president on Thursday, he will complete two historic and improbable comebacks. Earlier this year, Biden rose from roadkill status in early February voting to effectively claim the nomination by the end of March. But 2020 was far from the first time Biden bid for the White House. His nomination realizes the dream of a recurrent campaign first launched more than three decades ago \u2014 in another political era, in another century. No other major party nominee has reached this plateau so many years after their first formal candidacy. Most Americans know Biden as the No. 2 who served eight years under Barack Obama. They may know that Biden previously had been a high-profile, six-term senator from Delaware, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Foreign Relations Committee. Fewer may recall that Biden was also a candidate for president in 2008, dropping out after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses. Fewer yet remember Biden's brilliant flame-out in 1987, when he was among the early favorites for the 1988 nomination. And few ever knew that Biden flirted with a campaign as far back as 1984 (when he actually received one delegate's vote at the national convention). Biden was also mentioned as a potential candidate in more recent cycles, notably 2016. As Obama's vice president, Biden might well have been competitive with Hillary Clinton, the eventual nominee. He publicly considered a run in 2015, but stepped back after his son Beau died of cancer in May. He made his announcement in October, but several months later said he regretted not running \"every day.\" A rough start to 2020 What people do remember is that Biden began the current presidential cycle as the Democrats' putative front-runner, that he stumbled along the way and nearly washed out early. The Real Clear Politics average of polls showed him leading \u2014 but not dominating \u2014 the field throughout 2019. In a field that at one point teemed with more than 20 other hopefuls, Biden's polling rarely surpassed 30%. He struggled at times in the debates, caught in the crossfire from rivals \u2014 including the one who is now his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. In the very first debate last year, her jab at Biden's stand on school busing in the 1970s (\"That little girl was me\") gave her fledgling campaign a bump. It also left a bitter taste with some of Biden's closest advisers that would hinder, but not prevent, her joining the ticket. As the debates ground on and impeachment proceedings in Washington diverted media attention, Biden struggled to break away from the field. When his main challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, had a heart attack in October, some Sanders backers gravitated to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other candidates, not Biden. By the end of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, Biden found himself an also-ran, just as in 2008. It was upstart candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who shared the winner's circle with Sanders. Biden finished fourth. Sanders and Buttigieg again virtually tied in New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11. Biden came in fifth, the choice of only one out of every 12 voters. As Sanders and Buttigieg dueled for delegates, it was Sanders who got the biggest boost in the polls. His rise coincided with his big win in the Feb. 22 Nevada caucuses, where the avowed democratic socialist showed strong appeal among Hispanic voters and got nearly half the votes overall. Media reports were routinely referring to him as the front-runner. But Biden stayed alive in Nevada, finishing second with 20%. It was enough to carry him to South Carolina and redemption.

An endorsement from Rep. James Clyburn (right) proved pivotal. South Carolina's first-in-the-South primary matters in the Democratic contest because it is the first event where African American voters \u2014 with whom Biden had residual appeal as Obama's vice president \u2014 carry outsize influence. As attention turned to the Palmetto State, its senior officeholder, James Clyburn, the highest ranking Black member of Congress as the House majority whip, announced his endorsement of Biden. Clyburn's backing all but guaranteed Biden would carry the Black vote. But it did more than that \u2014 it created the first real groundswell of energy for his campaign in months. That weekend, Biden won the Black vote overwhelmingly, especially among women, fueling a blowout that saw his vote share and Sanders' reversed from the Nevada tally. In the biggest event of the year to date, Biden got nearly half the vote and Sanders a fifth. No other candidate got enough to earn a delegate. With Super Tuesday looming, both Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar dropped out and endorsed Biden. They said he was the candidate most likely to beat President Trump, which was the criterion most often cited as crucial by Democratic voters. Warren remained in the hunt, but barely, giving Biden the one-on-one match with Sanders he had been wanting. After Nevada, Sanders had been poised to win most of the 14 states voting in the March 3rd Super Tuesday contests. But South Carolina shifted the momentum. Sanders won in California, Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Biden swept the rest, including Texas and five other Southern states where he won at least 55% of votes among African Americans. The shift in momentum dimmed Sanders' hopes for recovery in states where he had done well in 2016 \u2014 such as Missouri, Michigan and Washington. After Wisconsin joined that list on April 7, Sanders dropped out. Within a week, he endorsed Biden. In the four months since, as other states have held their nominating events, Biden has continued to reap the delegate harvest essentially unopposed. While the coronavirus has limited his \"campaigning\" to remote events and interviews from his home in Wilmington, Del., Biden his gradually risen in the polls and built a lead over the incumbent president that stood at 11 points in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Friday. That trend has continued despite Biden's relative inactivity, driven less by the Democrat than by Trump's controversies, especially his handling of the virus, the economic fallout and the widespread racial unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

February was not the first time Biden's presidential prospects seemed lost. Twice before he had been regarded as a promising contestant who faltered not far from the starting gate. In 1987, Biden was among several Democrats visiting Iowa and New Hampshire as the clock wound down on President Ronald Reagan's second term. Biden was then 45 and in his third term in the Senate, having first been elected in 1972 when not yet 30 years old on Election Day. He was known for his extroverted personality and aggressive speaking style, and he traveled to Democratic dinners around the country giving a carefully crafted speech reminiscent of John and Bobby Kennedy. In the spring of that year, Biden was competitive in polls of the Democratic hopefuls, along with Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts (the eventual nominee). Biden was regarded as a threat by the cycle's early front-runner, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado. But Hart's campaign collapsed in May after The Miami Herald reported he had entertained a young woman at his Washington townhouse while his wife was in Colorado. Hart's fall seemed to benefit Biden, but soon thereafter reporters received copies of a videotape of Biden giving a speech that borrowed from one given by a British politician. This revived accounts of an accusation of plagiarism while Biden was in law school. At an event in New Hampshire, Biden angrily denounced a man who questioned him. It happened long before the internet and social media, but the footage was widely shared on news programs. Biden suspended his campaign. The following year he suffered a pair of life-threatening brain aneurysms that led to two surgeries and kept him from the Senate for weeks. Having left the campaign trail, Biden focused on the Judiciary Committee, where he oversaw the highly contentious confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees Robert Bork (rejected in 1987) and Clarence Thomas (confirmed in 1991). Like most of his ambitious colleagues in the Senate, Biden saw no chance of beating President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and did not enter the primaries that year. In 2000, the Democratic nomination was all but conceded to Gore, who by then was serving as vice president. In 2004, several prominent Democrats sought the nomination against President George W. Bush, but not Biden. Late in Bush's second term, however, Biden joined the squad of senators \u2014 including Obama and Hillary Clinton \u2014 in a series of debates that began early in 2007. Biden did well in these meetings, but also occasionally displayed his proclivity for gaffes. On one occasion he referred to Obama as the first presidential candidate who was a \"mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\" Not long after that remark, Biden flopped in the Iowa caucuses that kicked off the voting in January 2008. What has changed? If the Obama-Biden ticket saw itself as groundbreaking, the Biden-Harris campaign will cast itself more as a rescue mission from the Trump era.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption If the Obama-Biden ticket saw itself as groundbreaking, the Biden-Harris campaign will cast itself more as a rescue mission from the Trump era. How did Biden come back over time to bestride the party with such stature at this moment? Has Biden changed or have the Democrats changed, or is this a different country today? In varying degrees, all three have changed. Often seen as garrulous and talkative in his Senate years, Biden has been more subdued in public during the current cycle. He has also seemed sobered by the pandemic and by the portents he sees in the governing mode of President Trump. That matured persona has played well in the current climate, at least among Democrats, large majorities of whom view the COVID-19 crisis as a major concern and share a sense of anxiety and dread about Trump. The Democratic Party today is younger and less Caucasian than it was when Biden first contemplated a run for president. Biden will be the oldest nominee either party has ever had, and would be the oldest occupant of the White House ever on the day he took the oath. But the younger voters who preferred Sanders did not turn out in significant numbers during the primaries, a fact Sanders himself acknowledged. And while Biden would seem miscast as the champion of people of color, he wound up benefiting most from their votes, which never coalesced around Harris, or Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey or Julian Castro of Texas \u2014 all of whom dropped out before Iowa. This is also a more progressive Democratic Party, as shown by the success of Sanders' two campaigns and the popularity of Warren's stands in 2020. Ideologically, Biden has been generally moderate to center-left, and while he has moved toward Sanders and Warren on health care and other issues since becoming the presumptive nominee, big differences remain. In the end, Biden had just enough connection, whether through his often-mentioned association with Obama or his ties to officeholders and other party influencers, to overcome his deficits. And as the nation's oldest political party gathers in virtual space for its 2020 convention, it is less a celebration of Biden, or Biden-Harris, than it is a concentration of opposition to the incumbent president. If the Obama-Biden ticket saw itself as groundbreaking, the Biden-Harris campaign will cast itself more as a rescue mission.",

Kamala Harris will take the helm of their party at the virtual convention, with a challenge to offer voters a vision of the future. In a recent campaign ad, Joe Biden is behind the wheel of a 1967 Corvette Stingray, in his trademark aviator sunglasses. \"I love this car, nothing but incredible memories. Every time I get in, I think of my dad and Beau,\" Biden says, referring to his late son. \"God, could my dad drive a car.\" It's pure nostalgia. But then Biden pivots to his pitch to restore American manufacturing. \"They're making an electric Corvette and it can go 200 miles an hour,\" Biden says. \"You think I'm kidding \u2014 I'm not kidding. So, I'm excited about it.\" It lines up with the vision for the future being laid out by the 77-year-old Biden, the ultimate retro politician, a middle of the road Democrat who talks about the good old days, now embracing some of the most progressive ideas of his party. How Biden, his running mate California Sen. Kamala Harris and other Democrats lay out this vision in their virtual convention over the next week is important. Presidential elections are won by the candidate who presents the most compelling vision for the future, and the convention is an opportunity for Biden and Harris to convince voters not just that President Trump has failed today, but that Democrats will make Americans' lives safer and more prosperous tomorrow. Biden's vision is a combination of old and new, according to Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a campaign surrogate. \"Let's take the best of what our country is, that proud manufacturing tradition, that notion that you ought to have a fair shot no matter where you live,\" Warner said. \"Let's marry it with a vision for the future that says we can build the autos of the future that will also save our planet.\" Biden calls his vision \"Build Back Better,\" and it includes big investments in the public health system, green infrastructure and American manufacturing, paid for with higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. He says he'll be tougher on Wall Street \u2014 a change from the Obama-Biden administration, criticized for the lack of any prosecution of senior Wall Street bankers after the financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession. He also wants to expand Obamacare with a public option, as well as address systemic racism in policing, homeownership and federal contracting. Many of Biden's plans are longstanding Democratic Party goals, but they've been adapted to address racial inequities and climate change. \"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is 'hoax.' When I think about climate change, the word I think of is 'jobs,' \" Biden said last month. \"Good-paying union jobs that will put Americans to work making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, making it faster, cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across the country and around the world.\" The rap on Biden for most of the year was that he was the candidate of restoration, looking to return to the good old Obama days. Then the pandemic happened, George Floyd was killed, and the country was forced to confront systemic racism. All of a sudden, Biden, as the head of the party that believes in activist government, was given a new opportunity to recast his agenda with a forward-looking vision of what government should do. \"The thing about the American people is, we really don't like government as a concept. We do love government, however, when there's an emergency,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee who ran a program tasked with reinventing government in the Clinton White House. \"So, whenever there's an emergency, the first question is, where's the government? And the first criticism is the government didn't do enough or the government screwed this up.\" That is the core of Biden's argument: Donald Trump thinks government is a swamp, while Joe Biden thinks government can be a solution to America's ills. \"The pandemic and our response to it, as well as the Floyd events, have really shown us just how ruptured our social contract is. We don't actually think of ourselves as all in it together,\" said professor Danielle Allen, a political theorist and director of Harvard's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. Allen was skeptical at first that Biden could have a vision for the future, but no more: \"I do think the Biden campaign has laid out a vision that is about pulling us all together and that does focus on the key elements that we need in order to restore a healthy, strong social contract. Where we're pursuing simultaneously the objectives of saving lives, securing livelihoods, protecting liberties.\" But others are not convinced yet that Biden's vision of the future is compelling enough to get the voters he needs to turn out in large numbers this fall. \"It's not everything that we would want, but we think he has the potential,\" said the Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. He's trying to motivate millions of low-income people to vote, and he says that will depend a lot on how Biden explains his vision for the future at the convention. Barber has advice for how Biden should do that: \"Push the issues that would cause people to see, if I vote, I will get a living wage. If I vote, there will be health care for me and my children. If I vote, the candidates will deal with the issues of ecological devastation. If I vote, somebody would deal with this racist voter suppression that's not only hurting Black people, but it also ends up suppressing the votes of Latino and poor white people, as well.\"",

            "article_content": "Democrat Joe Biden has expanded his lead to double-digits over President Trump, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Biden now leads Trump 53% to 42%, the poll says.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: If you were to take a picture of the race for the White House between Joe Biden and Donald Trump today, you would see Biden running ahead of the incumbent president. Biden's outpacing Trump by double digits according to the latest snapshot taken by the NPR/PBS/Marist poll. NPR's Domenico Montanaro joins us now to talk about what else is in that frame. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Sarah. MCCAMMON: So a double-digit lead for Biden sounds like a lot. Let's dig into those numbers a bit more, though. Where's that support coming from? MONTANARO: Well, Biden's got an 11-point lead - 53 to 42 over Trump. That's up from eight points at the end of June. Biden is getting 52% with independents, a 16-point advantage over Trump. And they're tied at 48 with white voters, which is stunning. Trump won them by 20 points in 2016. Just to underscore this, no Democrat has gotten that high with white voters in a presidential election since Carter in '76. And there are far more people of color in the country now, and Biden is winning them by a lot. Democrats, look; usually need around 40% with white voters to win in a presidential election. In 2012, President Obama got 39% with white voters and was the first Democrat to win the presidency with less than 40%. So being at 48 is huge for Biden. MCCAMMON: And the pandemic surely is influencing how voters think about the choice between these two men. What does the poll say about that? MONTANARO: Yeah. Voters don't see the president as particularly handling the coronavirus well. In fact, they say they prefer Biden on handling the pandemic by 16 points. And just 31% say they trust the information they're getting from the president. That puts Trump in a difficult position right now. That's part of why he's promoting progress on a vaccine. Here he was today at the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're very close to having something that's going to be very, very special in the form of therapeutics and vaccines. MONTANARO: You know, experts say they don't expect a vaccine to be ready before the election. But Trump needs people to think that that's possible to help his standing. MCCAMMON: And, Domenico, the other big issue, of course, this year has been race relations. How is the country viewing the protests around racial justice, and which of the candidates is seen as more trusted to handle that? MONTANARO: Again, Biden has a big advantage here - 23-point edge over Trump on this question with voters. As for the protests themselves, there is some evidence that Trump's disparaging of the protest - stressing looting and the potential for crime if police are defunded - is having some effect. But mostly it's with his base. Overall, 57% of voters view the Black Lives Matter movement favorably. Fifty-four percent have a favorable impression of the protests. Now, favorable views of the protests are down 8 points from early June, but most of that is coming from Republicans and people who live in rural areas. Trump's suburban messaging, though, just doesn't appear to be sticking. Sixty-five percent of suburban voters view the protests favorably, which is actually up two points since June. MCCAMMON: And, Domenico, this all looks pretty gloomy for President Trump. I know it's a snapshot in time, but is there a path forward for him to win reelection? MONTANARO: You know, a few things have to happen. His numbers have to improve in the suburbs or with white voters. Maybe some of those right-leaning independents go home to him because they see him as doing marginally better on handling coronavirus, or his campaign does such a good job of muddying up Biden that he becomes unacceptable to the middle. Or, you know, he gets white voters without a college degree to turn out at a higher percentage than they did in 2016. That's possible. They turned out at a rate of 58% in 2016, so there's room to grow. MCCAMMON: All right. That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Democrat Joe Biden's lead has expanded to double-digits against President Trump in the presidential election, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Biden now leads Trump 53% to 42%, up from an 8-point advantage at the end of June. The change comes as 71% of Americans now see the coronavirus as a real threat, up significantly over the last several months, as more than 167,000 Americans have died and more than 5 million have become infected with the virus, as of Friday. And yet, more than a third of Americans (35%) say they won't get vaccinated when a vaccine comes available; 60% say they will. There are huge splits by education and party on this. Those with college degrees are 19 points more likely to get vaccinated than those without (72% to 53%), and Democrats are 23 points more likely than Republicans (71% to 48%). Loading... (Just 52% had said they would get vaccinated for H1N1 in 2009 in the survey, but H1N1 was far less deadly and did not have the same far-reaching impact on the American economy and society.) Dr. Anthony Fauci,  head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he is concerned about the unwarranted vaccine skepticism in some of the country and how that could slow overcoming the virus. \"We have to admit and realize that there is an anti-vax movement that we have had to struggle with in this country,\" Fauci told the PBS NewsHour last month. \"And I believe the solution to that would be community engagement ... because it could be lifesaving, and it certainly would be the solution to this terrible pandemic.\" The poll shows that experts like Fauci have some leverage in making the case to the public. Three-quarters of Americans (75%) say they trust the information they hear from public health experts a great deal or a good amount. State and local officials also fare well, with 62% of Americans saying they trust what they hear from those officials. President Trump, whose approval rating has dipped to 39% in this survey, is seen as an unreliable source of information on the pandemic. Just 31% say they can trust the information coming from the president. Less than half \u2014 46% \u2014 say they trust what they hear from news media on it. On the issues, Trump trails Biden substantially on who is seen as better to handle coronavirus or race relations. Biden has a 53% to 37% lead on handling coronavirus and an even wider 58% to 34% advantage on handling race relations. Trump retains a narrow, 47% to 45% edge on the economy, but that has narrowed since March when Trump had a clear 50% to 42% lead on the question in an ABC/Washington Post poll. All of that helps explain Biden's expanded lead and where the vote is coming from. Biden has now reached a majority (52%) with independents and leads Trump with this crucial group by 16 percentage points. Biden's advantages Biden also has significant advantages with Black voters, young voters, whites with a college degree and suburban voters. Trump draws his strongest support from white evangelical Christians, whites without a college degree and those who live in rural areas. Trump has seen his advantages with other key groups decline, including with whites overall, men and voters in small towns. What's particularly striking is Trump and Biden are now tied with whites at 48%. Trump had a 6-point advantage with the group at the end of June. To underscore the significance of this, Trump won white voters by 20 points in 2016, and no Democrat has gotten more than 44% of the white vote (incumbent President Bill Clinton in 1996) in a presidential election since 1976. That year, Carter got 48% of the white vote and won in an electoral landslide, but only by 2 percentage points in the popular vote. Back then, whites made up almost 9 in 10 voters. In 2016, whites were down to 70% as a share of the electorate, and demographics point to a continuing downward trend. Neither Trump nor Biden is viewed very favorably, but Trump's score is far worse than Biden's. Just 35% said they have a favorable view of Trump, even less than approve of the job he's doing; 60% have an unfavorable view. For Biden, 42% had a positive impression, 49% had a negative one. Notably, Biden leads by 19 points voters who say they dislike both candidates. That's important because in 2016, Trump won voters who said they disliked both Trump and his Democrat Hillary Clinton by 17 points, according to exit polls. Even though Clinton led for most of 2016 in surveys, the election broke late in Trump's direction because of voters who said they were undecided and said they disliked both candidates. This poll finds that just 12% are persuadable \u2014 either undecided or could change their vote. The one positive sign for Trump continues to be the strong backing of his supporters. His voters are more enthusiastically behind him than Biden \u2014 76% of them say they strongly support the president versus 64% of Biden's. A similar three-quarters of Trump supporters say they are casting their ballots in favor of Trump; only 22% said they are voting against Biden. Half of Biden's voters instead say they are casting their ballot against Trump. The Trump campaign has highlighted similar findings in other surveys, but reelections are about the incumbent president, and the voters who oppose Trump are highly motivated to cast their ballots. One of the goals of the Democratic National Convention, which begins next week, might be try to drum up more enthusiasm for the ticket, now consisting of Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris, whom Biden picked to be his running mate this week after this poll was taken. \"The pick of Harris and the Democratic convention could change that,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. \"Certainly, one of the goals of the Democratic convention should be to close this enthusiasm gap for the ticket.\" Mailing it in Half of Americans (50%) now say they will cast their votes in person, up from 38% in May. Forty-three percent say they will mail in their ballots, down from 50% in May. And there is a big partisan split. Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%. Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls \u2014 72% to 24%. Coronavirus \u2014 what to do and not do American families are hotly debating the right and wrong things to do during the tenuous reopenings during the pandemic. Well, here are some numbers to settle those arguments. Most Americans think it's largely a good idea to eat outside at restaurants (80%) and have people physically return to work (58%), though to a lesser degree. They do not, however, think it's a good idea to: allow large groups of people to attend religious, social or sporting events (just 27% in favor), allow children to take part in local or school sports (35%), have students return to school (40%) or open restaurants for people to eat inside (43%). Loading... The survey of 1,261 U.S. adults, including 1,118 registered voters, was conducted by calling mobile phones and landlines, from Aug. 3 through Aug. 11 by The Marist Poll, in both English and Spanish. The poll has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points when adults are referenced and 3.6 percentage points for registered voters. The survey was sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour.",

President Trump has been arguing that he has been the best president for Black Americans outside of Abraham Lincoln, but with less than 100 days before the election, it's not clear that his campaign to reach African Americans is changing many minds. Trump won just 8% of the Black vote in 2016. Current polls show the vast majority of Black voters backing Trump's Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. But, in swing states like Wisconsin and North Carolina, where the presidential race could be tight, squeezing out a few more Black votes could make a difference for Trump. Trump started out the year with a State of the Union address that highlighted issues aimed at appealing to African Americans: rising Black employment opportunities, funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and tax breaks for investments in poor communities. His campaign also announced plans to open more than a dozen field offices in critical cities with large African American communities, like Milwaukee and Detroit. But shortly after they began holding \"Black Voices for Trump\" events, the coronavirus pandemic shut down in-person campaigning for months. And during that time, the election landscape shifted. The economic shock caused by the response to the pandemic wiped out one of the campaign's key talking points \u2014 low Black unemployment. And polls showed that most Americans of all races blamed Trump for increasing racial tensions after massive protests broke out about the killing of a Black man, George Floyd, in police custody. Now, where local regulations allow, the campaign is back in the field attempting to make the case for reelecting Trump. \"We're in the communities, because we knew we could not depend on the mainstream press to tell Americans exactly what this president is doing and has done for them,\" said senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson. \"So we're on the ground making sure that they stay informed.\" In a state like Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 1%, Democrats and Republicans are fighting for every vote. The Milwaukee field office is the first ever for Republicans in the city. Back in late February \u2014 before the pandemic hit \u2014  the campaign held a panel discussion in the storefront office with speakers brought in from across the country to talk to about 50 people in attendance about the importance of Black Republicans. According to Pierson, that office now has about eight people on staff. In recent weeks, the Milwaukee office has hosted a cookout and a movie night, screening a documentary about Black conservatives. These events \"allowed for us to connect with people in a smaller setting,\" said Paris Dennard, a senior adviser on Black media for the Republican National Committee. \"That's when we can have more personal dialogue. That's when we can answer questions easier, and that's when we can really form relationships,\" Dennard said. But gaining support for any Republican in these Democratic strongholds is not going to be easy, and polls have shown that a majority of Black voters believe Trump is racist. Orlando Owens is a Black Republican running for the Wisconsin state legislature representing part of Milwaukee. The seat has been held by Democrats for decades. Owens has been knocking on doors making the case for his own campaign, but he said that residents do bring up Trump and not necessarily in a good way. \"I see some that like President Trump. I see a lot more that question his moves,\" Owens said. He said he never bashes Trump. Instead he focuses on what he could do for his district by working with the Republican majority in the state capital. Some people have asked Owens whether they would have to vote for Trump if they vote for him. He said he tells them: \"You do whatever you think you need to do on the presidential level. But you don't have to vote for a straight party. You can vote for each individual race ... and people smile.\" Back in February, Quinn Taylor was one of the Milwaukee residents who attended the Trump campaign panel discussion. Taylor, who is African American, says he's still open to voting for Trump. But he wants him to be more thoughtful and presidential. \"I don't think he made one correct decision regarding the coronavirus,\" Taylor said. \"I think we really could've came out of this a whole lot better if he took it seriously.\" Taylor said he liked that Trump was talking more about social distancing and wearing masks, but he's not sure how long that will last. Even though Taylor attended a campaign event, he said he hasn't heard much from the campaign other than generic emails. He said he would like to see them do more to help the community. RNC adviser Dennard acknowledged that the campaign has more work to do to make sure its connections have lasting impact. \"That's something we are going to work on, making sure that people who have a genuine interest and want to hear more about the Republican Party give the president a first look,\" Dennard said. \"We want to make sure that we meet them.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump appeared to raise questions about whether Kamala Harris was eligible to be the vice presidential candidate following an op-ed that incorrectly raised doubts about her eligibility.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Tonight, President Trump declined to say whether he believes Sen. Kamala Harris is eligible to be vice president - this following an op-ed in Newsweek that incorrectly raised doubts about Harris' eligibility. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements. And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that's right. SHAPIRO: We should be very clear here that the president's speculation has no basis in fact. Joining us to talk about the president's remarks is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: This has echoes of the president raising the specter of birtherism - that Barack Obama was not eligible to be president. And it's hard to miss the fact that both of these people are nonwhite. What else did the president say about Kamala Harris today? LIASSON: Right. This is clearly birtherism 2.0. You heard him say that he doesn't know if it's true or not, but he certainly described the charge as credible. He praised the lawyer who wrote it. The lawyer for the Republican National Committee retweeted this charge, and he said to the person who asked the question - it was a reporter from VOA. He said, I don't know if this is right, but are you saying she was not born in the U.S.? And the reporter said, no, she was born in the United States. But the charge is that because her parents weren't citizens, somehow, she wasn't either - which, of course, is completely false. We have birthright citizenship in the United States. So he's casting doubts on whether Kamala Harris is a legitimate candidate for the office of vice president, just as he suggested falsely back before 2016 that Barack Obama was not a legitimate president because he was not born in the United States. SHAPIRO: The president has attacked Sen. Harris personally. He's called her mean. He's called her other names. Is this the first time he's talked about her eligibility? LIASSON: It's the first time certainly in the briefing room - asked a direct question like this that I can remember. But this is something that we've been watching for. How would the Trump campaign, how would Trump himself deal with Kamala Harris, the first Black, first Asian woman on a presidential ticket? Would they stick to ideology - just calling her a radical liberal, too far left - or would they try to demonize her as someone who was literally constitutionally illegitimate to run for that office? Would it become racial? And it sounds like it is. SHAPIRO: This seems to tie into a larger Trump/Pence campaign strategy of appealing to white fears about people of color. Put it in the context of the larger campaign for us. LIASSON: Right. Well, the big question is, every time the president makes a kind of racialized attack, does it do him more good than harm? In other words, for every white voter that it might rile up, every white, working-class Trump - potential Trump voter, does it also turn off one, two, three, four suburban women who the president needs but don't like this kind of attack? And that's the big question. Net, net, net - does this help him politically or not? It certainly is going to... SHAPIRO: Even motivate Democrats. LIASSON: ...Energize Democrats. SHAPIRO: Now, there was something else that came up at this briefing that's noteworthy. The president said he will not veto funding for the post office. Bring us up to speed there. LIASSON: Right. The president has said this morning that the Democrats want money for the post office so that they can run a voter - vote-by-mail program because, of course, because of COVID-19, many people want to vote by mail instead of going in person to vote at a polling place. He doesn't like voting by mail. He's against it. He says, without any evidence, that it leads to massive fraud, and he doesn't want to give the post office more money. So he said today - he was asked about that. Would you veto a bill that had money for the post office? - part of the stalled negotiations for another relief bill. He said, no, I won't veto it - which, of course, is not really germane because he's never - if he doesn't want a bill, one will never come to his desk. SHAPIRO: You're saying because Republicans who control the Senate are not going to... LIASSON: Right. Right. Right. Or - yes, that's exactly right. So he's never going to have to be faced with the question of veto or not veto. But he said again - and he was very adamant today - he is against voting by mail. He doesn't want the post office to have any extra money to do vote by mail. SHAPIRO: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you for the update, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you.

Harpaz/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Two years after opening an investigation into Yale University's use of race in admissions, the Justice Department is demanding that the school agree not to use race or national origin in its upcoming 2020-2021 admissions cycle. The Department of Justice accused Yale University of violating federal civil rights law by illegally discriminating against Asian American and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions process. Those are the findings of a two-year investigation conducted in response to a complaint by a coalition of Asian American groups. The Justice Department notified university officials in a letter on Thursday. \"The Department of Justice found Yale discriminates based on race and national origin in its undergraduate admissions process, and that race is the determinative factor in hundreds of admissions decisions each year,\" the department said in a release. It went on to say that \"for the great majority of applicants,\" Asian American and white prospective students have 1/10 to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials. In a statement provided to NPR, a Yale spokesperson said that the university \"categorically denies this allegation.\" \"At Yale, we look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants,\" the statement said. \"We take into consideration a multitude of factors, including their academic achievement, interests, demonstrated leadership, background, success in taking maximum advantage of their secondary school and community resources, and the likelihood that they will contribute to the Yale community and the world.\" The spokesperson also suggested that the Justice Department had not fully taken into account the information and data that university officials were providing. \"We are dismayed that the DOJ has made its determination before allowing Yale to provide all the information the Department has requested thus far,\" she said. \"Had the Department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that Yale's practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent.\" The Justice Department acknowledged that the Supreme Court has held that colleges receiving federal funds can consider applicants' race in certain circumstances, as one of many factors. But it described Yale's use of race as \"anything but limited.\" The Justice Department is alleging that Yale uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process, which multiplies the effect of race on an applicant's chances of getting in. It also said the school racially balances its classes. The department argued that such practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance. Yale \"expressly agrees\" to comply with that law as a condition of receiving millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, the department said. The Justice Department is demanding that Yale agree not to use race or national origin in its upcoming 2020-2021 admissions cycle. It also gives Yale an opportunity to propose a \"narrowly tailored\" plan for using race in future admissions cycles, pending Justice Department approval. Yale is not planning to modify its policies, according to its statement Thursday. \"We are proud of Yale's admissions practices, and we will not change them on the basis of such a meritless, hasty accusation,\" the university said. Art Coleman, an attorney and former deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights under the Clinton administration, raised questions about the strength of the Justice Department's case in an interview with NPR. \"The case here is thin at best,\" he said. \"Thin in terms of underlying evidence.\" He compared Thursday's four-page Justice Department findings to the more than 100 pages a judge issued in a similar case regarding Harvard University, and noted \"that difference says a lot.\" The Supreme Court has long upheld the use of race-based admissions in colleges, ruling on the subject as recently as 2016. Still, the Trump administration has repeatedly challenged the ability of higher education institutions to consider race in admissions decisions. Notably, in 2018, it withdrew Obama-era guidance that encouraged affirmative action in schools and universities. Mitchell Chang, an education professor at UCLA, said it is \"hard to imagine\" this latest move is not political, given its proximity to the general election in November. He also characterized it as at odds with the current social and political moment in which protesters across the country are calling for racial justice and equity. \"This move fails to respond to the calls being made nationally to consider race in a way that would help us address racism,\" Chang said. \"That's what affirmative action policies were meant to do. To increase access to elite higher education. This very much runs counter to that.\" Disclaimer: Rachel Treisman is a graduate of Yale University.",

Kamala Harris, at the Hotel DuPont in Wilmington, Del. Biden took off his mask to speak. Updated at 6:08 p.m. ET Joe Biden is calling for everyone in the United States to wear a mask, well into the fall. \"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum,\" Biden said Thursday afternoon in remarks in Wilmington, Del. \"Every governor should mandate mandatory mask-wearing. The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives.\" His comments came after a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic with his new running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and public health experts. More than 165,000 Americans have died because of COVID-19. Unlike President Trump, who took months to wear a mask publicly, Biden has long been consistently wearing a mask and encouraging others to do so. But he's never been so explicit about mandates and a timeline. In an interview with KDKA in Pittsburgh in June, the presumptive Democratic nominee said he would require masks if he were president. \"I would insist that everybody out in public be wearing that mask. Anyone to reopen would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks,\" he said. The former vice president said he would use the power of the executive branch to do everything possible to make mask-wearing in public a requirement \u2014 though mandates have come at the state level, and many governors have opted against such measures. In remarks at a June event in Wilmington, Biden also said there should be better guidance from the administration around mask-wearing. \"We absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public, period,\" he said. But his statement Thursday was the most direct comment he's given to date. \"It's not about your rights; it's about your responsibilities,\" Biden said. He tried to present the issue as a matter of patriotism to protect fellow Americans. In a news conference later Thursday, Trump took issue with Biden's nationwide call for mask-wearing, ignoring that the Democrat urged governors to issue mandates. \"[Biden] does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate,\" Trump said, \"or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country.\" Trump added: \"If the president has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have?\" An NBC News/Survey Monkey poll in late July found a majority of Americans said they wear a mask in public, but there are clear partisan, racial and age divides. Far more Democrats, nonwhites and older people said they wear masks every time they leave the house. Biden and Harris, his vice presidential pick, collectively spoke for about eight minutes Thursday, and walked away without taking questions from the press.",

            "article_content": "California Sen. Kamala Harris will become the next Vice President of the United States, shattering another racial and gender barrier in American politics, at the end of a bruising presidential race and a bitterly divided electorate. Harris claimed her place in history on Friday  after a bruising battle for the White House, at the conclusion of which President Trump falsely claimed victory with millions of votes outstanding, and his legal team pursued action amid the close race. It also closes an election season upended by the coronavirus pandemic, and a fierce national reckoning over race, justice and police brutality. Democrats were seeking a victory that would demonstrate a repudiation of President Donald Trump and the direction in which he is leading the country. That did not happen this year, in a race with razor-thin margins in some key states, and there was no Democratic wave. But in Harris's elevation to the vice presidency, the party and the country have marked a significant milestone in a caustic political environment. Harris, 56, will bring a legion of firsts to the vice presidency: the first woman, the first Black person, the first Indian American and the first Asian American to hold the office. She will also be the first graduate of a historically Black college and first member of a Black sorority to do so.Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, will also be the first biracial vice president. \"It sends a message about what kind of country we are today,\" said Manisha Sinha, a professor of American history at the University of Connecticut. \"An interracial democracy that represents people, men and women, from all over the globe. I think that's a very good thing for American democracy. And for me personally, it gives me a sense of national belonging that may not have been there before to some extent.\" It is a jubilant moment for many women across the country, but most notably for Black women activists who pushed Biden to name a Black woman as his running mate. Black women have been longtime party stalwarts, and were a key constituency that helped deliver Biden the Democratic nomination, though activists say the contributions of Black women have often been overlooked and taken for granted. \"Black women have always been the backbone of this Democratic Party, and oftentimes not valued for our ability to lead,\" said Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland, Calif., who was a co-chair of Harris's presidential bid. \"But I tell you now, Black women are showing that Black women lead, and we'll never go back to the days where candidates only knew our value in terms of helping them get elected. Now they will see how we govern from the White House.\" Lee said the moment made her think back to working on the campaign of Shirley Chisholm, the pioneering first Black woman to serve in Congress and first woman to seek the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. \"When Kamala was selected as the vice presidential nominee, I thought about Shirley Chisholm, and I thought about how it took all this time, but how happy she must be that the seeds she planted are now being sewn,\" Lee said. Glynda Carr, the president of Higher Heights, a group dedicated to building the political power of Black women, described the moment as \"game changing.\" \"Kamala Harris' win is going to change the way we think about what leadership looks like,\" she said. \"My goddaughters will know the possibilities that exist for their political leadership if they want to pursue that. I was most prideful to see my little goddaughter, who is in pre-K, standing at that TV, one inch away, looking at Sen. Kamala Harris.\" Harris is also a prominent face of a generation of children of immigrants who are a growing political force in their own right. More than a quarter of American adults today are immigrants or children of immigrants. \"Her background is something that we often celebrate about America, that we are this immigrant melting pot, we are a place where anybody can succeed who can come to America and find opportunity, and her family did that,\" said Chryl Laird, an assistant professor of government and legal studies at Bowdoin College. Biden's selection of Harris as his running mate earlier this year, and her ascension to the vice presidency, is a nod to the future of the Democratic Party. Her place on the ticket could well pave the way for Harris to become the leader of the party in four or eight years. The first time that Biden and Harris appeared together as the Democratic ticket, Biden nodded to the history that Harris had made \u2014 and the barriers that she could break in the future. \"This morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up \u2014 especially little Black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities. But today, today, just maybe, they're seeing themselves for the first time in a new way,\" Biden said at their first event as political partners. \"It is not without struggle\" Harris herself has discussed, cautiously at times, her own trailblazing status and has acknowledged that the experience of being a \"first\" or \"the only\" can often come with its own battle scars. \"When you break things, that can be painful. Sometimes you get cut. Sometimes you bleed,\" she has said, reflecting on her own experiences \u2014 and on those of those who came before her. \"It will be worth it every time, but it is not without struggle.\" In the closing days of the campaign, Harris was the subject of attacks from the president, who called her a \"monster\" and a \"communist,\" and argued that it would be an \"insult\" if she one day became the first female president.  Republican Sen. David Perdue appeared to intentionally mock Harris's first name at a campaign rally in Georgia. \"If you think of the kind of racist and misogynistic slurs that are hurled at Black women or sometimes even unconscious ideas about who black women are and how they should behave, or how they should talk, I think she's the best answer to that,\" said Sinha. \"In a way, I think it will lead to the country's healing a little bit after four years of blatant racism and sexism being literally espoused from the highest office in the land.\" Harris's ascension to the vice presidency, comes four years after Hillary Clinton's bruising 2016 loss. And it also comes after Harris's own much-lauded campaign for the White House fell short of the same goal. Harris's campaign began with a flag-draped rally in Oakland, Calif., and she was one of a historically diverse field of candidates, including multiple women and people of color, who vied for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. But Harris dropped out in November, before voting began, and in choosing Biden, her party again opted to elevate another white man. So Harris did not shatter the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling,\" that Clinton somberly talked about when conceding in both 2008 and 2016. But it is a singular feat that a Black woman who is a daughter of immigrants achieves this milestone first, in a country where some may have expected a white woman to break this barrier. Clinton wrestled with gender and her own history-making status, ultimately giving it a more prominent role in her 2016 campaign than in 2008. As Mirya Holman, a political science professor at Tulane University who studies women in politics, explained, while both campaigns were historic, Harris's ascent stands apart from the history of Clinton's campaign. \"Kamala, in comparison, got to kind of do whatever she wants. And part of that, I think, is that she's not at the top of the ticket. Part of that, though, is that she's a Black woman and she in that way gets to separate herself from the legacy of Hillary Clinton in ways that I don't think, say, Elizabeth Warren would have been able to,\" said Holman. \"And part of it has been a very strategic action on the part of the Biden campaign to really showcase Kamala as a unique, unusual individual and an exciting part of the campaign. Let's not even talk about history, let's just talk about how cool she is today.\" Her mother's legacy Multiple women pointed to the profound influence of Harris's mother, Shymala Gopalan, that led the Californian to this moment. Gopalan, who left India in the 1950s to pursue graduate studies at UC Berkeley, died of cancer in 2009. Her father, Donald Harris, is a professor of economics at Stanford University. The two divorced when Harris was a child, and it is her mother's impact on Harris \u2014 in life and through her death \u2014 that is indelible. \"She speaks about how her mother said to her and her sister, 'You are black girls,'\" said Laird, the Bowdoin College professor. \"So although she is multiracial, her mother who is Indian, is saying to her you are Black girls, the world will see you as Black girls and you need to understand that you are Black girls. And so that is how she lives her life, in an understanding that how she is seen, how she is viewed is as a Black girl.\" Congresswoman Lee, who has known Harris since the 1980s, recalls running into her at a political event after Lee's own mother died in 2015. Harris, Lee explained, connected with her over their shared experience of grief. \"It was just a moment that demonstrated how caring she was and how she could connect and understand the pain of women, the pain of loss and just what it meant, because she's been through that experience also,\" said Lee. \"I think that bodes well for someone who's a vice president of the United States to be able to connect with people the way she did with me.\"",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his newly named running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., made their first joint appearance in Delaware on Wednesday.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Democrats formally introduced their presidential ticket today in Delaware. That is where Joe Biden and his newly named running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, delivered remarks. Biden announced yesterday he was picking Harris to be the first woman of color on the ticket of a major political party. Here's what he had to say today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: And this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little Black and brown girls who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today - today just maybe they're seeing themselves for the first time in a new way as the stuff of president and vice presidents. KELLY: Let's bring in NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid to talk through all that was said and done at this event today. Hey there, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So let's start with Kamala Harris. This is the first time we have heard from her as the vice presidential candidate. How did she do? What stood out to you? KHALID: So I would say what really stood out to me was the forceful critique that she made against both President Trump individually and then the Trump administration. You know, she is a longtime prosecutor, and I would say that I think she was perhaps the most effective Democrat we have heard as of late prosecuting the case against how the Trump administration has handled the coronavirus pandemic. You know, I have heard Joe Biden criticize Trump quite a bit around COVID-19, many times actually in recent months, but I would say never as forcefully and as detailed and as sharp as what we heard from Harris today. She said the case against President Trump is really, in her view, open and shut. And she compared this pandemic with the Ebola outbreak during the Obama administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis. It was called Ebola, and we all remember that pandemic. But you know what happened then? Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died - two. That is what's called leadership. But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. KHALID: She also criticized how Trump has handled the economy. You know, she said that he had inherited the longest economic expansion in recent history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then in her words, quote, \"like everything else he inherited, he ran it into the ground.\" You know, I would say that one of the key components of a vice president is to do no harm, but it is also to prosecute the case against the other side. And I think today we got a glimpse of how Harris intends to do that. KELLY: Let me turn you, Asma, to how Harris is a historic selection, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. And as we heard in that clip a moment ago from Joe Biden, that was front and center at tonight's event. KHALID: That's right. I mean, this is really, I would say, a historic pick. I mean, there's really no way else to say this. And I think a lot of us as political journalists have described Kamala Harris at times as a very consensus choice. She was, in some ways, maybe the predictable choice that a lot of people had thought. But we should still I think not lose sense of the fact that really this is a historic moment. We've never had a woman of color at the top of the ticket. And Joe Biden gave a glimpse of what that all meant through, you know, the biographical description he gave of Kamala Harris. I think what was also interesting to me, though, is that Harris also connected this moment and what it all meant back to Joe Biden's background. You probably recall there was this really public skirmish that the two of them had on the debate stage when she was running for president about bussing and civil rights. And today, it was noteworthy to hear because she praised Joe Biden's record on civil rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRIS: Today he takes his place in the ongoing story of America's march toward equality and justice as only - as the only - as the only who has served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate. KHALID: I mean, that sort of I think really succinctly just sums up the historical nature of this all. You know, Biden certainly had faced a lot of pressure to choose a Black woman as his running mate, given some of the protests we've seen around the country calling for just better issues around policing and racial justice. I think today, to me, was an opportunity to hear both Biden and Harris speak to this issue of representation. KELLY: Now, what about Joe Biden at the top of the ticket? What were the headlines of what he had to say tonight? KHALID: So, Mary Louise, you know, I think a lot of us have heard that when Barack Obama asked Joe Biden to be his running mate that Biden asked him that he would always be the final voice in the room before a big decision. And today, he told us that he envisions a similar relationship with Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions. KHALID: I mean, so there you have it. There's kind of I think really an insight into how they might govern. You know, the other thing that Joe Biden mentioned was just a very quick criticism we saw from President Trump, the attacks on Kamala Harris as being, quote, \"nasty\" or whining. You know, we should note that the Trump campaign has said that in their view Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together make up the most extreme leftist ticket in American major party history. You know, this idea of radical socialism is something that Trump has tried to target Joe Biden with, and it hasn't stuck. And so we've now begun to see these attacks shift over to Kamala Harris. KELLY: Have we learned any more, Asma, since yesterday about how this ticket came together, why Biden ended up choosing Harris as his running mate? KHALID: You know, I did get some more insight. I will say I heard from folks within sort of close to this vetting process and whatnot that there were co-chairs of the VP selection committee who met with more than 20 candidates. And then that list was whittled down to 11. Amongst the overall pool of more than 20 candidates, they all had a uniform list of questions, including such stuff as, you know, what would your agenda be, what would your agenda that you want to focus on be? But one question I thought, Mary Louise, that was really interesting and perhaps, you know, kind of gives us a glimpse into the attacks they knew were likely to come, they were all asked, the women, what do you think President Trump's nickname for you would be, which I just thought was a very interesting question. You know, the women then amongst the 20 were whittled down to the 11. Joe Biden himself met with all 11 of them. And he really seemed to emphasize a sense that he was looking for a governing partner and that relationship was key for him. He has long talked about wanting to find somebody who was simpatico with him. And he has said that in Kamala Harris, he found that. KELLY: Do we know, by the way, what Kamala Harris said Trump's nickname for her would be? KHALID: We do not. I know. That is a question I was curious to know myself. KELLY: I have the feeling we may learn soon (laughter). OK. Just one question before we let you go, which is how this might work going forward. Worth noting - this event was an unusual rally. There was nobody there except reporters, masks, social distancing, no crowd. KHALID: No applause, no real hugs, no - you know, there was a sort of awkward photo - socially distanced photo shoot moment there at the end. You know, we don't have a clear sense of how they will continue to campaign together. I will say as we speak, though, they were holding a virtual fundraiser together. And so whether or not they can actually campaign in person, it'll be interesting to see how many events they're able to do together virtually. KELLY: All right. Thank you, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. KELLY: NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. The pick of a running mate from California is unusual, since candidates usually balance their ticket with someone from a swing state.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now, let's hear what her home state thinks of the elevation of Kamala Harris. She's Joe Biden's choice as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Harris identifies as Black. She is the child of a Jamaican immigrant father and a South Asian immigrant mother. Nobody of such a background has ever served on a major party national ticket before. But for Californians, that is just one layer of her story. Scott Shafer, who knows a lot about California politics, reports from member station KQED in San Francisco. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: Kamala Harris launched her short-lived campaign for president last year in her hometown of Oakland, Calif. While she dropped out of the race before a single vote was cast, leading Democrats in the state take pride in her being back in the national spotlight. AIMEE ALLISON: To have our hometown California senator is amazing. SHAFER: That's Aimee Allison of She the People, an Oakland-based organization that advocates for having more women of color in politics. Her group desperately wanted - insisted, really - that Biden add diversity to the ticket. And she thinks that's what Kamala Harris brings. ALLISON: She knows how to navigate complex racial politics. She did it in California. And that's the value. That's what she's going to do in places like Texas and Florida and Georgia. SHAFER: California is used to being the ATM of national politics, the place politicians of both parties come to raise money. And former California Senator Barbara Boxer, whose retirement prompted Harris' run for the Senate, says being a solid Democratic state has reduced California's presence on national tickets. BARBARA BOXER: And so people take us for granted. And most the time, a vice-presidential pick will come from a swing state. So this is unusual and exciting for us. SHAFER: For California Democrats who didn't support Harris' run for president, her selection by Biden is a disappointment, to put it mildly. Norman Solomon is a delegate for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who won the California primary in March. His group of progressive Democrats calls Harris a political weather vane shifting with the winds. NORMAN SOLOMON: For Joe Biden, he doesn't want the so-called big tent of the Democratic Party to be big enough to include, really, authentic progressive activists and progressive voters. And I think that's disturbing. SHAFER: When she ran for president, Harris presented herself as a progressive prosecutor, a so-called smart-on-crime attorney general of California who supported criminal justice reforms. But she was slow to support legalizing marijuana. And critics said she was timid on pressing for police reform and holding corporations accountable. Former Senator Boxer says Harris has evolved. But in any case, it doesn't really matter. BOXER: Right now, she's not running on her record. She's running, basically, to help Joe Biden get elected. And the record that's going to be in front of us is, really, his record, Joe's, and Trump's. SHAFER: State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who became AG after Harris was elected to the Senate, says she adds energy to the ticket. XAVIER BECERRA: You've got this dynamic duo now. The level of experience that the two of them bring, the type of dynamism that she adds, it's just all good. SHAFER: Becerra says having a Californian on the ticket will bring the state's progressive values to the highest level of government. BECERRA: All the innovation, all those ideas, all that energy - guess what. Now you'll have a Californian in the White House working with the president directly, so even more likely that as goes California will go the country. SHAFER: Of course, that notion strikes fear into the hearts of Republicans who see California as a high-tax nanny state. And Ron Nehring, former chair of the state Republican Party, says Harris' record as a prosecutor might go over well in San Francisco, but not in the Midwest. RON NEHRING: This looks like one of those prosecutors who doesn't take the role of prosecuting seriously and letting bad guys off the hook. SHAFER: Whether that line of attack works with voters focused on a pandemic and a staggering economy remains to be seen. For NPR News, I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris will make history as the first woman of color on a major party presidential ticket after a selection process in which Joe Biden faced pressure to choose a Black woman.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Joe Biden has chosen his running mate. It is California Sen. Kamala Harris. She will make history as the first woman of color on a major party presidential ticket. Her parents were immigrants from Jamaica and India. Biden's decision comes months after he said he would choose a woman and after intense pressure from many in his party to pick a Black woman. NPR's Juana Summers covers demographics and culture in the campaign. She's with us now. Hey, Juana. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Hey there. KELLY: Just how intense has this pressure been on Biden as this decision loomed? SUMMERS: It has gotten more intense by the week. There have been a series of attempts to put public pressure on this process with a number of open letters and op-eds from prominent activists, strategists and public figures who have made clear that they believe that Joe Biden should be picking one of several of the Black women that he was considering as his running mate up until this point. And I do think that's something that intensified as the political atmosphere in this country intensified after the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. And here's just one example of how intense this pressure was. Recently, the news broke that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a white woman, had met with Biden to discuss the possibility of joining him on the ticket. And we heard a lot of anger and frustration from those Black women strategists and activists who believe that it was a requirement that Biden select a Black woman as his running mate. We saw something similar a little while ago with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, another white woman who was seen as a potential running mate, and she ultimately ended up pulling herself out of consideration in this ongoing discussion about racial injustice and police brutality, some of which centered on her home state. And at the time, she said that she believed herself that Joe Biden should choose a woman of color instead. KELLY: You know, in the days leading up to this pick, there was a lot of commentary about the women under consideration, lots of coded words, people talking about people who might be more ambitious than another candidate, a lot of pitting of one Black potential candidate against another in the press. That drew a backlash. It was pretty strongly called out, which is not something we have seen so much in past campaigns. What is your read on that? SUMMERS: Yeah. I think people honestly were just really frustrated that we were having the same conversations about women and electability and ambition that we've been having for decades in a way that we do not talk about male candidates. I covered the 2016 campaign, and I know that when covering Hillary Clinton's campaign, a lot of times people would ignore these kinds of broadsides, not point to sexism, and that's really changed. We're in a completely different political environment. We have seen women expand their political power. The #MeToo movement has ushered in these new fights against sexism in business and media and politics, and I think the game has just changed. People are ready to call it out openly. KELLY: Juana, just step back and talk about the Democratic Party for a second because even before this summer's protests, Democrats were wrestling with how dependent they are on the votes of Black voters and Black women to win elections. They were accused of not doing enough for Black voters. How big a factor has that been in shaping the campaign so far? SUMMERS: It's been a huge factor, and it was particularly huge for Kamala Harris from day one of her campaign when she announced that she was running for president on Martin Luther King Day in 2019 and paid homage to Shirley Chisholm, the first Black candidate to seek a major party's nomination. And so I think that Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris is a reflection of the diversity of the Democratic coalition and specifically a reflection of the Black voters who have played a key role in his ability to secure the nomination. Without Black voters, Joe Biden would have been unlikely to secure this nomination. KELLY: All right. That is NPR's Juana Summers reporting. Thanks so much. SUMMERS: Thank you.

            "article_content": "President Trump tried to woo Black voters, but the pandemic has compounded an already difficult proposition. Still, in key cities such as Milwaukee, Trump's field offices are back to work.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: All right. This news about Kamala Harris being tapped as Joe Biden's running mate comes as President Trump has been trying to make the case that his presidency is a boon for Black Americans. That was always going to be a difficult case to make. Then the coronavirus put his campaign's outreach on hold. Now in critical cities, including Milwaukee, field offices are back up and running. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe reports on whether the message is connecting. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've done more for African Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, and that's true. I've passed... I did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. With the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has even been close. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Despite President Trump's bragging, Black voters still overwhelmingly back his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. And that's not surprising for a Republican president. Still, according to a CNN analysis, Trump is doing slightly better with African American voters than he did in polls ahead of the 2016 election. After a hiatus due to the coronavirus, the Trump campaign is back on the ground in Milwaukee and other key cities with large African American communities. In a tight election, squeezing out a few more votes for Trump could make a difference. Paris Dennard is a senior adviser on Black media for the Republican National Committee. PARIS DENNARD: Because of the restrictions and the things that we have to abide by, we've had to sort of change our engagement. RASCOE: Back in late February, just before the pandemic shut down the country, the campaign held a panel discussion in their storefront field office in North Milwaukee with speakers flown in from around the country. About 50 people attended. Dennard says where local health regulations allow, the party is once again holding in-person events. In recent weeks, the Milwaukee office has hosted a cookout and a movie night screening a documentary about Black conservatives. The campaign wants to combat what they view as unfair media coverage, says senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson. KATRINA PIERSON: We knew we could not depend on the mainstream press to tell Americans exactly what this president is doing and has done for them. RASCOE: But one of the campaign's key talking points, low Black unemployment, no longer exists thanks to the coronavirus. And polls show that most Americans of all races believe that Trump increased racial tensions after protests about the killing of George Floyd. Orlando Owens is a Black Republican running for the Wisconsin State Legislature, representing part of Milwaukee. The seat's been held by Democrats for decades. Owens says he's been knocking on doors making the case for his own campaign. But President Trump does come up and not necessarily in a good way. ORLANDO OWENS: I see some who like President Trump. I see a lot more that question his moves. RASCOE: He says he never bashes Trump, and he focuses on what he could do for his district. Some people do ask him, do they have to vote for Trump if they vote for him? OWENS: I say, listen; you do whatever you think you need to do on a presidential level. But you can - you don't have to vote straight party. You can vote for each individual race, and people smile. RASCOE: Back in February, Quinn Taylor was one of the Milwaukee residents who attended the Trump campaign panel discussion. Taylor, who is African American, says he's still open to voting for Trump, but he wants him to be more serious and presidential. QUINN TAYLOR: The typical Trump - speak too fast, not prepared for a question and just talk. So you know, you get - you don't always get the president answer; you get the Trump answer. RASCOE: Taylor says he also wants to see the field office do more to help the community. RNC adviser Dennard acknowledged that the campaign has more work to do to make sure its connections have lasting impact. Even though Taylor attended a campaign event, he says they haven't contacted him other than generic emails. And that movie night the office held, Taylor says he would have attended, but he never heard about it. Ayesha Rascoe, NPR News.

The selection will make Harris the third woman and first Black and first Asian American candidate to be nominated for vice president by a major political party. \"These aren't normal times,\" Biden said in an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon, referencing the coronavirus pandemic and calls for racial justice. \"I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person.\" Harris tweeted that she's \"honored\" to join the ticket, saying Biden can \"unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals.\" In his note, Biden also referred to Harris' friendship with his late son, Beau. Harris and Beau Biden were state attorneys general at the same time. \"[Beau] had enormous respect for her and her work,\" Joe Biden wrote Tuesday. \"I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one's opinion I valued more than Beau's and I'm proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\" The two are set to deliver remarks in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday, and together hold a virtual fundraiser. The pandemic prevents Biden and Harris from rolling out their ticket in the usual format: a boisterous introductory rally in a key swing state. Sen. Kamala Harris will become the first Black and first Asian American candidate to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Drago/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris will become the first Black and first Asian American candidate to be nominated for vice president by a major political party. The Harris pick creates a Democratic ticket that in many ways mirrors the one Biden ran on in 2008 with then-Sen. Barack Obama: An older white man and Washington lifer with deep foreign policy experience is paired with a younger, Black running mate with immigrant roots who has been in the Senate just four years yet still has managed to carve out a national profile. Only this time, Biden is occupying the top spot. Biden's age, and the fact that the 77-year-old has repeatedly referred to himself as a \"transitional\" candidate, will almost certainly place increased focus on the 55-year-old Harris as the likely future leader of the Democratic Party. \"That little girl was me\" The ticket is being formed despite a moment of tension between Biden and Harris during the Democratic primary. While Biden regularly criticized Obama's lack of experience when he was also running in the 2008 Democratic primary, Biden never attacked Obama in the high-profile, personal way that Harris did during a televised debate in 2019. Harris, whose own campaign saw Black voters in South Carolina as key to her chances of winning the primary, criticized Biden for previously opposing federal busing mandates. \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools,\" Harris said on the Miami stage. \"And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\" The attack briefly cost Biden support and surged Harris toward the top of the polls, but those numbers quickly reversed themselves, especially after Harris conceded that she and Biden held similar views on whether busing decisions should be made on the local or federal level. Harris ultimately endorsed Biden and campaigned for him after suspending her presidential campaign in late 2019.

Ahead of the running mate selection, several Biden allies and donors warned in the press that the debate attack was too personal, and too harsh, for Harris to serve as Biden's vice president. The critiques raised cries of sexism \u2014 particularly a Politico report saying former Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, a member of Biden's vice presidential selection committee, was surprised that Harris had no \"remorse\" for the attack. Many Democrats pointed out that Biden, George H.W. Bush, John Edwards and other men who became running mates of people they had opposed in a presidential primary rarely faced questions about whether they had any \"remorse\" for campaign critiques, or whether they were too \"ambitious\" for the No. 2 job. As the Harris criticisms ticked up in the weeks before the pick, Biden's campaign tried to diffuse them. \"Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win. Our campaign is full of ambitious women going all out for Joe Biden,\" Biden's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, tweeted in late July. Ahead of Harris' selection, a group called We Have Her Back \u2014 which includes former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and leaders from Planned Parenthood and the National Women's Law Center \u2014 sent a letter to various media outlets demanding fair coverage of the vice presidential candidate. \"Women have been subject to stereotypes and tropes about qualifications, leadership, looks, relationships and experience. Those stereotypes are often amplified and weaponized for Black and Brown women,\" the letter said, urging the media to resist popular coverage tropes such as \"likeability\" and \"electability\" for candidates who happen to be women \u2014 analysis they said is hardly ever applied to male candidates. Obama, Trump respond to the selection Obama offered his congratulations to Harris, saying in a statement Tuesday that Biden \"nailed this decision.\" \"She is more than prepared for the job,\" Obama said of Harris. \"She's spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. Her own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, there's a place for you here. It's a fundamentally American perspective, one that's led us out of the hardest times before. And it's a perspective we can all rally behind right now.\" Meanwhile, President Trump, in a press briefing Tuesday, said he was \"a little surprised\" by the pick, given Harris' attack on Biden in the Democratic debate. Trump also slammed what he called Harris' \"horrible\" questioning of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and her legislative record, saying she is \"known as being about the most liberal person in the Senate.\" A longtime prosecutor Harris was born in Oakland, Calif., and grew up in Berkeley. She's the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. She was a prosecutor in the Alameda County and San Francisco district attorney's offices before running for San Francisco district attorney in 2003. She went on to win election as California attorney general in 2010. In 2016, Harris became just the second Black woman in U.S. history to be elected to the U.S. Senate. She was assigned to the Intelligence Committee, which held several nationally televised hearings on Russia's efforts to interfere in the presidential election, and how Trump's campaign and the Department of Justice responded to those efforts. The longtime prosecutor also sat on the Judiciary Committee, which oversaw the confirmation of two U.S. Supreme Court justices: Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. The high-profile hearings that each committee held quickly helped Harris develop a national reputation as a sharp, aggressive questioner who could unnerve opposing witnesses. She generated headlines and energized progressives across the country with her questioning of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General William Barr and, most notably, Kavanaugh. In January 2019, Harris launched a bid for the White House. She was initially seen as a serious contender for the Democratic nomination, drawing more than 20,000 people to her kickoff rally in Oakland. But Harris struggled to articulate a clear reason for her candidacy in a crowded field, and her campaign experienced bouts of infighting. Since returning full time to the Senate, Harris has played a lead role in Senate Democrats' response to both the coronavirus crisis, and the increased focus on systemic racism and police brutality. Biden's pick came amid intense pressure from Democrats not only to pick a woman, which he promised to do in March, but also to pick a woman of color. That drumbeat began well before George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police but intensified amid sustained protests across the country. Harris will be the fourth woman on a major party's national ticket. All three women to run for president and vice president have lost: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in 2008 and Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. The only previous Black candidate on a presidential ticket, Obama, won the White House with Biden at his side in 2008.",

She still doesn't like many of Biden's policies, and she's not thrilled he's the presumptive Democratic nominee. But a summer of chaos has made her reassess her politics.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. history teacher Monique Sampson recently decided to vote for Joe Biden. She still doesn't like many of Biden's policies, and she's not thrilled he's the presumptive Democratic nominee. But a summer of chaos has made her reassess her politics. Before COVID-19 and before the death of George Floyd, Monique Sampson said she thought Joe Biden and President Trump were \"different wings on the same bird.\" The 23-year-old American history teacher with dangling earrings that proclaim, \"A woman's place is in the struggle,\" had been hoping for a Bernie Sanders presidency. She still doesn't like plenty of Biden's policies \u2014 and she's not thrilled he's the presumptive Democratic nominee. But a summer of chaos has made her reassess her own politics. \"For a very long time I wasn't going to vote for [Biden],\" Sampson said. \"And then COVID happened. And I was like, 'You know what, he sucks,' for lack of a better term. But he's not criminal. His actions aren't criminal in the sense that he wouldn't view 150,000 deaths as progress.\" Sampson's story is part of a larger shift underway in Florida's Duval County \u2014 one that mirrors many of the headwinds facing Trump in large swaths of the country. In a county that for more than four decades has been a reliable Republican vote, Democrats are sensing new optimism ahead of the November elections, thanks to intense anti-Trump energy among Black voters like Sampson, young voters and college-educated professionals in the suburbs. Duval County, a traditionally conservative area in Florida's northeast corner along the Atlantic Ocean, hasn't voted for a Democratic president since Jimmy Carter in 1976. But in recent presidential elections, it's begun tilting more toward the Democratic Party. In 2016, Trump won Duval County by 1.5 percentage points \u2014 one of his slimmest margins in the state. Pollsters, political scientists and party leaders all agree the county's changing landscape is largely due to demographics and grassroots organizing. Stronger turnout among the county's relatively large Black population combined with an influx of college-educated transplants has turned this once-reliable red county into a contested political battleground in a must-win state for Trump. New energy from activists In the late 1960s, Duval County and the city of Jacksonville merged into one entity, creating a large sprawling city that feels like an overgrown suburb. Trump has struggled in recent polling with suburban voters nationwide, and the same trend seems evident in Duval. Mitt Romney won the county by a bigger margin in 2012 than Trump did in 2016 (though Romney lost the state of Florida and Trump won it). Beyond demographics, activists point to the work that progressive groups like Indivisible and the New Florida Majority have been doing on the ground. Traditionally, after a midterm, the state party packs up and goes home, but after the 2018 elections, half a dozen Democratic staffers stayed on the ground to prepare for the presidential race. Activists like Sampson, a cofounder of the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, organized protests for racial justice this summer with voter registration tables. Sampson is frank when describing her hometown. \"It can be very backwards politically,\" she said, sitting on the steps of the county courthouse in downtown Jacksonville. \"If you drive down the street from here ... you have Hemming Park \u2014 that's named after a Confederate. You have Confederate Park, which is named after the Confederacy.\" But as critical as she is, Sampson admits her county feels like it's changing. Earlier this summer, she organized a protest for racial justice. She said 10,000 people showed up. She was floored. New residents, new politics The old assumption was that this corner of Florida was more culturally akin to South Georgia than the Democratic enclaves of Miami and Orlando. Multiple people said they couldn't have envisioned a time when Confederate statues would be taken down. Lisa King, 57, is the former chair of the Duval Democratic Party and was born and raised in Jacksonville.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lisa King, 57, is the former chair of the Duval Democratic Party and was born and raised in Jacksonville. \"When I was born here it was a town that was predominantly a military town and a manufacturing town,\" said Lisa King, 57, the former chair of the Duval County Democratic Party. \"We were always told here, at the local party, our job is to turn out Democrats and try to keep the margin of loss down to a minimum.\" But those margins began to tighten significantly around 2008, a change local Democrats say was helped by the attention the Obama campaign paid to the Jacksonville area. Nowadays, the area has developed from a small Navy town into a hub for the medical, financial and insurance industries. \"We have Mayo Clinic now,\" said King, referring to the renowned Minnesota medical center that has opened a campus in Jacksonville. \"Those companies bring their workforce from all over the country ... we have a lot of professionals that have moved here for work, and as we know Donald Trump does worse with college-educated people.\" Data from the Florida Chamber of Commerce finds the two states where most Duval transplants have arrived from in recent years are New York and Pennsylvania. The assumption is these outsiders are bringing their more liberal politics to the South. Voter registration data seems to somewhat align with this theory. Young voters and disenchanted Republicans But the shift is not tied solely to new college-educated voters moving into the area. The new chair of the Democratic Party elected last year is a 28-year-old Black man, the youngest leader in the local party's history. The average age in Duval is younger than many other Florida counties, and young voters tend to be more liberal. Jack Rowan is a recent high school graduate who registered as a Republican because of fiscal policy.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jack Rowan is a recent high school graduate who registered as a Republican because of fiscal policy. At the same time, there are some Republicans who have grown disenchanted with the president. While this frustration will not necessarily translate into votes for Biden, it has become one factor in Duval's changing landscape. \"I don't like the the brand of Republicanism that he's brought about,\" said Jack Rowan, a recent high school graduate who registered as a Republican because of fiscal policy. \"I think it's a brand built on division, more than a brand built on unifying people.\" Rowan has decided he won't be voting for Trump; the president's response to the Black Lives Matter protests deeply bothered him. But he's also not yet sure if he'll vote for Biden. A number of locals said the Republican Party under Trump has morphed into a very different type of Republicanism from the traditional politics that once attracted moderate Chamber of Commerce types in Jacksonville. \"I'm a Republican voter,\" said John Delaney, who served as Jacksonville's mayor from 1995 to 2003. \"But I think the country would be healthier and better off with somebody new there.\" Delaney said even though he appreciates some of the judicial appointments and economic decisions the president has made in office, he cannot convince himself to support Trump in November. John Delaney is a former mayor of Jacksonville and a Republican. He doesn't agree with Trump's style and said he won't be voting for him.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Delaney is a former mayor of Jacksonville and a Republican. He doesn't agree with Trump's style and said he won't be voting for him. \"It's the style, the recklessness, the bombast, the attacking, the critiquing,\" he said that has turned him off from the president, more than any one specific policy. Delaney said he tends to be more liberal on immigration than where the current Republican administration stands, but won't be voting for Biden this November either. He may write in another Republican instead. \"You know, I tend to think of suburbs as Episcopalian, and they expect a certain dress when you go to church,\" he said in explaining why he thinks the president seems to be struggling in Duval. \"The single most important county\" In Duval County, there are more registered Democrats than Republicans, but the GOP still usually wins elections. Jacksonville has a Republican mayor. The GOP has a majority on the city council as well. But in 2018, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, won Duval County \u2014 a first since the 1980s. Republicans and Democrats agree this November will be tight. \"Arguably the single most important county in the single most important state in the most important election in a century is Duval County,\" said Dean Black, the GOP county chair. Black is convinced that more than demographic change, Democrats started doing better in the area because Republicans became complacent over the years with little competition. \"The party did not do its job,\" he said. Dean Black is the Duval County GOP chair. He thinks Democrats started doing better in the area because Republicans became complacent over the years with little competition.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dean Black is the Duval County GOP chair. He thinks Democrats started doing better in the area because Republicans became complacent over the years with little competition. One side effect of the now-cancelled plans to bring the Republican National Convention to the area, he said, was that the local party was able to build up a 5,000 person volunteer list. But Black admits an outright victory in the county this November will be challenging. \"If Democrats could win Duval I think it would be very important, a symbolic victory,\" said Matt Corrigan, a political science professor at Jacksonville University who has written a book about the 2016 presidential election in Florida. Finding the votes Corrigan said what happens in Duval is only part of the story. All of the surrounding counties are far more conservative. And Democrats, he said, will undoubtedly lose a lot of votes in those communities. \"The challenge of Florida is you just can't pick out a couple of counties now and say, 'OK, I win this county, and then I'm going to win the state.' That's just not true,\" said Corrigan. Republicans, he said, are experts at at finding votes in rural, exurban towns across Florida. \"As they get their polling and other data, if they see, well, Republicans are down 20,000 votes in the state, they go look for those 20,000 votes,\" he said. Republicans host a voter registration drive in Ponte Vedra, a coastal, conservative community outside of Jacksonville.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republicans host a voter registration drive in Ponte Vedra, a coastal, conservative community outside of Jacksonville. On a recent weekend, Republicans with no masks on were selling Trump face masks and T-shirts outside a grocery store in Ponte Vedra, a wealthy, overwhelmingly white community on the ocean just southeast of Jacksonville in neighboring St. Johns County. St. Johns is one of the most college-educated counties in the state. The president's enduring popularity here runs counter to trends in other well-educated suburban enclaves and it's a sign of hope for the GOP. Many people \u2014 some fleeing Duval \u2014 have been moving here in recent years for better schools and cheaper housing. \"The secret started getting out about the great schools,\" said Brandon Patty, the GOP chair in St. Johns County. \"It's safe, the sheriff's office is real good. Next thing you know, St. Johns develops into a conservative heavyweight ... it's a red county.\" When the president speaks about law and order, it's a message meant for a place like St. Johns. In 2016, over 60% of voters here chose Trump. And most Republicans think he deserves reelection. \"From a policy perspective, economically he's done very well with the deregulation, with the tax cut,\" said Patty. Ultimately, some Republicans say the demographics and the momentum nationwide will make it difficult to win Duval County. And so for Trump to keep Florida red, they'll need to focus on a broader game plan. Black, the Duval County GOP chair, said he's fundamentally focused on a \"North Florida\" strategy. \"The bottom line is we need North Florida to turn out the Republican vote totals to overwhelm South Florida,\" Black said. \"The truth is, a vote for President Trump in Duval County will count the same as one from St. Johns County or Nassau County or Leon County, right? It doesn't really matter where the votes come from.\"",

            "article_content": "Senate primaries took place in Kansas, Michigan and Missouri on Tuesday. NPR discusses the major election news and what the results might signal about what's to come in November.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It is still primary season. And in yesterday's contests, progressive Democrats scored two high-profile victories while a conservative aligned with President Trump lost to a more mainstream Republican in Kansas. NPR's Susan Davis is here to sort through results and tell us what this might signal about November. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the Republican contest, where former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach lost the GOP Senate primary to Congressman Roger Marshall. Today you wrote that this is a win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. How so? DAVIS: Well, Marshall was McConnell's preferred candidate. The Senate Leadership Fund, which is an outside super PAC aligned with the leader, spent over $2 million to help Marshall win. McConnell, like many Republicans, believed that if Kobach had won, he would have tanked the party's chances of holding onto that seat in November and very likely could have taken the majority down with it. A word of caution here, though - Marshall is still not a sure bet. There's still interesting things happening in Kansas, and that race looks like it could still be competitive. And I've talked to GOP strategists who say it's going to - you know, they're going to have to keep investing in Kansas to keep it in their column. But ultimately, this is a seat that will be harder for Democrats to win. And the battle for the Senate carries on. SHAPIRO: And then let's shift to what happened in the Democratic Party yesterday, which was just remarkable. In the primary in the St. Louis area in Missouri, incumbent Congressman William Lacy Clay lost to progressive Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush, who ran to his left. Incumbents so rarely lose primaries. How did she pull it off? DAVIS: Well, this was, first, a rematch. She ran and lost against Clay in 2018 by 20 points. It wasn't even close two years ago, especially in a year that was really friendly to Democratic women candidates. She ran again - big comeback - beat him on Tuesday by three points. It is part of a trend that we've seen playing out this year in House Democratic primaries, where progressives, especially Black progressives, are getting much more traction among Democratic voters than they had in the past. We saw that happen in New York where three young Black male progressive candidates won in contested primaries - and yet another example of where an incumbent was defeated with Eliot Engel. SHAPIRO: In this specific case, Clay was not only an incumbent. His family was a Black political dynasty in Missouri. His father represented the seat before he did for three decades. DAVIS: Yeah. The Clay family is second only to the Dingell family in terms of long legacies in Congress. And beating an incumbent is probably the hardest thing you can do in politics. But this year, Clay is the seventh incumbent to lose. There have been four Republicans and now three Democrats. And that doesn't sound like a big number - seven - when you think there's 435 members of Congress, but it's a ton. Bloomberg analyst Greg Giroux calculated that it's the most incumbents to lose in a non-redistricting year since 1974. SHAPIRO: Wow. DAVIS: I've talked to Democrats a lot about this this cycle, and they point to a couple factors. They say the pandemic is just really challenging the way voters think of government and how they want it in their lives. And of course, the racial justice protests that have come from the - following the death of George Floyd have really had a political impact here. Bush in this case - she's a Black woman. She's a well-known local activist. She started in activism during the Ferguson protests back in 2014. And this was just her right moment. She was the right candidate at the right time in the right district. SHAPIRO: So when you pull back and look at these primary upsets, does it suggest that the Democratic Party as a whole is shifting to the left? DAVIS: You know, it's complicated because Democrats have the majority because they were able to win in swing seats with moderate districts. That's where the party needs to win to have a majority. But these progressive candidates are winning in very safe Democratic seats. They aren't in contention in November. And it is definitely emboldening the progressive wing of the party that sees itself as the rising force. SHAPIRO: Where do you see that in action? DAVIS: If you look at another win - Tuesday, Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, better known as one of the members of the so-called squad - she had a primary challenge from the center. And she was able to beat that back by 30 points. SHAPIRO: Wow. DAVIS: I think we're just seeing that the people that are losing in primary challenges are being replaced by people, in large part, who are more ideological than they are. And it's further evidence of something that we know is true about Congress. And each passing election, it is getting more and more polarized. SHAPIRO: That is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thanks, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Former national security adviser Susan Rice told NPR she's \"honored and humbled\" to be on Joe Biden's shortlist for vice president and that her lengthy tenure in the executive branch would make her an effective No. 2. \"I think I could bring my experience of almost now 20 years in the senior levels of the executive branch to bear to help tackle the most pressing problems we face,\" she told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Tuesday. \"If there's an opportunity to serve again, I'm certainly eager to do so, but not because it's something that I want for myself,\" she added. \"I've been blessed to have served already at the highest levels. But if at a time when we are suffering domestically and internationally, people with skills and experience are asked to come back, my judgment is they should say yes, even if it may not be the best thing for them personally.\" Rice, 55, is a veteran of the past two Democratic administrations, serving on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration and as ambassador to the United Nations and subsequently national security adviser under former President Barack Obama. Despite her extensive resume, Rice has never held or run for office herself, a concern she dismisses \u2014 especially this year. \"I've run for office on other people's behalf, where I did actually quite a bit of retail politics and speaking on the stump and speaking to groups of people,\" she told Inskeep. \"But I think, unfortunately, in the current context with the pandemic, this will be quite an unusual campaign, where much of the outreach is done via television, via radio, via Zoom. And those are all media in which I, like many others, have considerable experience as well.\" Rice said that the other candidates on Biden's shortlist \"are very strong\" and that all have their \"relative strengths and weaknesses.\" If she were on the ticket, Republicans would likely attack her on Benghazi, the location of a 2012 assault on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed four Americans. When it happened, Rice went on TV and called the assault an act of spontaneous violence, which was later shown to be incorrect. In the NPR interview, Rice suggested a Biden administration would need to push back against the division President Trump has sown while in office. \"One of the critical reasons why we are in such a difficult spot, whether with respect to the pandemic or economy, national cohesion, racial justice issues is because we are now burdened with leadership in the White House that thrives on dividing us and pitting Americans against each other,\" she said. \"We absolutely have to move past that to a point of a recognition that we are all in this boat together, we sink or swim together.\" Rice has personal experience relating to people who disagree fundamentally with her politics. \"I have a 23-year-old son whom I love dearly, whose politics are very, very different from my own and from the rest of our family,\" she explained. \"My son and I will have some robust disagreements over some matters of policy, not all. And yet, at the end of the day, you know, I love him dearly and he loves me.\" Rice said she believes, for her family and country, it comes down to finding areas of agreement and respecting people with differing political views. \"We agree, for example, on the importance of the United States playing a responsible, principled leadership role in the world,\" she said of her son. \"We agree on the importance of having strong alliances. We agree we have to be cleareyed and strong in dealing with adversaries like Russia and the threat that China may pose. We disagree on things like choice. I'm pro-choice. He's pro-life. That's the kind of difference that we ought to be able to respect.\"",

Voters head to the polls in a handful of states Tuesday, in the latest tests of voting systems stressed by the ongoing pandemic. Primaries are set for Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington state. (Tennessee holds its contests Thursday.) Here are five primaries to watch Tuesday: 1. Kansas U.S. Senate \u2014 Republican: This one has the attention of party leaders. Longtime GOP Sen. Pat Roberts is retiring, and a slew of Republicans are seeking to replace him, with Rep. Roger Marshall, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and businessman Bob Hamilton considered the leading contenders. Kobach is a polarizing conservative who holds hard-line stances on immigration and alleged voter fraud. He lost the governor's race to Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018, and many Republicans think his nomination would similarly cost the party a Senate seat. And with the GOP majority in the Senate looking more and more tenuous, many Republicans think they can't afford to put a seat in jeopardy in deep red Kansas. \"If [Kobach] wins the primary, that's probably curtains for the majority,\" one veteran GOP strategist engaged in 2020 congressional races told NPR. Some Democrats are so eager to face Kobach that they're behind a campaign ad touting Kobach as a true conservative and denigrating Marshall. Democratic state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician and former Republican who's raised millions of dollars for her campaign, is likely to be awaiting the winner of Tuesday's GOP race. Kansas hasn't elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1932. Loading... Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib (left), seen here during a March hearing on Capitol Hill, has a Democratic primary challenge.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption 2. Michigan's 13th Congressional District \u2014 Democratic: Two primaries of note on Tuesday feature Democratic incumbents challenged in very liberal districts. First-term progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib has one such challenge, and it's a rematch. Detroit City Councilor Brenda Jones topped Tlaib in a special election to serve in Congress briefly, and then Tlaib eked out a win over Jones in 2018 for a full term. Since then, though, Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, has significantly raised her national profile, along with three other noteworthy first-term progressive women who've referred to themselves as \"the squad.\" Shortly after being sworn in, Tlaib invoked expletives to declare she wanted to impeach President Trump, giving Republicans evidence that Democrats were determined to do so from the get-go. Jones told Quinn Klinefelter of member station WDET that she's running because voters want a different tone in Congress. The district is one of the poorest in the nation, Klinefelter says, and now hit hard by job losses and the coronavirus. Loading... 3. Missouri's 1st Congressional District \u2014 Democratic: The other intra-party tussle of note in a left-leaning district comes in St. Louis. Rep. William Lacy Clay, who's been in office nearly 20 years, faces a second challenge from nurse and activist Cori Bush. Clay topped Bush by 20 percentage points in 2018, but Bush's profile has risen since then, partly because of a documentary that also profiled New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Democratic primary is another example of a progressive challenging a well-known incumbent. Bush has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Justice Democrats, a group closely aligned with Ocasio-Cortez; and Jamaal Bowman, who dispatched with longtime New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel earlier this summer. Clay's backers, including fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, maintain he's \"no moderate Democrat,\" citing, for instance, his support of \"Medicare for All.\" Loading... 4. Arizona's 6th Congressional District \u2014 Democratic: This is a district held by a GOP incumbent, with a clear Republican lean, that's suddenly gotten more competitive after ethics violations. Just on Friday, the House unanimously passed a rare ethics resolution to reprimand incumbent Rep. David Schweikert for breaking congressional and campaign finance rules. Schweikert admitted to the violations and agreed to pay a $50,000 fine. Schweikert won his last election by 10 points, and there are four Democrats vying for a general election matchup this year, including Anita Malik, whom Schweikert defeated in 2018. As Steve Goldstein of member station KJZZ has reported, protests against racial injustice are motivating many voters in the Scottsdale-centered suburban district, as well. Loading... 5. Michigan's 3rd Congressional District \u2014 Republican: This seat is being left vacant by the retirement of Rep. Justin Amash, an independent who left the GOP in 2019 and voted to impeach President Trump. Amash also briefly considered running to be the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee before opting against it. The district, which includes Grand Rapids, has a Republican lean, according to the Cook Political Report. One of its counties, Kent County, has long been reliably Republican \u2014 Grand Rapids was the boyhood home of President Gerald Ford \u2014 but it's also a suburban area that Democrats aim to win in November. Former Department of Justice attorney Hillary Scholten is unopposed on the Democratic ballot, but there are a handful of candidates on the GOP side, including state Rep. Lynn Afendoulis. Loading...

Now she is a contender to be Joe Biden's running mate.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Rep. Karen Bass was catapulted onto the national stage leading Democrats on police reform. Now she is a contender to be Joe Biden's running mate. One of a series of reports looking at Joe Biden's potential running mates. California Rep. Karen Bass was a relative unknown on the national stage until just a few months ago. Now she is among the contenders to be Joe Biden's pick for his vice presidential running mate. A former community organizer and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Bass led the Democratic effort to write sweeping police reform legislation. A \"collaborative\" approach She says she evolved into politics after starting out as an activist in Los Angeles in the 1980s. At the time she co-founded the Community Coalition aimed at fighting addiction, crime and poverty in the community. Rep. Barbara Lee, a fellow California Democrat, says she remembers meeting Bass in the '90s. Lee was in the state assembly and Bass was lobbying for liquor store regulations to keep kids from buying alcohol. \"She was really a community organizer,\" Lee said. \"But she also knew how to strategically work within the system, within the legislative body to get a bill passed.\" Bass describes feeling like she needed to create spaces where she could lead and train people to follow in her footsteps. \"I believe in working in a very collaborative, collective work style, which means that it's team-driven,\" Bass said in an interview with NPR. \"It's never personality-driven.\" Democrats say Bass' style may not have made her a household name but it has made her well-liked among Democrats on Capitol Hill, particularly after she took charge on the policing bill. Colleagues privately acknowledge that her low profile is a drawback when it comes to being vetted for vice president because Bass isn't a national figure. They say she hasn't been publicly tested yet for that kind of job. But her background in activism and social justice makes her a logical fit for Biden's list as the country grapples with racial inequality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a former Congressional Black Caucus chair and the third-ranking Democrat in the House, says Bass is known for being in constant contact. He says she keeps members in the loop and they feel like they're a part of every move the group makes. \"She doesn't mind leading by example,\" Clyburn said in an interview. \"A lot of people will lead by precepts, but Karen provides examples for people to follow.\" Her activism in Los Angeles made her a clear candidate when a California State Assembly seat opened up. From there she became the first Black woman to lead a state assembly as speaker and was elected to Congress in 2011. She rapidly rose in influence among members of the Congressional Black Caucus and was elected to lead the group in 2018. Bass was elevated to the national stage last month when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tasked her with writing the police reform bill. \"We are blessed to be led by the CBC chair, Karen Bass, who brings 47 years advocating for racial justice and an end to police brutality,\" Pelosi said at an event unveiling the legislation. Progressives, moderates and leadership allies say her collaborative approach made people feel included and prepared despite a lightning-quick process of drafting the bill. Bass already had a sense of which members had policing legislation ready to go and quickly knit together a bill that banned chokeholds, created a national registry of police misconduct, and ended special legal immunity for police. It is unusual for legislation to come together as rapidly as the George Floyd Justice in Policing bill. Members and staff involved describe a process in which Bass and her staff kept major ideological caucuses within the party apprised from the beginning. \"She was very effective in putting this together very quickly because people trusted her,\" Lee said. \"She organized everything in a way that allowed her to move expeditiously.\" The police reform process helped Bass develop new allies on Capitol Hill \u2014 relationships that could be important in the vetting process for vice president. The surge of attention on social and racial justice has created a unique moment for Democrats. At least three Black women in Congress \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., and Bass \u2014 are rumored to be on Biden's list. But Bass says any attempt to frame this as a competition or a cutthroat showdown are unfair and reductive. For his part, Clyburn said it shouldn't come as a surprise that Black women in Congress make up such a large share of the vice presidential contenders. \"The party is supposed to guarantee opportunity,\" Clyburn said. \"And this party has guaranteed opportunity for women.\" Castro comment Clyburn, who is personally close with Biden, says the decision now will come down to vetting, polling and focus groups that will parse every statement and comment a contender has made, every group or ally they may have upset or offended. For Bass, the remark already raising eyebrows was a statement she released in 2016 that called former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro \"Comandante en jefe\" after his death. That led to a dust-up with Florida Democrats who said she appeared to support the dictator in that statement. Bass has since walked that statement back, but critics say it points to a blind spot in her background and her lack of a deep understanding of foreign policy. \"I spoke to my colleagues from the Florida area, and they certainly shared with me the difficulty of how I referenced Castro,\" Bass said. \"And so I will definitely keep that in mind in the future.\" Bass wouldn't say if she's campaigning for vice president. Democrats say one benefit of the vice presidential search is that it is elevating female leaders like Bass to the national stage, which could be helpful for her future in the House. \"She understands the moment that we're in,\" Lee said. \"And that we must seize the time on behalf of, not just our communities, communities of color, but for the entire country.\"",

Updated at 9 a.m. ET This week, Joe Biden's campaign released its fourth and final plank in the former vice president's package of economic ideas: a plan for racial economic equity. It's a 26-page rundown of policies ranging from a plan to boost small businesses to a first-time homebuyer tax credit. But contained in the plan was a less-flashy proposal: asking the Federal Reserve to explicitly take race into account when it sets policy. \"Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth,\" the Biden plan says. What the Biden team is proposing isn't a total overhaul of monetary policy; rather, it's more of a refocusing of the Fed's attention onto America's wide racial economic gaps, as well as making sure that the Fed talks about those gaps. Monetary policy isn't known for targeting particular subgroups, however \u2014 the Fed's main tools are more sledgehammers than scalpels. It's possible that the policy could play a part in shrinking gaps considerably, but there is some dispute over how effective it would be. What Biden is proposing Biden is proposing that the Fed pay attention to racial gaps in making monetary policy, and also regularly talk about those gaps. (He's also proposing greater diversity in Fed hiring, as well as backing a \"real-time payment system\" the Fed has proposed to allow faster bank transactions between people and businesses. This article is going to focus on typical monetary policy, however.) A quick refresher on what the Fed does: It has what's called a \"dual mandate,\" meaning that by law, it has to pursue two aims: to both keep inflation in check and maintain \"full employment.\" The idea has been to get unemployment down to a level that is as low as possible, without getting so low that inflation picks up. Its main tool in doing that is manipulating interest rates. Pushing interest rates downward is like pushing on the accelerator; it's supposed to speed up the economy, because lower interest rates help spur investment and borrowing. (For example, think about how people say it's a great time to buy a house when mortgage rates are low.) Here's where Biden's proposals come in. The Fed usually pays attention to the total unemployment rate when it considers what full employment looks like.However, that unemployment rate obscures some wide gaps. For example, Black and Hispanic unemployment have been consistently higher than white and Asian unemployment. In fact, the Black unemployment rate in recent years has been just under twice as high as the total unemployment rate. \"Based on historical relationships, a 4% overall rate translates into something like an 8% overall rate for Blacks, and that's a recessionary unemployment rate,\" said Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist to Vice President Biden and is familiar with Biden's current proposals. Bernstein also co-wrote a June paper that advocated for the Fed shrinking racial gaps. Bernstein makes the case that the Fed could keep monetary policy loose without sparking runaway inflation. Unemployment was at historically low levels before the pandemic, but it didn't appear to be sending prices spiking upward. All of that might mean the Fed would decide to hold interest rates lower for longer, Bernstein said. The hope would be that more of the (disproportionately Black and Hispanic) people remaining unemployed are hired, without inflation also increasing. In addition, Biden is proposing that the Fed talk more about racial gaps. Specifically, he would want to amend the Federal Reserve Act so that when the Fed chair goes to Capitol Hill to report on the economy (as the chair is required by law to do), they would also report on racial gaps. Those gaps go well beyond jobs; America has some gaping wealth disparities. The median white family has 10 times the wealth of the median Black family and 8 times that of the median Hispanic family, according to Fed data. For his part, President Trump has touted the record-low unemployment levels that Black and Hispanic Americans hit pre-pandemic as proof that his economic policies benefit people of color. However, in recent weeks, he has also used the rollback of a housing policy designed to combat bias in an apparent attempt to play on white voters' presumed racist fears. Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Federal Reserve, as well, often criticizing Chair Jerome Powell when Trump thinks the Fed has not boosted the economy aggressively enough. Would it work? One former Fed governor believes that just the communication part of the Biden policy would play a big part in shrinking racial gaps. \"I think that you could go a long way simply by saying to the Fed, 'Look, we want you to report on a regular basis about the gap between Black unemployment and white unemployment, and how are your policy choices likely to influence that gap?' \" said Narayana Kocherlakota, professor of economics at the University of Rochester and former president of the Minneapolis Fed. \"I think anything the Fed has to pay attention to in its reports to Congress or the public immediately flow into decision-making.\" He also sees past Fed policy as being too tight and thinks paying attention to racial economic gaps would prevent those kinds of moves in the future. \"I think it really would put an alert on the Fed about tightening too early, which I think unfortunately, I think we saw a lot of in the last slow recovery from from the Great Recession,\" Kocherlakota said. But then, not everyone agrees that the Fed should be targeting racial gaps. Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that he thinks this type of Fed policy would be \"a long way from their traditional mandate.\" In addition, it's also possible that such a policy wouldn't be very effective at shrinking gaps. That's the view of Sandy Darity, an economist at Duke University. \"I don't see any way that aggregate interest rate policy will reduce the gap,\" Darity wrote in an email to NPR. \"Since the unemployment rate gap is an index of the degree of discrimination in employment in the economy, and interest policy has no impact on discrimination, I have no idea why anyone would believe conventional Fed monetary policy could have an effect on the black-white ratio of unemployment rates.\" He added that he would prefer the Fed to instead \"play a direct role in financing reparations for black American descendants of U.S. slavery.\" Biden has said he supports a study of reparations, but his racial equity plan does not call for that kind of policy. For his part, Bernstein is clear that Fed policy alone wouldn't achieve Biden's goals for greater racial equality. \"No one is claiming that this idea by itself would close racial wealth gaps,\" he said. But he added, \"I think it would be a big mistake to underestimate the benefits to persons of color of persistently tight labor markets.\"",

            "article_content": "Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass is a potential running mate for Joe Biden. Her background as a community organizer and her role in crafting police reform have elevated her profile.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: California Congresswoman Karen Bass was a relative unknown on the national stage until recently, and now she's believed to be among the contenders to be Joe Biden's running mate. A former community organizer and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, she's gaining support not just as a VP hopeful but as a leader in the party as NPR's Kelsey Snell reports. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: There are a lot of hard-edge leadership styles in Washington, demanding, cajoling and will-bending types. Karen Bass says she approaches things a little differently. KAREN BASS: And the work that I do is anchored in pushing for social and economic justice. I believe in working in a very collaborative, collective work style, which means that it's team driven. It's never personality driven. SNELL: It's a style Bass says she developed in Los Angeles in the 1980s.

Lee was in the state assembly and Bass was lobbying for liquor store regulations to keep kids from buying alcohol. BARBARA LEE: She was really a community organizer, but she also knew how to strategically work within the system, within a legislative body, to get a bill passed. SNELL: When a state legislative seat opened up, Lee says Bass was the only person on most lists for who should run. She became the first Black woman to lead a state assembly, was elected to Congress in 2011 and was picked to chair the Congressional Black Caucus in 2018. But when it comes to being Biden's running mate, some colleagues privately acknowledge that she lacks a national profile and hasn't been tested for this kind of role. But they say her background in activism and social justice make her a logical fit for Biden's list as the country grapples with racial injustice in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: We are blessed to be led by the CBC chair, Karen Bass, who brings 47 years of leadership advocating for racial justice and an end to police brutality. SNELL: That's House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the steps of the Capitol explaining why she chose Bass to lead Democrats in rewriting the nation's policing standards. The surge of attention in America on social and racial justice has created a unique moment for Democrats. At least four Black women in Congress are rumored to be on Biden's list. But Bass says any attempt to frame this as a competition or a cutthroat showdown are unfair and reductive. South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn, who was an influential voice in the Democratic Party and was one of the first people to float Bass as a vice presidential contender, says women and African Americans are a critical part of the Democratic coalition. JIM CLYBURN: The party is supposed to guarantee opportunity, and this party has guaranteed opportunity for women. SNELL: Bass may be in the vice presidential mix, but unlike some of the others, she hasn't worked closely with Biden. Critics say she also lacks a strong background in foreign policy. It's a shortcoming that led to a dust-up with Florida Democrats over a seemingly supportive statement she made about former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. She walked that back, but critics say it could hurt her appeal in a key battleground state. Bass wouldn't say if she's campaigning for vice president, but Lee says Bass is well equipped to lead the party even if it's not from the White House. LEE: She understands the moment that we're in and that we must seize the time on behalf of not only our communities, communities of color, but for the entire country. SNELL: Democrats say one benefit of the vice presidential search is that it's elevating women leaders like Bass to the national stage. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Former first lady Michelle Obama excoriated President Trump during a video message aimed at delivering her closing argument for why voters should elect Joe Biden. \"We can no longer pretend that we don't know exactly who and what this president stands for. Search your hearts, and your conscience, and then vote for Joe Biden like your lives depend on it,\" Obama said in the video released by Biden's campaign. She rebuked Trump for what she sees as \"willful mismanagement of the COVID crisis.\" \"Seven months later, he still won't wear a mask consistently and encourage others to do the same, even when those simple actions could save countless lives,\" she said. \"Instead, he continues to gaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat.\" Her remarks Tuesday morning came a day after Trump was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive the rest of his treatment for COVID-19 from the White House. Upon his return, he took off his mask for a photo-op and in a video downplayed the severity of the virus. \"Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it,\" Trump said. In a tweet Tuesday morning, Trump said he's \"FEELING GREAT!\" Obama also admonished the president for his push for colleges to reopen immediately. \"Everybody wants their kids back in school as soon as it's safe,\" she said. \"But as a mom, it is frightening thinking about all of these young people, who were just our babies yesterday, quarantined alone in dorms or apartments with little or no support as the disease continues to spread, unable to come home if their symptoms get worse.\" She also used the video to have a frank discussion about white privilege, calling for people to walk in each other's shoes. She said: Think about it: You've worked hard all your life, and for too long, you've watched the rich get richer ... you've seen your beloved towns shattered by joblessness ... and it's frustrating to hear some folks say that you've been the beneficiary of privilege, that the color of your skin gives you a head start. But right now, the president and his allies are trying to tap into that frustration and distract from his breathtaking failures by giving folks someone to blame other than them. They're stoking fears about Black and brown Americans, lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbs, whipping up violence and intimidation. She underlined: \"It's morally wrong and yes, it is racist.\" In last week's nationally televised presidential debate, Trump declined to denounce white supremacists, instead saying that the Proud Boys, a far-right group, should \"stand back and stand by.\" He later told Fox News that he condemns right-wing hate groups. Obama said the moment calls for empathy. \"Imagine how it feels to have suspicion cast on you from the day you were born simply because of the hue of your skin,\" she said, \"to walk around your own country scared that someone's unjustified fear of you could put you in harm's way, terrified of what four more years of this kind of division might mean for the safety of you and those you love.\" Obama labeled electing Biden in November as a \"chance for a fresh start.\" She ticked through the Democratic nominee's biography and decades of public service, noting that Biden continued to serve even in the face of tragedy after he lost his wife and young daughter, and later in life, his eldest son Beau. She emphasized the importance of making a voting plan, saying, \"We don't have the luxury to assume that things are going to turn out OK.\" \"We cannot afford to withhold our votes or waste them on a protest candidate,\" she said, perhaps referencing the candidacy of musician Kanye West. \"Work like this may not feel as impactful as attending a protest, but trust me, it is absolutely the most important thing that we can do right now to save our democracy.\"",

On a recent morning, Kim Gates helped hand out free boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables in an underserved area of Grand Rapids, Mich. Lately, the retired schoolteacher from the nearby tiny town of Caledonia has been trying to volunteer with minority communities and read more about racism. The 63-year-old white woman had always voted for the candidate she thought was best for the job \u2014 like, for instance, Michigan's recent Republican governor, Rick Snyder. She said she never considered herself political until Donald Trump's victory in 2016. \"The night he got elected I got online and started looking for issues I was going to support,\" Gates said. \"And I chose to support areas against racism and with immigration.\" Gates said she was drawn to those topics, in part, because she was living in a \"very, very white, very homogeneous community.\" The election of Trump was her initial catalyst, but like many white voters, the death of George Floyd and the outcry that followed have made her more conscious of race and racial injustice. Polling shows Gates is not alone. A recent Monmouth University survey found 76% of Americans say racial and ethnic discrimination is a big problem in the country. That's up from 51% five years ago. More than half of Americans also now support the Black Lives Matter movement, another poll found. In particular, white suburban voters are having a reckoning with race \u2014 showing up to protests in small towns and calling for police reform in communities that had never before witnessed a Black Lives Matter rally. As NPR has previously reported, polls show an increasing number of white liberals began adopting more progressive positions on a range of cultural issues around 2012. These days, white Democrats \u2014 and, in particular, white liberals \u2014 are more likely than in decades past to support more liberal immigration policies, embrace racial diversity and uphold affirmative action. \"This country needs a man like Gerald Ford\" Former President Gerald Ford's boyhood home in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Gerald Ford's boyhood home in Grand Rapids, Mich. For decades, Kent County, home to Grand Rapids, has been reliably Republican. With the exception of Barack Obama's narrow victory in 2008, no Democratic presidential candidate has carried the county since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. But in 2016, Trump narrowly won it by 3 percentage points \u2014 far narrower than Mitt Romney's victory there four years earlier. And in 2018, Democrats further chipped away at that historical legacy. The state's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, won the county by 4 percentage points. And then last year, conservative Rep. Justin Amash, who represents part of the county in Congress, left the Republican Party to become an independent. Dutch Christian immigrants shaped the culture of the region. But these days, the suburbs are growing quickly and diversifying. The city of Kentwood, southeast of Grand Rapids, is known as the most diverse school district in Michigan. The county prides itself on its unique vein of moderate Midwestern politics. Both Republicans and Democrats like to point out that Gerald Ford, the president who led the country in the wake of the Watergate scandal, hailed from Grand Rapids. \"This country needs a man like Gerald Ford,\" said Tim England, who now lives in Ford's boyhood home. \"His philosophy was that he wanted to heal this country.\" England grew up as a Republican, but he said there's no way he would vote for  Trump. \"It's a disgrace what he's done to our democracy,\" he said. England wants a president who will be a steady hand and shepherd the country out of chaos, much like Ford after Richard Nixon. And this fall he intends to vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Dave Levitt said he's now a \"fallen conservative, a former conservative.\" Levitt voted for Romney in 2012 but then chose Hillary Clinton over Trump four year later. He works in real estate and said for years he chose Republican presidents because of economic policy. He largely ignored the social issues, but he said he can't anymore. \"I can't see good people on both sides in Charlottesville, I'm sorry, I can't,\" Levitt said, referring to Trump's comments about the Virginia city in 2017. \"If you're marching down the street with a tiki torch saying, 'Jews will not replace us,' I'm not going to support that.\" And so come this fall, he said he too intends to vote for Biden, even though he feels like a man without a home in either political party. \"I think I didn't understand white privilege\" Murals in Grand Rapids.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Murals in Grand Rapids. Kent County is the kind of place Biden may need if he intends to win back Michigan for Democrats \u2014 full of suburbanites and young, college-educated transplants who lean toward his party. \"When I went to college here in 2000, all of my friends left. It was pretty much just me and my husband here,\" said Rachel Westerhof, a local Democratic organizer. \"And now a number of those people have come back.\" But it's not just young people who've moved into the county, which has been growing at a faster rate than the state. Westerhof's parents moved to the region from Iowa two years ago. Her mother, Mary Meuzelaar, is a former Republican who began voting for Democrats in 2008 with Obama, and now considers herself a \"fiery Democrat.\" She said her change came down to values around poverty, equality and justice. But more recently, that's also incorporated race. \"I think I didn't understand white privilege. I just didn't understand it, because it wasn't in the way I was brought up,\" Meuzelaar said. She said she started to understand this privilege over the last eight years, and then Floyd was killed. \"Oh my goodness, I was just devastated, and suddenly it just hit home in a way that I had never felt,\" she said. \"I'm so embarrassed 'cause I didn't see it before. I want so badly to make up for the things we've done for the last 150 years, and I feel helpless at times.\" But voting makes her feel slightly less helpless. And the way the president has handled this situation, she said, makes it easy to vote against him. At a Juneteenth celebration Friday evening, white residents lined the street demanding change, asking passing cars to honk in support. A young white man in an Eddie Bauer backpack held up a sign that read, \"Black Lives Matter! Period!\" Another man held a sign with the words \"Abolish White Supremacy.\" Some people, such as Susie Hall, a 62-year-old teacher, had never attended a Juneteenth celebration before. But the racial unrest in the country prompted her to come out with her daughter. Susie Hall, right, and her daughter Rebekah attend a Juneteenth celebration.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Susie Hall, right, and her daughter Rebekah attend a Juneteenth celebration. \"The last couple of years I realize I taught my kids to be colorblind,\" she said. \"But I'm realizing, I guess, and in the process of educating myself more, that race is important, especially as our country is not equal to all races.\" But for Hall, like many Democrats, racial injustice and the need to come out and condemn it has also become a rallying cry against the president. \"We've come out for other things, like we've marched for science, we've marched for women and stuff like that,\" said Ian O'Hara, 33, who had never previously attended a Juneteenth event or Black Lives Matter protest. The protests around racial injustice are for some white Democrats the latest outrage in a long litany of complaints about the president's conduct in office. \"This election is really about President Trump\" Despite the passion in the streets, the assumption that the current racial unrest might sway Trump voters away from him seems unlikely. Jeff Christians considers himself a moderate pro-business Republican. The small-business owner is not a big fan of the president's character. \"He's very self-centered and I think self-serving,\" he said. He said he feels mixed about the president's response to the COVID-19 crisis, but still he intends to vote for him for reelection. \"I would vote for the Trump platform again because of the Republican pro-business approach,\" Christians said. \"The economic factors are very significant for where we are right now.\" Christians may not like the president's behavior, but he has no intention of converting. And Democrats around Kent County are realizing that. They said the key to victory isn't about trying to persuade Trump voters, it's about trying to make sure Democrats who are riled up now stay fed up \u2014 and then show up on Election Day. \"This election is really about President Trump,\" said Gary Stark, the Kent County Democratic Party chair. \"Almost all Democrats I talk to say, 'Vote blue, no matter who' \u2014 you don't have to be enthusiastic ... it's pragmatic.\"",

But it is also a suburban place that Democrats think they can win this November.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Michigan is likely to be a battleground state again this fall. For decades, Kent County, home to Grand Rapids, has been a Republican stronghold. Now that's changing. Across the country, white suburban voters say they're waking up to racism. NPR's Asma Khalid reports how white voters in Kent County view President Trump's response to these issues could be a major factor in November. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Kent County prides itself on its moderate Midwestern politics. Both Republicans and Democrats like to point out that Gerald Ford, the president who led the country in the wake of Watergate, is from here. TIM ENGLAND: This country needs a man like Gerald Ford. KHALID: That's Tim England. He now owns the home Ford lived in as a boy. ENGLAND: His philosophy was that he wanted to heal this country. KHALID: England, like many folks around here, used to be a Republican. But he says there's no way he would vote for Donald Trump. ENGLAND: It's a disgrace what he's done to our democracy. KHALID: Trump won Kent County by three points. He did worse here than Mitt Romney in 2012, in part because of people like Dave Levitt. DAVE LEVITT: I think today I would say I'm a fallen conservative, former conservative. KHALID: Levitt works in real estate and mostly voted Republican because of economic policy. He largely ignored the social issues, but he says he can't anymore. LEVITT: I can't see good people on both sides in Charlottesville. I'm sorry. I can't see that, you know? If you're marching down the street with a tiki torch and saying Jews will not replace us, you're not going to - I'm not going to support that. KHALID: Kent County is the kind of place Joe Biden may need if he intends to win back Michigan. It's a place full of suburban voters, white voters well into their 60s who are having a reckoning with race. Mary Meuzelaar is a former Republican who began voting for Democrats in 2008 with Barack Obama. MARY MEUZELAAR: I think I didn't understand white privilege. I just didn't understand it because it wasn't in my - the way I was brought up. KHALID: The death of George Floyd devastated her. MEUZELAAR: I'm so embarrassed because I didn't see it before. I want so badly to make up for the things that we've done for the last 150 years, and I feel helpless at times. KHALID: But voting makes her feel like she can do something. And the way the president has handled this situation, she says, makes it easy to vote against him. One major reason this county is changing is because lots of new people are moving in, and many are college-educated professionals who lean toward the Democratic Party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: No justice. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: No justice. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: No peace. KHALID: At a Juneteenth celebration the other night, probably half the crowd was white. Multiple people told me they'd never attended a Juneteenth event before. I met Suzi Hall with her daughter. The 62-year-old teacher was carrying a sign with the words justice for all. SUZI HALL: The last couple of years I realized that I taught my kids to be colorblind.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is backtracking on remarks he made on a popular black radio program on Friday that were criticized as questioning the cultural authenticity of black supporters of President Trump. \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,\" the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said during an interview with Breakfast Club host Charlamagne Tha God. Biden's campaign later said the remarks, called \"racist\" by the Trump campaign, were made \"in jest.\" But Biden reportedly told black business leaders on a call Friday afternoon that he \"shouldn't have been such a wise guy. I shouldn't have been so cavalier.\" Throughout Friday morning's 18-minute interview, Biden sought to distinguish his record from Trump's and to make the case for why he was the best candidate for black America. He cited the Trump administration's delayed response to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected African Americans, his own Senate voting record and the overwhelming support he has historically garnered from black voters. But in his closing remarks to the program, made shortly after he side-stepped speculation of whether he would select a black woman as his running mate in the White House race, Biden took the controversial dig at black Trump supporters, sparking a near-immediate backlash online. \"1.3 million black Americans already voted for Trump in 2016. This morning, Joe Biden told every single one of us we 'ain't black,' \" Tim Scott, the lone black Republican in the U.S. Senate, tweeted on Friday morning. \"I'd say I'm surprised, but it's sadly par for the course for Democrats to take the black community for granted and brow beat those that don't agree.\" He called Biden's comments \"the most arrogant and condescending thing I've heard in a very long time,\" adding, \"I am offended, but not surprised.\" In a call with reporters, Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson called the remarks \"extremely racist\" and an example of \"white privilege.\" Biden's Friday remark was not the first time the Democratic presumptive nominee stumbled into controversy over racial consciousness. During the primary, Biden was taken to task by fellow Democrats over his past opposition to federal busing school integration policies and his support of the 1994 crime bill. Symone D. Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden and one of his most visible supporters, defended his remarks as an attempt at humor. \"Vice President Biden spent his career fighting alongside and for the African American community. He won his party's nomination by earning every vote and meeting people where they are and that's exactly what he intends to do this November,\" Sanders wrote on Twitter. \"The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let's be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump's any day. Period,\" she continued. Trump's own record on race has been called into question numerous times. His detractors have reached as far back to a 1973 federal lawsuit brought against Trump and his company for alleged racial discrimination at his housing developments in New York, to more recent rhetoric about immigrants, particularly from Latin America and Africa.",

Five different Code Switch members got to interview poets, which is awesome, including one of our interns at the time. The poets were kind of shocked when we told them we wanted to ask them about the census. They were like, \"Why me? I don't write poetry about the census!\" But prompting them to look at how their work related to how we count people made for some incredible insights. When in doubt, ask a poet!\" \u2014 Kumari Devarajan, production assistant \"My favorite recent episode was Is It Time To Say 'RIP' to 'POC'. I love it when we include the voices of Code Switch listeners and this episode is full of your informed and intelligent opinions about the terms POC and BIPOC. It's also one of those episodes that came from a real question I had: 'Why is everyone saying 'BIPOC', and should we be using it on Code Switch, too?'\" \u2014 Shereen Marisol Meraji, co-host \"I loved working on our episode about the Gen Z Latinx voters that was part of our election coverage. I pitched the idea months before, wanting to know more about this fast-growing demographic of young folks, and spent weeks talking to young folks across the country about the issues that are important to them. I love working on stories that take teens and their politics seriously\u2014and it was great to spend so much time talking to people who care deeply about their world.\" \u2014 Natalie Escobar, assistant editor \"Our episode about the Treaty of New Echota was born out of a deep, deep research rabbit hole. It was my first meaningful interaction with an idea Julian Brave NoiseCat wrote about recently for the Columbia Journalism Review, that they way journalists are trained to tell stories often fails Indigenous stories and storytelling. In learning so much that I never picked up through school, it constantly felt like this story was missing pieces (slave owning, Christian schooling, attacks on Chief John Ross's mixed heritage \u2014 each one a rabbit hole of its own). But while one episode of Code Switch can't cover everything, we still told a story about family, art and power that I'm really proud of.\" \u2014 Jess Kung, production assistant \"One Korean American's Reckoning was a really meaningful episode for me to work on because it's the first one I reported and produced since joining Code Switch at the beginning of the summer. I was really new to the team and I jumped in feet first with a lot of support and creative freedom to talk about anti-Blackness and organizing in the Asian American community. All of the research was new to me, so I was learning about myself as I was reporting and that is always amazing!\" \u2014 Alyssa Jeong Perry, producer \"I'd have to say my favorite, and the toughest piece of design I've worked on all year, was for the episode A Decade of Watching Black People Die. I had the, what seemed to me, obvious idea of writing out the names of black people killed at the hands of police up to the murder of George Floyd on one sheet, and making it printable, to show the impact of this disease. People really appreciated and felt moved by that simple but meaningful design. I saw the design on posters and flags, and it even became a giant mural in Brooklyn. But the worst part was that soon after I created it, it became outdated. The list is too long and still growing.\" \u2014LA Johnson, art director The rate at which black Americans are killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans.

First off, because it taught me something: about how and why people vote the way they do in this country, but also in that it popped a bubble that I think had been expanding dangerously in the media about why Joe Biden won the presidential election, and why so many people voted for Donald Trump. And secondly, because it was one of those episodes where everyone who worked on it contributed \u2014 a real team effort that when I listen back to it, I can hear all those different voices that went into it. It's funny, and thoughtful, and a little angry, too.\" \u2014Steven Drummond, executive producer \"It would be a tie, between the Karens ep, because that was of the moment and so many people didn't know that the 'Karen' moniker wasn't sui generis, but part of a progression of women with a big blind spot about their privilege. Or, Is Trump Really That Racist? I think we all know the short, one-word answer to that question. (In fact I got some response on Twitter from a number of people asking \"LOL! Really? You had to ask?\"), but I liked putting him in the context of recent history. Even the most beloved and/or effective presidents have had policies or episodes that could be described as racist, or {choke} race-inflected (!), and it's important to remember that.  Especially as people of color.\" \u2014Karen Grigsby Bates, senior correspondent \"This year was a whirlwind, so it felt really satisfying to be able to work on episodes that felt super relevant to all that was going on in the country. But my favorite episode to work on had nothing to do with the news \u2014 it was a story about my family's history, and how my ancestors' lives intersected with slavery, reconstruction and the Great Migration. Getting to explore those histories through a personal lens was such a privilege, and helped illuminate how present the past can be in all of our lives. And drinking beer in the French Quarter with my dad as 'research' didn't hurt, either.\" \u2014Leah Donnella, editor",

With only a few weeks until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, President Trump still won't admit defeat. White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, who has reported on Trump over the past 20 years, sheds light on his refusal to concede. \"[Trump] can't handle the concept of the label 'loser,' \" Haberman says. \"He has never before encountered a problem that he couldn't sue away through the court system or spin away. ... This is just an objective fact that he can't do anything about. It is roiling him.\" Haberman has covered Trump for The New York Times for more than four years. Before then, she wrote about him for the New York Post, New York Daily News and Politico. She describes the president as a \"self-destructive\" individual who tends to crave most what he does not \u2014 or cannot \u2014 have. Still, Haberman thinks it's unlikely that Trump will have to be forcibly removed from office: \"There has been this ongoing fear that he's going to somehow barricade himself in the White House,\" she says. \"I've never thought that's reality and I still don't.\" Haberman says while it's a privilege to cover the White House, reporting on an administration that seeds so much disinformation and often attacks journalists has been frustrating and exhausting. \"I feel like I got off one of those centrifugal force rides at the amusement park that pushes you against the wall because it's spinning so fast,\" she says. \"I think this presidency has had a disorienting effect on a lot of people \u2014 in Washington, outside of Washington, across the country.\" It's still not clear what lies next for Trump, but Haberman's next project is decided: She'll be covering politics for The Times and working on a book about Trump. Also, she's turning off Twitter notifications for Trump's account. On Trump continuing to have ties with Rudy Giuliani despite Giuliani's embarrassing press appearances [Rudy] Giuliani is saying to the president what the president wants to hear, which is that the president was robbed. Maggie Haberman The president was very displeased by the black rivulets of sweat running down Giuliani's face at the press conference. But the president has a very long relationship with Rudy Giuliani; he's never going to cut ties with him. He's really not. And Giuliani has convinced the president that it's activist judges or it's this one or it's that one who are thwarting them \u2014 and not that it's at all Giuliani's fault. Giuliani is saying to the president what the president wants to hear, which is that the president was robbed. On Trump raising more than $170 million from his supporters for his \"election defense fund\" What the president plans on using this money for is a big open question. He can certainly use some of it for his political action committee. There's a breakdown if you donate and it's clear that a large percentage of the donation initially goes to this leadership PAC he's formed, and then the rest goes to this campaign legal fight. Presumably he can use some of the money for his own legal fees if he faces ongoing legal battles, which many people think he will, over his own conduct and over questions around his children's behavior going forward. But it does put him in an unusual and formidable category where he's going to have a lot of money and he's refusing to let go of his clenched fist on the Republican Party. It's going to make him probably the most influential after-the-fact president that I can think of. I mean, the closest that would come is in the last 25 years would be Bill Clinton, and it took him a couple of years until he started really getting back into the political arena. George W. Bush left the stage very quickly. President [Barack] Obama was photographed very happily smiling and I think it was parasailing in the days right after he left the White House. That's not what you're going to see Donald Trump do. He's not just going to quietly exit. On Trump's lasting influence on the Republican Party He likes having power. Almost everything about Donald Trump for 50 years at this point has been about power and dominance. Maggie Haberman The second biggest vote-getter in history was Donald Trump. The first was Joe Biden. That's a substantial number to head off into the sunset with. This president has made clear over time that he loved hearing about how his endorsements impacted Republican primaries. I believe he wants to continue throwing his influence around in Republican primaries, and you're going to see early tests of that in 2022. He has this massive data list of supporters, this email list that he can blast out appeals to. He likes having power. Almost everything about Donald Trump for 50 years at this point has been about power and dominance. ... He knows that he has a group of millions of people. And is it the full 74 million who voted on the Republican line? Probably not, but it is a substantial segment of that group that will go with him. And so if he sets out when he leaves office and not just tries to be influential, but indicates he's running for president again, which he has told many, many people he's going to do, that is essentially going to freeze the Republican field, because it's going to be very hard for other candidates to say they will be the person to carry on Donald Trump's legacy if Donald Trump is standing on the field still. On why she believes Trump is fighting so hard to keep a job he didn't seem to want in the first place He doesn't like being told he can't have something. One of the things that I say about how he views advisers and people close to him is that he never wants someone more than when their back is turned to him, because he wants to see if he can win them over. And he has trouble being told that the sale is over. You can't do it anymore. And I think that he is constantly fighting for things that he has cost himself. He's very, very self-destructive. I mean, that should be pretty obvious, but he has gotten away with being self-destructive and facing few costs for it for so long. It's very hard for him to hear that now, that that's a problem for him, if that makes any sense. ... I think he liked being called president. I think he liked knowing that he ... lives in the White House. I think he likes Air Force One. I remember asking a friend of his at the end of 2017, if he liked being president. The friend said, \"Oh, absolutely.\" And the friend said, \"Oh, you know, Air Force One, Air Force Two, Marine One.\" I think he likes the accoutrements. I think that the act of being president, the job of being president has not always thrilled him. On the difficulty and frustration of reporting on the White House The frustrations are enormous. I remember in 2015 after I had some really elaborate fight with his folks and with him about a story, it was, again, just one of these areas where it was just a bad fact set for him, and he responded by trying to torch me. I remember saying to a Republican strategist a few days later that never before had we covered somebody where I'll be sitting on a chair and they'll point to the chair and say, \"That's a table,\" and insist on it, insist on it and insist on it. And it was just a fundamentally asymmetrical experience. Look, it's very frustrating. I think it's going to take a few months after this presidency to get my head around some of it. It's frustrating because we are just writing facts, and he takes them and twists them, or lies, or preemptively says everything is fake news. It's very, very hard to do our job in that climate. It has been very hard to get a baseline of just accurate fact sets from this White House. And it has been harder still that there are millions of people who don't believe things because he says they're not true. On Trump trying to get reporters to remove their masks and his lax attitude about COVID-19 In meetings he would say to people, \"Get that thing off.\" And he would use an expletive to emphasize his point. With reporters he has said, \"Can you take that thing off? It's really hard to hear you.\" I was on Air Force One several months ago, I think it was during the summer, and he was not masked. We were all masked. He came to the back of the plane to talk to us. And I had several back and forths with him. Again, he was unmasked. This is before he got sick. We learned later that somebody we were on the plane with got sick. That was just another reminder of sort of the lax culture there. It has just never been something that he has favored ever, because he thinks it looks weak and he doesn't like the way things look on people's faces. ... I think if you look at it through the lens of everything is how it impacts him. He convinced himself he was safe because he was getting tested. And he was not getting tested every day despite the fact that the White House led us to believe that. ... He was living in this unreality bubble where he was safe because he was the president and because people who came in contact with him were tested \u2014 and that just obviously was not foolproof. On Trump frequently being alone in the White House, without the first family My understanding has always been that he would not eat dinner with [Melania and Barron] every night, but there were some nights a week that they would eat dinner together. I think she is the one who spends the most time with their son. ... I think he's a lonely human being. And it goes back to those inconsistencies that I talked about. Even when surrounded by a lot of people, he can make himself alone. So I think a constant theme of this presidency has been his loneliness. On following Trump after he leaves office Haberman began covering the Trump campaign for The New York Times in 2015. \"I have not had a lot of sleep in the last four years,\" she says.\n                \n                    \n                    The New York Times\n                    \n                \nhide caption Haberman began covering the Trump campaign for The New York Times in 2015. \"I have not had a lot of sleep in the last four years,\" she says. I'm probably going to pay more attention to him than a lot of reporters, certainly the White House reporters. I'm not going to be covering the White House specifically anymore, so there's that. I am going to be covering the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, I anticipate anyway, and he is clearly a big part of that. I don't know that I'm going to keep Twitter notifications on. In fact, I don't plan to for him because they can be constant. And in the last couple of months, they've gotten more frenetic, more frequent. I will still be paying attention to him, but I do think the bar for news coverage changes significantly. ... I think that if he does something that is objectively newsworthy, makes an endorsement in a primary, gives a speech depending on what he says and so forth, I think those are worthy of coverage. He's still a former president, right? I mean, I think that that is and there are still 74 million people who voted for him. But \"Donald Trump tweets,\" just on its own, to me, that's not a story.

An executive order from the Trump administration said there would be consequences if its diversity training programs were to continue.\n                \n                    \n                    Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Agency for International Development is one of the largest official foreign aid organizations in the world. An executive order from the Trump administration said there would be consequences if its diversity training programs were to continue. The Trump administration issued an executive order and memorandum in September, prohibiting any discussion in the federal workforce of concepts such as systemic racism, white privilege and unconscious bias during workplace diversity training. While affirming a commitment to \"continue to foster environments devoid of hostility grounded in race, sex, and other federally protected characteristics,\"  the order condemned workplace diversity and inclusion trainings that bring up these concepts as \"divisive,\" \"anti-American,\" racist against white people and sexist against men. As an example, the order pointed to a Treasury Department seminar that promoted the idea that \"virtually all white people, regardless of how 'woke' they are, contribute to racism.\" The overall message: Such trainings must stop in federal agencies, contractors or any other institution that receives federal grants; otherwise, they may lose their funding. In part the memo said these parties must certify that they will \"not use Federal funds to promote the divisive concepts set forth in the E.O.\" and that \"noncompliance by continuing with prohibited training will result in consequences.\" As a result, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID \u2013 one of the largest official foreign aid agencies in the world \u2013 suspended all diversity and inclusion training on Sept. 30, one week after the order was issued. \"In compliance with the [executive order], USAID has put a pause across the Agency on upcoming trainings, seminars, and other related [assemblies] on diversity and inclusion until the completion of a review of the content of these programs in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget,\" a USAID spokesperson wrote to NPR in an email. The spokesperson would not provide further comment on what this move entails. \"There are many unanswered questions,\" USAID acting Administrator John Barsa wrote in guidance he issued to the agency, according to the global development website Devex. But apparently, it will be far-reaching. According to Barsa's guidance, any organization receiving funding directly or indirectly from USAID will have to make sure it's in compliance with the executive order \u2013 whatever that looks like. USAID works with more than 4,000 organizations in more than 100 countries, according to the agency's website. Experts in international aid contend these trainings provide important context that can lead to institutional culture shifts. Megan O'Donnell, assistant director for gender and a senior policy analyst at the Center for Global Development, said that diversity training is intended to provide a \"more accurate, historically grounded picture of racism and sexism\" in the U.S. and globally. \"This kind of executive order [from the Trump administration] means that we're refusing to acknowledge history and the current reality that so many people are impacted by,\" she said. O'Donnell said that training is most effective when done in combination with other diversity and inclusion efforts, such as narrowing pay gaps and setting targets for hiring and promoting women and people of color. That kind of multifaceted approach reflects the findings of a 2019 study by Edward Chang of the Harvard Business School: that a one-hour, one-off training might change attitudes but not behaviors in the workplace. Chang stresses that \"instead of [one-off] trainings, companies should think about how they can embed diversity and inclusion practices throughout their organization.\" As for the executive order, he had this to say: \"The spirit of the executive order I very much disagree with. This idea that we should not be talking about diversity or race in organizations and education \u2013 I think that's outlandish.\" These diversity and inclusion efforts are especially important in the international development sector, O'Donnell said, where people from high-income countries, often white, are trying to help people from low- and middle-income countries, often people of color. According to O'Donnell, training can help challenge that inherent power imbalance and make development projects more effective by putting the perspectives of the beneficiaries first. That's why this move by the Trump administration and USAID is so worrisome to members of the aid and development community. Marie-Rose Romain Murphy, co-founder and president of Fondation Communautaire Haitienne-Espwa (the Haiti Community Foundation) said that in a global development system already \"dominated by white privilege and white men,\" the executive order is a setback in the conversation around how racism and sexism are not just a matter of \"a few bad apples\" but rather systemic problems. \"This is not a good signal,\" she said. A June report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the percentage of nonwhite people working at USAID increased 4% from 2002 to 2018. Well over half of the workforce (64%) was still white, and the proportion of African Americans fell 5%. The study also found that men continue to hold more senior-level positions, with more women concentrated at lower levels. The development sector has also been criticized for failing to hire and promote more local workers, organizations and leaders. Now, Romain Murphy said the executive order could send the message that it's \"even more OK to not use local contractors and people of color.\" Emily Bancroft is president of one of the USAID partners, a global health group called VillageReach. She said the group hasn't received direct guidance from USAID yet regarding the executive order. But for now, she does not believe it will have to change much to be in compliance with the order besides submitting training materials to the government for evaluation. \"We don't do a lot of formal training with our staff. We encourage personal learning, open dialogue and reflection on colonialism and systemic racism within the development sector,\" Bancroft said. \"Our best assessment right now is that what we do within our organization is not in violation \u2013 but there's a lot of room for interpretation on that.\" If it turns out VillageReach is not in compliance with the Trump order, Bancroft said it will have to reassess its federal partnership because diversity, equity and inclusion are core values. In the meantime, it seems that most of the sector is on standby. \"I think a lot of people are saying, 'Let's wait and see what happens with the election and whether this executive order goes away,' \" Bancroft said.

She recently went back to work, and is, as she says, scrambling to find a way to teach during the coronavirus pandemic. When you first meet Veres, you'd never know how tough she's had it. She lived in foster homes as a child. She's overcome poverty. She's a recovering alcoholic. But none of this got the best of her. She's now a single mom to six kids. And she's always been determined to break free from the struggles, the stereotypes and the racism she has faced all her life. Loading... As a Navajo woman, she says her Indigenous community has endured so much trauma over generations that in some ways they are better equipped to handle the economic and emotional toll of this pandemic than the rest of the country. What keeps her up at night, she says, is her kids. She wants them \u2013 and their generation \u2014 to be informed citizens. She worries they won't be because of the deluge of disinformation and conspiracy theories. Veres believes the events of the last few years, particularly the killing of George Floyd, have exposed systemic racism that had long been downplayed and ignored, and that President Trump's time in office has finally unearthed some uncomfortable truths about America. She thinks Biden lives with a \"whole lot of white privilege.\" She hasn't liked him for a long time, but she still plans to vote for him in November. Dr. Connie Liu and Dr. Chris Hoover live near the Navajo Nation. She's an OB-GYN and he's a urologist. They serve the rural, mostly indigenous community. Many of their patients come from areas without reliable Internet access and cell phone infrastructure. The pandemic, say Liu, 42, and Hoover, 40, has amplified inequalities around healthcare access. Loading... The couple believes public health \u2014 especially when it comes to wearing masks \u2014 has been politicized, and as a result they have become more politically engaged to advocate for their patients and for their two young children. \"I want to hear messages that are science-centric and patient-centric, and I don't think we're in that place\" says Liu. She worries that public health experts and institutions like the Centers for Disease Control have been sidelined in COVID-19 response efforts. They plan to vote for Joe Biden in November. (NPR is not using Mary Jean's last name because she fears retribution for her political views. For the same reason, she did not want to be photographed for this story.) Mary Jean, 70, spent her career in media and marketing, living in a few different big cities, including Los Angeles and Manhattan. She and her husband moved to Arizona years ago for work, then retired there. But now she can't even imagine visiting those cities. She has kids living in Chicago, Portland and just outside of Los Angeles, and she worries about what she views as escalating violence in cities. Though overall crime has generally been on a downward trend in many big cities during the pandemic, Mary Jean says her friends and relatives tell her otherwise. She says before her husband died suddenly in mid-July, they had talked about whether they'd ever go back to New York City. \"We went back to New York every year for a couple of days and walked the streets and shopped and dined and drank and go to shows,\" she said. \"We even said, 'I don't know if we'll get back there.' \" Mary Jean is a registered Democrat, but she voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and plans to again this year. She supports his positions on immigration and believes he's an effective champion for law and order. Why did we visit Arizona and New Mexico for this story? Both are among the Sun Belt states that experienced a stubborn surge of COVID-19 cases this summer. The casualty count among minority groups, particularly Indigenous communities, are staggering. Then there's the political bent of these two states. New Mexico appears to be leaning toward Democratic nominee Joe Biden while next door, Arizona has consistently voted for Republican candidates in recent presidential and state elections. This year, Arizona is considered a toss-up state with many polls showing Biden with a slim lead over President Trump and one of the biggest forces at play in both states is the growing number of eligible Latino voters.",

            "article_content": "Maybe you've heard that by mid-century, the United States will no longer have a white majority. But what if that projection wasn't realistic? Here's how a statistic took on a life of its own.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Since the very first U.S. Census in 1790, the government has changed its definitions of racial categories more than 10 times. This week, NPR's Invisibilia podcast looks at the shifting boundaries around race and the continuing challenge over who belongs in which racial box. Here's NPR's Yowei Shaw. YOWEI SHAW, BYLINE: When Richard Alba wrote a piece about race for The New York Times, he was hoping to get buzz but not on white supremacist sites like The Daily Stormer. RICHARD ALBA: And they had this funny picture of me, and they had imposed a lavender Star of David on my forehead. SHAW: Oh, my gosh. It was 2015, and Alba, a sociology professor at the CUNY Graduate Center, had written about Census Bureau projections, forecasting that the U.S. population would no longer have a white majority by midcentury. ALBA: The projections imply a picture of two great blocs of people. And implied is a kind of contest for power in the largest sense. SHAW: But it wasn't just white supremacists who fixated. When the census first started publishing projections about a majority-minority crossover, people of all political stripes paid attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Almost half of white Americans say the U.S.A. becoming a majority non-white nation would weaken American customs and values. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: White people - they used to be everywhere. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: The idea that whites will not be the majority - it's an exciting transformation of the country. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) You will not replace us. MARIA ABASCAL: People don't like change in general - right? - and this is a big change. SHAW: Maria Abascal is a sociology professor at Columbia University. And she says that a slew of reputable studies have shown that white people react with fear and anger when they hear about their future shrinking numbers. ABASCAL: Yeah, so we know that they're more likely to express sympathy for other whites. They express more negative attitudes toward minorities. They are less supportive of redistributive policies like welfare. SHAW: White people might even be redefining whiteness. Abascal recently conducted a study in which whites were presented with photos of various Latinos. And she found that when told about future white decline, whites were less likely to classify the faces as white, compared to those who hadn't heard about the projections. ABASCAL: Whites who identified with the Republican Party and whites who voted for Trump in particular were even less likely to classify ambiguous people as white under demographic threat. SHAW: In other words, white people were guarding the white category more closely. ABASCAL: It seems like a very straightforward way to fight numeric decline is to recruit more people into your group, but that's not what we saw. SHAW: But what if these census projections weren't realistic? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ALBA: The more I dug into the data, the bigger the problem looked to me. SHAW: At first, Richard Alba accepted the projections like everyone else. But then he discovered that in 2000, when the census started allowing people to check more than one box, if you checked the white box plus any other box - like Black, Asian, American Indian or Hispanic - the census would count you as a minority. ALBA: Correct. SHAW: Now, the government does this, in part, for civil rights enforcement. But Alba thinks that this accelerated white decline in recent census projections, when really, Alba says, the number of multiracial people is growing. And they can identify in all kinds of ways, sometimes as white. ALBA: And the problem with the projections is that it - they can't take this fluidity into account. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAW: Take the case of Hannah Liu and her brother Allen, who have a white Jewish mom and a Taiwanese immigrant dad. Today, at 25, Hannah identifies as mixed race, Asian American and definitely not white, though she says people are sometimes surprised. HANNAH LIU: I also have told people that I identify as a person of color. And they've said no, you aren't. SHAW: So when Hannah was hanging out recently with her brother Allen and he said something about having white privilege, she was confused. H LIU: Because we have the same parents and the same racial makeup, and I don't really think about myself as having white privilege. SHAW: Though Hannah says she does have what she calls light skin privilege. H LIU: And I said, but you're not white. And he said, yes, I am. And it really freaked me out. I was like, oh, no. Am I white? - because I generally trust his opinion, and I think he's really smart. SHAW: Should we call him and see if you have a white brother? H LIU: Well, that's terrifying. But, yes, let's do it (laughter). ALLEN LIU: Hello. SHAW: Hello? H LIU: Yo. SHAW: Allen was nice enough to take our call and to explain himself to his sister. A LIU: I feel like people default assume that I'm someone to be listened to in nearly every situation that I come across with very few exceptions. So given that I experience these things that sounds like white privilege and I'm ethnically at least part white, then that makes me as a white person. SHAW: So just to clarify, you do see yourself as white? A LIU: Yeah, I say I'm white. I'm also East Asian, among my other possible identities as a Jewish person and as a 21-year-old college student. SHAW: Oh. Hannah, did you catch that? H LIU: That definitely makes me feel better (laughter). A LIU: (Laughter) OK. SHAW: Of course, today with the coronavirus and reports of anti-Asian harassment on the rise, it's hard to say how this will affect people like Hannah and Allen, how their race will be perceived by other Americans. And it's important to note that even if the census used a more inclusive definition of white, a lot of sociologists told me that the U.S. is still on course to becoming a much more diverse country, which is why how you tell the story of demographic change matters. A study by Dowell Myers and Morris Levy at USC found that when white participants read projections stressing a white majority with increasing diversity, they were much less anxious and angry than those who read projections merely emphasizing white decline, which has led to a personal revolution for demographer Dowell Myers. DOWELL MYERS: I've become much more fixated on the idea of demographic narrative, which I always thought was just sort of, like, sort of backroom gossip. That's actually what drives elections. It's not the main facts in the report. It's the narrative about it. SHAW: The Census Bureau says it has talked to Alba and other race scholars about all this and is now thinking hard about how to present their racial projections. In the most recent published projections, they didn't list a date for the majority-minority crossover, and they didn't use the phrase majority-minority. But that hasn't stopped the media or academics or even white supremacists from doing their own math. For NPR, I'm Yowei Shaw. CHANG: In the current episode of NPR's Invisibilia podcast, Yowei Shaw looks at which racial box a city council candidate struggles to fit into and the political consequences for an entire city.

DAVID GREENE, HOST: As this Democratic Party convention has been going this week, we've been focusing on how politics is really personal. It's not just about speeches, it's about your lives and how your experiences and fears shape your votes. Politics is so personal for a woman we met when we visited the Navajo Nation in Arizona last week. Debbie (ph), I'm David. DEBORAH VERES: Hi, David. GREENE: Nice to meet you. VERES: Nice to meet you, too. GREENE: Did your kids set up this whole canopy, everything? VERES: Yes. Aren't they sweet? Come on over (unintelligible). GREENE: Oh, that was really nice. We really needed some cover from the sun because it was a scorcher when we met with Deborah Veres. We were at her home in Fort Defiance, Ariz. We set up under a tarp canopy in the backyard - both of us with our masks on at a distance, right in earshot of the air conditioner unit that was cooling her home. Deborah had just come home from the middle school down the road where she teaches social studies. VERES: But I'm back at work now for the last two weeks. I've had two weeks on now, maybe three. We're temperature checked every day, no children in the school, trying to scramble to find a way to teach. GREENE: When you first meet Deborah, you'd never know how tough she's had it. She lived in foster homes as a child. She's overcome poverty. She's a recovering alcoholic. But none of this got the best of her. She's now a single mom to six kids. And she's always been determined to break free from the struggles, the stereotypes and the racism she has faced all her life. VERES: I was often called a stupid Indian. Sometimes that was said under their breath or muttered. Other times it was said quite clearly. But I always knew where I stood. And so at a very young age, you know, I was reading and trying to not be a stupid Indian. GREENE: The story of Indigenous communities like hers is riddled with trauma - forced relocations, forced sterilizations, nuclear waste dumped on their lands. And now Indigenous communities have been hit especially hard by this pandemic. But Deborah didn't bring any of this stuff up when I asked her the question we've been asking all the voters we meet - what keeps you up at night? VERES: The thing that keeps me up most at night is my kids. And I'm telling you what really scares me is since we've been home, I've really got a chance to see what they watch. And I'm afraid. And I see Trump and all of the things that are happening in our world, in our communities and our nation and the conspiracy theories. What keeps me up at night is that people are going to be ignorant and dumb and have weird beliefs. GREENE: But thinking about her kids and their future does make Deborah reflect on her own journey. She had accepted that things would never change for underrepresented groups, certainly not in her lifetime. VERES: I had come to this space in my life where I believed that I was going to die and nothing would be changed. And then the (crying) - George Floyd got killed, murdered, and it was so heartbreaking. I still haven't watched the whole video. I just can't. And I saw those folks just start to come out into the streets. And I started - this is so bizarre, and it's probably going to be so bizarre to your listeners. But in the midst of a pandemic, I felt hope (crying) that somehow my children's life was going to be different. And I started to see that we're turning a corner. And I'm seeing all these white people in D.C. and Atlanta and LA. And just as many white people were protesting with Black Lives Matter as Black people. GREENE: Do you still feel that hope today compared to... VERES: Then I started feeling kind of depressed for a while because I want to be a part of it. There are some of us who've been doing this for a long time and waiting for this moment. But I'm 56, and I don't want to catch COVID. And I have a lot of responsibility. I'm a really important person. I'm an Indigenous woman who has survived this, who has gotten educated, who is taking care of her kids. I have to survive this pandemic. GREENE: ...What role does President Trump play in everything you're talking about? VERES: Oh, my gosh. I think that our general community, not just Native, not just Black, but our general community has kind of really seen how - what gaslighting is. I used to talk about racism, and nobody believed me until they saw George Floyd get a knee in the neck till he died for eight minutes. You guys are seeing that, too. We've always known that this nation has some really deep sins that nobody ever wanted to talk about. And those are being unearthed. His sickness and his lies and his awfulness has made people say, oh, my God, how could I have had my head in the ground for so long? Why didn't I notice this before? And what are we going to do about it? And they're doing something. Voter after voter, you know, is going in there and they're voting for progressive people. They're voting for justice Democrats. Do I believe in the Democratic Party? No. I am Indigenous. I am not along the net. There is no politician or no party who has ever given a [expletive] about us. But if this country as a whole does better, we do better. GREENE: And what do you think about Joe Biden? VERES: I don't really like Joe Biden, but I'm going to vote for Joe Biden. GREENE: What don't you like about Biden? VERES: I think he's very, very white man. He lives with a really whole lot of white privilege. He doesn't see it. He doesn't experience it that way. I think he knows it intellectually. And I think he understands intellectually. I'm just not sure that he feels that. GREENE: It's almost like you never would have asked for all of this, but now that it's happening, you feel... VERES: Yeah. GREENE: ...Like we're living through something important. VERES: You know what? I'm going to something that is so controversial. But it's the same thing that happened at Sept. 11. Like, I was here. I was up at my mom's place, and I was watching Sept. 11. And the first thing that came to many of our mouths was, now they know. They know what it's like to be terrorized. Now they know. It's not that I didn't feel grief. Oh, my God, I would see those signs on the buildings - have you seen my son? - with those pictures. Can you imagine coming from a space where your family has 500 years of pictures? You know, I don't think you guys understand. GREENE: But you see that may be changing now? VERES: I see in our communities, maybe in this country, maybe even if it's just between Navajo and Navajo, maybe Black people and Black people, maybe Natives. Like, we've made a lot of friends (laughter), you know. We made a lot of connections. Like, we saw our power. You know our power now. That's important. You never knew our power before. We have power. We are somebody. (SOUNDBITE OF THRUPENCE'S \"HAKEA\") GREENE: Debbie, thank you for talking to us. VERES: You got it. GREENE: That's - thank you. VERES: No, thank you.

A judge freed President Trump's niece this week from a restraining order restricting her from discussing the book.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A display of Mary Trump's new book about her uncle. A judge freed President Trump's niece this week from a restraining order restricting her from discussing the book. In an extended conversation with NPR's Rachel Martin, Mary Trump said on Wednesday that her grandfather and family patriarch Fred Trump rewarded ruthlessness and dismissed any interests outside of the family real estate business, contributing to what she now views as an unfitness on President Trump's part to hold the office of the White House. \"It's kind of ironic in the sense that the traits my grandfather came to value in Donald were the traits that were a result of my grandfather's maltreatment of Donald,\" she said. \"The bullying, the tendency not to care about other people's feelings, the willingness to cheat, lie to get what he wanted. And eventually ... my grandfather started to see a kindred spirit. Somebody who could advance his agenda.\" Mary Trump, the president's only niece, describes an abusive and neglectful upbringing suffered by her father and uncles at the hand of Fred Trump, and said she will be supporting her uncle's rival, Joe Biden, in the 2020 election. A trained psychologist living in New York, she was promoting her highly anticipated new book, Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man. In the book, Mary Trump describes how her grandfather's relentless business ambition was passed down to Donald Trump. \"Honest work was never demanded of him, and no matter how badly he failed, he was rewarded in ways that are almost unfathomable. He continues to be protected from his own disasters in the White House,\" she writes in the tell-all. \"But now the stakes are far higher than they've ever been before; they are literally life and death. Unlike any previous time in his life, Donald's failings cannot be hidden or ignored because they threaten us all.\" The White House has repeatedly dismissed the book as a money grab by the president's niece. \"The president describes the relationship he had with his father as warm and said his father was very good to him,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said earlier this month. \"He said his father was loving and not at all hard on him as a child. Also, the absurd SAT allegation is completely false,\" Matthews said, referring to a claim in the book that the president cheated on the SAT by paying someone else to take the exam on his behalf. The book, which was released Tuesday, is the second high-profile expose of the president this summer. In June, former national security adviser John Bolton won a legal battle to publish a review of his time at the president's right hand. Robert Trump, the president's younger brother, sought to have a court block Mary Trump's book release and her promotion of it. A New York judge on Monday freed Mary Trump from an existing gag order restricting her from discussing the book. A separate and earlier court ruling had already allowed the publishing house Simon & Schuster to move forward with producing the account. Mary Trump said that while she is not afraid to speak freely about her family history, she felt there were risks associated with talking about the president unfavorably. \"Realistically speaking, Donald has a position with which comes an enormous amount of power,\" she said in the Wednesday interview. \"He has a following which has proven to be fairly fanatical. And from what I've seen, anybody who comes forward to speak truth to power or fulfill their obligations to uphold and defend the Constitution, if that clashes with Donald's agenda, they do not fare well.\" \"It's a very divisive world we're living in at the moment. And I understand that what I'm doing will be misinterpreted \u2014 sometimes willfully misinterpreted. And I just need to be careful.\" Mary Trump also offered her opinion of the president's mental fitness. \"If you're in a room with him for two minutes and you're paying attention, you know that he's not doing well,\" she alleged. \"Psychologically, he's absolutely unfit. Emotionally, psychologically, he is absolutely unfit.\" Mary Trump did not speak in an official capacity as a psychologist. Mental health professionals typically refrain from diagnosing public figures they have not examined. Asked whether she would be backing her uncle in the upcoming Nov. 3 general election, Mary Trump said she would support former Vice President Joe Biden.",

One of the oldest traditions in American politics is \"running against Washington,\" which has been a common campaign theme since the city was first created as the capital and the home of the federal government. In fact, candidates for president and Congress have found running against Washington one of the surest ways to get there. Some do it to stay there, too. Take for example Ronald Reagan, whose talk of the \"puzzle palace on the Potomac\" drew on the tradition and amplified it.  For years, Reagan repeated a stock joke about the nine most feared words in the language: \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\" Reagan displaced Jimmy Carter, who himself had been elected as an outsider in 1976 to clean house following the Watergate scandal. Not long after Reagan we got Bill Clinton in 1992, yet another governor with no taint of Washington, followed by two more two-term presidents who had spent minimal time in the capital and could plausibly pose as outsiders. Yet now we may be in a new phase of this phenomenon as the candidate running most vehemently against Washington is also the city's most prominent resident. Surely President Trump in 2016 was as skilled and effective at this line of politicking as any candidate in memory. He made a mantra of \"drain the swamp\" and let his crowds chant \"lock them up.\" Still, it raises eyebrows to hear him continue the assault as an incumbent seeking a second term. Trump's rallies are a way for the president to emphasize to his supporters that while he lives in Washington, he is not of Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Blanco/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump's rallies are a way for the president to emphasize to his supporters that while he lives in Washington, he is not of Washington. As political writer Matt Bai has noted in The Washington Post, Trump is acting as though he had nothing to do with his own government \u2013 dissociating himself from all that has gone wrong on his watch and even saying at one point: \"I don't take responsibility at all.\" Bai argues that Trump has never really seen himself as part of the government he supposedly leads and has \"already proved that governing interests [him] about as much as mold.\" At the same time, Trump has urgently invoked nonexistent privileges of office (\"Any conversation with me is classified\") and overstated his control of the military and even the governors of the states. (\"When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that's the way it's got to be. ... It's total, the governors know that.\") Trump has also elevated and empowered an attorney general in William Barr who has long espoused a vision of executive power as expansive as any since Alexander Hamilton's six-hour lecture on the subject at the Constitutional Convention. Trump is running not so much against specific parts of the government as against the idea of Washington, which is to say the idea that someone somewhere has a lot more power than you do and is using it against your best interests. That idea is deeply fixed, both in the rational workings of the American mind and in the untamed regions of American suspicion. This has relatively little to do with the actual city of Washington, a racially diverse community of 700,000 at the center of a metro area of 6.2 million. But it does help explain why the District of Columbia has not been made a state or allowed a voting member of Congress. The latest legislation attempting to do so was approved in the House of Representatives this week, but its chances in the Republican Senate are exactly nil. Were that to change, the White House hastens to assure us, Trump's advisers would recommend a veto. In one measure or another, generations of candidates have made their bones by bashing the capital \u2014 making it a symbol of something (or everything) they opposed. For some, the evil to be resisted has been oppressive or intrusive government. For others, the evil emanating from Washington has been socialism or, conversely, the collusion of government with capitalism. The idea of Washington has long been associated with a distant and disrespectful elite that had only its own selfish interests at heart. To some degree this sort of populist critique has also extended to Wall Street and the image of the fat-cat financier, mashing up that money madness with Washington's power hunger. But somehow that element of New York has never dimmed that city's allure in popular culture. Think of all the songs \u2014 indeed, entire musicals \u2014 that adore the Big Apple. Any come to mind romanticizing Washington in that way? Even the shows based in early American history, such as 1776 and Hamilton, celebrate other cities. When Washington does break into the movies it is rarely a pretty picture. In the 1939 classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Jimmy Stewart is the small-town hero and the cynical capital is the villain. A long parade of sequels, including Eddie Murphy's The Distinguished Gentleman and the Judy Holliday hit Born Yesterday sound similar themes. Another 1939 film about power myths was the endearing The Wizard of Oz, based on a 1900 children's story by L. Frank Baum that can be read as a populist allegory for the politics of its time. The Emerald City can be seen as a remote, fantastic capital fascinated with the greenback dollar at the end of the Yellow Brick Road (stand-in for the gold standard, measured in ounces, hence the Oz of the title). A lobby card from the 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz, based on a children's story that also served as a political allegory about the dangers posed by Washington to the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A lobby card from the 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz, based on a children's story that also served as a political allegory about the dangers posed by Washington to the country. Little Dorothy gets safely home to Kansas with the help of the Scarecrow (farmers) and the Tin Man (industrial workers) and a Cowardly Lion (William Jennings Bryan, the \"prairie avenger, mountain lion\" who was a populist icon and three-time presidential nominee). But the girl's true savior is her pair of silver slippers, a nod to the metal that was to rival gold in Bryan's bimetallist program. (Hollywood decided ruby slippers would be more cinematic.) Trump may not be a film buff, but he is surely steeped in the attitudes that made all these movies hits. He instinctively understands the contradiction: Americans want a commander in chief who signs bills into law and directs a bureaucracy of millions spending trillions, but who does so without embracing the system or becoming its prisoner. To paraphrase a verse from the Gospel of John, he is to be in that world but not of that world. For such a president, the prospect of running against Washington even as an incumbent is not just possible \u2013 it's mandatory. Can the contradiction be overcome? Plenty of congressmen and senators would answer yes because they've been doing it for years. As unpopular as Congress is, and has been, its incumbent members routinely win reelection (most of them easily). They do it in part by running against the institution wherein they serve \u2013 often in harsh terms \u2014 portraying themselves as grateful to stick close to home and get out of Washington. That's why even West Coast members of Congress fly home regularly for weekends and \"district work periods.\" It is why few now buy homes in the capital area or move their families there. They cannot risk appearing to have \"gone Washington.\" Trump is pursuing a version of this on a typically grand scale. It has less to do with loyalty to a state or district than with loyalty to a voting base. He is cementing his bond with his voters from 2016, hawking the same issues and pounding the same targets, almost as if the last four years had not happened. Once again, we will hear of a wall with Mexico and immigration in general. Bad trade deals. Allies who don't pay their \"fair share\" and don't buy American often enough.  His issues are generally not those that official Washington wants to talk about, which is why he wants to talk about them. Once again, we will see Trump define himself apart from all other efforts to define or restrain him.  That, too, is essential to his relationship with his base.  It is one reason he refuses to wear a mask, even as health officials and even some Republican senators reportedly urge him to do so at least sometimes. Issues of vanity aside, the mask has become an emblem of submission to experts and scolds and the nanny state \u2014 an emblem of submission to Washington. So the refusal to wear one becomes a badge of defiance, perhaps the most important to date. To give up on that score would suggest the swamp was draining him, rather than the other way around. In the months ahead, Trump the master showman will cast himself less as the head of the government and more as Washington's resident anti-government activist, presiding in form while disrupting in fact. The show is scheduled to run at least through the fall.",

A new survey has identified a group of persuadable voters dubbed \"guardian women\" who could decide which party wins key states like Michigan and the election.\n                \n                    \n                    JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People vote in Detroit during the March 10 Michigan primary. A new survey has identified a group of persuadable voters dubbed \"guardian women\" who could decide which party wins key states like Michigan and the election. The COVID-19 crisis has brought significant challenges for American women, increasing their burden of care and raising unemployment levels to greater numbers compared to men. As the general election inches closer, new polling shows that a subset of American women remain a wildcard, and they could be a crucial swing vote if the race for president gets close. The non-partisan group All In Together took a look at how the pandemic was affecting women's political views and their willingness to vote in November. They surveyed 1,000 women and found that over a quarter (26%) were swing voters. \"There is, again, a group of women that are on the fence, that have split their vote over the years, have gone back and forth between voting Democrat and Republican,\" said Lauren Leader, the CEO of All In Together. The group is referring to them as \"guardian women,\" defined as largely white, married and over 50 years old. The majority also live in suburban areas, have an income over $50,000 and do not have a college degree. Leader compares these women to the \"soccer moms\" and \"security moms\" observed in past campaign years. \"There have always been groups of women who are really split down the middle in terms of their political affiliation,\" Leader said. In 2012, these voters were divided almost evenly between President Obama (40%) and Mitt Romney (42%). In 2016, this group also split between Hillary Clinton (43%) and President Trump (41%). This new poll indicates that former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a small lead (46%) with \"guardian women,\" compared to Trump (42%). \"Guardian women\" are identified as a group of mostly white, married, suburban women over 50. Data comes from a survey of 1,000 registered Democratic, Republican and independent voters. Conducted May 8-9, 2020 with a credibility interval of +/- 3 percentage points\n                \n                    \n                    All In Together/Emerson College Poll\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Guardian women\" are identified as a group of mostly white, married, suburban women over 50. Data comes from a survey of 1,000 registered Democratic, Republican and independent voters. Conducted May 8-9, 2020 with a credibility interval of +/- 3 percentage points While Biden may have a slight edge with this group for now, a significant portion (12%) said they were undecided. When pushed, the undecided voters lean towards Trump, giving the president a potential chance to win back the advantage among them. According to Leader, it may be worth a try since 85% say they are extremely likely to cast their ballots in the general election. \"These are women who are very likely to show up at the polls,\" Leader said, \"90% of them agreed that their vote matters now more than ever to make sure the United States goes in the right direction.\" In addition to the pandemic, these women are now also watching how candidates respond to racism and social unrest. To Susan J. Carroll, a political scientist at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, there's a through line for all of these groups of swing women voters. As they go back and forth in their political affiliation, these women are all looking for the same thing \u2014 security \u2014 for their families and their communities. Carroll says it started with \"soccer moms\" in the 1990s and then moved to \"security moms\" following the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"The idea was they were focused on their children,\" Carroll said referring to \"security moms.\" \"But this time they were focused on ... keeping their children safe and their family safe,\" she added. While the top security concern for the swing women voters following 9/11 was terrorism, like many voters \"guardian women\" want to protect their families from the pandemic and the recession, and it may be what motivates their decisions in November. The polling found that these voters are providing more care for parents and relatives than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, above what all women are experiencing. \"Guardian women\" are identified as a group of mostly white, married, suburban women over 50.

They are 85 years old and still in the same house that I grew up in,\" Lee said. \"I mean, thank goodness they're not in a nursing home or anything like that. But I mean, they do need help.\" Sandy Dailey is 74, lives in Nebraska and supported Trump in 2016. \"I definitely won't vote for him again,\" she said. \"He's just not a president. He's just not at all,\" Dailey added. Like other women and seniors who've stopped supporting Trump, Dailey points to the president's behavior during the pandemic and in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, who was killed by police in Minneapolis. \"He just comes up with some of the most off the wall things,\" Dailey said, referring to Trump's decision to take a picture holding a bible in front of St. John's Church near the White House shortly after a crowd of peaceful protesters was aggressively cleared out. \"I was thinking that maybe he was going to hold the Bible and say a prayer for our nation. I just didn't imagine it was for a photo shoot. I was so disappointed. It's just awful,\" she added. Terri Olsen, who manages a dental office in Onalaska, Wisc., voted for Trump in 2016, but now says she is undecided. Olsen says her main issue centers around the economic challenges brought on by the lockdown in response to COVID-19, an issue Trump has been pushing. \"I think that the shutdown of the country has devastated so many people, and it's going to for a long time. So I think it's very important for whoever is voted [in] is going to definitely do something about that,\" Olsen said. \"I think that shutting down everything was a mistake.\" Olsen believes that Trump would be better for the economy than Biden, but she takes issue with Trump's bullying style, a quality that has pushed her into the undecided column, among other things. \"The pandemic has kind of pushed me more to the middle. Rioting and that whole situation has pushed me more to the middle. I guess I still have time before the election, and I'm not sure what I'm looking for, but it just seems like everything is getting more divided. And I guess I'm looking for someone to unify us and to make me confident that they're going to do something about our economy,\" Olsen added. All In Together is planning to go back in the field later this month to survey women in the battleground states, where voters who share the demographics of the \"guardian women\" are an even larger percentage of the electorate. \"These women, I think, are going to be an incredibly important factor in November,\" Leader added, \"We need to watch them, we need to understand them, and we need to focus on those folks in the middle that are still trying to decide which way to go.\" Elena Moore contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Many politicians are skeptical about the power of their endorsement, but that's not slowing the pace of announcements ahead of Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In the old days of American politics, a single party boss could hold an iron grip on state politics, and their endorsement could make or break a political candidate. Those days are gone, yet 2020 presidential hopefuls still covet those local endorsements. From New Hampshire Public Radio's \"Stranglehold\" podcast, Jack Rodolico explains why. JACK RODOLICO, BYLINE: New Hampshire's longest-serving state senator is a Democrat. He's 81 years old. And his office is covered in photos, pictures that show a thin line between his personal and political life. LOU D'ALLESANDRO: My wife, my daughter, John Kennedy when he announced for the presidency in Manchester, N.H. RODOLICO: His name is Lou D'Allesandro. And peppered around the walls of his office are photos of him with powerful people - people you would not expect to be friends with someone this low down the national political food chain. D'ALLESANDRO: I pinch myself all the time. I walk into this building, I pinch myself and I say, I'm a New Hampshire state senator. How good does it get? How good does it get? I'm one lucky guy. RODOLICO: How lucky a guy is he? Think about this. Former President Bill Clinton once personally called D'Allesandro to ask him to back Hillary Clinton when she was running for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Lou D'Allesandro has been a friend of mine a long time, and I thank him very much for his support and his friendship. Thank you, Lou. RODOLICO: In the state Senate, D'Allesandro represents a chunk of Manchester, the biggest city in New Hampshire. It's a trove of voters in the first-in-the-nation primary state. And would-be Democratic hopefuls seek him out to get in front of those voters. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) D'ALLESANDRO: It is my privilege to introduce to you my friend, Senator John Edwards. And it is an honor and a privilege for me to introduce the United States senator from Delaware, Joseph Biden. RODOLICO: This time around, D'Allesandro has endorsed Biden. And so it's worth asking - can D'Allesandro deliver votes on primary day? JOSH ROGERS, BYLINE: I think it's an open question what local endorsements have ever meant to presidential campaigns. RODOLICO: This is my colleague here at NHPR, Josh Rogers. He's a political reporter who's now covering his fifth presidential primary. Josh says campaigns in 2020 have all sorts of digital tools - tools that reach way more voters than a speech by a local politico. And that leaves a more interesting question on the table. If the campaigns aren't getting much from these endorsements, what are the local endorsers getting? ROGERS: There is one very well-known Democratic Party activist who - my understanding, like, kept a moldy cookie from a Christmas party they attended at the White House on their kitchen counter. RODOLICO: This - this is a real thing. There are lots of politicos in New Hampshire whose offices and homes are filled with little mementos from presidential hopefuls, although as far as we know, there was only one with a moldy cookie from the White House. ROGERS: Moldy - it's in plastic. I do think that's in some way emblematic of our political culture prizing access with people running for president or people who become president and really kind of leave it there. RODOLICO: It is a heady experience getting personally courted by people who want to be president. Here's state Representative Kristina Schultz. KRISTINA SCHULTZ: Yeah. Phone calls, emails - I got a text from one of the candidates when I was in the hospital this summer. That was very nice. RODOLICO: It is nice, but it's not always an ego boost. Here's state rep Bob Backus on what endorsements like his bring to presidential campaigns. BOB BACKUS: Frankly, not much. RODOLICO: Yet local politicians still endorse. Democratic presidential campaigns keep flooding the inboxes of political reporters with long lists of endorsements. But you know who you won't find on any of those lists? This woman. EVA CASTILLO: We tend to be just used as a face. RODOLICO: Eva Castillo - she's an immigration activist. She has endorsed presidential candidates in the past. But she says she felt used by the campaigns, tokenized. CASTILLO: And so that's why I don't endorse anybody personally because I'm not the token anything for anybody. RODOLICO: State Representative Gerri Cannon has similar concerns but still sees power in her endorsement as a politician who's transgender. She endorsed Senator Cory Booker. GERRI CANNON: I said, I don't want them to overuse me as a transgender representative. On the other hand, I know that's important. There are transgender people that need to know they can stand up for a candidate. RODOLICO: So what do local politicos get from endorsing a presidential candidate? Maybe they elevate an issue close to their hearts. Maybe they're just flattered. I brought this all back to state Senator Lou D'Allesandro. I asked him, what does he get for his endorsement? D'ALLESANDRO: I got a great wife. I got a great family. What else can I ask for? What else could they give me that I don't have? RODOLICO: I mean, how do you put a value on face time with the most powerful people in American politics? For NPR News, I'm Jack Rodolico in Concord, N.H. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And he had help reporting that story from Josh Rogers and Casey McDermott of NHPR. They're part of the team that makes the podcast \"Stranglehold.\" Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

President Trump's accusers fell far short of proving wrongdoing or the case for removing him from office, defense attorneys told senators on Saturday as they opened their portion of the impeachment trial. The presentation by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his colleagues follows three days of opening arguments from House Democratic managers and marks the end of the first week of Trump's impeachment trial. The defense team promised to eviscerate the Democrats' arguments with their own evidence and said the bottom line is simply that Democrats and much of officialdom hate Trump. The case for removing a president for the first time in history and \"tearing up the ballots of all the states\" must be unquestionable, Cipollone said, and here, it isn't. \"They're asking you to do what no Senate has ever done \u2014 and they're asking you to do it with no evidence. And that's wrong,\" Cipollone said. He and Trump's other lawyers used the shorter weekend Senate session on Saturday to run what they called \"coming attractions\" for their defense of the president in the coming week. But Cipollone, lawyer Mike Purpura and Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said they could dismantle the House impeachment managers' case expeditiously. The attorneys wrapped their arguments in about two hours on Saturday. Trump acted within his powers all throughout the Ukraine affair; was consistent in the objections he raised about equal burden-sharing with Western European nations on Ukraine; and ultimately released aid frozen for Ukraine last year with no commitment by its leaders to do investigations Trump wanted, they said. \"The president was, at all times, acting in our national interest and upholding his oath of office,\" Purpura said. Trump's lawyers are expected to take full Senate trial sessions next week to amplify their points \u2014 although they've said they may not use all 24 hours they're granted under the rules. Then senators will have the opportunity to submit written questions for the parties. Some \u2014 as, for example, Maine's Independent Sen. Angus King \u2014 have been asking constituents what questions they should ask when that time comes. Over the course of these impeachment proceedings, I\u2019m drafting questions that I will ask to the House Managers and White House lawyers in the days ahead in order to help us get to the truth. I\u2019ve got some ideas of my own, but want to hear from Maine people \u2013 any suggestions? Legal focus Trump's attorneys on Saturday opened with what they called the factual and legal problems with Democrats' case. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for example, has said that he never felt pressured by Trump during the much-debated events of 2019, Purpura argued. None of Democrats' witnesses ever heard directly from Trump that he wished to exploit leverage over Ukraine in order to get Zelenskiy to conduct the investigations that Trump wanted, Purpura said. Lead manager Rep. Adam Schiff., D-Calif., and his compatriots rely too heavily on inference, supposition and extrapolation \u2014 not facts, Purpura argued. \"They try to overcome the devastating evidence against them by, apparently, claiming to be mind readers,\" he said. Another deputy counsel to Cipollone, Patrick Philbin, followed later in the day by taking on Article II of the Democrats' articles of impeachment, which alleges obstruction of Congress. In Philbin's telling, Schiff and Democrats were unwilling to accommodate Trump's valid concerns about protecting his privilege to solicit advice confidentially. Philbin also said that Democrats' subpoenas and requests for information in the Ukraine affair were invalid because they didn't follow what he called an appropriate vote by the full House to authorize its impeachment inquiry. Counteroffensive Trump's lawyers had been hinting before their window opened in the trial that they not only intended to defend the president but, in effect, turn the proceedings into impeachments of the FBI, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. There were hints about what's coming in that sense, including from Sekulow, who appeared to suggest that Trump's team plans to argue that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Sekulow also underscored findings about the Russia investigation that have embarrassed the FBI and the Justice Department. Some Republicans have sought to cast a newspaper op-ed and comments by Ukrainian officials critical of then-candidate Trump as, in effect, equal in magnitude to the historic wave of active measures launched by Russia in that election, including with cyberattacks and disinformation. During the House impeachment inquiry late last year, former national security council Russia specialist Fiona Hill put House Republicans on the defensive over what she called this false equivalence, which has its origins as a Russian government talking point seeking to eschew responsibility for the 2016 interference. Trump, however, took that narrative up and it partly underpinned his actions in the Ukraine affair. That has forced defenders to try to dance between the raindrops, both in the House and now in the Senate trial: They've sought both not to deny the reality of the Russian interference but also to underscore some Ukrainian officials' opposition to Trump at the time of the election. Loading... It isn't clear how much Sekulow might develop the Ukraine interference narrative in the coming days as an explanation for why Trump's desire for investigations might have been, in his view, reasonable. What was clear on Saturday was how much Sekulow, Cipollone and Philbin were prepared to focus specifically and personally on Schiff, whom they said was not a credible accuser because of his earlier role in the Russia imbroglio and because of what they called the unfair process he ran in the House. Dems: Now they want to negotiate? Schiff responded to the White House lawyers' criticism with a post on Twitter after the session. After listening to the President\u2019s lawyers opening arguments, I have three observations:They don\u2019t contest the facts of Trump\u2019s scheme.They\u2019re trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth.And they are continuing to cover it up by blocking documents and witnesses. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, said they heard the best justifications yet for new witnesses and evidence in the trial in the presentation \u2014 from the very White House that has declined to furnish them. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, for example, told reporters after the arguments that the administration itself easily could settle what Trump's attorneys called the facts in the Ukraine affair. It could, he said, permit officials to testify, including former national security adviser John Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Kaine scoffed at the White House lawyers' complaints about process and their emphasis on the right of cross-examination by observing that Trump had foreclosed the ability for his own aides to be cross-examined here. \"How dare they?\" Kaine said.",

Adam Schiff, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry Nadler and Hakeem Jeffries head toward the Senate chamber for the start of President Trump's impeachment trial Wednesday. Updated at 9:49 p.m. ET The matter before the Senate isn't just President Trump's conduct; it is no less than the fate of the Constitution and America's role in the world, House managers said on Wednesday. With the ground rules having been settled in the early hours after sometimes-bitter litigation between the House delegation and Trump's legal team, senators returned Wednesday afternoon to hear the formal opening of the case. Democrats are going first with 24 hours over three days to present their arguments for removing Trump from office. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., outlined the now-familiar Ukraine affair, in which the president is accused of holding up military aid in an attempt to get a political rival investigated. He returned to his earlier themes about the need for new witnesses and evidence \u2014 and exhorted senators in sometimes apocalyptic terms about the magnitude of this moment for the life of the Republic. \"If we don't stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our hand,\" he said. \"We have for generations been the shining city upon a hill that President Reagan described. America is not just a country but also an idea. But what worth is that idea if, when tried, we do not affirm the values that underpin it?\" Senators must bear in mind that in the Trump case, impeachment itself is on trial, Schiff said. Article 2 of the impeachment addresses what Democrats call Trump's obstruction of Congress. Schiff said if Trump is permitted to keep his office \u2014 even after barring witnesses from talking to Congress and withholding documents \u2014 the Senate will have given away its power to hold presidents accountable. \"There's no guarantee that this democracy that has served us so well will continue to prosper,\" he said. Trump's attorneys will have time later in the trial to offer a rebuttal. In the meanwhile, lawyer Jay Sekulow repeated some of the White House's complaints about Schiff and Democrats to reporters during breaks in the trial. Foreign implications At the beginning of hours' worth of presentations, Schiff also warned that an acquittal would serve as a signal to nations abroad, too. Authoritarian regimes such as Russia would take comfort in the accumulation of power in the presidency and its concomitant loss by Congress, he said. Then there are the more immediate geopolitics. The strategy pursued by the United States to help Ukraine against Russia and Russian-backed forces is the correct one, Schiff said, and Trump's freeze last year cast that into doubt. Further doubt about American commitments will result if Trump keeps his office, he argued. \"This isn't charity. It's about our defense as much as Ukraine,\" he said. If the Senate doesn't remove Trump for having imperiled that commitment, Schiff said, Moscow would reap a geopolitical victory in Europe through the loss of faith in American support for its allies. No thaw over witnesses or evidence Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters during a break that he thought Schiff's remarks were a \"tour de force\" and that he hoped the congressman's eloquence would break the logjam with Republicans over admitting new witnesses and evidence into the Senate trial. Schiff and his compatriots did allude to evidence about the Ukraine affair that has surfaced since the House voted to impeach Trump last month, including a trove of material connected to an aide of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But there was no sign that Tuesday's marathon series of motions by Schumer to admit witnesses and evidence, as Democrats wish, had made any dent in the resolve of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., or the majority. McConnell has given ground slightly on admitting the House's evidentiary record and has held open the possibility of allowing witnesses and documents later on. But it seemed unlikely that any Republicans had been further swayed by the presentation on Wednesday. \"I didn't hear anything new, at all,\" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wy. \"This was an effort ... in a partisan way, to bring a case against President Trump because they weren't happy with the results of the 2016 election.\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, another Republican, told reporters he blamed the impeachment on a political gambit by Democrats not to try to remove Trump but to put Republican senators in potentially competitive states such as Colorado and Maine, in a jam. \"What we've seen is just a rehashing of yesterday's charges,\" Scott said. \"The goal of this entire process is ... to create an opportunity for them to try to overtake the Senate.\" Free-flowing river For now, as the hours unreeled on Wednesday and the main action of the trial got underway, it began to feel like the old-fashioned editions of Sports Center \u2014 similar stories told and retold, often with the same highlights, in slightly different ways over a day or night's worth of programming. Schiff and his colleagues \u2014 Reps. Jerry Nadler, Jason Crow, Sylvia Garcia, Val Demings, Hakeem Jeffries and Zoe Lofgren \u2014 each elaborated in ways of their own on the basic themes of the Ukraine affair. Demings alluded once more to her tenure as the chief of police in Orlando. Crow told senators about taking fire in Afghanistan when he was deployed there with a special operations unit \u2014 and about the importance of the counterbattery radars that alerted the American troops about incoming artillery. Congress also furnished those kinds of systems to Ukraine, Crow said, and so he could appreciate how much the Ukrainians might have been upset when they worried about the hold in assistance last year. \"This is not a theoretical exercise ... and the Ukrainians know it,\" Crow said. The milk matter Before adjourning just before 10 p.m., the Democrats often quoted from the same documents and referred to the same TV clips, including of Trump at the White House or in interviews. Anecdotes from the House investigation were repeated more than once by different presenters. The Senate, all the while, continued to settle in for the unusual tableau of a chamber in which all members are present, seated at their desks \u2014 and silent. A protester interrupted the proceedings not long after 6 p.m. as Jeffries was speaking but was ejected by Capitol Police. Some senators appeared to take intense notes. At least one \u2014 Kentucky Republican Rand Paul \u2014 appeared to at least one observer to be solving a crossword puzzle. Scenes from the Senate floor:Sen Mike Lee was fiercely taking notes through Schiff's remarks, at one point having to stop to massage the palm of his writing hand Sen Rand Paul, extremely focused as well.. but on a crossword puzzle, hidden not so discretely between his papers Other senators coped with the hour upon hour of presentations by invoking one of the few privileges that remain available to them under the rules in force for the trial: a glass of milk. Only milk and water are permitted. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., was observed drinking a glass of milk, as was Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, who cracked wise about it on Twitter during a break \u2014 senators may not use their phones during the trial \u2014 but they may get treats from the Senate's \"candy desk,\" as Cotton evidently did. It\u2019s true, I had some milk with my chocolate.I guess I could\u2019ve added vodka & had a White Russian (minus the Kahlua). But @RepAdamSchiff probably would\u2019ve accused me of collusion. https://t.co/JY4ca2oMUe Another big change in the tenor of the Senate was represented in Burr's ankles \u2014 which were not visible. Burr, who typically does not wear socks irrespective of the weather on Capitol Hill, chose instead to wear them for the session on Wednesday.

            "article_content": "On the first day of December in the year of our collective dread 2020, my editor called me to have the annual conversation. How, Jacob wanted to know, do you plan to write about this year in music? Our back-and-forth fluctuated between the general  \u2014 NPR Music was about to publish its lists of 2020's best songs and albums \u2014 and the personal. He talked about listening to sad disco while taking long summer runs in upstate New York. I confessed that while I'd marveled at the women rappers, Black country singers and pop-star androgynes who'd made social media fun, all I'd wanted to do most nights in Nashville was put on headphones and listen to a folkie whisper in my ear. Our talk of bests, our generalizations and volleyed opinions, felt heartwarmingly familiar. But then he asked me a question that jarred me out of that comfort zone. \"When you look back later, what will this year's music mean to you?\" he asked. \"Assuming there will be a later. And apart from, you know, everything.\" Everything: the pandemic, the political crisis, the crashing economy, the fact that since the first week of March I hadn't seen a concert or shouted to a friend above the blaring music in a bar, or caught the eye of a stranger humming a Perfume Genius song in the coffee shop, or sung along to anything with anyone besides, when she'd let me, my teenage daughter blasting the Ramones in the kitchen. Jacob was asking me to make the imaginative leap out of 2020's crushing confusion into a clearer atmosphere, where hierarchical terms like \"Number One\" and \"most influential\" alight. Up there I could do the critic's usual job of determining what in my particular field will have lasting significance. I realized in that moment that I couldn't ascend into that space, didn't want to try. Significance. The word comes from the Latin \u2014 favorite subject of my daughter, doing virtual high school downstairs in the den. It means \"meaning,\" but also \"energy,\" the spark that runs through the universe. As a critic, I try to determine how that energy moves from artists to listeners and sometimes, renewing itself, onward through time. Prince or the philosopher Roland Barthes might have said that a critic is fundamentally a sign reader, though more like a Tarot card interpreter or a translator than a traffic cop. I strive to respect all the different ways sound can signify while making a case for my own interpretations. This year, though, the signs sputtered and buzzed, short-circuiting. 2020 was the year of fake news, of an invisible plague, of economic spirals and looming natural disasters. Some people fell heavy beneath these dissembling challenges; many experienced them from a looming distance, warnings coming through garbled lines. COVID-19 claimed hundreds of thousands of victims hidden behind closed doors. Unemployment left millions idle, yet the stock market still rose, fueled by the continued success of corporations profiting even as so many suffered. Fires raged on the West Coast and floods sunk whole towns in the South, yet these cataclysms rarely registered on the news, shut out by frantic reactions to the President's latest Twitter tirade. The nation's leaders claimed to be underdogs, acted like interlopers, called for trust and offered lies. The citizenry spat and swore across electrical-fence divides. Musicians have suffered in specific and drastic ways. In the air, the virus rendered live concerts a menace, canceled tours, made even gathering in recording studios risky business. Yet they continue to work, some fighting writers' block and others hysterically prolific. Reports have come from music fans, too, about emotional swings, dry periods and surprising impulses. I know people who've only listened to songs from 20 years ago and others who've devoted weeks to learning whole new genres or the catalogs of greats. Myself? I went through every phase, rapid-fire \u2014 two weeks of almost nothing but Stevie Wonder; distracted hours spent jumping among weirdly named playlists on various streaming platforms; immersing myself in new albums by old favorites and feeling saved, but then putting them aside, unable to concentrate on anything longer than the latest pop song. Time keeps stretching and collapsing. The other day I pulled out my favorite album from freshman year in high school. Hello, Andy Gibb. Tomorrow I might decide the only thing worth thinking about is TikToks of teenagers dancing to Bad Bunny. My listening patterns form no coherent storyline. Communication has become so difficult anyway. My mask covers my face as I try to be friendly at the grocery store. Online, freezing screens and overloaded circuits fuzz my words. I miss being close to open mouths.  Music makes me yearn for what feels lost: a whisper pushing breath onto my neck, a voice singing loud into a crowd yelling back at it. In my solitude, though, recordings become a lifeline. Spending time with music has never felt more private, a way of both sheltering from and mediating the noise from outside. At the same time, the sound always takes me somewhere; it's often the only way I hear a stranger's voice on any given day. See what I'm getting at? Nothing's got just one meaning. In a year crowded with contradictions, music's way of enhancing emotion can feel clarifying, or it can overwhelm. Like every other form of information, music is reaching people through static-filled channels, distorted, muffled, feeding back. The only reasonable thing a critic can do right now is recognize that reality and consider how it's affected her own ears, her own thinking process. Don't ask me for answers, I thought, when Jacob brought up the future. I'm just one sign reader among many. Every day is a mess of unknowns. \"We take the staff's temperature every morning,\" the dentist-office receptionist says to me right before I cancel my appointment, deciding that's not enough for me to take a chance. The health anxiety I've fought against for years now envelops the nation; everybody's wondering about that little tickle in the throat, the unthinking behavioral slip-up. Attempts to understand what's happening have become more like tics, like games. People count the cars in each others' driveways to determine the safety of their neighborhoods, consult risk-assessment charts whose grid lines jump like never-ending heart attacks. To relax, people turn to astrology or gesture at each other using the semaphore of memes. So, generalizations, opinions, what's the point? Trying to write about music as it's reached me in 2020, I need to put aside these critics' comforts. I'm hanging out with my garbled self, within the self-generated distortions and feedback loops shaping any insight I might claim. Fred Moten, the philosopher, poet and music head who became a Macarthur Fellow this year, has written about how consciousness can be both internal and interstitial, invaded by the world around it, the \"uncontainable outside.\" I can't claim to be part of the Black American experience at the heart of Moten's thinking, but his words echo as I've sought a way to write from unresolved experience instead of reaching for something more solid. I think this might also be a way to live now: to refuse any fixed conclusions, remaining, to paraphrase jazz-head Moten, \"in the break,\" the slippery space in which comprehension falls apart, reconstitutes itself, becomes its own improvisation. What I offer here is an account of such attempts. Call it the diary of a plague year. Or, as Jacob called it after our melancholic conversation, of a fugue year. In a psychological fugue state, a person loses herself to the noise of the outside world. In a musical fugue, disparate melodic lines interweave to form a whole that never settles. Both definitions suit my 2020, my life of seeking signs. I have a photograph of a sign in my camera roll from the day the pandemic unofficially hit home \u2013 March 11, when the NBA postponed its season, America's sweetheart Tom Hanks reported he'd contracted the virus and people in Nashville started talking about a shutdown. The sign just said, PRAY. No bigger than a handbill, it  was tacked to a utility pole in North Nashville, where I'd gone to try to buy toilet paper, which was already illogically flying off every grocery store's shelves. I pulled over and snapped a shot. Never even posted it anywhere. I'd just look at it from time to time. A sign saying PRAY is hardly novel in the Jesus-loving South, but this one struck me. Usually I'd see the word either in 10-foot-tall letters and surrounded by Bible quotes heralding the apocalypse or in front of one of East Nashville's new non-denominational churches, part of a dumb joke. You know, Jesus fed the multitudes, we have Taco Tuesdays. Eat carnitas and PRAY! But this little missive didn't have any frame. Just the word, hand-stenciled and filled with what looked like tempera paint. PRAY. When I looked at the picture later I could see a little airbrushed cross, but at the time the word seemed unfettered by creed, dogma or other directives. The sign took me into myself. When I think of the word PRAY, unadorned, I think of my father. Growing up in the Depression in a huge Irish Catholic family, he learned to pray under the hands of his stern mother and the nuns of St. Anne's Parish in Seattle. There are photos of him and his brothers, shirt tails halfway out of their trousers, leaning against each other in front of my grandmother's clapboard house. When he was cute and curly-mopped, I imagine, my father approached praying as a family obligation, head down stifling a laugh in the church pew. My dad learned to pray again, though, when he was eighteen. He'd been shoved into a troop carrier, then walked across most of France, ending up in a village quickly becoming rubble, where he faced soldiers who resembled all those brothers of his and was wounded while delivering his own lethal blows. He returned to Seattle with a rosary in his pocket. He never spoke of the war. For the rest of his life, he dealt with chronic pain from the shrapnel in his leg; he drank. Prayer became the way he could speak, only to himself, about what had happened. My father loved music. He had a solid Irish voice you could almost call a tenor, and he'd take my brother and me in his arms and sing his favorites, songs that made us, cheap dates, giggle and sob. One was called \"The Whiffenpoof Song.\" We are poor little lambs who have lost our way, baaa baaa baaa. Like prayers, songs like these also spoke the unspeakable, the tender side of a man who sometimes lost it, sometimes seemed transported back to the fields where he had faced others' guns and had to wield his own. Every week at Mass I would see him turn his head down to stave off the deep fatalism always with him on a low hum, closing his eyes as he listened to the words offered the Virgin: Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. And often in the evenings as we all watched the singer brightly standing in the spotlight on the Lawrence Welk or Carol Burnett show, I'd also feel him getting quieter, calming down. Tiny Bubbles.  In the wine, make me happy... make me feel fine. From glancing at my father I learned that to pray is to listen; his love of music taught me that to listen is to pray. I don't remember what was on the radio on March 11, when I pulled over and took that photograph of the little sign. I do know that in the early days before anybody knew a goddamn thing, I turned to old songs like litanies. Find a handwashing song, the experts said, one you can sing for 20 seconds while you scrub. Mine was Rod Stewart's \"Maggie May\" \u2014 a rock chestnut completely inappropriate in 2020, with its macho swagger and casual attitude about emotional abandonment. I've always loved it, though, and now I knew why: Singing to a lover about how he's sure to leave as soon as he gets up the energy, Stewart is completely certain about his uncertainty, comfortable in radical ambiguity. That's a lesson for living with an unknown threat. No church in that song, sorry Dad, I thought as I squirted Softsoap onto my palms. There wouldn't be any praying in my 2020, it turned out, as the antipathy religion motivated in others made me wonder where God really was. But I had an invocation at least. \"All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand,\" Rod sang. The bubbles swirled in the sink. Everybody has a before story. Less than a month after the pandemic officially changed things, I noticed people starting to perfect their remembrances of recent dinners out or trips taken, using airy brushstrokes to capture the familiar as it faded into the rear view. A strange nostalgia descended, more like an anxious attempt to grasp the meaning of loss. I miss hugs. My dog's the only one who's seen me in five weeks. All I want is a dry martini served by a good-looking bartender. Before stories offered a way to pay tribute to the pleasures of the disrupted everyday. My friends, mostly music fiends, set their before stories at concerts, dance parties, and karaoke hangs. Mine fit right in. Five days before lockdown I'd driven the 15 minutes from my house to the Ryman Auditorium to see Ruston Kelly. A headlining gig at the Ryman is an ultimate marker of arrival for Nashville musicians, especially singer-songwriters with any kind of country lean; for Kelly, a much-loved Music Row songwriter whose bumpy recovery from addiction coincided with his emergence as an artist in his own right, it played even sweeter than for most. He had a great new album almost ready to release and was ending a long tour in his hometown with the fans who treasured him most. With his dad on pedal steel and his sister singing backup, Kelly sang his laconic heart out. Friends came out and briefly joined the band, including his wife Kacey Musgraves, whose star had ascended a little faster than his but who modulated her presence that night to let him shine. \"I never took for granted all the love in my life,\" Kelly sang in his weeper \"Brave,\" and a feeling pinged through the crowd: gratitude. We grabbed onto that feeling not because of the future we couldn't anticipate on that first Friday in March, but because of what Nashville had just endured. A few days earlier a tornado had ripped across the city with the typical mercilessness of Southern weather. Hundreds lost their homes and businesses. The morning after that terrifying night, thousands more walked out into the neighborhoods to pick up rubble, distribute food and make sure people were safe. The hugs exchanged in the Ryman lobby before Kelly played his set communicated the vulnerability and fellow feeling Nashville relied on right then. The phrase \"mutual aid,\" in the air after the storm, would change meaning in the months to come as GoFundMe pages became ubiquitous among the musicians' community and the free store the punk rockers opened on Dickerson distributed winter squash and paper goods to those in need, but no one could know that then. Kelly's show was one for the books, a special evening. It felt like that at the time, but also like just another night out in a town where music is atmosphere. Prayer of remembrance: For months afterward, I left my Ryman ticket stub from on my Mazda dashboard as the car got grimier, rarely leaving the driveway. It reminded me of that night, the edifying pleasure of watching someone stroll into their dream's high point. By midsummer Kelly's album Shape and Destroy would be out, his marriage to Musgraves entering the separation phase. The fading stub was my signpost from the land of the taken for granted. It allowed me entry into a memory I never imagined would matter so much. In April I started to notice signs around my neighborhood. My daughter's March spring break had never ended; she sat at home, her plans for a New York vacation and a summer job dashed. As a diversion she turned back to the video games she'd last loved when she was in middle school. Minecraft. The Sims. Build a world not wrecked like this one. Nashville's honky-tonks went quiet as residents sheltered under a \"safer at home\" order. Music festivals that would have taken me across the country fell by the wayside one by one. My husband and I walked our little dog through northern East Nashville every morning and evening, our route around the block expanding into miles-long treks. We cultivated neighborliness with other walkers a street's-width apart, a wave and a smile, our only connection to others that wasn't mediated by a screen. Our family members who lived in the early hot zones of Seattle and Long Island managed their movements even more carefully. We canceled our reunions and learned how to Zoom with them, negotiating a feeling of impending doom. Spring got hotter, headed toward summer. Graduation announcements dotted yards everywhere \u2014 Home To a Proud Dan Mills Fourth Grader! Congratulations Jacobi, Hume-Fogg Class of 2020! These signs didn't harbor memories; they were surrogates. They delivered the first emotional fruits of what everyone was starting to call the new normal. Music people made their own substitutions. The album release calendar shriveled up, becoming a list of maybe-laters. Early experiments with live-streaming felt awkward and poignant, especially those dedicated to keeping alive the cultural meccas no one ever had imagined would be imperiled. Legendary clubs face the prospect of permanent closure. WWOZ in New Orleans hosted a virtual Jazzfest featuring archived sets, including some from legends no longer living; folks who hadn't missed that fest in 20 years tuned in worldwide and posted pictures of the gumbo simmering in their kitchens. The Metropolitan Opera's gala featured divas and divos recording themselves at home on phones attached to shaky tripods; fans sat rapt, straining to see what books Bryn Terfel in Wales or Renee Fleming in Virginia had on their shelves. Stephen Sondheim's 90th birthday felt like one of those family Zoom calls that starts out shaky \u2014 host Raul Esparza couldn't get the tech to work \u2014 but ended up with everybody laughing and crying and wishing it could last all night. I chatted about it online with pals from my high school drama club days. Meryl sang with Audra and Christine! Bernadette did \"No One is Alone!\" Isolation still felt poignant then. Not yet sunk into its own chasm of skyrocketing COVID cases and denialism, America saw this crisis as something it  shared with the rest of the world. The biggest virtual concert of that spring was One World: Together At Home, co-organized by Lady Gaga to benefit the World Health Organization. I dipped in and out of such livestreams, noticing how the weird flat openness of unfamiliar platforms allowed for fans to feel they could suddenly interact with their favorites on a first-name basis, even though Gaga and Elton and Macca were farther away than ever, protected much more than the average person by invisible walls of wealth. The vital exchange between musicians and fans that can only happen in person was one of the pandemic's first casualties. Listening took on the feeling of a s\u00e9ance. Is this what it's like, I wondered, to live in a haunted place? As Nick Tosches once wrote, recorded music always opens a portal to the places where dead voices gather. In the quarantine spring, living people became apparitions to each other and it increasingly felt like there'd never be a chance to solidify connections again. The loss tilted my equilibrium. Then, into this morphing environment came Fetch the Bolt Cutters, Fiona Apple's first album in eight years. What a blast of life! Everyone was so ready. The elusive, beloved singer-songwriter fingerspelled \"my album is done\" in a Tumblr post in March; a couple weeks later, a video of one of her dogs playing in the Venice surf near her home served as a happy warning that new tunes would arrive soon. Then came April 17, and everyone I knew dropped everything \u2014 as if we had anything to drop \u2014 to listen to this clattering, clamoring, recklessly immediate set. \"Kick me under the table if you want!\"  Apple sang. \"I won't shut up!\" Her voice reached me as if it were cutting through a crowd \u2014 a feeling I hadn't realized I'd missed so much. Hardly the hermit her long absence from the stage had made her out to be, in these songs Apple showed the improvisatory confidence of a motormouth, freely versing tough words for old lovers and guffaws for friends and lighting bolts of insight. Three core musicians matched and helped organize her racket, with each song growing up from rhythms that felt, as I listened, like they might be coming from my own body. This record made me remember bodies! Her pups barked in the background. Joy. Prayer of communion: Apple, the notorious semi-recluse, had created Fetch the Bolt Cutters at home, turning her sanctuary into not just a recording studio but an instrument. For months she and her collaborators marched around chanting and banging on the walls, tapped out code on wastebaskets. Fetch the Bolt Cutters is a record of four people forgetting their separate identities in favor of something unique to their interaction. A pandemic pod from before the term existed. Apple is a strong individualist, but I think people went mad for this music because it was communal and it came from inside the house. Here was relative isolation transmogrified into a big world. The clamor of a family dancing with its high school graduate in the living room. It put flesh on the bones of ghosts. This disease was real and soon touched nearby. Just days after the Ruston Kelly concert that was my last, nearly 2,000 people crammed into the Marathon Music Works nightclub to raise tornado relief funds and be rewarded by a show featuring more than a dozen of Nashville's favorite artists \u2014 Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, Brandi Carlile, Yola, Sheryl Crow. I almost went myself, but for some reason my usually incautious husband urged me to stay home. Four friends, maybe five, who did attend started having COVID symptoms not long after that show. This was frightening. Only a few weeks later came the first COVID fatality to shake my extended circle of music lovers. Adam Schlesinger, one of the most admired members of the indie rock-raised singer-songwriter crowd I'd lived around in New York in the '90s, was in a coma, the rumors said. Then he was gone. Had a day passed? The sudden death of an acquaintance over 50 (Schlesinger was 52) is not unusual; many musicians and writers live hard, without a safety net. But the fear was rising. Was this one departure a signal of a coming deluge? Others were already testing positive. One reported positive test worried people around me more than most. John Prine was Nashville music's favorite uncle: a mentor, a delightfully acerbic voice, a genius who'd drink vodka and ginger ale with any young songwriter seeking his counsel. And still making great music at 73. With two cancer bouts in his past, he was in the PROTECT AT ALL COSTS category. But COVID, everyone quickly learned, did not care about our feelings. On April 7, two weeks after he entered Vanderbilt Hospital unable to breathe well, he died. The city reeled. The mural within which he still gazed out at us, affixed to the wall of Grimey's Records \u2014 became a shrine, covered in flowers. Prine's death felt like a turning point, marking a new level of endangerment and of bereavement.  Yet COVID'S toll on American music didn't unfold the way people thought it would. While the virus has no morals, its trajectory further exposed the fault lines in a system deeply deteriorating.  We lost elders, but not the superstars for whom I and many other music writers hastily wrote advance obituaries. Instead, the players who often operated at the center of American's music history but not its economy \u2014  elders and a significant number of younger people who'd never gained fame's privileges but were treasured within their communities \u2014 suffered alongside the thousands of essential workers whose stories define the pandemic's history on the ground. Jazz was gutted. New Orleans music suffered irreparable blows. House DJs and cult-favorite rappers left the earth. It became inarguably clear that the lineages less valued within popular music's money-making sectors would be the most affected by this scourge, just as Black and brown Americans in general were suffering more than their better-insured and sequestered white counterparts. Musicians themselves were the ones who carried the souls of these elders and peers beyond death. Prayers of lamentation: These offerings served as a kind of kaddish for their own working lives, too. Live performance sustained them, money-wise and heart-wise, and suddenly it had become impossible. So they did what mourners do, creating rituals that called toward spirits lost. In New Orleans, the city that for me most vividly embodies American music, friends noted the strange silence: the raucous, street-packing jazz funerals that cleansed the dead with revelry and sent them onward, were banned. But musicians found ways. When beloved pianist and scene father Ellis Marsalis died, the calliope player Debbie Fagano filled the Mississippi river with the elder's favorite tunes, playing them on her lonely floating keyboard. After the deaths in his close circle mounted into the double digits, trombone player Winston Turner told a few members of his band the Brass-A-Holics to put on their dark suits and gather six feet apart in City Park to play the African-American national anthem, \"I'll Fly Away.\" Unannounced and fleeting, such acts elegized people, but also the familiar ways of music-making itself. \"While we were out there, people understood what we were doing,\" Turner said in one account I read. \"There were a number of people gathered and just crying.\" Nashville's singer-songwriters, meanwhile, lovingly constructed a new virtual songbook of John Prine covers. I've noticed, as the months of mourning build upon themselves, that Prine's songs have become a vehicle for those of us who loved his music to process ongoing loss. His sad songs serve one purpose, dwelling on the importance of really seeing others' suffering clearly; his funny ones, another, modeling resilience. Prine always told jokes with a melancholy streak and broke hearts in a way that could include a laugh; that's why, months later, musicians are still grieving inside that songbook. \"That's the way that the world goes round, one minute you're up the next you're down,\" Miranda Lambert sang, playing Prine's own custom-made guitar during a benefit for the financially flagging Country Music Hall of Fame in October, a season after he departed. Prine's will was this goodwill, I thought as I watched Lambert on YouTube, the smile crossing her face in conversation with the trace of a tear. Over the months it had become clear that the music world's pain would be just like every other corner's: inestimable, ongoing, hard to track. But there were these melodies and words to repeat. Hold on to a memory, preserve yourself. As time went on, people tried to reach out to each other in any way. We wore out the quarantime's new favorite sign of affection, thumbs on phones: virtual hug. One friend confided that she'd taken to late-night Tinder assignations. The kids down the block stained the sidewalk with overly cheery chalk drawings of rainbows, flowers, slightly desperate expressions of the failing truism every little thing is going to be all right. What was happening to us, more hyperconnected than ever within a global disaster, yet so divided, not only by necessity but by our responses to the crisis? Nashville is a tourist town, where the embrace of strangers represents not only the community's best open-hearted intentions but the economy's hungry need. When viral videos appeared showing downtown honky-tonks packed to the brim with revelers, my friends became the NIMBY's we never thought we would be. THIS IS SHOCKING, I yelled through my laptop keyboard in the mayor's vague direction. MAKE IT STOP. Meanwhile, so many of those people I love, their incomes tied to live music production, sat waiting for their unemployment checks. I have always believed that music is one of the most powerful forces available for collapsing social distance, and that when that happens, miracles abound: slow dances and mosh pits, 10,000 out of tune fans massacring a pop anthem blares or roomful of ears leaning in close to hear a jazz pianist brush the keys. Those moments unite as surely as any kiss. Now, with the virus everywhere, it felt like music was inciting violence. People thrived as much as they could, interpersonally. My small family walked around inside the house, laughing over the same dumb in-jokes and arguing over the chores list as we did before each other was all we had. I engaged in these familiar practices unthinkingly, then sometimes purposefully. Random embraces in the hallway became a reminder of how lucky we were. Into this suspension and transformation of intimacy came some music, sometimes, that recreated the feeling of opening up to someone new. I found myself crying quietly into my dishtowel as I cleaned up after dinner, listening to singer-songwriters making offerings of their heartache. Jess Cornelius: \"When we met I used to make you laugh. Then we lost the baby and it broke my heart.\" Lucinda Williams: \"Down past bottom rolling harder than a stone, I can't remember any good times I've known.\" Ashley Ray, singing to her mother after her father's death: \"Can't take it up to heaven, mama, can't you see that it's just a house.\" Arlo Parks, to a friend on the edge: \"Just take your medicine and eat some food, I'd do anything to get you out of your room.\" Taylor Swift, to a childhood love she'll never see again: \"Please picture me in the weeds, before I learned civility.\" These songs sounded like intercessions, prayers to household saints. \"I hate living by the hospital, the sirens go all night,\" sang Phoebe Bridgers on her album Punisher, the album to which I kept returning as the blue evenings grew longer. More than any other voice on the sad-song playlist that I built, I was drawn to hers, to its catch, that I'm-just-gonna-say-this flow. Bridgers writes as if she's telling somebody she loves a dream she had about them, trying to make her subconscious yearning and disturbing impulses clear. In a dream, she recalls, you touch my leg, and I insist, but I wake up before we do it. Trying to reach somebody has always felt like a big risk. A hand on a knee. Remember? I will wait for the next time you want me like a dog with a bird at your door, Bridgers sings. The animal is still within me, within all of us. Virtual hug. In May, the signs in my neighborhood started proliferating differently. Those marking personal achievements and simply trying to be friendly remained \u2014 one popped up in a yard at the edge of my daily walk, offering a free \"clean\" queen bed to anyone who'd call this number \u2014 but next to them were ones reflecting loyalties and concerns extending beyond our three-mile radius. \"Support Essential Workers,\" said one decorated with cartoon images of doctors and nurses; another, hand-drawn with the magic-marker outline of a guitar in the corner, pleaded, \"Save Live Music.\" Here and there I'd run across a political marker whose presence predated the pandemic: a dark rectangle cut horizontally by a white stripe and holding the neatly stacked words \"Black Lives Matter.\" After May 26, the day 17-year-old Darnella Frazier's phone video recording of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers broke across social media and people took to the streets in rage, those signs, like the protests, multiplied. I live in north Inglewood on the east side of Gallatin Avenue, a quiet corner of the eternally gentrifying East Nashville. My block is mostly, though not entirely, occupied by white families ranging in age from baby-boomer to millennial. Here the Black Lives Matter signs multiplied quickly, often in the more liberal-universalist version that expands or dilutes the message, depending on your viewpoint.  LOVE IS LOVE, EVERY WOMAN IS A FEMINIST, SCIENCE IS REAL and so forth. Some neighbors hand-lettered placards with more individualized messages \u2014 closer to the stately Riverside Drive, one read, \"Complacency Keeps Racists In Power,\" while at the block's other edge, where duplexes dominate, the messages were blunter: \"Defund the Police,\" \"Racism Kills.\" We put one of those namby-pamby, all-inclusive signs in our own front yard, letting it do the talking for us while others we knew marched. The strictures of my mainstream-journalist job required avoiding partisan stances. Inside, at my desk, I wondered how to act. At first I tried to continue my usual work, looking to history for context as the cries of protest built into a reckoning that encompassed every corner of American culture. Soon, I began thinking I should just step back. Sometimes only your silence can make space for others, I told myself. But this was tough. Every critic loves the sound of her own voice \u2013 that's a swimmer loving water \u2013 and an ego wrestling with a conscience makes for a downright ugly match. I mostly stopped writing. My dad reappeared in my daydreams as I tried to face down my own defensiveness and despondency, reminding me that pride is the seed of all sins. I looked up what others have said about that human flaw and wrote one sermonizer's words my notebook: \"Pride slides its arm around our neck every time we place ourselves above someone else in an attitude of judgement or condemnation, a violation of our rightful place, side-by-side with all our fellow men.\" This image of pride as a choke-hold struck me, echoing the voices of protestors chanting George Floyd's final words: \"I can't breathe.\" Inequity spiritually strangles us all. But not literally. Black pain is something I have no right to appropriate, even metaphorically. My self-absorption, heightened by isolation, was spinning me in circles. If pride, self-elevation, was the problem, why did I feel so low? That's when I remembered that pride has an inverse, a shadowy twin: shame. Feeling low can be as much a signal of excessive self-importance as feeling high. Prayer of contrition: I needed to get it together and find some humility instead. The only thing that helped, with summer getting hotter and the signs on fire everywhere, was being quiet, reading and listening. The universe \u2014 really, their writers' years of hard work \u2014 gave me a gift: I started getting galleys of new books in the mail by Black women scholars telling American music's stories in ways that knocked out my own unexamined assumptions. Maureen Mahon's Black Diamond Queens showed me how to rethink the history of classic rock; Kim Mack's Fictional Blues gave me a new framework for understanding the bluesman and woman's very ways of speaking. Shana Redmond put pioneering blacktivist Paul Robeson back into the heart of the conversation with Everything Man. As autumn entered, I got my hands on an advance copy of Daphne Brooks's epic Liner Notes For a Revolution, which demands a wholly new approach to music history, guided by the spirits of Zora Neale Hurston and Lorraine Hansberry. Every one of them made me feel less lost, more able to think about what music writing needs to be. In this paradoxical time of lies and revelations, what did music itself need to be? I heard so many voices trying to figure that out. A new wave of protest songs began to form immediately after George Floyd's death and continues to build to this day. As at the marches and other protests that inspired them, the best of these new anthems rejected universals for particulars. Black Lives Matter is a movement that makes its arguments through exhaustive attention to detail \u2014 the bloody specifics captured in videos like Frazier's, the counts of shots fired at or blows sustained by particular victims of police violence, and more than anything, the names of those victims, which become emblems precisely because they draw attention to the way racism destroys people one by one. There is no more detail-oriented music than hip-hop, and rappers have built a whole new canon of protest music in just a few months by applying their gifts for connecting reference points to the stories of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain and many others whose lives have been lost. Songs like Dinner Party's \"Freeze Tag\" and the Late Ones' \"The Noose\" built upon the legacy of Billie Holiday singing \"Strange Fruit,\" avoiding niceties in favor of the tangible image, rubber bullets fired into a crowd. The way these new anthems didn't really offer comfort, demanding more difficult emotional responses, felt right to me. I sought the clarity of direct statements. I gravitated toward the YouTube channel of the rapper and singer Tobe Nwigwe, who enlisted his friends and family to mount gorgeous tableaus from within his pristine, quarantined apartment. The directness of his words and meditative quality of his voice has a powerful resonance. His ultimate statement was only 44 seconds long. \"I Need You To (Breonna Taylor)\" unfolds over a stark drum beat, the lyrics going not very far beyond the song's title. \"I need you to,\" Nwigwe sings as if he's about to croon a seduction. Instead, his voice turns harder as he demands justice for Taylor, the Louisville woman killed by police in her own home, and McClain, the young Coloradoan who died after police injected him with ketamine to tranquilize him. Nwigwe says what he has to say \u2014 their names \u2014 with little embellishment. \"You catch my vibe?\" he asks. \"Now get off my page.\" In the video he gazes into the eyes of whoever's watching, no smile, no tears, no outstretched hand, no nonsense. I found the same clarity in a very different musical response to violence, the four-and-a-half minute suite \"Mary Turner: An American Tradition\" by the jazz saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins and his quartet. In 1918, the pregnant Turner was lynched by a white mob in Valdosta, Ga. after publicly demanding accountability for the murder of her husband in the same lynching rampage. Wilkins, pianist Micah Thomas and bassist Daryl Johns make the spirit of the long-lost Turner vivid \u2014 vulnerable, defiant, terrified \u2014 as drummer Kweky Sumbry conjures the ground she walked on, African in ancestry. This music, so subtle and yet somehow so explicit, cannot give Mary Turner her life back. But it can demand that listeners witness it, alongside her death. I started collecting songs like these, though many were not an easy listen. Shemekia Copeland's \"Clotilda's on Fire,\" pays witness to the arrival of the last slave ship to come to America. Sault's \"Little Boy\" places the listener inside the kind of conversation Black parents have with their children when it comes time to warn them about the dangers the police may pose to them. Historical passages made personal, personal ones revealed as historic \u2014 through these amalgamations, these songs educated me. And when an artist challenged me \u2014 \"American silence is a crime,\" the folk singer Chris Pierce declared; \"You should be ashamed that nothing's really changed,\" the keyboardist and composer PJ Morton crooned, in a collaboration with Nwigwe \u2013 I took that in. Still working through my own place in this struggle, I felt grateful for these artists holding the line. Not easy. But like Nwigwe said: I need you to. By autumn, the neighborhood signs turned partisan. As it came into focus, the Presidential election felt more like an ongoing brawl than an orderly argument about our nation's best future. My immediate area's election placards leaned uniformly to the left, with Biden/Harris troths mounted next to those rainbow-hued social justice emblems from weeks earlier. Yet the membrane was weak. \"I was walking down McGavock, and there's one house that's just a shrine to Trump!\" another mom on the block declared one evening when I ran into her on her daily baby-buggy perambulations. This distressed her because, on that day, the election was a week gone but plenty of people in Tennessee, and throughout the country, were still debating who had won. We were in a loop. It felt like a horror movie. Our neighbors knew this would happen, apparently; many had integrated their campaign placards into Halloween displays, as if to say to passersby, no hellscape haunts the way our own precarious daily surroundings do right now. I laughed, I cried, I felt sick. The election provided an outlet for the anger that often overtakes people when they don't know how to protect themselves, and then, instead of the resolution voting was supposed to bring, contention froze the air. We were not moving forward. Abhorrence and horror have the same Latin root, meaning \"a chill.\" America's endemic inequities and instabilities turned people against each other ever more dramatically. Fear became rage and intensified into personal confrontations, invasions of space.  In Nashville there were anti-mask rallies and a \"worship protest,\" part of a nationwide tour by Christian rocker Sean Feucht, in which people sing together and testify that their breath remains pure of the virus no one can see. Elsewhere, the newspapers reported, people gathered in throngs to ride motorcycles, danced at raves, attended weddings that left 90 per cent of the guests sick. The virus got worse and people's defiance grew more obstinate. In the yard signs I saw evidence of tampering with this cruel mood, in the form of jokes. My favorite example involved a Bernie Sanders sign someone had doctored until it said \"Biden,\" using fine-point pens and masking tape, an \"e\" turned into and \"I\" and so forth, but with the old name showing through. I liked the way the Bernie fan embedded an old loyalty into compromise. And I related to the messy way they did it, this crude emblem of a season in which nothing solidified. I couldn't focus on books so I turned  to elaborate puzzle games that led me from one decaying castle room to the next. Scandinavian mystery shows and classic horror movies aestheticized dread and made it approachable. Doomscrolling was my bad habit, leading out into the abhorrent chill again. Around midnight I'd inevitably delete all the social media platforms from my phone and turn to a soothing voice on a self-help podcast, whispering reassurances, gently holding my anxieties in check. Sometimes I'd click on a music video. The live-streaming universe of concerts and other theatrical experiences continued to expand exponentially but I rarely felt drawn into it. Maybe this was my form of Zoom fatigue, a loss of interest in the screen-mediated intimacy most online performances offered, because without the possibility of swapping actual breath the effort too often made me feel sad, tuned in to my own solitude. Prayer for asylum: I wanted to flee, into other realities altogether. Wandering YouTube around midnight, I'd gravitate toward artists whose ambitions were more cosmic than intimate. Often these cosmic realms did away with the very divisions that people were fighting about IRL \u2014 borders, genders, sexuality. Bodies came together within them and identities broke apart. In the video for \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" the year's breakthrough category-basher Bad Bunny morphed from summer-sundress chic caliente to mustachioed stud to vinyl-sporting dominatrix, capping off these transformations by rubbing up against his own masculine/feminine ass. Harry Styles beamed at me from his Quarantine Island in \"Watermelon Sugar,\" a clip \"dedicated to touching\" and featuring the lissome boy androgyne pop star innocently wrapping himself in the caresses of a dozen gorgeous friends, male, female, either, both. Repeated viewings of Harry's paradise opened up an algorithmic path that led me to Isaac Dunbar, a teenager schooled in the wisdom of Lady Gaga and  whose imagination crawled with glitter and sparkled with the wings of moths. Most satisfying was the exploded domestic sphere Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion ruled over in \"WAP\" \u2014 Sappho's island reimagined as the ultimate Playgirl club, where tigers and snakes wandered without endangering anyone and all of the pair's famous friends danced in separate perfect mistress-bedrooms. I watched \"WAP\" five times in a row when it dropped in early August and every day for a month after that. These utopian chimeras welcomed me and I fell into them, their opulence my ethereal balm. These video binges could quickly devolve into risky behavior, though \u2014 another form of scrolling, minus the doom that news-focused platforms imparted, but still producing that nervous feeling brought on by endless choice. I needed to close my laptop and my eyes and have a sustained experience. Like a child, I needed someone to tell me a story \u2014 to take me back to my earliest experiences of others building worlds where I could rest. It's a funny thing when you're a kid \u2013 if you're lucky the little circle of your family contains you, but you need a different kind of reassurance, the promise that there's more beyond the rectangular confines of your own house. At the same time, you need to be reassured that going outside will be safe. Stories fill this need. They combat loneliness in ways a loved one's hug does not. I knew that, as weird autumn wore on, others were craving stories too. Friends shared delirious accounts of Netflix binges and deep dives into old books. Many fell asleep each night to the \"bedtime\" monologues on meditation apps, revenant experiences of Mom reading Anne of Green Gables or Bless Me, Ultima under dim bedside light. I found my stories in albums that transported me that way, into a different world, connected to my own but, in this season, more comprehensible. I sought music strongly grounded in their makers to say I am here, and to show me all the details of what here meant to them. Zara McFarlane was here in East London; her Songs of An Unknown Tongue encircled the territory that linked the Jamaica of her family's past to her own present as a jazz singer and rendered it new through samples and loops and her own clear current of a voice. For Moses Sumney, here was Asheville, N.C., where he'd moved from California to make grae and transform into some kind of latter-day Romantic building a new vision of the pastoral from gospel swoons, soul shouts and psychedelic jams. On Aguita, Gabriel Garzon-Montano brought me here to a Brooklyn where reggaeton blasted in the streets and bedroom curtains fluttered with art-jazz beats and Brazilian whispers. This universe started to feel infinite. The Puerto Rican here of Buscabulla's Regresa, streaked sunset pink, complemented the astral here of Inner Song, in which Kelly Lee Owens seemed to project herself into a Welsh night sky. It feels wrong to say these albums took me away, the way a tourist might go to a Sandals resort and think she knew something about the island where she'd landed. They challenge that touristic impulse, in fact, because of the strong personalities at their center \u2014 whole beings who resist being exoticized by being insistently, idiosyncratically themselves. Sumney's desire to defy a singular identity bore the marks of stretching past how his own Black masculinity, and others' assumptions about it, could confine him. Garzon-Montano, a delicate auteur trying on swagger, confronted the problems of machismo even as he flirted with it. I think these albums felt comforting to me because their beauty emerged through discomfort, that tender feeling of unrest that takes over when some kind of metamorphosis must occur. Tell me a story. Zara McFarlane's words: Everything is connected, although you cannot see the roots that hold us. In a lifelong web, trapped by hope. As the calendar turned toward December, a music movie showed up on Amazon Prime that built a world so joyously and meticulously, it hit me like a prayer at least partially answered. Director Steve McQueen's Lovers Rock, part of his Small Axe suite of films that lovingly reveal the daily life of Black London, dwells almost entirely within a cramped row house where Caribbean immigrants have gathered for a sound system party. Most of its 70 minutes places the viewer within just a few rooms were goat stew bubbles on the kitchen stove, a DJ/selector crams his setup into a corner and people steadily gather, pass in hallways, cluster against walls, clinch in corners, bantering, almost fighting and turning aways, flirting and surreptitiously making love. At the film's center is a scene set to singer Janet Kay and producer Dennis Bovell's yearning anthem \"Silly Games\" \u2014 three minutes of absolute, enveloping yearning capped by some of the highest vocal notes in pop history. On McQueen's dance floor the selector stretches out the song's ending, and then the crowd takes over, voices melding and melting, simmering all the way up to Kay's impossible high notes. The scene goes on and on, every sway of the dancers' hips another precious moment to dwell in. Watching it, falling into it, on an early December night, I realized how rarely cinema grants this gift that music routinely delivers: the distillation of time itself into something evoking a world. Caught up in \"Silly Games,\" McQueen's dancers break free of the uncertainties of their regular lives, where racism violates their days and curtails most of their nights. They're not in a nightmare loop; they know the song will end. But they also understand that within its warm confines they are safe. When I was a kid, my dad whistled incessantly. Sitting at the kitchen table after dinner with the piles of papers he'd brought home from his accounting job, or puttering around the house, or waiting to pick up my brother at his soccer game, he'd punctuate the air with his Irish trill. Whistling in public was an incognito way of self-soothing, not that he would have ever used a therapeutic word like that. He couldn't sing in public; unless something really bad was happening he couldn't pray. So he whistled. Snatches of arias he'd learned from Mario Lanza records melded with Bing Crosby favorites and hymns in his repertoires. Mostly, though, it was just this one melody. Up and down the scale, up and down \u2014 I could never tell what song it came from. And I never asked him. Fourteen years after his death, the precise notes have faded from my ear. I'm sad about that. And I'll never know where he got them. All I know is that they helped him get through things somehow. Ten days after the election, a week after the slow counting of absentee ballots made it clear, if not acceptable to naysayers, who had won, the signs in my neighborhood gave way to holiday lights. My dad loved Christmas; he'd get on the roof and string lights all around our house and stuff the space under the tree with presents from Sears and J.C. Penney. I'm glad my dad is dead in 2020, miss him still but am relieved he's not lying in some old folks' home bed as the virus wafts through the hallways or hiding in our old house in Seattle, afraid to do the thing he loved to do most on a weekend morning, which was go to the grocery store. To be honest, what little relief I've felt about the state of the world the past four years has taken the form of gratitude that both of my parents passed before this cursed era fell upon America. I tell my friends my dad would have cried to see the country he fought for, the one that took his youthful health from him, devolve into bitter ignominy. To hear the name of fascism, the political plague he fought against raised and recognized on the horizon. I don't tell people that I'm also glad he's gone because who knows what ideas spewing out of the television in the retirement home dining room might have taken him over and made him my enemy. Sometimes lately I think I can hear my dad's whistling. It's just my heart looking for reassurance, something quotidian. I can't take the constant alarm bells announcing new variations on crisis, even though I know they have to be heeded. There's reason to hope, but so much peril still on the path. In Nashville I see many people going about their business and their fun, many working to accept a new reality requiring distance but many still pulling their masks off their noses as soon as they can get far enough from the signs telling them to follow health codes outside every shop. The holiday lights shine and I hate to admit it, I hope no one's coming home for Christmas. In mid-November a song that's been hanging around for a few months wends its way into my brain, replicating my dad's whistling in the yard. \"Starting Over\" was the first single to drop from my country music favorite Chris Stapleton's new album, and its title track. I listened once in August and thought, this is corny. Moved on to my daytime protest songs and nighttime fantasy reels. But with the whole album in my ears, its misty ballads and muscular rock songs as solidly and comfortingly proficient as I needed, \"Starting Over\" became something I reached for like a painkiller. Prayers work best when revisited daily. \"Starting Over\" opens with a chord change from some other folk-rock chestnut, I still can't figure out which, just like with that tune of my dad's I never identified. Chris's voice comes in, sturdy, hardly reaching, joined in harmony as always by his wife Morgane's. The lyrics propose a change of scenery. \"I got friends out on the coast, let's jump in the water and see what floats.\" I haven't seen the coast where I grew up in more than a year now. I try on this daydream; it feels fine. But what gets me, keeps me, is the hook that felt so corny to me when I first heard it. \"I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four leaf clover,\" Chris and Morgane sing to each other. It's the kind of thing a parent says to a kid when the day is getting long and everybody's tired, or when some tough little battle looms and nerves have got the better of everybody. I recognize, listening to this chorus, that \"Starting Over\" isn't really about what the title says. Instead, it's about just floating the possibility of change, putting a little hope in your step even as everything else pulls you downward. The best songs about change, about a better tomorrow, always have some sadness in them, because there's still that gap between what the future offers and whatever mess you're in right now. Chris and Morgane's harmonies circle back on themselves; starting over will come some time. In the meantime, sing to each other, the song said. Listen to your own faltering survivor's spirit. A song can mark the time that goes around and around. It tells me that I can live another day. Starting over.",

Some worry he might destroy White House records and begin issuing pardons.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Presidents typically reserve their most controversial decisions for their last weeks in office, writes my guest, journalist Garrett Graff. He says, so imagine what might happen in a post-election period when Donald Trump, a president who has spent four years demonstrating his lack of interest in norms and practices of a democracy, retains all the powers and authority of the presidency and officially has nothing left to lose. In an article in Politico Magazine, Graff lays out some of the norm-busting actions Trump may take in the days remaining in his presidency. Graff wrote that article just before the election. Since then, President Trump has broken other norms by refusing to concede the election, making baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud and pursuing legal challenges. Trump is also standing in the way of a smooth transition by blocking President-elect Biden's access to the funding allocated for the transition process and blocking access to classified information, such as the presidential daily briefing, that is supposed to be granted to a president-elect. Garrett Graff also wrote a recent article in Politico Magazine about what Trump might do after leaving the White House. Graff is a former editor of Politico Magazine and is a contributor to Wired. He's written books about Robert Mueller's tenure as FBI director, a history of the secret bunkers built to protect government leaders in case of nuclear attack and an oral history of Sept. 11. He's also the director of the cyber initiative at the Aspen Institute. Our interview was recorded yesterday. Garrett Graff, welcome back to FRESH AIR. GARRETT GRAFF: Thanks so much for having me, Terry. GROSS: Let's start with a couple of the - what you consider most norm-breaking things President Trump has done so far to interfere with the transfer of power. GRAFF: The biggest one has to just be the simple fact that he has not yet accepted the projected winner of the election being Joe Biden. This is a very different situation than we faced in 2000 with the Florida recount. The state victories across the country are definitive. They are decisive. And Joe Biden looks like he's actually on his way to a comfortable victory in the Electoral College. And the fact that now, more than a week after the election, Donald Trump has not yet accepted that - he's not yet given permission for Republican leaders to accept that and not yet given permission for the U.S. government to accept that - is deeply worrisome. There's a second level of his norm-breaking that we are already beginning to see, which is one of the things that I had speculated about before the election, which is widespread firings of senior government officials, a housecleaning, if you will, among top national security and intelligence leaders in a way that is worrisome from the - a national security perspective amid a transition. We've never seen a president in a lame-duck period like this fire, for instance, the defense secretary. And this is injecting a lot of uncertainty and instability into some very key American institutions at a moment where you are already facing uncertainty and instability amid a presidential transition. GROSS: Attorney General William Barr has given federal prosecutors approval to pursue allegations of, quote, \"voter tabulation irregularities\" in certain cases before results are certified. But he added, in terms of investigating voter fraud, specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries. So what does that mean? 'Cause you could argue that all of Trump's claims about voter fraud are specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched. GRAFF: Yeah. And on the one hand, it seems a little too early to know whether this Barr memo is just sort of bluster and performative to give Donald Trump a little bit of cover as he carries out these, as you said, sort of specious court filings and court arguments around the country around voter fraud, all of which have been turned aside unanimously by courts across the country, state after state. And there is indeed no evidence of any widespread fraud and certainly no evidence of any fraud anywhere close to the level of the victories that we are seeing Joe Biden pile up in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia. At the same time, though, there is reason to be worried that Bill Barr's memo might be more than just hot air. Just a few hours after he issued that memo, we saw the head of the election crimes unit at the Justice Department resign in protest. And that's a worrisome statement by someone who is presumably in a good position to know what Bill Barr might be trying to do with that memo. But we haven't yet seen any evidence of that Barr memo appearing in court across the country in investigations carried out by the federal government. GROSS: Mark Esper, the secretary of defense, was fired this week - so were three other top officials in the Defense Department. After being fired, Esper said, who's going to come in behind me? It's going to be a real yes man, and then God help us. What went through your mind when he said that? And I ask you this because you wrote a book about the United States government's doomsday plans - in other words, if there is a nuclear attack, where are the secret bunkers? Who in the government gets to go in those secret bunkers? What's the chain of command? How do they operate afterwards? So I know you've given a lot of thought to the nuclear football and what happens before and after a nuclear attack. So, you know, the God-help-us made me kind of think - is Esper thinking about a nuclear issue? GRAFF: It's possible. The reason - there are sort of two reasons to be specifically concerned about Esper's firing. One is that one of the main sources of tension between Donald Trump and Mark Esper earlier this year was Esper's refusal to allow the U.S. military to be used in domestic law enforcement over the summer during the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Donald Trump wanted to bring in the U.S. military to restore order to places like Washington, D.C., and Esper argued that that is both illegal and against, you know, just the norms of American democracy. And so, you know, there's an obvious concern, as we face another moment of political instability, about whether Donald Trump is looking for someone who will be willing to use the U.S. military to quell domestic unrest. The second reason to be concerned is that Donald Trump didn't just fire Mark Esper; he installed Chris Miller as the new acting secretary of defense. Now, Miller is someone who is not the next in line for defense secretary under normal circumstances. There is a confirmed deputy secretary of defense who should be the one stepping into the top Pentagon role, and instead, Donald Trump went outside the normal order of succession to bring over Chris Miller, who's currently the head of the National Counterterrorism Center and was, as recently as August, a deputy assistant secretary in the Pentagon overseeing special operations. And that is effectively a five-rank promotion for Chris Miller from, you know, deputy assistant secretary up to acting secretary. And you have to ask yourself, why Chris Miller, and what is Donald Trump looking for in Miller specifically that he couldn't get from, you know, the literally dozens of people in the normal order of succession ahead of Miller? GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Garrett Graff. His recent articles in Politico Magazine are about norms President Trump may break between the election and Joe Biden's inauguration and what Trump might do after leaving office. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with journalist Garrett Graff about his two latest articles in Politico Magazine - norms President Trump may break in the days remaining in his presidency and what he may do after leaving the White House. One of the things you speculate about, which may already be happening, is that President Trump can take revenge on the deep state in his lame-duck weeks. What do you mean by that? GRAFF: Yeah. I mean, we have seen Donald Trump sort of rail against the government bureaucracy, the career civil servants in the military, in the intelligence community, across the rest of the federal government. And there are sort of two areas to be particularly concerned about in the final weeks of the Trump presidency. The first is, you know, the outright firings that he might make to try to corrupt decision-making in these final weeks, some of which we may already be seeing taking place at places like the Pentagon and the Defense Department. The second is, basically, Donald Trump creating his own deep state opposition within the federal government. There's a process that's technically known in Washington jargon as burrowing in - when you have political appointees shift over into civil service roles, where people who would sort of ordinarily leave with an administration then are now sort of permanently part of the federal government. And we are beginning to see this take place in potentially some very worrisome positions. One top White House counsel was recently shifted over to a civil service position as the general counsel of the NSA, the National Security Agency, where presumably it would be hard to remove him in a Biden administration and where he will have enormous sway as general counsel at one of the nation's leading intelligence agencies over the declassification of information, over how signals intelligence programs unfold and how civil liberties of ordinary Americans are respected or abused. And that's just one very specific example of something that we've already seen just a few days after the election. And, you know, Donald Trump has 70 more days ahead of potential mischief. GROSS: Is there another example of that that you can think of? GRAFF: That's the main one that sticks out right now. But, again, you know, we're just a couple of days into this transition period. And, frankly, we're still in the portion where Donald Trump doesn't expect to be leaving. You know, there are signs this week that, actually, Donald Trump is proceeding with vetting officials for a second term, and he has instructed the government this week to continue to move towards presenting a Donald Trump administration budget in February of 2021, where, you know, presumably he will not be in office anymore. We haven't even yet fully seen the administration come to terms with and begin to act like it is leaving in 70 days. GROSS: So the administrator of the General Services Administration, Emily Murphy - who's a Trump appointee - she has to formally recognize Biden as the president-elect before the transfer of power can actually begin. She's declined to do that so far. So that's what is blocking all the transition funding. That's what's blocking Biden's ability to get the presidential daily briefing. It's what's blocking his ability to get the funding to launch his new administration. How unprecedented is this? GRAFF: Totally unprecedented. We're already calling Joe Biden the president-elect, but there are really two moments where a president officially and legally becomes president-elect. And the first is when he is designated by the GSA administrator as the president-elect in a process that's known as ascertainment, that the GSA administrator has to ascertain that he is the likely winner of the Electoral College vote and sends him a letter basically saying, Dear Joe Biden, it looks like you are going to be the next president of the United States; you are now officially the president-elect. And as you said, that unlocks millions of dollars in transition funding for him. It unlocks government office space for his transition staff, government email addresses, government cellphones - I mean, sort of all of the information that agencies and departments have prepared for the transition. It gives his staff the legal authority to show up at agencies and departments and begin to talk with government officials. And it unlocks their ability to receive classified information, including, as you said, the president's daily brief, the daily intelligence briefing prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. That is normally a very routine process. In 2008, when Barack Obama was elected, the GSA administrator ascertained that he was the president-elect around 1:00 a.m. on election night, you know, just within literal hours of the networks declaring the election. And that this is something that we have never seen before, where the networks have called the election, and the GSA administrator is basically waiting to get official word from the president, presumably, that he is conceding. And one of the reasons to be sort of concerned about the partisan nature of this is that just a couple of days before the election - literally, a couple of days before the election - the White House installed one of its own White House counsels, a Trump administration lawyer, as the general counsel at the GSA, which is a, you know, weird bureaucratic sleight of hand that presumably is helping to hold up the transition process right now. GROSS: Does Trump legally have to concede before the Biden administration moves forward, before Biden is named, you know, officially president, before he's certified? GRAFF: So in theory, no. Joe Biden - presumably, over the next couple of weeks, states will certify their own election results, which is a formal process done generally by either the governor or the secretary of the state. That will then translate into instructions for the Electoral College voters, who will meet on December 14 in state capitols around the country and sign their votes for the presidency, officially. Those are then transmitted to Congress, who will convene at 1:00 p.m. on the afternoon of January 6 to count and certify the election results. And that it's that Electoral College vote that actually then establishes the official president-elect status that would then lead to the president taking office at noon on January 20. So in theory, Donald Trump doesn't have to concede in order for that process to unfold. But in, you know, the entire history of the United States, part of the key of a peaceful transition of power from one presidency to the next has been the willingness of presidents to put aside partisan differences for the good of the nation following a legitimate election result. GROSS: Now, I think you said that the head of the General Service Administration, Emily Murphy, is waiting for Trump to concede before she certifies Joe Biden as the president-elect. But does she legally have to wait for Trump to concede before certifying Biden? GRAFF: Not at all. This is a decision that she alone can make at any time. She can ascertain, officially, Joe Biden as the president-elect whenever she wants, and the fact that she has not is troubling and worrisome and goes against, you know, decades of normal practice of the federal government. GROSS: Do you think that this is in a way, like, the ultimate norm-breaker, you know, refusing to concede, saying that there was, you know, massive fraud when there was not or there's absolutely no evidence of that and blocking the next president from beginning his transition? I mean, Biden's moving forward anyways. But, you know, there's things that he doesn't have access to. There's money that Biden doesn't have access to. Is this the ultimate in breaking norms? You know, American democracy depends on a president leaving power when he's lost the election, as Trump clearly has. GRAFF: Absolutely. And I would sort of go one step further, which is to say this president's unwillingness to concede in what by all stretch of, you know, bipartisan agreement is a legitimate, free and fair and secure election is an attack on the very core of the United States. You know, part of the challenge of the democracy that we have, the republic that we have, is that what America really is, is an idea. It is these traditions. It is these institutions - the idea of a peaceful transition of power, the idea of the rule of law, the idea of a free press. And generation after generation, our ancestors have tended these, guarded them, passed them along to future generations. And the model of American democracy is that it is for the current generation to care for these institutions and these traditions for future generations. And what Donald Trump is engaged in right now, by refusing to concede the election, a decision that is being enabled by and aided and abetted by the leaders of the Republican Party right now, I would argue, is an assault not just on every generation of Americans thus far, but an assault on every generation of Americans yet to come. GROSS: Let me introduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Garrett Graff. And his recent articles in Politico Magazine are about norms President Trump may break between the election and Joe Biden's inauguration and what Trump might do after leaving office. We'll talk more after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with journalist Garrett Graff. His two latest articles in Politico Magazine are about what norms President Trump may break in the remaining weeks of his presidency and what Trump may do after leaving the White House, including how he might try to make money to pay off his debts That will be coming due. Graff is a former editor of Politico Magazine, the author of several books, including one about Robert Mueller and is the director of cyber initiatives at the Aspen Institute. Now, another category of concerns you bring up in terms of what Trump may do in his lame duck weeks is to destroy records, like, White House records and obstruct access to information for Biden when he becomes president. So what are some of the things that you're concerned Trump might do to destroy or hide or block access to records of his presidency? GRAFF: Yeah. So there are sort of two directions of this fear. One is documents that could be destroyed such that we never understand how debates unfold or in situations like, for instance, the child separation policy of the federal government as part of the immigration debate, where officials might fear that they might face criminal investigation after leaving office. You might see them attempt to destroy documents that outline potential criminal liability. So there's a destruction aspect to it. There's also a declassification aspect to this, which is Donald Trump has already shown that he is willing to declassify documents that are politically embarrassing to his adversaries and that we might see him race over the next 70 days or so to push out embarrassing secrets or embarrassing documents or potentially scandalous documents about folks like Hillary Clinton or other political adversaries where he just wants to weaponize the information of the federal government before he leaves office. GROSS: So during the Trump presidency, Trump spoke several times and met with Vladimir Putin but kept the content of those conversations secret. Is there any way to get access to those records? Is there any way for Biden to get access to those records? GRAFF: The short answer is there should be, you know, those types of documents, even if they are highly classified, should be protected from destruction legally. Whether that actually stands out in this case, whether that actually unfolds normally in this case, I think is not a foregone conclusion. The good news is many of these records are going to be digital. And so it's going to be harder to track down and delete fully all of the copies of the records, given the classified nature of some of these systems. GROSS: Let's talk about some of the relatively conventional things that Trump might do during his lame duck weeks. In your article, you write about pardons, pardons he might give to protect his family and people who have protected him. Who are you thinking of that he could possibly pardon before leaving office? GRAFF: Yeah. So one of the things to remember is that this is a moment in presidencies where even presidents who care about their historical legacy, care about respecting democratic norms normally take their most controversial action. So you saw President George H.W. Bush pardon the leading figures in the Iran-Contra scandal during this time period after he lost his election. You saw President Clinton pardon 140 people, including Marc Rich, in the final hours of his presidency. And you saw Barack Obama commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning in the final weeks of his presidency. So the pardons are normally a controversial part of a presidency in these final weeks. What's unique about Donald Trump is that pardons have already been a controversial part of his presidency. And we have seen him exercise that power in ways that benefit his friends, benefit potentially criminal co-conspirators of his like Roger Stone, as well as sort of all manner of political allies, including Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D'Souza, Bernie Kerik, Conrad Black and other sort of right wing cause celebres. So one of the things that I think we could look at over the next couple of weeks is after whichever moment he sort of comes to terms with the fact that he's actually going to leave office in January, first, you could see him offering presidential pardons or commutations to other people who are caught up in the Russia investigation, people like Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, perhaps including Paul Manafort and other figures. The second category are sort of blanket preemptive pardons for the president's own family, close friends, campaign associates and aides who might face investigation and charges after Trump leaves office. GROSS: Can you explain how the preemptive pardon works and why a president, including President Trump, could pardon somebody before they're even charged with a crime? GRAFF: Yeah. And this is where we actually turn back to the Nixon presidency, which is he had not actually been charged when Gerald Ford pardoned him. And Gerald Ford made the argument that it was important to allow the country to basically move forward without a criminal investigation into, you know, unspooling for years into the criminality of Richard Nixon's administration. And so he offered - you know, this is not a legal term, but effectively a blanket preemptive pardon that would stop a federal investigation from really pursuing charges against Richard Nixon in the first place. GROSS: So is this something that's built into the presidency? Or is this something that kind of evolved over the years, the idea of the preemptive pardon? GRAFF: Yeah. So the presidential pardon is written into the Constitution. It is one of the most powerful and direct powers that the presidency has. And it's really one of the only places where presidential power works in the way that Donald Trump sort of imagines the presidency works, which is, you know, wave a magic wand, sign a piece of paper and the deed is done. And Donald Trump has repeatedly turned to pardons and commutations, in part because he sort of loves that instant gratification aspect of the presidential pardon. One of the big open questions is whether Donald Trump could, in fact, pardon himself and offer a self-pardon to ensure that he is - does not face any federal criminal charges or investigations after he leaves office. Most legal scholars tend to believe that the president does not have that ability to self-pardon. But, for instance, if Donald Trump resigned at 11:00 a.m. on January 20, and Mike Pence had one hour as president of the United States, he could issue a pardon for Donald Trump before the end of Donald Trump's term. So it would be weird. It would be unprecedented. It would be, you know, a hugely politically explosive act for Mike Pence to undertake. But, you know, this is the Trump administration and weird things have happened. GROSS: Getting back to the preemptive pardon. So the Constitution gives the president the right to pardon, but does it say anything about a preemptive pardon, pardoning somebody before they've even been accused of a crime? GRAFF: Effectively what the pardon power allows is for you to be pardoned for offenses against the United States. And what that means is the way that a pardon actually legally plays out, you would be brought into court to face criminal charges. And you would say, you know, I have this presidential get-out-of-jail-free card right here that pardons me from this offence. So you could see a prosecutor bring charges against the president for, say, a self-pardon. And you could see a court challenge arise when former President Trump presents that pardon in federal court about whether that preemptive pardon actually is legal. But, you know, it would certainly be discouraging to a federal prosecutor to go into a court case knowing that there was the possibility that the charges had already been pardoned. One thing that is important to caveat this with is that presidential pardons only deal with federal crimes. And that what you see is investigations unfolding, for instance, at the New York state level with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James. And there is nothing that Donald Trump could do to get out of criminal charges or court challenges arising at the state or local level. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Garrett Graff. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with journalist Garrett Graff about his two latest articles in Politico Magazine. They're about norms President Trump may break in the days remaining in his presidency and what he may do after leaving the White House. Let's talk about some of the things Trump might do after leaving the White House. As you point out, he'll have a lot of debt to pay off. What's the estimate of how much debt he's going to have to pay off? GRAFF: Well, we know from the incredible work of The New York Times this fall reporting on his taxes that he faces about $420 million in debt that comes due over the next couple of years, as well as a lot of other open questions, including potentially as much as a 90 or $100 million tax bill from the IRS amid an ongoing tax dispute that he has there, as well as a lot of other debt related to his business in all sorts of different directions and different properties around the world. GROSS: Now, I wasn't aware of this, but ex-presidents get $200,000 annual pensions for the remainder of their lives and about a million dollars a year for travel and office expenses and also franking privileges. That means you can mail things without having to pay. I don't know if that includes Federal Express (laughter) or just the USPS. This is an important question for franking. But - so what opportunities do you see to use money designed to help and to protect the president where he can take that money and channel it into his businesses? GRAFF: So the biggest opportunity he's going to have is the fact that he receives lifetime Secret Service protection. And what we have seen through his presidency is, you know, on the one hand, he brags about how he forgoes his salary as president and donates it to charity. But what he has done throughout his presidency is by traveling to his own properties - to Mar-a-Lago, to Bedminster, to his golf course outside of Washington - he has directed millions upon millions of dollars of government spending to his own properties, you know, in terms of hotel bills, in terms of golf cart rentals. And that is going to be money that the U.S. Secret Service is going to have to continue to spend on him in the years ahead, particularly if he takes up residence at his own properties, as he presumably will, you know, potentially Mar-a-Lago through the winter and his Bedminster, N.J., golf course in the summer and maybe some combination of the Trump Hotel in Washington as well. And that's been pretty expensive for the Secret Service. I mean, they charge - his Bedminster golf course charges him $17,000 a month for the Secret Service to rent a cottage in Bedminster. The - Mar-a-Lago charges the U.S. government as much as $650 a night for rooms at Mar-a-Lago. And the Secret Service, even this summer, actually paid $179,000 to rent golf carts and other vehicles at his New Jersey golf course. So this is a spigot of government money that he will get simply because the Secret Service is going to be following him wherever he goes. GROSS: And is it more profitable for Trump in terms of the income and his properties to move from property to property? Because the way that Mar-a-Lago was rezoned, he can't live there full time anymore, because it's - I think it's designated as a commercial property now. So he can't have full-time residence there. So is it more profitable if he moves from property to property? GRAFF: It's certainly more profitable in the fact that the Secret Service will have to set up multiple protection systems at each of his properties as they move back-and-forth. And this is all, again, sort of imagining a relatively normal set of presidential activities. One of the things that the president will be doing, presumably once he leaves office, is beginning to think about a presidential library and presidential museum. Those have traditionally been nonprofit entities that back up the National Archives' version of the presidential library. But there's no reason the President Trump, for instance, couldn't create a for-profit, you know, Trump world, you know, MAGA mega resort in Florida, you know, to compete with the other attractions in Orlando and bring his millions of diehard fans to Trump world to pay to see Trump family members, to sort of serve as a rallying point for his movement as it goes forward. GROSS: So you're envisioning a possible, like, Trump theme park? GROSS: And I think, you know, if you are Donald Trump and you are in the business of hospitality and you are the showman that Donald Trump is, you know, that is exactly the type of model that I would be trying to pursue, particularly if, as Donald Trump hints from time to time, he might actually be interested in continuing in politics and continuing potentially to run for election in 2024 if he loses and leaves office in January. GROSS: So you're saying that there's a possibility - and this is just pure speculation - that Trump would create a kind of presidential library/theme park that I presume you'd have to charge admission for? GRAFF: Yes. And it could serve as sort of the focal point of his presidential - post-presidential activities. It could sort of serve as a mecca for his fans and Republican acolytes to come and pay homage to him and the Trump family. Because, you know, Donald Trump may leave office in January, but he's not going anywhere. And this is someone who is going to remain hugely influential in the Republican Party for years to come, presumably. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Garrett Graff. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with journalist Garrett Graff about his two latest articles in Politico Magazine. They're about norms President Trump may break in the days remaining in his presidency and what he may do after leaving the White House. If Trump wants to remain a powerbroker after his presidency, what are some of the ways he can do that? GRAFF: Well, one of the things, Terry, that is important to understand is just how thoroughly Donald Trump has remade the Republican Party in the four or five years that he has been its leader. You know, there's a lot of, I think, speculation out there that the Republican Party, the moment Donald Trump leaves office, is going to pretend that Donald Trump never happened and that it's going to sort of snap back to this, you know, Republican ideal of, you know, some sort of, you know, George W. Bush compassionate conservatism kind of model. And that's just really unlikely to happen because what Donald Trump has done over the last five years is basically push out of the Republican Party, the very people who would be the moderate Bush-style conservatives in a previous era. You know, if you look at Capitol Hill, less than half of the representatives and senators who started as Republican congressmen and women in January 2017 will still be in office in January 2021, when the 117th Congress convenes. And so the people who are left in this party are the Trump purists at this point. And so Donald Trump is going to, you know, be walking away from the White House having won more Republican votes, more votes than any person in American history prior to this election. I mean, 70 million Americans went out and voted for him on Election Day. And that's an enormous amount of power and influence he's going to continue to hold over the Republican Party in the years ahead, even if he decides not to run in 2024. GROSS: So President Trump might remain a power broker after he leaves office. He might end up facing criminal charges. He might face insurmountable debt. He might exploit the system for his own good. He might, you know, make a lot of money on a Trump theme park (laughter). I mean, there's so many extremes that are possible in the next few years for him. GRAFF: Yeah. And one thing that I think is worth talking about that we haven't mentioned so far is the extent to which Donald Trump, in sort of his recklessness and his willingness to coddle authoritarian regimes around the rest of the world, remains and could create sort of new national security risks for the United States going forward. That sort of you could imagine, for instance, Donald Trump coddling and cozying up with authoritarians like Turkey's Erdogan or Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, you know, as he opens and does business deals or hotel deals or hospitality deals around the rest of the world and sort of creating himself as sort of an alternate universe of U.S. foreign policy power, where, you know, he could show up courtside for a basketball game in Pyongyang, like Dennis Rodman, and say, you know, hey, you know, Kim Jong Un won't meet with Joe Biden, but he'll meet with me - and trying to undermine the Biden administration and American government on the world stage. He is walking out of the White House having, you know, literally trillions of dollars of national security secrets at his fingertips as president - you know, things about surveillance capabilities, things about intelligence assets, things about the details of military weapons. And all of that would be information that any foreign power, you know, allies or adversaries alike, would be interested in knowing. And you could see Donald Trump, you know, potentially trying to weaponize or profit off of that information as a former president in a way that America is totally unprepared for. I mean, we have this tradition of former presidents really leaving the stage when they leave office, and there's no sign and no reason to believe that Donald Trump will leave the stage willingly at any point. GROSS: Well, Garrett Graff, you've given us a lot to think about (laughter). Thank you so much for talking with us. GRAFF: Terry, it's always a pleasure. GROSS: Garrett Graff's articles about what Trump might do in the remaining days of his presidency and what he might do after leaving the White House are published in Politico Magazine.

            "article_content": "Vice president-elect Kamala Harris, front center, with, from left, her grandfather, sister, mother and grandmother in 1972.\n                \n                    \n                    Twitter/ @mayaharris_\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice president-elect Kamala Harris, front center, with, from left, her grandfather, sister, mother and grandmother in 1972. Unless you've been living under a (really, really large) rock, you know that Kamala Harris is the vice president-elect\u2014and has shattered a lot of glass ceilings. Come January, she'll be the first woman and first daughter of immigrants and first woman of color to hold the role of VP. And different people point out different aspects of her multiracial identity; after all, she's Black and Asian and South Asian and Indian American. So this week on the show, we're talking about what exactly it means for Kamala Harris to be the United States' first Black-South-Asian-multiracial-female-vice-president-elect. We get into a lot of messy territory, like what her political prominence might help illuminate (or obscure) about South Asian political identity, how multiracial people are perceived, and how Blackness intersects with all of those things. To help us make sense of all of that, we talked to Nitasha Sharma, an associate professor of African American Studies and Asian American studies at Northwestern University. Here's the extended cut of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity. Back when Kamala Harris was running for the Democratic nomination, what sorts of things were you noticing in the way that people were talking about her racial identity? On the one hand, among Black folks on Twitter, there was a response to how Harris has really identified as a Black woman. So I think people were really excited about that possibility. But also, among progressives, it was more about her politics and her policies rather than her identity, although those things happen at once. On the other hand, among South Asians, people knew that she was Indian. And I think that's what was really critical for a lot of South Asians. But now that she's been out a little longer, Asian Americans as a whole have embraced that part of her. And then finally, of course, the immigrant narrative: A lot of us are the children of immigrants, and I think that speaks to a lot of folks. So there's a lot of kind of mainstream celebration of Kamala Harris being the first Black and South Asian woman to run for the Democratic VP ticket. On the other hand, people are saying that it's not really about her background. We know that there are Black people, for instance, who don't have policies that are good for Black people. All skinfolk ain't kinfolk. Even if you are a particular identity, it doesn't mean politically that you're going to pass laws and legislation that is good for that broader community. You say that among Asian Americans, South Asians were the first to claim Kamala Harris, then Asian Americans more broadly. I'm curious about that process, how fast or slow that happens, and what that says about the politics within the Asian American community. That's a really great question. So, you know, South Asians sort of came into the umbrella of Asian American more recently. \"Asian\" in the United States has often been typified as the face of an East Asian person \u2014 somebody who might be Japanese or Korean, maybe Vietnamese, Chinese. And this has to do with immigration patterns to the United States, and the U.S.'s global relations with Asia, which initially had been with East Asia. Immigrants who came here were first Chinese, then Japanese, Koreans and Filipinos. South Asians came a little bit after Kamala Harris's mother came from India, and that is from the 1965 Immigration Act. So on the one hand, when we think about Asian Americans, we think East Asian. On the other hand, a lot of South Asians don't consider themselves to be Asian American. Part of it, especially after 9/11, is because we look different. We're racialized differently. We are considered to be Brown. And people might mix up a person who's from India with someone who is Latino or Mexican. So there's a different racial process to that. At the same time, Asian American is a political identity. So the folks who are, say, academics in Asian American studies on university campuses can see a ready identification with Kamala Harris as part of the Asian immigrant story. But Kamala Harris is not an \"Asian American\" to some South Asians and Indian Americans\u2014she's Indian. So I think that there's those various levels, and Kamala can be all of those things. And it really is interesting when we pay attention to who she claims to be. South Asians seem to have long known that Kamala Harris was Indian\u2014but why might others only know that she's Black? I always knew she was Indian because she has the same name as my auntie in the village in India. Kamala is an Indian name, and her middle name is Devi\u2014 a South Asian middle name. So, right off the bat when you see \"Kamala Devi Harris,\" you know that she is Indian, or her parents had some interest in India, because we know that there are jazz musicians who are African American who name their children with South Asian names. But in general, it's true that people will look at her and listen to her story about how she identifies and reduce her to being Black. And that is not necessarily a negative thing. That's how she self-identifies as well. She is a Black woman. She was born and raised in Oakland, California, and she grew up in the '60s. She knew people who founded Black studies departments. And she was around the civil rights and Black nationalist movements in the Bay Area. She went to a historically Black university. But when we think about race in the U.S. or people are talking about racial issues, they're often using \"race\" as a code word for \"Black.\" And so the primary paradigm that this nation was founded on was a Black and white paradigm. The invisibility of Harris' Indian-ness is an allegory for the racial position of Asians in the United States. We are generally invisible, irrelevant, it seems, to the conversation of race. So when we talk about Kamala Harris' race, people often will only speak about her as a Black woman. And that's the way race operates in the United States. With all the things that you were hearing about her identity, was there anything that surprised you about that conversation? I'm not surprised that there's a lot of celebration among many Americans, but also within the Black community and particularly among Black women. We saw the same with Obama, so in the same way, that's not that surprising. What is surprising to me is that people are picking up that she's also South Asian. Right? So that means that people are picking up on her multiracial identity and that she's not like Obama. She's not like what we generally think of as a mixed person and then question their Blackness\u2014 as people did with Obama\u2014because she's not white. Her father's Black, from Jamaica, and her mom is South Indian. And so what is surprising is that people are willing to grapple with the fact that she is not, \"just Black.\" Black is expansive enough to embrace and include all kinds of multiracial people. Most people of African descent in the United States who have been here for generations have European and Indigenous ancestry. But the one-drop rule works in such a way in, you know, as developed from the times of slavery to increase the number of Black people, to increase the number of slaves. It can be a way to define community in a proud way and expansive way\u2014that if you're Black, you're Black. On the other hand, that really leads to a distrust of people who claim multiracial identity. That's because, like with Obama, most people think claiming \"mixed race\" as an identity is an anti-Black move or a move away from Blackness, because the assumption is that you're moving toward your white identity or light-skinned privileges. Kamala Harris changes the whole conversation on that. How do these dynamics play out on a national political stage, and what's different between Barack Obama and Kamala Harris? Harris and Obama are both very aware of racial dynamics as politicians and their desires to appeal to a broad base. So the way that they handle their racial identity and their affiliations will be very self-aware, especially on the main stage when they're running for political office. Obama was raised by his white mom in Honolulu and by his grandparents who are white. His father was in Kenya and passed away. And so he would speak about his white family and sometimes would bring them on stage. And that really had some audiences saying, OK, he's trying to do this strategically and he's trying to affiliate with white people and appeal to white audiences. And that is often, by some, read as a move away from Blackness. There's not the ability among Americans, with regard to race, to understand that one can be both, and\u2014not either, or. In the vice presidential debate, Kamala Harris talked about her mom as an immigrant, but she didn't talk about her racial background. She didn't give us the immigrant story with the specifics that she does in other interviews. And I think that that's interesting as well. Her mom has passed away, and so she doesn't have her on stage with her. She seems to be estranged from her father, so he doesn't appear on stage with her. So it has to do with how she looks, how she presents herself and the narratives that she picks from her background and her experiences. And that's how it plays out on stage as audiences are watching. We think we understand what a Black woman is and what that signifies\u2014but she has to choose to call to the surface her South Asian-ness. It makes me giggle a little bit that with Kamala Harris, Indians are so proud of her and Indians are also, generally speaking, so anti-Black. I love my Indian community, but we have issues. The main voice for South Asians in America are North Indians like my father. And the person that they get to celebrate in this moment is a woman \u2014 the daughter of a very independent South Indian woman who came before the mainstream Immigration Act of '65 and chose to marry a Black man. Does the fact that Indians and South Asians identify with her and claim her surprise you? I mean, can you see an alternative where her being Black is just too much of an obstacle for her to be this esteemed figure for South Asians? Oh, for sure. It tickles me, because she's so respectable, and she's doing all the things, right? She's not crazy progressive. She is highly educated. She is well-dressed. She's married to a nice white man. She's done all the things that Desis approve of. She's not a doctor or engineer, but she did go through law school. So she fits the stereotype and the image of what South Asian immigrants want to celebrate. And as the children of South Asian immigrants, we know those pressures. You are not supposed to marry Black, and you are not supposed to listen to hip hop or affiliate with Black people. But people identify with her as South Asian because she is the respectable, centrist, accomplished image of South Asians in the United States. Now, if she was someone who was super progressive, or was an artist, or a sexually explicit rapper, I'm not so sure South Asians would be like, yeah, Kamala Harris is our beacon of arrival in the United States. What does caste have to do with that? She's a Brahmin, and in the Indian caste system, Brahmins are at the top. And I think that this really overlays Indians' pride in her, especially in India, because she is the daughter of an upper-caste woman. It is not as if she is a Shatri or a Shudra or an \"untouchable\" or a Dalit, which would create some tension among Indians that she would be a representative of Indian arrival. Even given all the ways that she's \"respectable,\" I'm still a little bit amazed that so many South Asians are openly embracing Kamala Harris, when, as you mentioned, anti-Blackness is still common among many South Asian communities. What do you make of that? Well, I think the South Asians don't really have a choice. I mean, there's probably some South Asians who are so anti-Black that they are not celebrating her. But, you know, there's a big enough Democratic South Asian presence who knows that they should not publicly be so anti-Black, so they can celebrate Kamala Harris as Indian, while understanding that she's also Black. But it doesn't mean that they'd want their sons to marry her. It's very liberal right now to be an American and to celebrate Kamala for both being Black and for being Indian. These kinds of dynamics are really complicated\u2014and they're cross cut by a lot of things. Also, because there's so little representation of Asian Americans in real life, outside of the very few that are in the mainstream media or Hollywood, that we have to kind of grab onto anything that comes our way. And that is a devastating and sad part of racial politics in the United States, the true and deep and historic racial invisibility of Asian Americans.",

            "article_content": "Despite public health recommendations that people infected with the coronavirus isolate themselves to prevent further transmission, President Trump rode with Secret Service agents past his supporters outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Despite public health recommendations that people infected with the coronavirus isolate themselves to prevent further transmission, President Trump rode with Secret Service agents past his supporters outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday. Updated at 5:15 p.m. ET Last Thursday afternoon, when Hope Hicks tested positive for the coronavirus, President Trump was aboard Marine One, on his way to a campaign fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club. Hicks, a top Trump aide, had traveled with the president to a Minnesota fundraiser and rally the day before and reportedly felt ill on the plane ride back. \"The CDC guidelines are pretty clear when you identify [someone] who is infected,\" says Howard Koh, former assistant secretary of health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Anybody who had recently come in close contact with Hicks \u2014 defined as spending more than 15 minutes within 6 feet of her, in the previous two days  \u2014 is to take precautions so they don't spread the virus to others. \"I assume the president was one of those persons,\" Koh says. \"And according to the guidelines, the quarantine should have started at that point, for 14 days.\" Instead, Trump greeted over 200 supporters at the New Jersey fundraiser, flew back to Washington and mingled with dozens of aides. A few hours later, the president tweeted that he and first lady Melania Trump had also tested positive for coronavirus. From the time Hicks began showing symptoms of COVID-19, the Trump campaign and White House repeatedly made missteps that health experts say dangerously amplified the risks of spreading the virus to others. The president's failure to quarantine was a critical crossroads at which he and his team chose to flout rather than follow pandemic safeguards \u2014 a path they have stuck to, even as test results showed the virus spreading through the White House. The White House has declined to do contact tracing of a Rose Garden celebration held several days before Trump and other Republican attendees tested positive. And the president has struggled to balance the public health recommendation to isolate with his desire to be seen publicly as Election Day approaches. Much of the New Jersey fundraiser took place outdoors, which reduces the risk of transmission. But Trump also reportedly met indoors, with a select group of around 19 top donors for 45 minutes. While the donors sat indoors more than 6 feet apart, according to CNN, nobody wore masks \u2014 which increases the risks of the virus accumulating in the air and spreading to people more than 6 feet away. \"If you're indoors, basically, you're all sharing the air in that room,\" said Kim Prather, an aerosols scientist at the University of California, San Diego, in a call with reporters this week, \"We always have to remember that some masks are absolutely essential when you're indoors.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said via Twitter that health officials are working with the CDC to contact and monitor everyone who showed up to the fundraiser. Attendees are being advised to quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms for two weeks. But some attendees do not plan to comply. That's another consequence of the president's defiance of public health safeguards, says Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at American University: \"It just sends such a strong signal to the general public that these recommendations aren't important to pay attention to and aren't necessary to follow.\" It's risky, because the CDC's public health guidance contains tried-and-true recipes for dealing with coronavirus outbreaks in the absence of vaccines and therapeutics. Since no cures or prophylactics are available, the public health guidance focuses mainly on preventing the spread of coronavirus, through measures such as mask-wearing, improving fresh air flow indoors, testing likely cases and keeping people who may be infected away from others. Once the president was diagnosed with coronavirus, public health guidelines dictated that he be isolated. \"That means nobody around him for 10 days,\" the duration after symptom onset when he's most likely to be contagious, says Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. But the president, in between medical treatments at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, took a ride down the street in a sealed SUV, exposing his Secret Service bodyguards to coronavirus in the process. \"[Not isolating] is an advantage and a privilege of his office that is not afforded to pretty much any other American,\" Khan says. When the president was diagnosed, anybody who had come in close contact with him \u2014 or any other recently confirmed cases \u2014 should also have quarantined for 14 days. \"The only exception for that is, occasionally, essential workers,\" Khan says, adding that the exception was originally meant for health care workers at low risk of being infected, who would be wearing full protective gear around patients. The administration has since expanded the definition to 16 industries, including law enforcement and agriculture. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany described herself as an \"essential worker\" and continued to speak with reporters while not wearing a mask. McEnany said she had trusted that negative test results meant she was not carrying the virus. Then, on Monday, McEnany announced that she, too, had tested positive for coronavirus. \"It appears that the White House has declared themselves essential workers that are not subject to quarantine rules,\" Khan says. The outbreak among the president's circle demonstrates that relying solely on routine testing is an imperfect strategy. People are prone to false negative results in the early stages of infection, when they can still spread the disease, says Dr. William Lang, former director of the White House Medical Unit and deputy physician to the president in the George W. Bush administration. \"Testing reduces risk, but it does not eliminate risk. Wearing masks does not eliminate risk, it reduces risk,\" and the same goes for keeping a 6-foot distance from others, says Lang. \"You don't rely on any one thing to satisfactorily reduce your risk of COVID-19. You've got to do it all.\" The president returned Monday evening to the White House from hospitalization at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, still in recovery from COVID-19 and well within the window of being contagious. In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, \"Physical access to the president will be significantly limited and appropriate PPE will be worn when near him.\" However, White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on Tuesday that masks are not currently mandated inside the White House. And the White House still won't say the total number of coronavirus cases among White House personnel. But the list of people in the president's circle testing positive grows daily, and it's not clear to observers that those exposed will quarantine. Further, the president says he plans to proceed with a scheduled debate in Miami on Oct. 15 with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, which is fine by CDC guidelines, so long as the president's symptoms resolve.",

            "article_content": "Just weeks before the election, President Trump and his wife have joined the more than 7 million Americans who've tested positive for the coronavirus.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The president of the United States has tested positive for a virus that he has publicly, openly doubted and minimized at times. Melania Trump has also tested positive, as have a number of close aides and U.S. senators. Today the president's at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a patient and is expected to stay there at least several days. NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Good morning, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: And first, what do we know about the president's health? ELVING: Last night, we had an update from one of his doctors, Sean Conley, saying the president is doing, quote, \"very well,\" unquote. He said the president was not requiring supplemental oxygen but that he had started Remdesivir therapy. Now, last night, of course, the president was flown to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The White House said this was, quote, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" unquote, and that the president would be working there for a few days in the presidential office at the center where he can be monitored for further symptoms. He had reportedly experienced some coughing and congestion and a moderate fever on Friday. The diagnosis had originally been made known in the wee hours of that morning. SIMON: Ron, certainly nobody wants or wishes the coronavirus on anyone. And President Trump certainly didn't want to begin the last month before an election as a patient in Walter Reed with a disease that he's often diminished. ELVING: Clearly not. He's been yearning to get back out on the campaign trail. He wanted to have the big events that he's had in the past that are the wellspring for his style of politics. And while they cut back on those for months in deference to the virus, they tried to jumpstart them, of course, last June - that abortive event in Tulsa that didn't fill the seats and resulted in some spreading of the virus. They held off again for a while, then they began again last month with a - kind of a scaled-back version - things like airplane hangar rallies, where supporters jam into a semi-indoor space, with few wearing masks or observing social distance. It also appears, Scott, that the president should have known on Thursday or may have known on Thursday that Hope Hicks, his staff adviser, had tested positive and been in close contact with him and that that circumstance might have prompted some protective measures. But the president went on to the fundraiser in New Jersey Thursday night anyway. SIMON: And let me ask about this spread all around the circle of the president - not just Hope Hicks, but his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, his former adviser, Kellyanne Conway, three journalists, reportedly, who worked at the White House, two Republican Senators - Mike Lee of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Given the incubation period for this virus, testing has to continue. ELVING: And, of course, that is essential at this point, even beyond the usual battery of testing they had been doing. Vice President Mike Pence, to be sure - he has a debate with Democratic nominee for Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday. By the way, both those candidates have tested negative so far. And also Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, who has also tested negative, she has met in recent days with something like two dozen Republican senators in person, including Mike Lee. And the White House staff also needs to be checked. Some, of course, have been checked before, but others will be now. SIMON: And, of course, Joe Biden shared the debate stage with him in Cleveland. And there was a whole lot of shouting going on, although Mr. Biden and Jill Biden have tested negative. ELVING: Yes. Yes. So far, they have. And Biden appeared in public yesterday wearing a mask. But as NPR has reported, negative tests do not necessarily mean you're in the clear. SIMON: Ron, what's it say about this country and the coronavirus that a person with matchless access to the best medical opinion and personal security still gets infected? ELVING: It says matchless access does not guarantee immunity. You still have to do the right things and show concern for the way your actions affect others. It also shows we all need to re-examine our notions of being safe or out of the woods. No one should rely on youth or privilege or other illusions of invulnerability. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And when his frank assessment became public in the summer of 2019, he became persona non grata in Trump's Washington, overnight. Darroch, who had held the ambassadorship from 2016, resigned after President Trump said he would \"no longer deal with him.\" Darroch writes about the experience \u2014 and many others during his three-plus years in Washington \u2014 in a new book titled Collateral Damage: Britain, America, and Europe in the Age of Trump. In his first U.S. broadcast interview about the book, he says of this period: \"I wouldn't hide the fact that those were the four worst days of my career. And, you know, they're a distant memory now because we are 15 months on from that. But it was a pretty searing and difficult time.\" Darroch says he predicted Donald Trump had a good chance of winning the election four years ago. He says he thinks Joe Biden is in the \"stronger position\" now. On the moment he learned that cables had been leaked Yeah, it was a horrible moment. It was a Friday in Washington and we'd heard from London that one of the minister's private offices, one of the special advisers to the minister, had been tipped off by one of our Sunday newspapers that they had a sheaf of documents from Washington, from the embassy and the newspaper sportingly provided us with a kind of page from each of them so that it was a bit of research to try and find out what the whole documents were in each case. And most of them were cables with quite a wide circulation, comparatively recent. One was talking about the state visit. One was talking about the president's first rally where he had launched his 2020 election campaign. On what he wrote in the cables But the one that had kind of stopped me in my tracks and made me think this is really bad was a letter I had written to, as you say, a tiny group of people in Whitehall, very senior people in Whitehall as preparation for a senior level of ministerial discussion about relations with the new administration in the U.S. It was written about six months into the Trump administration and some of the comments in it were about the president \u2014 actually inept and dysfunctional was about the administration as a whole. And remember, there had been a lot of changes in the first six months and some policies had been introduced and blocked in the courts. And it was proving quite difficult to track what the administration was going to deliver. So, I called it as I saw it. And we are paid to give frank, clear assessments \u2014 but confidential assessments \u2014 to our ministers of what's going on. And so, of course, you know, I was furious that this had leaked and I realized instantly that it put my posting in jeopardy. On standing by his judgments I have said publicly several times since that, you know, I stand by my judgments ... I think it's been written a thousand times that this was a president who thrived on chaos and disruption and who didn't believe in, or didn't operate by, the normal processes and structures and norms, if you like, of the office. And, you know, whether you think he's done a great job, or that his record is more mixed, I think it's inarguable that he has stuck to that very unique style of conducting the presidency. ... So I kind of stand by my judgments, though I wish they had not become they had not become internationally famous. On whether he knows who leaked the cables I don't have suspicions based on any inside knowledge or facts or particular leads. You know, I'm not a detective. And the police, when I talked to them right at the start of the investigation, I didn't have any strong leads either. So it's all guesswork. It could have been someone ... who thought I was being strongly unfair to the president. It could have been because I was six months or so from the end of my term. So, you know, my time was running out. It could have been about who should succeed me, of trying to make sure that it was someone who had a political rather than a diplomatic background or who was strongly Brexit-supporting or whatever. But it's all guesswork. On his decision to resign I knew from the moment that the stuff leaked and the articles appeared that that [Trump] would respond \u2014 and I realized very quickly that this put my position in jeopardy. ... As you know, that's his style. And so I wouldn't have known what particular words he would use, but I guessed it would be that sort of style. So this may sound surprising, but I wasn't surprised by it. I was a bit surprised by the second half of that tweet or one of the tweets about me, which carried on into an attack on the then-prime minister, Theresa May, and how she was handling Brexit, because I just wondered what prompted him to go on to that point in an attack on me. But no, I mean, it was you know, the words that really made a difference were \u2014 to my thinking \u2014 were we will \"no longer deal with him.\" And I started to think, well, your job here as an ambassador depends on having the best channels to the highest level of the administration. And if you don't have those, then you can't really do the job \u2014 and this is such an important posting \u2014 that British interests need an ambassador who has the best possible contacts. So I started to think then the job had become, my position had become, untenable. On the positive side, I have to say, this was one of the most fascinating periods in history. The combination of the election of Donald Trump as president and Brexit in the U.K. ... So it was a privilege to be here at that time. ... I wouldn't hide the fact that those were the four worst days of my career. And, you know, they're a distant memory now because we are 15 months on from that. But it was a pretty searing and difficult time. And I'm really glad that I resigned quickly rather than trying to hang on, because I think I would have had to leave sooner or later. And I think it would have been humiliating to sort of cling on and wait for stories in London saying I was about to be removed or whatever. So I feel it was the right decision to resign when I did, which was on the Wednesday \u2014 actually took the decision on Tuesday night \u2014 after the leaks. On his U.S. presidential election predictions Do you know when [Trump] won, there were lots of stories in 2016 \u2014 and a lot of stories in the British press \u2014 that no one had seen this coming. And as I recall in the book ... I wrote in February 2016, which I think was quite early before others were calling it, but I was certain that Trump would win the nomination. And given how unpopular Hillary Clinton seemed and given what I thought were some flaws in her as a candidate, I thought it was possible that Trump could win the presidency. Now, look, [2020] is a really difficult one to call it for two reasons. Well, I think [it will be] Joe Biden or several reasons. Joe Biden has \u2014 he's in a stronger position than [Hillary Clinton] ... Joe Biden's lead [in the polls] seems to be both bigger and more stable. Second, Donald Trump ran as the absolute outsider in 2016, and he's now running with a record on which he can be attacked. So it's not like he can come with a completely clean slate and say \u2014 I've nothing to do with Washington, I'm going to clean up this mess and all of those things. So you have to say, I guess, that Joe Biden is the narrow favorite. And when I look at the English bookmakers, the British bookmakers, they all have Joe Biden as a very narrow favorite. But I'll tell you this, first of all, although national polls show a big lead, it's all about the battleground states. And I just noticed that his lead is smaller in the battleground states, and when the lead gets quite smaller, gets within the margin of error, and you start to wonder about it. Second, you still have the debates to come and you'll have 80 plus million Americans watching those debates. And some of them may take decisions on the basis of what they see. And I think Donald Trump is quite a hard guy to debate with for a whole range of reasons that we could discuss at length. ... I mean, yes, I think the bookmakers are right to say that Biden is a narrow favorite. But I tell people here \u2014 do not rule out a second term President Trump.",

No reader should skip the prologue to Bob Woodward's new book on President Trump, because the author puts his best scene on its first page. Woodward's Rage opens on the Oval Office, where the two top officials from the president's national security team are telling him that COVID-19 is a major threat to the U.S. and far worse than the flu. \"This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,\" says Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser (Trump's fourth). \"This is going to be the roughest thing you face.\" O'Brien's statement makes the president's head \"pop up,\" but it is immediately seconded by O'Brien's principal deputy, Matt Pottinger, whom Woodward reports was also present. Pottinger is a China scholar and former intelligence officer in the Marines who had lived in China seven years and spoke fluent Mandarin. Rage by Bob Woodward\n                \n                    \n                    Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption The date on this conversation leaps out from the book's very first sentence: Jan. 28. O'Brien and Pottinger were elevating the issue because days earlier Trump had dismissed the virus at a conference in Switzerland: \"It's one person coming in from China,\" Trump had said. \"We have it under control. It's going to be just fine. We've already handled it pretty well.\" Three days later, urged on by O'Brien and Pottinger and a chorus of scientists including Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dr. Robert Redfield, Trump ordered a shutdown of travel from China to the United States. He would later claim, in interviews with Woodward and elsewhere, that he made this move in defiance of his closest advisers. Woodward has Trump saying there had been a score of advisers present and \"everyone in that room except me did not want to have that ban.\" \"I always wanted to play it down\" Woodward also makes clear that Trump knew early on that the disease could be spread without physical contact and could be transmitted by people showing no symptoms of infection. \"It goes through air,\" he told Woodward in a Feb. 7 phone call not previously reported. \"So that's a tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.\" At another point in the Feb. 7 conversation, Trump says COVID-19 could be deadlier than the flu, \"maybe five times more deadly.\" Stunning, because throughout the crucial month of February the president was sending a totally different signal to the American public. The same week he talked to Woodward, Trump in public uttered his now infamous lines about how \"when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away\" and \"I think it's going to work out good, we only have 11 cases and they're all getting better.\" Throughout the month, he bragged of limiting the invader to a handful of cases that were \"all getting better\" and would \"soon be down to zero.\" On Feb. 28, at a rally in South Carolina, he called Democrats' criticism of his handling of the virus \"their new hoax.\" Attendees at the rally told reporters they thought the whole story of the virus was a media creation. The following day, the first U.S. death was announced, and Trump opened his news conference talking about progress in Afghanistan. Woodward quotes a subsequent interview on March 19, wherein Trump says: \"I always wanted to play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\" Where did Woodward get these arresting statements? They were part of a series of interviews Trump granted the venerable journalist from The Washington Post \u2014 a total of 17 in all, stretching from December to late July. Was there no one in Trump's communications office to question this commitment of the president's time? Who but Trump could have arranged 17 interviews with a man who had written critically of eight presidents, including an earlier book characterizing Trump as unprepared and unfit for his office, a national disaster waiting to happen? \"Pray to God we don't have a crisis,\" Woodward said when Fear first appeared. Curiously, the earlier Woodward book featured zero interview material from Trump \u2014 there had been no interview. The president said his staff had not told him of Woodward's many requests. This time around, as though to compensate and produce a better narrative, Trump goes to the opposite extreme. (\"Let's see if we can get a good book,\" he says. \"That is, if you're willing to write it.\") At times the interviews are in the White House, at times they are impromptu calls the president places to Woodward's personal phone. At times, they seem serious interchanges; at times they are show-and-tell sessions to win the journalist over. Trump has what Woodward calls \"props,\" such as a stack of parchment signifying judicial appointments, or a wall poster-size picture of Trump with Kim Jong Un. On one occasion, Trump orders his aide Dan Scavino to screen a video of Sen. Kamala Harris and other Democrats watching the State of the Union speech. Trump shouts: \"Hate! See the hate!\" Naming names This is Woodward's 20th book. The first was All the President's Men, the inside story of the reporting of Woodward and Carl Bernstein that led to criminal prosecutions and impeachment proceedings and the eventual resignation of President Richard M. Nixon nearly half a century ago. That work was, and remains, controversial for its reliance on unnamed sources. Woodward's subsequent decades of work have been widely acclaimed but also often been held at arm's length for their reliance on \"blind quotes.\" But in this book, Woodward is making many, if not all, his sources plain. The stars are former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, both of whom had troubled tenures. (In Coats' case, he was removed from service by Trump via tweet while he was golfing at one of Trump's clubs.) Mattis had been conspicuous in his reticence to criticize the president. But he broke his silence this summer after mounted police cleared protesters from Washington's Lafayette Square so the president could have a photo opp in front of the neighboring St. John's Church. He said Trump was the first president he had served (of eight) who \"had not even tried\" to unite the country. Here, Mattis walks us through the president's troubled relations with experts of all kinds, especially military and foreign policy experts such as himself and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was also humiliated and denigrated upon his departure. Coats details his back-and-forth tension between loyalty to the chief executive and dismay at Trump's handling of facts and information. The president, he says, prefers to tell the story the way he prefers to see it \u2014 and the way he wants it told \u2014 regardless of the realities at hand. From among the president's intimates, the primary voices are his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina. Though neither is directly critical of Trump, Woodward uses Kushner as a \"reflector\" of the central subject and Graham as a friend and adviser who has at least occasional points of disagreement with The Boss. Kushner offers up four things to read to understand Trump, one of which is Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -- and his Cheshire Cat. Graham is characteristically intriguing, talking about his years of processing Trump's judicial appointments (a major trophy for the administration and Republican Senate). Graham says that \"we've weeded out some real wackos\" on the way to installing 300 nominees to the federal bench \u2014 where they all now have lifetime appointments. Graham also relates the concerns he has heard in \"frequent conversations\" with Chief Justice John Roberts, who he says \"doesn't want the Court, I think labeled as a political party.\" Graham also criticizes the photo op at St. John's Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House, and the mounted police who cleared the square to make it possible. Graham says he scolded Trump and told him people didn't like the way he held up the Bible. \"Christians liked it,\" Trump says, according to Graham, who says he's a Christian and did not. A plethora of tell-alls Trump books tend to fall in two categories. There are firsthand tell-alls penned by family and former associates, and then there are compendia of Trump stories compiled or witnessed by reporters and commentators. Woodward sold a great many copies of Fear, and this addition stands to dominate the latest crop as well. And it is a bumper crop. This month has already seen a scabrous collection from Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal attorney and fixer. Later this month we are expecting to hear from former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who had been replaced by John Bolton, whose scathing review of Trump on the world stage came out over the summer. And there are the far more personal stories from Mary Trump, a psychologist who is the president's niece, and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the former staffer and best friend of first lady Melania Trump. Suffice it to say both share with a vengeance. All of this was already out or in the pipeline before The Atlantic published the story that has preoccupied much of the media for a week, quoting four unnamed sources who say the president referred to dead soldiers personnel as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\" Are these books coming out now because the election is just eight weeks away? Yes, of course they are. Critical of the president in varying degrees of detail and high dudgeon, the books speak to those voters still making up their minds. They also reflect their authors' and publishers' sure knowledge that Trump books will sell better before the election than after (especially if he loses). Playing the audiotape Most of the later chapters in Rage are devoted to chronicling Woodward's 17 interviews with the president. Trump shifts from charming to combative, pleading for understanding and sympathy one moment and denouncing everyone in sight the next. But he is always selling, always pushing his narrative, always bending the reality. When Woodward asks in June about \"white privilege\" and whether they both should have more empathy for African Americans, Trump responds: \"You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you. Wow. No, I don't feel that way at all.\" In one exchange, Trump says he's No. 1 on Twitter and Facebook. Woodward interjects that Trump is ninth in followers on Twitter (below former President Barack Obama) and there are dozens ahead of him on Facebook. At another point, discussing how well he gets along with Turkey's brutish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Trump seems almost reflective: \"It's funny the relationships I have [with foreign leaders], the tougher and meaner they are the better I get along with them. You know? Explain that to me someday, okay?\" Still, with all the distractions, COVID-19 comes to dominate the story, as it has come to dominate everything else. And on that basis alone, Woodward seems comfortable in his conclusion to his epilogue, which is far more conclusive than in Fear. The final sentence can be taken with the first sentence of the prologue as a frame for the entire book: \"When his performance as president is taken in its entirety, I can only reach one conclusion: Trump is the wrong man for the job.\"",

            "article_content": "A purge at the U.S. Agency for Global Media has fueled concerns that broadcasters like Radio Free Europe will be turned into distributors of propaganda on behalf of the Trump administration.\n                \n                    \n                    Michal Kamary/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption A purge at the U.S. Agency for Global Media has fueled concerns that broadcasters like Radio Free Europe will be turned into distributors of propaganda on behalf of the Trump administration. A sweeping purge of executives at U.S. government media outlets widened this week. At least six of the top 10 executives at the U.S. Agency for Global Media were removed from their posts on Wednesday. Critics say the housecleaning  threatens to destroy the firewall meant to separate government news entities from the White House. They warn it could turn broadcasters such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe into distributors of propaganda on behalf of the Trump administration. The shake-up started in June after President Trump appointed a new CEO and director at the agency, conservative documentary filmmaker Michael Pack. Chief Financial Officer Grant Turner, who had been USAGM's acting CEO and director before Pack's arrival, is the most senior official affected. He had returned to the role of the company's chief financial officer. Now he has been put on administrative leave. Also placed on administrative leave, according to three agency sources, are David Kligerman, the agency's general counsel; Matthew Walsh, the deputy director for operations; Shawn Powers, the chief strategy officer; Oanh Tran, USAGM's executive director; and Marie Lennon, the director of management services and a 35-year employee of the federal government. All also had their security clearances suspended. Asked about the purge, a USAGM spokesperson \u2014 who insisted on not being named \u2014 said in an email that his agency \"is unable to comment on individual personnel matters.\" \"We took action to restore integrity to and respect for the rule of law in our work at USAGM,\" the agency spokesperson said in a prepared statement. \"We will take additional steps to return this agency to its glory days.\" The reference to the \"rule of law\" could be seen as a reference to an ongoing internal investigation at the agency. In a July 23 staff email, Pack said there had been \"systematic, severe and fundamental security failures,\" according to a report posted Friday on VOA's website. The probe is being done, Pack said, because \"the failures identified compromise the agency's ability to fulfill its mission, undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal workforce, and pose a threat to U.S. national security.\" Last week, Pack made public a confidential July 97-page report from the Office of Personnel Management that faults the screening of foreigners working at USAGM and the entities it oversees. It criticizes the agency for overstepping federal rules by requiring extensive information about the personal finances of those being vetted. Ousted agency officials scoff at the allegation of security lapses. \"The OPM report really is kind of a cover to move people out,\" says Turner, the sidelined CFO. \"If anything, we have tried to have a stricter standard in security investigations.\" Kligerman, the sacked general counsel, said the spokesperson's \"glory days\" reference \"speaks for itself: It's very Stalinesque.\" \"This is a pretextual purge,\" Kligerman added in an interview. \"I think it's designed to remove the career leadership of the agency \u2014 the people who are in charge of enforcing the rules and norms.\" Turner tells NPR that in his many years working in Washington under both Republican and Democratic presidents, he has never seen anything quite like what has happened at USAGM since Pack became its leader. \"There's gross mismanagement on such an enormous order,\" Turner says. \"I don't know if it's intentional or simply incompetence, or if it's a kind of malevolence. It's probably a badge of honor to be fired by folks in this administration.\" As an example of the new climate pervading the agency, Turner cites the removal of a photo of former USAGM CEO and president, John Lansing, that had hung on the wall in the main hallway. Also removed was a quote from Lansing that read, \"A set of unimpeachable facts, and the existence of a baseline of truth, is the foundation that undergirds our democracy, its institutions, and the health, safety and security of all American citizens.\" Lansing, who is now NPR's president and CEO, issued a statement sharply criticizing the latest personnel ousters at USAGM as well as the forced departure in June of the heads of global media organizations such as the Voice of America. He called those affected \"some of the finest public servants I have ever had the privilege to work with.\" \"Pack's attempt to discredit them is merely a smokescreen for his attempt to dismantle the legitimate editorial independence of VOA in favor of propagandizing the Agency to favor the Administration,\" he said. Lansing added that such action would violate the law establishing USAGM and the broadcasters it oversees. \"Dismantling the Agency and converting it to an American version of propaganda would serve only to discredit 75 years of distinguished work and would serve to prop up and legitimize authoritarian media control around the world.\" Agency insiders say visa extensions for foreign staffers employed at USAGM were abruptly put on hold in June, raising fears that some may have to return to authoritarian countries such as China and face harsh reprisals for their work in the U.S. Turner and others describe a climate of fear and self-censorship among those who still have their jobs at the agency. \"Here are a bunch of civil servants who want to do things by the book,\" the former acting CEO and director of USAGM says of the purge. \"They don't want to play by the book.\" Pack will likely have some explaining to do when he appears before a Sept. 24 hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight of USAGM. \"Michael Pack is once again attempting to purge USAGM of the apolitical, career officials who have helped ensure that the agency fulfills its mission to provide unbiased news and information around the world,\" declared Rep. Elliot Engel, the New York Democrat who chairs that committee. \"He is destroying the decades-old legacy of America's international broadcasting efforts,\" Engel added, \"in a clear attempt to transform the agency into an ideological mouthpiece to promote Donald Trump in advance of the election.\" Disclosure: Due to NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published.",

In the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist's first book, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration, Wilkerson evinced a rare ability to craft deeply insightful analysis of deeply researched evidence \u2014 both historical and contemporary \u2014 in harmonious structures of language and form. Now, in her sophomore effort, the former New York Times Chicago bureau chief does not disappoint. Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents is a masterwork of writing \u2014 a profound achievement of scholarship and research that stands also as a triumph of both visceral storytelling and cogent analysis. What is caste? According to Wilkerson, \"caste is the granting or withholding of respect, status, honor, attention, privileges, resources, benefit of the doubt, and human kindness to someone on the basis of their perceived rank or standing in the hierarchy.\" Racism and casteism do overlap, she writes, noting that \"what some people call racism could be seen as merely one manifestation of the degree to which we have internalized the larger American caste system.\" Wilkerson's central thesis is that caste, while a global occurrence, achieves its most violent manifestation in the treatment of American Blacks, set at the lowest level in society through historical and contemporary oppression, marginalization and violence \u2014 all legally maintained through systems of law and order. \"The English in North America developed the most rigid and exclusionist from of race ideology,\" Wilkerson writes, quoting the anthropologists Audrey and Brian Smedley. Wilkerson establishes a correlation between American Blacks, whom she names the \"American untouchables\" and the Indian \"untouchables,\" or Dalits, as the lowest caste; while whites in America are the dominant, highest caste equivalent to the Indian Brahmins. Describing the treatment of Blacks in America, Wilkerson writes: \"The institution of slavery was, for a quarter millennium, the conversion of human beings into currency, into machines who existed solely for the profit of their owners, to be worked as long as the owners desired, who had no rights over their bodies or loved ones, who could be mortgaged, bred, won in a bet, given as wedding presents, bequeathed to heirs, sold away from spouses or children to convene an owner's debts or to spite a rival or to settle an estate. They were regularly whipped, raped, and branded, subjected to any whim or distemper of the people who owned them. Some were castrated or endured other tortures too grisly for these pages, tortures that the Geneva Conventions would have banned as war crimes had the conventions applied to people of African descent on this soil.\" Wilkerson's argument is based on an exploration of what she names the three resonant caste systems in history: the Indian caste system, the Nazi caste system and the American caste system \u2014 which the Nazis researched when creating their own. \"There were no other models for miscegenation law that the Nazis could find in the world,\" Wilkerson writes, citing Yale legal historian James Q. Whitman as evidence: \"'Their overwhelming interest was in the 'classic example,' the United States of America.\" Wilkerson supports her analysis with an immense compendium of documented research that spans centuries. Through her detailed historical research, she unearths evidence that the violence toward Blacks that the American caste system espoused was too much even for the Nazis; they balked at replicating some of the more horrific acts of American racism toward Blacks. \"[Herbert] Kier was just one of several Nazi researchers who thought American law went overboard,\" Wilkerson writes, while others, like Hans F. K. G\u00fcnter, thought the American laws so outrageous as to be untrue. Caste, Wilkerson posits, is dependent upon the dehumanization of the other, most powerfully seen in the use of Jews and Blacks as the subject of horrific experiments by the respective dominant caste systems of Germany and America. \"German scientists and SS doctors conducted more than two dozen types of experiments on Jews and others they held captive,\" while \"in the United States, from slavery well into the twentieth century, doctors used African-Americans as a supply chain for experimentation, as subjects deprived of either consent or anesthesia,\" Wilkerson writes. One of the most poignant examples Wilkerson describes is the violence done by Dr. J. Marion Sims, lauded as the founder of American gynecology, on the bodies of Black women: \"He came to his discoveries by acquiring enslaved women in Alabama and conducting savage surgeries that often ended in disfigurement or death. He refused to administer anesthesia, saying vaginal surgery on them was not painful enough to justify the trouble. ...\" Wilkerson says Sims would \"invite leading men in town and apprentices in to see for themselves. He later wrote, 'I saw everything as no man had seen before.' \" Medical experiments were also carried out on Black men and Black children: Wilkerson notes Harriet Washington's research in Medical Apartheid in which a plantation doctor \"made incisions into a black baby's head to test a theory for curing seizures\" with \"cobbler's tools\" and \"the point of a crooked awl.\" The horror is legion. Wilkerson documents the pogroms of violence against the caste of American untouchables as waves throughout history \u2014 whether the violence of slavery or the waves of vigilante violence that that rose during Reconstruction and have continued since; incidents such the Ocoee, Fla., massacre in 1920 or the 1921 destruction of Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Okla., are set in a continuum that meets with the attacks on Black Americans in Birmingham, Ala., 40 years later in the 1960s, and then again in Charleston, S.C., by Dylann Roof on a Black church five years ago. This violent terror is a marker of the caste system, Wilkerson writes. The descriptions are vivid in their horror; the connections travel across history and time to resonate in the mind. This structural move is a classic trademark of Wilkerson's style, and one of the attributes of her unique voice that imbues her writing with such textured depth. Wilkerson's use of a poetic focus on imagery and detailed characterization allows us an intimate and personal relationship with the lives of those she chronicles; when this empathic closeness is juxtaposed with the harsh brutality of the historical record the contrast is resonant and haunting, becoming a towering memorial to those violated by the violence of caste. Caste is divided into six sections exploring the various aspects of caste: its origins, its sustainment and far-reaching \"tentacles,\" and its effects \u2014 whether detrimental health for the givers and receivers of racism or the expected white supremacist backlash to the election of the first president of recognizable Black heritage: \"The ability of a black person to supplant the racial caste system,\" Wilkerson writes, quoting the political scientist Andra Gillespie of Emory University, was \"the manifestation of a nightmare which would need to be resisted.\" Although a claim can be made that the opening chapter or two on the fallout of the 2016 election appear dated, this to be fair, is only because of what has happened to America in the interim since Wilkerson penned those words. What is problematic is the glaring absence of Africa in a book that aims to position itself as a seminal text on the concept of a global caste system and the positioning of Blackness within that global caste system. Wilkerson glances at this briefly with a scant mention of South Africa in a couple of paragraphs and by quoting a woman identified only as a Nigerian playwright saying that \"there are no Black people in Africa\" \u2014 and then keeps it moving. Both are moments that do need to be unpacked. It is understandable why Wilkerson does not walk through this door to explore caste in Africa \u2014 Caste is 400 pages before adding the impressive list of research sources. But if Wilkerson is not opening that door, there does need to be an acknowledgement of why not, an acknowledgement of that absence. Simply put: With colonization, European colonizers brought their caste system to Africa and implemented it over the already existing caste systems among many African ethnic groups. Perhaps the absence of Africa is because of the caste system Wilkerson speaks of itself \u2014 to get people in the dominant caste to care about a narrative about Blackness and Brownness, about the lower castes, there must be a strong presence of whiteness in the conversation because it is the dominant caste system within the narrative. And thus the caste system rears its head to affect a work about the caste system in real time. This points, ultimately, to the role of personal accountability within a caste system. What does one do with this knowledge of the violence of caste? Does one perpetuate it? Eradicate it? Interestingly, Wilkerson at times seems to argue not for an eradication of caste, but to create space for her, and others she meets, who have been miscast in their \"caste\" \u2014 regulated to the lowest caste when by intelligence or other attribute they should be in the higher caste, or vice versa. \"We had defied our caste assignments: He was not a warrior or ruler. He was a geologist. I was not a domestic. I was an author,\" Wilkerson writes. Even the ending \"Awakening\" section, couched as a look forward, is depicted less of an articulation of the possibilities of a world without caste, and more of her desire simply to be seen as equal to those of the dominant caste. In this, Wilkerson leans to biology. She offers the example of wolves as her support for the necessity of this hierarchal structure \u2014 the necessity not just of the alpha, but of the omega, or the underdog, beaten and abused by the others, the \"untouchable.\" When the underdog dies, she writes, the whole pack is destabilized. No one wants to be the lowest of the low, \"the scapegoat,\" but the pack needs one to survive. Without the untouchable, Wilkerson argues here, society collapses. The untouchable is needed. Wilkerson just does not want to be one. Writes Wilkerson: \"The great tragedy among humans is that people have often been assigned to or seen as qualified for alpha positions \u2014 as CEOs, quarterbacks, coaches, directors of film, presidents of colleges or countries \u2014 not necessarily on the basis of innate leadership traits but, historically on the basis of having been born to the dominant caste or the dominant gender or to the right family within the dominant caste.\" I would argue that the tragedy, rather, is the need for these positions such as \"omega\" to still exist, which then justifies the need for this caste structure and its continued existence \u2014 even if it exists with Wilkerson's proffered edit that would allow an individual, no matter \"background or caste,\" to hop into their desired caste and profit from the continued oppression of others the caste system welds. If we are to look at biology as evidence, let us consider the research of Eli D. Strauss and Kay E. Holekamp on hyenas in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the official journal of the National Academy of Sciences, which offers another model for social positioning. Within the hyena community, as with wolves, there is a strict hierarchy of dominant caste and lower castes. But, if a female understands the hierarchy as unjust and challenges a more dominant member of the higher caste and her female peer group agrees with her, they will rise up across caste and challenge the dominant caste; if this female cross-caste coalition wins, the hierarchy is destabilized, and this radical feminist hyena and her cross-caste pack become the new dominant caste. It is not enough, but it is a start. Let us think not just about our own individual desires to be seen as a member of the dominant caste and benefit accordingly, but about the necessity to challenge this entire system of oppression radically. Let us think not just about replicating oppressive patriarchal systems but about alternative models such as matrilineal cross-cultural communication and connection. Let us look not to the wolves, but to the hyenas. Hope Wabuke is a poet, writer and assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.",

Above, a sign in Jackson, Miss., in May 1961. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson says racism is an insufficient term for the systemic oppression of Black people in America. Instead, she prefers to refer to America as having a \"caste\" system. Wilkerson describes caste an artificial hierarchy that helps determine standing and respect, assumptions of beauty and competence, and even who gets benefit of the doubt and access to resources. \"Caste focuses in on the infrastructure of our divisions and the rankings, whereas race is the metric that's used to determine one's place in that,\" she says. Wilkerson notes that the concept of caste has been around for thousands of years: \"[Caste] predates the idea of race, which is ... only 400 or 500 years old, dating back to the transatlantic slave trade.\" Caste, she adds, \"is the term that is more precise [than race]; it is more comprehensive, and it gets at the underlying infrastructure that often we cannot see, but that is there undergirding much of the inequality and injustices and disparities that we live with in this country.\" Wilkerson's 2010 book, The Warmth of Other Suns, focused on the great migration of African Americans from the South to the North during the 20th century. In her new book, Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, Wilkerson says that acknowledging America's caste system deepens our understanding of what Black people are up against in the United States. On hearing a Nigerian-born playwright say that there are no Black people in Africa It's so shocking to our ears, because, of course, we say that there is an entire subcontinent of people who we would view as Black, but what she was saying was that until you come to the United States, they themselves do not see themselves as Black, they are Igbo ... or they are Yoruba or whatever it is that they are in terms of their ethnicity and identity. It is only when they enter into a multilayered caste structure ... a hierarchy such as this, do they then have to think of themselves as Black. But back where they are from, they do not have to think of themselves as Black, because Black is not the primary metric of determining one's identity. On how being \"white\" is an American innovation It's an innovation that is only several hundred years old, dating back to the time of the transatlantic slave trade. And that is because before that time, there were humans on the land wherever they happened to be on this planet, and because of the way people were living on the land, they were merely who they were. They were Irish or they were German or they were Polish or Hungarian, and only [thought of themselves as white] after the transatlantic slave trade, only after people who had been spread out all over the world converged in this one space \u2014 the New World \u2014 to create a new country, a new culture where all of these people were then interacting and having to figure out how they were going to relate to one another. That is when you have a caste system that emerges, a caste system that emerges that instantly relegates those who were brought in to be enslaved ... to the very bottom of the caste system, and then elevated those who looked like those who had who created the caste system \u2014 meaning those who were British and Western Europeans \u2014 at the very top of the caste system. And anyone who entered that caste system had to then navigate and figure out how were they [were] going to manage, how are they [were] going to survive and succeed in this system. And also upon arrival, discovering that they were assigned to a particular category, whether they [wished] to be in it or not. That means that until arriving here, people who were Irish, people who were Hungarian, people who were Polish would not have identified themselves back in the 19th century as being white, but only in connection to the gradations and ranking that occurred and was created in the United States \u2014 that is where the designation of white, the designation of Black and those in between came to have meaning. On where people of color who are not Black fit into the caste system There was a tremendous churning at the beginning of the 20th century of people who were arriving in these undetermined or middle groups that did not fit neatly into the bipolar structure that America had created. And at the beginning of the 20th century, there were petitions to the Supreme Court, petitions to the government, for clarity about where they would fit in. And they were often petitioning to be admitted to the dominant caste. One of the examples, a Japanese immigrant petitioned to qualify for being Caucasian because he said, \"My skin is actually whiter than many people that I identified as white in America. I should qualify to be considered Caucasian.\" And his petition was rejected by the Supreme Court. But these are all examples of the long-standing uncertainties about who fits where when you have a caste system that is bipolar [Black and white], such as the one that was created here. On the surprising origin of the term \"Caucasian\" Wilkerson won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her book about the Great Migration, The Warmth of Other Suns.\n\n                    \n                    Joe Henson/Penguin Random House\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wilkerson won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her book about the Great Migration, The Warmth of Other Suns. There was a physician, a German physician in the 18th century who had this obsession with skulls, and he collected these skulls from all over the world and his effort to determine who was supreme in humanity. So he had skulls from all over the world, and he identified the most beautiful skulls as having come from the area around the Caucasus Mountains. And as a result of that, because they were, in his view, so beautiful, he decided to identify this skull as Caucasian clearly, and to name the group to which he belonged as Caucasians. In other words, this was the group that was the most beautiful and perfect of all groups of humanity. This was a group that he presumed himself to belong to \u2014 though he was German. And this was the group that he described as European, and thus the word \"Caucasian\" actually refers to people who come from the Caucasus Mountains. Now, what's fascinating about that as well is that the very people who were from that region of the world actually are among those who had the most difficult time gaining entry to the United States as citizens as white in the early 20th century, because they did not qualify based upon the preferences for those who were from Northern European ancestry. On how the U.S. used immigration as a legal way to maintain the caste system Curating the population means deciding who gets to be a part of it and where they fit in upon entry, and so there is a tremendous effort at the end of the 19th century, the beginning of the 20th century, with the rise of eugenics and this growing belief in the gradations of humankind that they wanted to keep the population closer to what it had been at the founding of the country. And so there was an effort to restrict who could come into the country if they were not of Western European descent. Tremendous back and forth, tremendous efforts on the part of eugenicists who then held sway in the popular imagination, tremendous effort to keep out people who we now would view as part of the dominant group. It was a form of curating who could become a part of the United States and where they would fit in, and they used immigration laws to determine who would be able to get access to that dominant group. On why the Nazis studied American Jim Crow laws I have to say that my focus was not initially on the Nazis themselves, but rather on how Germany has worked in the decades after the war to reconcile its history. But the deeper that I got, and the more that I looked into this, the deeper I searched, I discovered these connections that I would never have imagined. It turned out that German eugenicists were in continuing dialogue with American eugenicists. Books by American eugenicists were big sellers in Germany in the years leading up to the Third Reich. And then, of course, the Nazis needed no one to teach them how to hate. But what they did was they sent researchers to study America's Jim Crow laws. They actually sent researchers to America to study how Americans had subjugated African Americans, what would be considered the subordinated caste. And they actually debated and consulted American law as they were devising the Nuremberg Laws and as they were looking at those laws in the United States. They couldn't understand why, from their perspective, the group that they had identified as the subordinated caste was not recognized in the United States in the same way. So that was the unusual interconnectedness that I never would have imagined. On the Nazi reaction to America's \"one drop rule,\" which maintained that a person with any amount of Black blood would be considered Black That idea of the one drop rule, that was viewed as too extreme to [the Nazis]. It was stunning to hear that. ... The Nazis, in trying to create their own caste system, what could be considered a caste system, went to great lengths to really think hard about who should qualify as Aryan, because they felt that they wanted to include as many people as they possibly could, ironically enough, and as they looked at the United States, it did not make sense to them that a single drop of Black blood would make someone Black, that they could not and did not accept. And in defining and creating their own hierarchy, they ended up coming up with a different configuration that actually encompassed more people into the Aryan side than would have been considered than the equivalent would have been in the United States.

            "article_content": "It's a famous scene by now: Andr\u00e9 3000 in a purple dashiki, Big Boi in an Atlanta Braves jersey, the pair ascending the steps of the stage at the 1995 Source Awards to accept the trophy for New Artist of the Year amid a flurry of boos from a less-than-pleased audience. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine OutKast catching jeers in any room of self-proclaimed hip-hop lovers. Yet here they were, just over a year removed from their debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, still underdogs, still unwelcome, still outcasts. There's a saying that history is written by the victors, and Andr\u00e9 3000 foretold a million stories that night when, on enemy territory, he proudly issued a proclamation, or a prophecy: \"It's like this, the South got something to say.\" To understand the fire in Andr\u00e9 3000's belly in that moment is to understand the ways in which Southerners, particularly Black Southerners, have been scorned and ostracized. It's to know what it is to walk into rooms thousands of miles from home and heart carrying centuries' worth of collective projected shame and have to decide whether to turn it up or off. The election year attitudes that have emerged about Black folk in the South \u2014 like their counterparts in the Midwest \u2014 reveal how they are often othered or erased in mainstream imaginings of the region until suddenly they're seen, called on to produce or help produce a desired result. Get it \"wrong,\" and you will learn what the rest of the country thinks of you. The notion of \"coastal elites\" has taken on a particularly loaded connotation in the Trump era, but the lack of acknowledgement of the ways in which life differs outside the progressive East and West corridors is real. That tension comes to bear in hip-hop, much the way all facets of life, for better and worse, are exposed and exaggerated within music and the mechanisms that power it. There's long been a dismissal of Southern rap that's rooted in a kind of respectability politics that mirrors that of anti-Black racism and white classism \u2014 Southerners, and by extension their contributions to rap, are often treated as though they are anti-intellectual and unsophisticated. It's rarely considered that Southern rap sounds the way it does as an aesthetic decision rather than due to inability, and its practitioners are saddled with the burden of disproving that assumption rather than the privilege of showing up on their own terms. Their effectiveness is measured by their ability to mimic the sound of somewhere else \u2014 to be something other than what they are. Those who win respect often do so on the basis of exceptionalism. For decades, the East Coast's cultural hegemony, which delineates the rap South as inferior, has been upheld and largely uninterrogated, most quantifiably by the media. In the '90s and early 2000s, when the Source was held as the bible for all things hip-hop, only two Southern artists ever received the coveted 5 Mic rating \u2014 OutKast, for Aquemini, and Scarface, for The Fix. The magazine's 1998 list of the top 100 albums included only four Southern releases. A 2011 XXL special edition covering the 250 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of the '90s included only 26 from the South. A 2012 Rolling Stone list of the 50 Greatest Rap Songs featured four (a 2017 update of the 100 Greatest Rap Songs only turned up 11 more); a 2017 Complex list of the 90 Best Rap Albums of the '90s managed 15; a 2019 XXL list of the 50 Best albums of the 2000s yielded 11; the results of a 2019 BBC poll of 108 critics about the 25 best rap songs turned up four. At some point, these things aren't just coincidence or a matter of some sort of objective measure about what is and isn't great or is and isn't important. It's bias and erasure begetting more bias and more erasure \u2014 not unlike what women in rap (and women in music as a whole) continue to face. How do we come to place so much worth and power in the people and institutions that decide we have little? How was it that, for so long, the story of hip-hop \u2014 a genre prized for its ability to make visible those who have been rendered invisible \u2014 has involved largely writing off and out the section of the country that houses the highest percentage of Black people? And how is that anything other than a deliberate devaluing of a people's stories, language and expression? Yet 25 years removed from OutKast's win, a significant portion of popular rap comes from or sounds like the South. Those dark 808s, sharp snares, speeding hi-hats and moody minor-key melodies \u2014 all staples of trap music. It's been this way for the past 15 or so years, since around the time Nas named his 2006 album Hip Hop is Dead and set off a tsunami of finger-pointing and finger-wagging about who killed it. (The Queens rapper has said on several occasions that the title wasn't intended to shade any particular region, artist or trend, but his clarifications did little to mitigate the fury of those who did believe the genre was falling as Southern styles like snap and trap arose.) Popularity, though, doesn't portend respect. A microaggressive term like \"mumble rap,\" which has been applied so broadly it barely means anything at this point, or the cliche phrase \"real hip-hop\" are all ways of discrediting the artistic merits of some styles in order to prop up others. It's no secret they are most often deployed against rappers from the South. And the thrust of the intra-cultural conversations still moves the same \u2014 from Source Award resentment, to the way No Limit and Cash Money are cherry-picked as quintessential hip-hop success stories only after their empires were built (but Hypnotize Minds is still somehow excluded), to the way Trina (and all Southern rap women this side of Missy Elliott) remain under-acknowledged, to the way Soulja Boy was made a punchline as if he didn't revolutionize the way the genre could exist on the Internet, to the way Gucci Mane was shrugged off for years before a rebrand effectively rewrote history, to the way Rae Sremmurd was criticized for daring to have a good time and make music accordingly (Slim Jxmmi's query of \"why we gotta rap about 'momma couldn't pay the bills,' and s***?\" still needs an answer) to the initial reduction of Young Thug into \"post-language/post-lyrical\" sounds rather than an advancement of the tradition. The message is clear: Rap that doesn't take into account bicoastal sensibilities is not rap worth taking seriously or possibly not rap at all. That is, until it reaches a fever pitch, and the conversation becomes moot, the backhanded dismissals just another distant memory. When those who steer the larger cultural discourse let the pattern repeat without confronting the structures it upholds, we are tricked into buying the illusion of inadequacy; time has been the greatest source of redemption and truth. We arrive here, on the anniversary of Andr\u00e9 3000's call to battle, with everything different and yet unchanged. But that is not the place where our history begins. That honor likely goes to the Sequence, the group comprising Angie Stone, Cheryl \"the Pearl\" Cook and Gwendolyn \"Blondy\" Chisolm from South Carolina, and its 1979 song \"Funk You Up,\" the first rap hit made by women and by a Southern rap group. This is no small feat, but with Black, woman and Southern all working against them, they have largely been made a footnote. In an illuminating Rolling Stone story about its legacy, the trio outlines how it was treated at the 2016 VH1 Hip Hop Honors, which was dedicated to women. \"[VH1] tried to change history and say a lot of people don't remember Sequence,\" Stone told the publication. \"They didn't make a significant enough contribution, and we were devastated.\" That's the trouble with awards shows and criticism and, indeed, the trouble with canons as a whole: People get written out with the wave of a pen, a rushed vote or a subjective decision made to adhere to a subjective set of parameters. Arbitrary judgements are made \u2014 like the one that excluded the Sequence from even this list due to just how early and pioneering the group was; it would take another decade, where we begin, in 1989, for the momentum to catch up \u2014 and suddenly it's as if a person and their art didn't exist. What's been made here is a corrective drop in a poisoned well. Women, queer people and trans people are largely absent because the process of digging up what has been systemically buried \u2014 in this music, in all music, in society as a whole \u2014 is a lifetime's work; it's hard to see what has been cast into shadow. The proposition of any sort of rubric is also tainted, requiring a conscience and willful effort to work against the common consensus, to unlearn many of the standards that weren't made with your people in mind but were forced upon you nevertheless. That, too, is a lifetime's work. The act of canon-making is difficult no matter the parameters. To make one for Southern rap is an especially Sisyphean task that begins with the arduous exercise of defining the region's borders \u2014 this one's stretches from Texas to Southern Virginia and points in between but largely skirts the Midwest (namely Missouri) and the Mid-Atlantic (namely DC, Maryland and Northern Virginia). It ends with defining its equally amorphous sounds \u2014 from Miami bass to New Orleans bounce to Memphis buck to Houston chopped-and-screwed to Atlanta trap and derivatives thereof. From a geographical perspective, the South covers more square miles than any other rap hub; from a sonic one, its expansive swath of styles account for the predominant sound of the genre over nearly the past two decades, simultaneously creating and continuing infinite dialogues. The South Got Something To Say: A Celebration of Southern Rap called on Southern critics, scholars and writers \u2014 representing the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana and those ever complicated mid-Atlantic states Virginia and Maryland \u2014 to bring their unique experiences and voices to the table. Then it asked the impossible of them: to whittle down their childhoods, their teenage years, their college years and their presents to a handful of albums and songs. The task was specific enough to inspire enthusiasm even in its challenge and vague enough to leave room for each to determine for his or herself what constitutes Southern rap and what constitutes a canon. In emails, group chats and video calls, we still never really decided. What was determined, however, is that this list would not be ranked; that the South, which for so long had been pitted against the rest of the world, would not be pitted against itself. The quest was never about finding the best Southern rap album or song but about presenting the region for all that it has been and given to us: country, gangsta, political, silly, somber, confrontational, artful, ratchet, sexy, brilliant, ignorant and, at our very best, every last one of those things all at once. Perhaps the most important takeaway here is that the South is no more a monolith than rap is or Black people are. Each state and city therein is alive with its own rhythm and culture, intertwining to create this glorious gumbo of pride, ingenuity and craft. We are unified by the magical light we conjure out of the dark shadow of the Confederacy, the Klan and Jim Crow. At its core, Southern rap is nothing more than the collective convictions of hip-hop articulated in another language, marching to a different beat. Crunk and buck music are the sound of righteous indignation unmuted; trap is the sound of finding something glamorous in all that struggle; snap is the sound of delight simply for the sake of. So much of what is divisive about these modes is their refusal of neutrality, geographic and otherwise. The refusal to tone down or silence that Dirty South dialect and swagger. The refusal to be inoffensive to less imaginative sensibilities. The refusal to be erased. But what is more Black and hip-hop than survival by joy? New York will always be the birthplace of this beautiful culture; that is a fact that no one can change or take away. But infinity is the South, the genesis of all popular music mounted on the spirituals and blues of those who built this country. It is an injustice to be rendered additive when one is, in fact, foundational. To reorient rap around the South \u2014 or, at least, to acknowledge that its creative impetus has long been concentrated around the region \u2014 is to make room for possibilities. It's to begin to bring into focus that which has been distorted. It's to reject sanitization and shame in the name of fully embracing Black people and not just those which have been deemed valuable by respectability and faux ideas of liberation. To play Southern rap is to hear hints of a path forward. So maybe this isn't a canon at all. Canon implies authority, sufficiency, finality or an unimpeachable quality, and this is none of those things. Maybe it's more an honoring or a witnessing, a way to see ourselves and be seen by others. Ideally, it's a continuation of the work that has already been done by so many of the writers involved and plenty of others and an overture to a critical realignment. The South no longer needs defending. It's here, and it's long had something \u2014 many things \u2014 to say; the question now is: Are you willing to listen?

            "article_content": "As protests continue in cities across the U.S., people have hit the streets to protest systemic racism and police brutality. Many Asian Americans have joined in that action, but are also trying to figure out how they fit into the larger national conversation about racism. Some are protesting for the first time ever. Others are confronting their own anti-Blackness and that within their communities. (On this episode, we spoke to a young Korean American man who falls into that category.) Then, of course, there are the people who have been organizing and demonstrating for years. A recent Gallup poll found that Asian Americans are more likely to say they support and feel connected to the recent protests than any other ethnic groups apart from Black people. And after Black folks, Asian Americans were also the most likely to say that the protests have changed their views on racial justice. And though there's an energized push of Asian Americans being involved in and vocally supporting Black Lives Matter protests, the history of this group's organizing for racial justice isn't new. Kim Tran, an anti-racist consultant who is writing a book about interracial coalitions, spoke to us about that long history. Below is an excerpt of what she told us, which has been condensed and edited for clarity. On the origins of Asian American organizing: \"Arguably, the roots of what we know today as Asian-American activism begins around the same time as the Black American civil rights movement in the '60s. That's when we see it gain a lot of traction. I also think you could say that Asians have been organizing since their arrival in this country in the 1800s. You definitely saw Chinese Americans and Punjabi folks and Sikh folks really push back against racism in the United States since arriving here. There were also these big Supreme Court cases about race, like United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, which really helped us understand the way that whiteness is policed in America. Asian Americans have always thought of ourselves as a community that is also oppressed by white supremacy. So if you look at famous activists like Grace Lee Boggs or Yuri Kochiyama, what you see is there are long histories of them experiencing white supremacy in their own lives: of internment, of anti-Chinese racism. These experiences are often, for a lot of communities, the bedrock of anti-racist organizing. It's because we know what it feels like. It's because we know what it looks like.\" On coalition-building:\"Asian American organizing is differentiated from other racial groups like indigenous or Native organizing, or Chicanx organizing and Black American civil rights struggles by the fact that it's always been really coalitionary based. Asian American organizing has always been really multiracial. And that's something that I think is really serving us at this moment. For example, the Delano Grape Strike was organized by Filipino farm workers in the Coachella Valley in the mid '60s. And what we were seeing in that fight was for a 40 cents-per-hour raise, and that it was really looking at the working conditions for Latinx folks. And that's kind of one of my favorite moments, because it does show that Asian America has roots as a movement that works to build bridges across racial divides.\"On erasure from historical memory:\"One thing that often differentiates Asian American organizing from other activism is that we don't actually know the histories, even though they're tied in with broader movements. One of the things that I think about often is that Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese American, was the person who was holding Malcolm X after he had been shot numerous times and as he lay dying. But we don't actually see that in a lot of, you know, the visual imagery of this moment in films. It's not memorialized anywhere. And that's kind of also what we saw with the Delano Grape Strike, Cesar Chavez and farm workers. There's a whole part of Asian American organizing here, of participation in these boycotts and these marches and this nonviolent resistance\u2014but we don't talk about Asian American involvement. So the thing that we're left with is that Asian Americans aren't politicized, that Asian Americans don't fight and that Asian Americans are apathetic. But the reality is there's so much of Asian American political organizing that has taken place that we just haven't been able to see, in part because of white supremacy.\" On the emergence of the Asians for Black Lives movement:\"The footprint of Asians for Black Lives is the byproduct of years and years of organizing by a lot of these long time activists. And this particular umbrella group formed in response to the police brutality in the summer of August 2014, and the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. There's something really special that's happening now. These Asian American activists, since 2014 and 2015, are really, really invested in the project of Black liberation. And it's not about a shared struggle. It's not about being the same. It's not about us experiencing the same things. It's actually about us experiencing uniquely different things. It's putting a stake in the ground and saying this matters. And it's about liberation for Black folks.\" On anti-Blackness among Asian Americans \"Anti blackness is actually a part of Asian-American racial formation in a ton of ways. The model minority myth is a way that we [are defined] and define ourselves as definitively not black. And that is anti-Blackness within our community. On an individual level, you'll see things like Asian parents who say don't bring home a Black person. And structurally, you'll see things like in the education system, Asian-Americans are expected to know the answers to questions and black students aren't. There are some realities to being Asian-American, and that is that we are perpetual foreigners in this country and that aspirational whiteness is granted to a lot of East and Northeast Asians. So it seems like that's available to us \u2014 at least it did before the coronavirus really took place. It seems like whiteness was accessible and possible for a lot of us. Some folks are really comforted by that, because it's this white supremacist idea that you could claim the racial ladder and climb the racial hierarchy.\" On what's next for Asian Americans \"Asian Americans are a deeply political group of folks in this country. We participated in the fight for civil rights in the 60s. Asian Americans were a part of what Cesar Chavez did. And this moment, as hard as it may seem, and as new as it may seem for some, is actually connected to a much longer legacy. So, you know, we're doing this with history at our backs, and that's really exciting. I encourage folks to keep that in mind, especially when it gets hard.\" To hear more, listen to this week's Code Switch episode wherever you get your podcasts, including NPR One, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Stitcher, Google Podcasts and RSS.",

            "article_content": "Updated at 5:35 p.m. A sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court stood by its most recent abortion-rights precedent Monday, delivering a major defeat to abortion opponents who had hoped for a reversal of fortunes at the court with the addition of two new Trump-appointed justices. By a 5-4 vote, the court struck down a Louisiana law that was virtually identical to a Texas law it invalidated just four years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the fifth and decisive vote. Four years ago, the chief justice was among the dissenters when the court struck down a Texas law that required doctors performing clinic abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. But on Monday, Roberts joined the court's liberals in striking down a nearly identical law in Louisiana, even as he stood by the reasoning in his earlier dissent. The chief justice justified the change in his vote by pointing to the doctrine of stare decisis, which says the court should usually stand by its precedents. It \"instructs us to treat like cases alike,\" he wrote, and \"the Louisiana law burdens women seeking previability abortions to the same extent as the Texas law\" did four years ago. The value of following precedent, he added, is that it \"promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial principles, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\" While precedent is not an \"inexorable demand,\" simple disagreement with a previous decision is not enough to justify reversing course, he wrote. In this case, he observed, not only was the Louisiana law at issue virtually identical to the one the court struck down in 2016, but the District Court judge found after an extensive trial that if the law were to go into effect, at minimum two of the three abortion clinics in the state would be forced to close, women would have to wait longer and drive farther for abortions, and only one doctor would likely be left to fill the demand for 10,000 women seeking abortions in the state each year. For most hospitals, admitting privileges are a business decision. Hospitals do not generally grant admitting privileges to doctors unless those doctors routinely admit a significant stream of patients to the hospital for treatment, and most doctors who work at clinics that perform abortions do not have a private obstetric practice that would provide such a stream of patients. In addition, in many areas, doctors who perform abortions at clinics are not welcome at hospitals. Not only are they politically unpopular, but if hospitals were to grant them admitting privileges, they likely would have to beef up security. Roberts' opinion is likely to stall attempts at overruling the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 abortion decision, Roe v. Wade, and subsequent rulings that have reaffirmed that decision, to one degree or another dozens of times. The decision was also a particular repudiation of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which not only disregarded the Supreme Court's earlier decision in the Texas case, but disregarded the factual findings of the District Court judge  in the Louisiana case. As Roberts observed, the District Court judge, before his ruling, held a six-day trial in the case, and for 18 months monitored the attempts of clinic doctors, who, without success, sought in \"good faith\" to get the required admitting privileges. Abortion providers and defenders were, to say the least, relieved at the outcome in Monday's case. Kathleen Pittman, administrator of the Hope Medical Group for Women, which runs a clinic in Shreveport, La., told reporters, \"To say we're elated hardly begins to come close to what we are feeling,\" but she added, \"I am celebrating today, but I'm worried about our future.\" Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, echoed that sentiment. \"We are taking the Supreme Court one victory at a time,\" she said. \"We are under no illusions that the fight is over with this case\" because opponents of abortion rights will continue to try to impose new requirements and regulations aimed at restricting access to abortion. \"It's whack-a-mole over and over again,\" she said. Leah Litman, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, cautioned that Roberts' opinion sets out a standard different from the one the court previously adopted. \"The chief justice's reasoning was actually quite permissive in what it would allow states do to restrict abortions,\" she observed. That said, the decision does appear to send the signal that Roberts is not prepared to uphold state laws that, for instance, ban abortions at six, eight or 12 weeks, or any other time before fetal viability. Even James Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, sees those bans as dead in the water. \"I've been saying for 10 years that those approaches are doomed to failure,\" Bopp said. Though Bopp was disappointed in the Roberts opinion, he did see some hope. \"He gave us half a loaf,\" Bopp said, adding that he believes the Roberts opinion will enable states to mandate ultrasounds for those seeking an abortion, and will allow states to ban abortions for certain reasons, such as because of the sex of the fetus, or disability. Notre Dame Law School professor Richard Garnett agrees on the former, but said he believes that a flat ban on abortions of any sort is likely to run into trouble at the Supreme Court. Bopp, for his part, said he saw a message in the decision for anti-abortion voters: \"It tells the pro-life movement that President Trump fulfills his promises with his appointment of [Justices Neil] Gorsuch and [Brett] Kavanaugh and ... that .. we need Trump reelected in order to make future appointments.\" Political groups on the right and left made that same point. Were one of the liberal justices to retire \u2014 and two of them are over 80 \u2014 another Trump appointment to the high court could make Roberts' vote irrelevant. Given that mathematical reality, Monday's decision is likely to play a significant role in the upcoming election. Polling data have consistently shown a hefty majority of the public approves the right to abortion. But while Americans held similar views in 2016, exit polling also showed that Trump had more success at making the Supreme Court into an election issue, turning out more voters who voted for him because he promised to name conservative \u2014 and anti-abortion \u2014 justices to the court. One in five voters told CNN in an exit poll that the Supreme Court was one reason they had cast a ballot. Of the voters who said it was the \"most important factor\" in their decision, 56% voted for Trump. According to The Washington Post, 26% of all Trump voters polled said that the Supreme Court was the basis of their decision. While it was Roberts' decisive vote that struck down the Louisiana law, the chief justice explicitly declined to sign onto the reasoning offered in a plurality opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, who was joined by his three liberal colleagues in voting to invalidate the Louisiana law. They evaluated the law, as they had in the Texas case in 2016, to see if the burdens on women seeking abortions outweighed the state's justifications for the law. Breyer said the Louisiana law \"would place substantial obstacles in the path of women seeking an abortion\" in the state, that the admitting privileges requirement would provide \"no significant health-related benefits\" and that the law \"consequently imposes an 'undue burden' on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote the principal dissenting opinion, joined for the most part by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh. Alito wrote that the court's decisions in both the Louisiana and Texas cases are \"used like a bulldozer to flatten legal rules that stand in the way.\" In a separate dissenting opinion, Thomas wrote, \"Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled,\" and he said that the high court has \"neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare Louisiana's duly enacted law unconstitutional.\" Kavanaugh and Gorsuch also wrote separate dissents. In a statement, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called the ruling \"unfortunate.\" \"Instead of valuing fundamental democratic principles, unelected Justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of State governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate abortion safety regulations,\" she said. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, applauded the Supreme Court for \"[reaffirming] that states cannot put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.\" Separately, in two other opinions delivered Monday, the court upheld restrictions on overseas funding for AIDS initiatives. It also ruled that the president can fire at will the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but left intact the rest of the statute that created the agency.

What kind of a*****e would name his band Drive-By Truckers? A valid question, if you ask me. I'm the person responsible for it. Last week, it was announced that the country trio Lady Antebellum would be changing its name. I don't really know that band, nor its members. I'm sure they are nice and well-meaning folks, and wish them well. Good deeds, good intentions, all good things. I'm always rooting for those who try to do the right thing, since it's always easier said than done. They announced that the new name would be, simply, Lady A. But about an hour later, the singular Lady A, a well-established blues singer from Seattle who has been playing under that name for 20 years, took issue with a move that the more mainstream Lady A meant as a healing gesture. (It was later announced that the two Lady As had reached an agreement, though that is reportedly not quite the case.) Oof. I try to be a good person, but must admit, I snickered about it all. Then, a question smacked me right in the face: What kind of a*****e would name his band Drive-By Truckers? I was 31, broke and working two jobs. I had been living in Athens, Ga. for a little over a year at that point, and was immersed in its wonderful local music scene, which had first drawn me from my home state of Alabama to the otherwise sleepy college town. As a teenager, I had fallen in love with punk rock, spending my lunch money (and, later, money from my job at a record store) on albums by The Clash, Richard Hell and The Voidoids, and The Jim Carroll Band. When I first heard \"The Message\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, that love of punk grew to include, and at some times be eclipsed by, a devotion to hip-hop. By the mid-90's, living in Athens amidst an exploding music community, I had become aware of the amazing Dirty South scene that was about to explode out of neighboring Atlanta, through groups like Goodie Mob and OutKast. I loved punk for its energy and its emphasis on passion over chops. I loved hip-hop for its storytelling. I love both for their political relevance and humor. Around that same time, a DJ friend turned me onto the sounds of old-timey country. Loretta, George and Tammy, Ferlin Husky and Lefty Frizzel. All the Hanks (Snow, Williams and Jr.) and the Reds (Sovine and Foley). At least two Merles. From there, I was soon into Tom T. Hall and Townes Van Zandt. And on and on.** ** That DJ friend was Debbie Daughtry, who later moved to New York and started the Ichiban Rock and Soul show, which has run for years on WFMU. She has shared a Moveon.org petition to preserve it, after leaving WFMU over issues that pertain to some of the themes of this essay. I came out of a writer's block \u2014 I'd been writing songs for a long time by then \u2014 at a feverish pace, liberated by these old but new-to-me sounds, fleshing them out with themes that would be more at home on punk, or even hip-hop, records. I wanted to tackle some dark subjects, but with tongue firmly in cheek. I liked the idea of a dark comedic sensibility being applied to heftier themes. Serious but fun. Drive-By Truckers was officially formed on Monday, June 10, 1996. I lured the musicians I was wanting to play with into the studio for a day of recording. I had just enough money saved up for the studio time, a couple of cases of cheap beer and some pizza. We recorded five songs that day, two of which we released the following spring. The band name was intended as a tribute to two forms of music that I loved and revered. Hip-hop in the mid-'90s was filled with crime sagas, not necessarily far removed from the content of old Johnny Cash songs \u2014 which, of course, I also loved \u2014 and a direct descendant of the narcocorrido. I would not (and regardless, could not) rap, but I could approach my subject matter in a lyrical way, set to this old music that was a new passion of mine. From the start, the band was fun and rowdy and loud as hell. Our name had an irreverence that befit our style and sense of humor. It was such an absurd band name that I didn't have to worry about a blues performer in Seattle having the same. I had the privilege of being blissfully unaware. Oof. I'm not going to, and can't, claim that those were simpler times. They weren't. Rodney King was still a very fresh memory, and the forming of my band roughly coincided with the O.J. Simpson trial and all of the racial turmoil that accompanied it. The murders of Tupac and Biggie Smalls were just on the horizon. Everyone in the Atlanta metro area, of which Athens is certainly a part (like it or not) was gearing up for the world's stage as the Olympics, and with it the juggernaut of short-term jobs and gentrification that accompany such a huge event. All of this brings me back to my band's name, and the environment that led me to somehow think it was alright. To not really think about it at all. No one is blissfully unaware of much any more; this can be painful and brain-numbing but it can also, hopefully, lead us to somewhere better. I've never really given much of a s*** about the band name. We have spent most of the last two-and-a-half decades on the road, playing over 2,500 shows on three continents. We recently released our twelfth studio record. We've had numerous personnel changes (although none in the last eight years) and our sound and songs have morphed and changed as we've all grown older and, hopefully, wiser. We've seen the world and met and lived among all kinds of different people. Our message has matured and our world view has deepened. Our fans seldom refer to us by the original name anymore. They call us The Truckers or often DBT or even The DBTs, which I think I like most. Our fans call themselves \"Heathens,\" after a song I wrote in 2000. (That would have made a good band name for us, but was already taken.) All of which leads me to intent, and how that might not be enough. Gone With the Wind was a crappy movie in its time and it has aged horrendously. It was everyone's grandmother's favorite movie (mine included), who seemed to think it depicted some simpler time as it whitewashed, even glamorized, buying and selling humans as if there was some kind of nobility to it all. It perpetuated a mythology of lies and glorified a version of Southern history. I think it is a large part of why so many people have some romanticized notion of the \"antebellum\" period in the first place. HBO Max recently announced that it won't be showing Gone With the Wind (at least for now). Good riddance! To those who cry foul and say it's censorship, I'd argue that anyone who wants to sit through four excruciating hours of nausea-inducing crap can probably find it on VHS in their grandmother's attic. I'll take Lady Antebellum's word for it that they didn't mean any harm when they named their band that now admittedly awful name. In a discussion about the change, I was being snarky and recommended them calling themselves Lady Liamgallagher \u2014 if you're going to take someone's personal name, a surly English rock star would, at least, be in a more level position to fight a famous pop-country band for it. A friend of mine responded to that post by saying that they'd better not call themselves Lady DBT, which got me to thinking \u2014 maybe that would be a better name for us than the one we've had since 1996. Context and intent mean a lot, but perhaps not as much as I've always thought and hoped. I was raised in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in the '60s and '70s. My father, David Hood, is a musician too, and for decades was the bass player in the Muscle Shoals Sound Rhythm Section. He made his living by playing on classic soul records. You're most likely not familiar with his name, but you've heard him on hit songs by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Bobby Womack and The Staple Singers, to name just a few. Due to how I was raised, I grew up with a far different view of our country's history of racism than most of my white classmates. I also grew up in a home filled with soul music. My music education was pilfering through my dad's record collection with hundreds of records from the likes of Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Mille Jackson and Parliament. They informed my world view long before I got to see the world and were always a driving force in my songwriting and playing. It also probably allowed me to pat myself on the back, and even think I was one of the good guys. In Athens, one of the biggest news stories of 1995 was the police shooting of a man named Edward Wright. He was mentally challenged, and lived with his mother across the street from where I had lived upon first moving there. Deeply religious, he had felt a calling to cast off all worldly things and go spread the word of Jesus. He interpreted that as taking off his clothes and heading towards downtown to talk about the Lord. He was shot five times, as a crowd looked on. It shook our liberal oasis of a town to its progressive core \u2014 especially when the investigation cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing. In 2014, I was awakened by the back-to-back killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and the ongoing rage over the killing of Trayvon Martin two years earlier. Remembering back to Edward Wright's death, I was suddenly forced to face up to just how little we had progressed as a people in the past two decades. Like so many white Americans, I had drunk the Kool-Aid following Obama's election, thinking it somehow signified that we had entered a \"post-racial\" state of being. My way of trying to figure it all out was to sit down and attempt to write a song about it. \"What It Means\" was intentionally written from the point of view of a white southern man (with my very distinct accent turned up to ten). Although I have often been heavily influenced by various black musicians, I wanted that song to be a white man's reckoning of the American nightmare so many of us had tried not to notice. It spoke of black men and women being murdered on the streets by people of authority. There was no shortage of great songs by black artists about racial disparity and oppression. I felt like it needed to be said and needed to be expressed by the very same demographic that had pretended it wasn't happening. I also wanted the song to be a line in the sand, not only for the band but also our fans. We felt it was important then for our white, middle-aged, southern rock and roll band to say \"Black Lives Matter.\" We knew going into it that it had the potential to be polarizing, but we wanted everyone, from our fans to our families, to know which side of that line we stood on and what we stood for. It was way past time for people who looked like us to stand up and be counted against the systematic racism that has been tearing our country apart since the beginning. Everything in our world is in disarray and it's tumultuous and painful, as we rip scabs off of old, festering wounds. It's messy and sometimes ugly. I'm older and trying to navigate it all while watching my kids trying to figure it out and what it all means. Symbols are important \u2014 but those damned statues were put up for a very distinct purpose, and not necessarily the one regularly advertised. A vast majority of them went up during the early days of the Civil Rights struggle to symbolize white superiority and to romanticize bygone days when it went unquestioned. Tearing them down unequivocally says: Those days are over. It's way overdue. It has always been my intent to be a good person, and to try to be a better person. It's always a work in progress. Many of our band's songs have attempted to examine our country's fatal flaw of racism, from its origins in slavery and religion to our current systematic failure to advance beyond this quagmire of hate and mis-opportunity. It's an ongoing conversation that can be at times painful, but necessary. Our name was a drunken joke that was never intended to be in rotation and reckoned with two-and-a-half decades later, and I sincerely apologize for its stupidity and any negative stereotypes it has propagated. I'm not sure changing it now serves any higher purpose, but I'm certainly open to suggestions. In the meantime, you're welcome to just call us Lady DBT. Patterson Hood is a writer and musician, currently quarantined and living in Portland. His band's latest album is The Unraveling, released through ATO Records.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle for a More Unjust America by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 416 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? \"It did not have to be this way, and there was a time when it was not,\" Adam Cohen writes in his introduction to Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle for a More Unjust America. America could have top-notch, racially integrated schools, a criminal justice system that hadn't ballooned to the world's largest by locking up generations of black and brown people, a political system that wasn't suffocating in money and a legal system that valued individuals over big business. Today, though, the likelihood of implementing such a vision looks dim. Cohen, in his new book, explores the court's opinions over the past five decades and comes to a rueful conclusion: These decisions have greatly exacerbated America's gap between rich and poor. Cohen is a Harvard-educated lawyer, a former member of The New York Times editorial board and senior editor for Time, and he wrote several books on American history and politics. To review the basics \u2014 our Constitution establishes three co-equal branches of government: legislative (Senate and House of Representatives); executive (president, vice president and executive departments); and judiciary (\"one supreme court\" and lower courts as Congress deems fit to \"ordain\"). Cohen focuses on the judiciary's nine-member Supreme Court. He cites the personal histories of Supreme Court justices to explain how they vote, backing up his assertion that justices from modest economic backgrounds show more empathy for the 99% than those from privilege. Cohen opens with the Warren court (1953-1969), headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren. In addition to Brown v. Board of Education, which desegregated America's schools, the Warren court issued numerous opinions that protected the poor and unemployed, attempted to outlaw race discrimination, injected fairness into criminal procedure and strengthened voter protections. President Nixon, elected in 1968, ambitiously sought to change the court. Readers may find that his deployment of both the Justice Department and the media in an all-out smear campaign to force out liberal Justice Abe Fortas resonates with today's politics. Nixon was also ruthless in (unsuccessfully) trying to coerce Justice William Douglas' resignation, Cohen notes. Cohen traces the Supreme Court's pivot away from protecting the rights of the poor and marginalized to 1969, when President Nixon appointed his first justice, Warren E. Burger. Burger tipped the Supreme Court to a conservative majority. Dandridge v. Williams, a 1970 opinion written by Dwight Eisenhower appointee Potter Stewart, \"scion of the upper classes,\" heralded a change in welfare law that began narrowing and reversing earlier decisions protecting access to government assistance. President Nixon got his lasting conservative majority; he appointed four Supreme Court justices whose influence is keenly felt today. Cohen unspools the court's increasingly right-wing holdings on education, campaign finance, democracy, workers, corporations and criminal justice. Many of these decisions have overturned statutory law and the court's own precedents, he shows. Cohen acknowledges that not all decisions break down along ideological lines. For example, in a blow to individuals, justices of mixed ideology limited punitive damages in cases of egregious corporate misconduct. And Buckley v. Valeo, decided in 1976, equated spending money on elections with free speech, even as it upheld aspects of campaign finance law. Conservative justices seized the Buckley opening, using this equivalence between money and speech to greatly expand corporate and wealthy people's \"rights\" to influence politics through spending (Citizens United v. FEC, 2010). With Justice John Roberts at the helm, the Supreme Court severely limited class actions (Dukes v. Wal-Mart, 2011, eviscerating the employment discrimination claims of 1.5 million women). Class actions had been a means for individuals with similar grievances and injuries to consolidate claims. Consolidation made it possible to show patterns of wrongdoing and to afford legal fees. Thus, while it may be difficult and unaffordable for one woman to show wage discrimination, 1.5 million womens' pay records can demonstrate a clear pattern. The Supreme Court has bowed to the steady corporate drumbeat on the need for \"tort reform,\" code for reducing corporate liability for defective and injurious products. \"The Court's rulings have saved corporations many billions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to people they injured or cheated,\" Cohen writes. \"Companies will sell more products with hidden defects.\" By limiting damages and foreclosing other options to sue for wrongdoing, the court has awarded corporations vast power and protection. Cohen cites University of Colorado Law School Byron R. White Center director Suzette M. Malveaux's aptly named 2011 article \u2014 \"How Goliath Won.\" Similarly, Cohen shows, the Supreme Court has narrowed individuals' rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, awarded police more power, severely limited federal tools to address voter suppression and much more. Read Supreme Inequality for a breathtaking, if depressing, catalogue. Cohen's book has a companion in David A. Kaplan's The Most Dangerous Branch. That book argues that the Supreme Court consolidated power by involving itself in every aspect of American life. The starkest example is Bush v. Gore that decided the 2000 presidential election. Bush v. Gore was done in haste, before Florida had time to complete its vote count. Kaplan believes the Supreme Court's activism both underscores and helps foster a weak and dysfunctional Congress. It creates a power imbalance among the three branches of government that threatens democracy. The Supreme Court's accrual of power raises disturbing questions, especially when limited government is a key tenet of conservatism. Each of the five conservative justices on today's Supreme Court have strong ties to the Federalist Society. Founded in 1982, the Federalists are conservatives and libertarians who aim to \"place a premium on individual liberty.\" How then are we to reconcile this set of beliefs with a court that consistently favors big money and corporations over individuals? One could legitimately ask what is conservative about opening the floodgates to money in politics, eviscerating a longstanding statutory provision providing federal voter protections, supporting policies that increase mass incarceration, legislating women's bodies, and purposefully ignoring clear evidence of racial bias in sentencing and convictions. But it is not within Cohen's remit to address those paradoxes. Cohen proves his argument that the Supreme Court's decisions have widened the wealth gap, diminished consumers' abilities to right wrongs, limited individuals' say in our democracy and greatly empowered corporations. His objections are clear, but he does not offer a path forward other than the unstated: Since the court fostered this concentration of corporate power and exacerbated the 1%'s rise, it has the power to reverse itself. At the dawn of 2020, it is unimaginable that the Roberts court would do so. On the contrary, this reviewer observes that conservative justices continue to actively seek cases that allow them to overturn decades of precedent favoring ordinary people. Others have offered more concrete ideas. One nonprofit has put forth a proposal that would limit Supreme Court terms to 18 years with a stricter code of ethics, clearer and more effective rules on financial interests and recusal, more transparency, and predictability and fairness in the process of appointing justices. Finally, in times when the Supreme Court is reliably pro-business and anti-consumer, pro-wealthy and anti-99%, lawyers and advocates pursuing other outcomes turn to state legislatures and state courts. If history is any guide, the pendulum can swing the other way. Martha Anne Toll's writing is at www.marthaannetoll.com, and she tweets at@marthaannetoll.

My Fight for Truth and Justice Against a Criminal President by Jill Wine-banks Hardcover, 272 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who has a cold today. My guest, Jill Wine-Banks, is a familiar face to cable TV audiences. She's appeared frequently as a legal analyst for MSNBC, often commenting on the Mueller investigation or the impeachment and trial of President Trump. But turn back the clock a few decades and you'd find her on the inside of another historic investigation into presidential misconduct. As an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation, she confronted associates of President Nixon in court and extracted evidence from White House records and presidential tape recordings. As a young woman in an overwhelmingly male legal world, she faced demeaning comments in offices, courtrooms and the media, including a New York Times profile of her titled \"A Lawyer In Miniskirts.\" And while she was investigating the Watergate break-in and cover-up, her own house was mysteriously burglarized twice. FBI agents said a tap on her phone had been installed, then removed. Her new memoir details her experiences in the Watergate probe and her personal struggles with a failing marriage. I spoke to her yesterday about the book called \"The Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\" Well, Jill Wine-Banks, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's talk about your experience in the Watergate investigation. You were hired at the age of 30 for the special prosecutor's office. You are an attorney with some experience. You'd done criminal prosecutions for the Justice Department. You were, I guess, the only woman trial lawyer on the team there. How were you regarded by all of these other men - the attorneys, the agents, others? JILL WINE-BANKS: Well, it depends on what part of my career you're talking about. When I first started at the Department of Justice, again, I was the only woman trial lawyer. And no one really knew how to deal with me because they weren't sure whether to call me a woman lawyer, which is something I've always objected to. I think that distinguishes me in a way that's unfair from any other lawyer. I was a trial lawyer, not a woman lawyer. And so I've always corrected people on that particular thing. I really ended up being very much accepted in the Department of Justice organized crime section, but it took me over a year to get my first trial, and that was because I was not even aware - I had no role models and no one to look to. And it took me a while to realize that the men I started with were starting to try cases. We all start doing appeals, but they had moved on to trials, and I hadn't. And so I had to confront my boss and say, how come? And he said, well, because you're a girl, and you'd be much more vulnerable in a courtroom. In appeals, you're just with lawyers. But in the courtroom, you'd be with Mafia members. And I simply said, well, what didn't you notice about me when you hired me as a trial lawyer? And that's how I got my first trial. When I got to Watergate, I had only a few years of experience. DAVIES: But they accepted you once you were on the team? WINE-BANKS: Oh, at Watergate, I never felt unaccepted. There were a number of episodes where you would have to say gender played a role. Judge Sirica made several, I would have to say, sexist comments. One was during my questioning of Rose Mary Woods when he said, now, ladies, we have enough problems in this courtroom without two women arguing. And that was while I was cross-examining her, not arguing with her. He also said during my cross-examination of one of the defendants, Robert Mardian, Mr. Mardian, don't you know you can never win an argument with a lady? And part of the trial strategy for cross-examining him was to get him angry and to get him arguing with me because we really felt that if he yelled at me and showed his true personality, it would definitely hurt him much more than if he yelled at Rick Ben-Veniste. And my strategy had worked. He was getting angry. The jury was hating him. And Judge Sirica stopped him. My law school - I went to Columbia in New York. The students there wrote a letter to him complaining about his treatment of me, and he did apologize for that. DAVIES: Yeah. It's interesting because there are a lot of circumstances where if a lawyer says something to you in an office, you can call him on it. You don't call out a judge in public. (LAUGHTER) WINE-BANKS: No, you don't. You just smile and stand there, all the blood draining from your face and in total horror. I mean, it was very hard to be the first. And I always felt that as the first, if I screwed up that I was going to make it harder for anyone to follow me. It would be easy for someone to say, well, women just can't do it. And so I really felt that pressure to perform well so that other women could follow me. That's been one of the things I'm proudest of is, for example, when I was general counsel of the Army - another first as a woman - my successor was a woman. And that meant that I had done a good enough job that they were willing to hire another woman. DAVIES: All right, let's talk about the Watergate case. One of the interesting things about this is that in May of '73, when the special counsel's office is organized and you begin this criminal investigation into Nixon and his associates, the U.S. Senate forms a committee and is beginning to hold public hearings on this. And a lot had come out on this because the Watergate burglars - one of them, James McCord - had begun talking about the cover-up, in effect. What effect did it have to U.S. prosecutors to have these Senate hearings going on at the same time? Did it reinforce what you were doing? Did you learn things from it? WINE-BANKS: It mostly complicated things, I would say. We had to be very careful to pay attention to what the Senate was doing because we didn't want them giving immunity to anyone we felt should be prosecuted. We had to make sure that no one told us one story and the Senate something else. It did make a big difference, though, in terms of acceptance of what we were doing because you had a public disclosure of information so that the American public could hear John Dean testify. And I have to say at the time when he testified, he had no notes because he had been escorted out of the White House and had left without his diaries and messages. So he testified from memory. DAVIES: And let's just explain for people who aren't Watergate buffs. Remind us who John Dean was - yeah. WINE-BANKS: John Dean was the White House counsel to President Nixon. And he ended up being one of the ringleaders of the cover-up and had a very major role in doing it, although he did not know how much President Nixon knew before he started telling President Nixon. But he testified from memory for days, and his memory was really incredibly accurate, as he testified about hush money payments and about perjury and the White House suborning perjury and about the approval of the break-in to begin with, which was done by members of the White House staff and the Committee to Reelect the President. So it was quite remarkable testimony. And basically, if you had polled America, people believed the denials. So he said, for example, that the chief of staff had done certain things. And the chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, testified that he hadn't. And people believed Haldeman rather than Dean. DAVIES: While Dean was telling this story to the Senate and on television to the world - I mean, I remember this very clearly - he was also talking to you in the prosecutor's office and giving you... WINE-BANKS: Yes. DAVIES: ...And was prepared to testify in court about what he knew, which was a lot and had a lot of detail. In July, a couple of months into this investigation, you discover something that practically no one knew - that Nixon had been taping his conversations. This did not come from your own investigators, right? Where did this come from? WINE-BANKS: No, that came from the testimony at the Senate. And we heard it the same way that all Americans heard it, which was on television. Alexander Butterfield was an aide to Richard Nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. And a sort of happenstance question by one of the Senate staffers on a Friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until Monday, when it was publicly revealed in Senate hearings. And Butterfield had debated with himself what he would do if he was asked, and he had said if he was asked a direct question, he would give an honest answer. He wasn't going to volunteer the information, but he was asked a direct question. And it was based on a document that had been found that sounded like it could have been a transcription of a conversation. It was not, but it led to the question of whether there was a taping system, and Butterfield said, yes, there was. DAVIES: So, you know, you're in the position in the prosecutor's office where you've been gathering all this information. And how are you going to prove whose version is right? You hear there are tapes. And it's interesting how that impacted you. You're - the guy who was head of your team, Jim Neal, was suspicious of this, right? WINE-BANKS: Yes. He thought that it was a trap. And I am much less skeptical. Maybe I was more naive, but I believed that it was a make or break for us. I knew that it either was going to confirm what John Dean said and make our case, or if it deviated from what he said, we would have been in serious jeopardy of not being able to prove the case because then there would have been serious doubt about his credibility. And so the only question we had was not if we would subpoena tapes, but which ones. And we foresaw executive privilege claims being raised. DAVIES: You said that lead of your team in the special prosecutor's office thought that this revelation of a recording system might have been a trap, meaning what? What was he suspicious of? WINE-BANKS: He, Jim Neal, thought that possibly they were either fake tapes that would exonerate the president or - I'm not really sure exactly what he had in mind, but he really thought it was a trap. He agreed we had no choice but to subpoena them because that was just how it was, and we were going to have to fight it. But I never doubted that it was legitimate. The confirmation that we got from John Dean was he was thrilled to know there was tapes because he believed he had been accurate in recounting all of the conversations he had, and he was relieved that he might be able to be proved correct. So his reaction to it led me to believe that this was good news for us. DAVIES: Now, what's interesting, you initially request - I think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. And this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as I read this. It helped in asking for specific dates to have White House logs, which you had been provided by whom? WINE-BANKS: We got them from the White House. It was something that helped enormously. We had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. And it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. So, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. But when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the White House saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. And we were very precise because we had the call logs. And we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. And it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations. DAVIES: Right. And it's interesting when you compare that to the recent investigations into the Trump administration, when special counsel Mueller was looking into looking into, you know, the deeds that he was looking into it. And initially the White House did cooperate and provide a lot of documents. Once the impeachment inquiry began, they refused to honor subpoenas. It really makes a difference whether some of this basic information is provided, doesn't it? WINE-BANKS: It does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the Supreme Court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. There's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. And it's very important if the American people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. I'm very fact-based. And I can see information. People can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. And if the facts are withheld, you have nothing. DAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for NBC. Her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the Watergate scandal is called \"Watergate Girl.\" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JEFF COFFIN & THE MU'TET'S \"LOW HANGING FRUIT\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And our guest is Jill Wine-Banks. She's an attorney and legal analyst for MSNBC. She was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation in the early '70s. She has a new memoir called \"Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\" You know, it's interesting. So you requested those nine tapes. The Nixon administration said, no, these are private conversations of the president's, that they're subject to executive privilege. And one of the things you write is that as this unfolded in public, his refusal to supply the tapes hurt his support even with his base of supporters. That's again, a difference from what we're seeing today, isn't it? WINE-BANKS: Yes, although in the Watergate case, there were a lot more complications. At first, he said, this is a hoax in a witch hunt, which sounds dramatically familiar to listeners today. He also simply refused. He just said, I'm not turning them over. Eventually we went public. Archibald Cox, who was the special prosecutor, had a press conference and, in a very moving and dramatic and - full of integrity, said why we needed the tapes and why we had a legal right to have them, which led to the president ordering the attorney general to fire Archibald Cox. The attorney general said I promised Congress I would not do it without cause, and there is no cause. I will not do it. So he was fired. And the deputy attorney general became attorney general and was ordered to fire Cox. And he also refused, and he was gone. The third person in charge was the solicitor general, who became the acting attorney general, and he carried out the order. Three days later, public protest was so dramatic, our office and the White House were inundated with bags of mail. This is in the era before email. There were telexes, but other than telexes, there was actual postal mail that we received and the White House received that led Nixon to do a U-turn and say, OK, I'll hire a new special prosecutor. And I'll give you the tapes. DAVIES: Right. Now, this was the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, right? WINE-BANKS: Yes. DAVIES: In October of 1973. As it happens, you were away on a wedding then, so you weren't in the office. But you did go back. And I want to just focus on that few days when, you know, two people - ranking people had been fired. The president was determined to shut down this investigation. You had an office with files and statements and all kinds of evidence. And you didn't know what was going to happen. Were you - what kinds of conversations did you have among each other, and what did you do to protect yourselves? WINE-BANKS: Well, before this happened, in anticipation that it might, we had copied some of the most significant documents. And each of us had taken briefcases of documents to our homes and stored them there just in case. We hoped we would never have to use it because it would have been illegal because they were grand jury materials. And we didn't want to violate any of our ethics and any of the rules. But we felt that there might come a time when our morals required us to do something to protect the country and to protect democracy. Luckily, it never came to that, but we did have that at home. After it actually happened, the discussion was, first of all, were we fired or was only Archibald Cox fired? And it appears that the office had been abolished, but we weren't actually fired. And so the discussion was, shall we quit in protest? And we basically decided, and Archibald Cox advised us, do not quit. That would give the president exactly what he wants. You know this case. You should never leave it unless you are forced out. As long as you can do your job, do it. DAVIES: So after the Saturday Night Massacre, after Nixon fired people attempting to shut down the investigation, it wasn't successful. Leon Jaworski was appointed to - the new special prosecutor, and the case went on. You were tangling with Nixon over the tapes, whether he would supply the nine tapes. Turned out two of them, they said, were missing. And you had to have court hearings over who exactly had custody of these things and what happened to them. You end up in a couple of confrontations with probably the only woman among the Nixon insiders, Rose Mary Woods. Tell us about her. WINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was eventually called his executive assistant. At the time, she was his secretary. But she had been with him from the time he was elected to the Senate. She had met him when he was in the House of Representatives and had been very impressed with how he turned in his reimbursement forms. He thought - she thought he was extremely neat and accurate. And he was impressed with her as well and was one of the first people he hired when he became a senator and one of the first people he brought into the White House after he was elected. And she was much more than an assistant to him. She really was an adviser. And listening to the tapes that aren't relevant to the criminal prosecution, you can hear a lot of conversations between them that show their close personal relationship. Her brother, by the way, was the sheriff of Cook County. And he - Joe Woods - exchanged suits with Richard Nixon, and she exchanged clothes with Pat Nixon. She was known as Aunt Rose by both of the Nixon girls, Tricia and Julie. And she was really a part of the family. DAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC. Her new book is \"The Watergate Girl.\" After a break, she'll describe her courtroom confrontation with Rose Mary Woods about a mysterious 18-minute gap in the tape of a critical White House conversation. And Maureen Corrigan reviews the unconventional debut novel of Deepa Anappara telling a story of child kidnapping in India. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE MOLE'S \"IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST FRONT TITLES\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who has a cold today. We're listening to my interview with Jill Wine-Banks. She's a legal analyst for MSNBC, and she has a new memoir about her days in the 1970s as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate investigation. It's called \"The Watergate Girl.\" When we left off, she was talking about President Nixon's longtime secretary and executive assistant, Rose Mary Woods, who was close to the first family and an integral part of the administration. Now, she ends up being a very important figure in this case. People would know her name because it turned out that one of the critical conversations just a few weeks - a short time after the break-in - conversations in the Oval Office had an 18 1/2-minute gap where only a hum appears on the tape, very suspicious. A lot of people in the White House had access, but she ends up on the stand having to explain this. And you were the one cross-examining her. Tell us about that. WINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was basically thrown under the bus by the White House counsel. They said we have now discovered as part of the drip, drip, drip of bad news - after the hearing on the first two missing tapes, they came back on the day before Thanksgiving and said, whoops (ph), there is a problem in a third tape. There's an 18 1/2-minute gap, and only Rose Mary Woods can explain it. And we can find no innocent explanation for it, which was really a dramatic announcement. And I had cross-examined her when she first testified about the two missing tapes as basically just a chain of custody witness because she had handled them. DAVIES: And she was tough, wasn't she? WINE-BANKS: She was feisty for sure. We definitely had a situation where I knew that nothing that I got from her would be easily obtained, that I was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. But at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. I, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at Camp David - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape. And she also - I had asked her about precautions that she had taken to avoid erasing. And she basically screamed at me, well, I used my head. It's the only thing I had to use. And it turned out that wasn't very effective, obviously, because the mistake was made. And when she finally was called the second time to testify, I had to give her her Miranda warnings, which is something that lawyers seldom ever do. But she was now a suspect in a criminal investigation, and so I had to do it before I could ask her any questions. DAVIES: Right. So she ends up giving this explanation of - and people who remember Watergate will remember this - that it seems the only way she could have erased this, she said the phone rang and she went to pick up the phone but somehow kept her foot on a pedal that was connected to the recording. And then that's what caused the erasure. But what's remarkable about this is that she says, well, it was different in my - when you made a comment about that's awkward, and she says, well, it's different in my office. WINE-BANKS: Right. DAVIES: And then you did what? WINE-BANKS: I said, well, then let's go to your office and continue the questioning. And for some reason, the court agreed. The White House lawyers agreed. And her lawyers agreed. And so we went to the White House. It was my first time ever in the White House. And she demonstrated they would not - they, the White House - would not let us bring in a photographer. So I had to rely on Ollie Atkins, who was the president's White House photographer. And the pictures are dramatic proof that her story didn't hold up. She also, just to make it clear, she said she had to make two mistakes. She had to push the wrong button and keep her foot on the pedal, which was a physical impossibility, certainly for 18 minutes. You might have been able to do it for one second but not for any prolonged period of time. So it just wasn't possible. The pictures made her basically a laughingstock. There were a lot of cartoons about the Rose Mary Twist or the Rose Mary Stretch that were really hard on her, I am sure. It must have been a very devastating thing for her. I got a lot of mail from secretaries around the country saying, I've used that same equipment and it's not possible. No one could do that. It wouldn't work that way. And then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. But we couldn't. But also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. There were multiple erasures. DAVIES: Now, this photo, ironically taken by White House photographers, kind of made Rose Mary Woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. It just seems kind of ridiculous. Did you have sympathy for her? WINE-BANKS: Probably at that moment I didn't. I have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. And I was really compartmentalized on, what questions do I have to ask while listening to her answers so that I can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? In retrospect, I definitely have sympathy for her because I know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't. And I feel badly that the president let her believe that she did it, that the White House blamed her. They withdrew. She was represented initially by White House counsel. They withdrew that and made her hire a private attorney and - which is probably the right thing because if they actually were blaming her, ethically, they shouldn't represent her. But I'm sure that was an expense and an embarrassment to her. She was certainly more deflated in the second hearing than when she had been called in the first time to testify about how she had handled the tapes. DAVIES: And the 18 1/2-minute gap was never officially explained. There was a lot of speculation about it. You write in the book that you have a theory that places Richard Nixon himself as the prime suspect. Why? WINE-BANKS: There's a lot of reasons why. He has the motive to erase it because it was the very first tape on our subpoena. Likely, in preparation for whether he was going to give them to us or not, he listened to the tapes. And logically, he would have listened to that one first. My theory is he listened to them and went, oh, this is bad. It shows that I know everything just a few days after the break-in. I can't let people hear that. So he erases it. Then he goes to the second tape and goes, oh, my gosh, they're all bad... DAVIES: (Laughter). WINE-BANKS: ...I can't erase them all, so I'm just going to have to stonewall and refuse to turn them over. DAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC. Her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the Watergate scandal is called \"Watergate Girl.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBBEN FORD & BILL EVANS' \"CATCH A RIDE\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is Jill Wine-Banks. She's an attorney and legal analyst for MSNBC. She was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation in the early '70s. She has a new memoir called \"Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\" You know, eventually, the special counsel's office asks for 64 more tapes, and there's a battle that goes all the way to the Supreme Court. And eventually, the court rules that they must be turned over. And that meant that you and the special counsel's office got the tapes. You could hear them themselves. And I'm just wondering, you write in the book about the people who listened to them - I mean, both you and women who were employed by the FBI later who had to transcribe hours and hours of them. The emotional impact of listening to these tapes, just share that with us. WINE-BANKS: Even to this day I remember how devastated and disappointed I was listening because imagining can never be as bad as actually hearing the president committing crimes. And it's not just the expletives, deleted language that was disturbing, but it was the fact that in the Oval Office, these conversations were taking place about paying hush money to make sure that the Watergate burglars never said that they were hired by the White House and the Committee to Reelect, that they were told to commit perjury. One of them was told to leave the country. And as they planned all this and used unaccounted campaign money, which led to legislation that's been undone by Citizens United, the Supreme Court case, they had so much money that they could spend it. And it's just very disturbing because I was raised to respect the president and the presidency, even if it wasn't someone that I agreed with politically. And so that was a - what I now see as a childhood vision that was just destroyed listening to the president committing crimes. DAVIES: And you mentioned that some of the women who were transcribing the tapes just... WINE-BANKS: Yes. DAVIES: ...Literally had tears on their cheeks. WINE-BANKS: They did. They cried because they couldn't believe what they were hearing as they listened to this horrible series of conversations. And it's available to anyone who wants to listen through the National Archives. You can listen to these tapes. And it's proof beyond doubt of the president's culpability. DAVIES: You know, one of the things that occurred to me as I read this was the power of being the first to set a narrative in a controversy like this. And in particular, there's this tape on March 21 of 1973 where, in Nixon's office, they're talking about raising a million dollars to ensure the loyalty and silence of the Watergate burglars. And Nixon says, yeah, we could get a million dollars. And the version that we first heard of this came from one of the president's, you know, inner circle, Bob Haldeman, at the Senate hearings in which he said, yeah, the president said, yes, we could get a million dollars, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. WINE-BANKS: (Laughter). DAVIES: Now, I paid a lot of attention to this. And I remembered that as being what he actually said - yes, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. When you actually got the tape, it didn't say that, did it? WINE-BANKS: It didn't, and John Dean had told us it didn't. So we knew that it didn't say that. But again, when you listen to it and you're waiting for those words and they don't come, you not only know that Bob Haldeman committed perjury, but you also know that the president was part of a conspiracy to pay hush money. And it proves your case in a way that almost nothing else could have done. DAVIES: But the interesting thing to me is that millions of Americans, me among them, believed that the president said it would be wrong, and that's because that was the first narrative we heard. It really matters who gets out in front of a story, doesn't it? (Laughter). WINE-BANKS: It does. And I hate to draw parallels to today, but how can you not when you look at what Attorney General William Barr did in terms of the Mueller report and so many other things? He misled the public and withheld the actual facts until the narrative had been set and people accepted it. And then when the truth came out, people were - well, he said, and I believe that, even though that was completely untrue. DAVIES: Just for the record, the actual quote from the tapes. The president says, \"you could get a million dollars, you could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten. It is not easy, but it could be done. But the question is, who the hell would handle it? Any ideas on that?\" Nothing about it being wrong. WINE-BANKS: Exactly. DAVIES: You have a poignant description of Rose Mary Woods after Nixon resigns. After the Supreme Court insists he turn over the tapes and it's clear he doesn't have the political support to survive a trial in the Senate, he resigns. She's around a bit. Tell us a bit about what she does. WINE-BANKS: She was moved out of her office adjacent to the Oval Office to a remote office in the Executive Office Building where she maintained a shrine to Richard Nixon until she was eventually, under President Ford, moved to a separate building, a little townhouse on Lafayette Square across from the White House. And she wasn't allowed to send mail to the president or communicate with him and eventually became - she said it was like being a B-list celebrity instead of an A-list. It's ironic, but she lived in the Watergate complex and had a nice lifestyle, eventually moving back to her hometown in Ohio and basically being out of the limelight. I very much would have loved to have interviewed her. I would have loved to have interviewed friends of hers because I really wanted to portray her not just as the stereotypical way she's portrayed. I wanted to portray her as her friends knew her, but none of them would talk to me. They felt that I was the enemy, and I felt I just was doing my job and now would like to portray her fully. I did as much research as I could, tried so many people. Bob Woodward advised me to stop calling people and to actually knock on their door because it would be harder to slam the door in my face. And guess what? I went to interview someone who knew her quite well, and they slammed the door in my face. DAVIES: You said that she had - when she was at the Executive Office Building in the days following Nixon's departure that she maintained a little shrine to Nixon. What was it? WINE-BANKS: She kept all of his personal belongings exactly as they were, including an ashtray with a half-smoked cigar. DAVIES: I wanted to just ask about the current president. I mean, it's clear that you believe from the facts and the law that impeachment and removal for office was warranted. As it turned out, you know, the refusal of the Senate to consider additional testimony and evidence and the swift acquittal of President Trump has left him in a perhaps stronger position than he might have been without it. Certainly, that's the view of Mitch McConnell, who said that this was a political blunder for the Democrats. You know, your area is law, not politics. But I'm just wondering, was it wise, do you think, for House Democrats to pursue the course they did? WINE-BANKS: I think it was. And it's easier to say that as a nonpolitician, but I don't think that leaving a president who does the things that President Trump has done unaccountable is acceptable. And yes, his acquittal means that he is now with no guardrails and may do even worse things in the next few months before the election. And if he happens to be reelected, his second term will be even more horrible in terms of violations of the law. So I think it was the right thing to do. I don't think it leaves him any stronger. Over 80% of the country believes that there should have been witnesses, that there should have been documents, that this was a sham trial. And I think that what we're going to find is that Americans are going to hold their senators responsible for cutting this off. To me, one of the most painful things was listening to the not guilties after senators had said, well, yes, he's guilty, he's done these things. Yes, the evidence is overwhelming. They weren't just saying unimpeachable. They had to say the words not guilty, and that was just not correct. DAVIES: Well, Jill Wine-Banks, thanks you so much for speaking with us. WINE-BANKS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure, Dave. DAVIES: Jill Wayne Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC.

Aside from times of genuine national crisis, it is hard to recall a week with as many events of political significance as the one we have all just witnessed. As a kickoff for the re-election year of a president, it could scarcely have been more fraught.  And as always, our perception of events was subject to our differing political perspectives. When high-impact moments come in such rapid succession, it is all too easy to lose track of meaningful developments. We may all look back on early February and wonder at how much we missed while we were trying to focus on so many things at once. But by week's end, President Trump had much to celebrate: acquittal in his impeachment trial, more good news on the economy and an unforced error on the part of the opposition party, which flubbed the first contest in its process of nominating Trump's November challenger. Of course, in the same time frame, the president had also disappointed those in his own party who had hoped the impeachment struggle would chasten him.  Instead of moderating his rhetoric or taking the high road, the president immediately set about settling scores. He  ripped into critics at a prayer breakfast and at a celebratory gathering at the White House, and he closed the week by firing two of the witnesses against him in last fall's pre-impeachment hearings \u2014  Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (and his brother) from the National Security Council staff. The week had begun with the Senate hearing closing arguments in Trump's impeachment trial,  just the third trial of a U.S. president in our national history.  It was a big story, but it would soon be swallowed up in subsequent news, a sequence that would be repeated throughout the week. Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, addresses the media about the aftermath of the Iowa caucuses on Friday in Des Moines.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Pope/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, addresses the media about the aftermath of the Iowa caucuses on Friday in Des Moines. That night, much of the nation watched and waited while the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) struggled to tabulate results in the state's first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. The night ended without a winner.  And that was an understatement. On Tuesday the debacle in Des Moines continued as the IDP was unable to sort out all the problems caused by a new phone app, which some precinct volunteers had not downloaded prior to caucus night. Training and testing had been minimal, at best, and telephone lines used for back-up had quickly overloaded. On Tuesday night we witnessed an unforgettable version of the president's annual State of the Union report, which for more than 70 years has been a widely viewed television event.But long before it went on the tube, the State of the Union was known for bringing together Washington's power players in an atmosphere of civility and shared respect. The importance of reaching TV viewers has long since eclipsed that of pleasing members of Congress and other grandees who watch the speech in the House chamber. But on this occasion, Trump played to his strengths as a reality-TV star, staging a show sure to inspire his supporters, enrage his critics, and engage a broad sweep of the national audience. The president surprised a Philadelphia grade-school girl with a scholarship to the \"school of her choice,\" surprised a military family with the return of their husband and father, and surprised a 100-year-old veteran of the Tuskegee Airmen with a special salute from his great-grandson.

At the end, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the speech. Democrats were not just restive as they sat in the chamber, they were downright rebellious. When the president spoke of prescription drug prices, a group of Democrats stood and chanted \"H.R. 3, H.R. 3\" \u2013 a reference to a bill on that subject that has languished in the Senate since the House passed it last year. Positioned behind the president, Vice President Mike Pence often applauded and even stood to applaud. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat beside him unmoved.  She had offered her hand to Trump when he arrived, but he had not taken it.  She had introduced him without the ritual reference to it being her \"high privilege and distinct honor\" to do so. Throughout the speech, she could be seen to be shuffling papers or glancing around in apparent exasperation. When the president had finished, she stood and tore her ceremonial copy in half. Asked about it later, she said the president \"shredded the truth\" so she \"shredded the speech.\" On Wednesday, the five-month drama of Trump's impeachment came to an end in the Senate with neither article receiving even half the votes in the chamber. As removal would have required 67 votes, there had never been any real doubt of Trump's eventual acquittal. Democratic hopes of prying loose a substantial fraction of the Republican majority had been dashed when the Senate voted the previous Friday not to call witnesses or consider new evidence. Nonetheless, the finality of Wednesday's vote reverberated with historic importance. Much was made of an emotional speech from Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who cast the only Republican vote to remove Trump from office. He was the first senator of either party in American history to vote to remove an impeached president of his own party. Romney's was also the only break from party in the chamber, as all 45 Democrats and both independents voted for Trump's removal. The president responded within minutes by tweeting a meme showing yard signs for Trump 2020 and 2024 and 2028 and 2032 and beyond. pic.twitter.com/JDS4zUXXJG The next day he would accuse Romney of using religion\"as a crutch.\" On Thursday, the fallout continued from Iowa, the State of the Union and the impeachment vote. We learned that in addition to all their other travails, the Iowa Democrats had been trolled by disrupters calling the backup telephone number intended for reporting results. While the volume of legitimate calls might have been enough to jam the lines, the impact of the trolls served to emphasize the vulnerability of the entire enterprise. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called for a recanvassing of the vote. Iowa resisted. Republicans exulted in the show of ineptitude. Meanwhile, the president had made news at the annual Capitol Hill Prayer Breakfast by wading into the impeachment controversy. He waved a copy of a newspaper with an enormous \"ACQUITTED\" headline and assailed his critics, including Romney and Pelosi. He said Romney had no right to cloak his vote in his religious faith, and said he doubted that Pelosi really prayed for him (as she has on occasion said she did). Pelosi was sitting a few feet away at the time. In a more typical week in a more normal time, this incident might have dominated news for a day or so. But on this Thursday, it was swiftly superseded. The president gathered White House staff, supporters from Congress and administration figures in the East Room of the White House. He told them and the cameras that the various probes of his actions had been terribly unfair to him \u2013 beginning even before he was elected. He called the impeachment managers \"vicious\" and \"evil\" and aimed another broadside at Pelosi (who was not present). On Friday, as uncertainties still plagued the counting in Iowa, the New York Times reported it had found problems heretofore unreported. The Associated Press, which had been saying all week it was \"too early to call\" a winner, had packed it in Thursday night and said a winner could not be determined. By then, it may have been too late to care. Except that, while the Iowa winner was not clear, the losers were rather apparent. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg seemed locked in a struggle at the top, but Sen, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was a disappointing third and former Vice President Joe Biden a disastrous fourth \u2013 barely ahead of Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. So, even in its moment of frustration and futility, Iowa had once again managed to \"shake up\" the expectations of prominent candidates. That was clear on Friday night, when the week of Big Stories concluded with the ABC-WMUR-Apple News debate in Manchester, N.H. The latest debate featured seven qualifying candidates: Sanders, Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, Klobuchar, Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer. (Another debate on Feb. 19 in Nevada is expected to include former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.) The New Hampshire debate had Buttigieg front and center, subject to the slings of arrows directed at any new front-runner \u2013 based on his rising standing in New Hampshire polls and his surprise showing in Iowa. Whether Iowa will still have this kind of impact in 2024 is problematic, as its front-of-the-line position is once again under pressure and its vote tallying fiasco has been a major embarrassment to the candidates and the national party. There may not be much Iowa can do about its unrepresentative demographics (more than 90% Anglo white). But it may be persuaded to modify or abandon the precinct caucus format it has used since 1972. This is the third time in as many cycles that one party or the other has had a problem determining the Iowa caucuses' statewide winner. If so, the Iowa Caucus will join the State of the Union address and the Senate's right to try cases of impeachment as institutions we will not see in quite the same way after this particular \"week that was.\"",

When President Trump stands before Congress on Tuesday to deliver his State of the Union address, he will be a president impeached, but not yet acquitted. Traditionally, the State of the Union address is the most important and most-watched speech of the year for a president. Doing it in the midst of an impeachment trial adds another political dimension. President Clinton faced a similar situation in 1999. He delivered his State of the Union on the very day his legal team began presenting his impeachment defense to senators. When Clinton entered the House chamber that night, members of Congress stood and applauded. Dennis Hastert, the Republican speaker of the House who had voted to impeach Clinton, offered a warm greeting. \"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States,\" Hastert said in introducing Clinton. In his speech, which lasted more than an hour, Clinton never once mentioned impeachment, and his speechwriters say there was never a question of doing so. They stuck to bipartisan and optimistic themes. \"As he stood up there and was applauded, this did not feel like a president whose presidency actually hung in the balance,\" said Jeff Shesol, a White House speechwriter at the time and now a partner at West Wing Writers, a speechwriting firm. Similar to Trump's situation today, there wasn't a lot of suspense about whether Clinton ultimately would be removed from office. He was riding high with near-record job approval. The economy was booming, and the budget deficit had been erased. \"America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless,\" Clinton said in his speech. \"But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency.\" In the speech, Clinton proposed a long-term fix for Social Security to put it \"on a sound footing for the next 75 years.\" Which is to say, his policy ambitions weren't constrained by the specter of impeachment. Throughout his impeachment and the years of investigations that preceded it, Clinton had tried to maintain an air of floating above it all. \"I think it increased our commitment to bipartisan themes that you probably would have seen in any event,\" Shesol said of the 1999 speech. In his State of the Union address last year, President Trump warned House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that \"if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In his State of the Union address last year, President Trump warned House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that \"if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\" For Trump, the Senate vote on two articles of impeachment is set for Wednesday. The outcome is all but certain. But when he gives his State of the Union address, the vote won't have happened yet, robbing him of the opportunity to tout his acquittal. In an interview on Fox over the weekend, Trump said he wasn't considering a delay in the address. \"I'm going to have it. It's going to be done,\" Trump said. \"We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made. Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things.\" To that end, a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the speech on the condition of anonymity said the theme will be \"the great American comeback.\" The official described it as an optimistic speech that would touch on the economy, trade, paid family leave, immigration and national security. But he also hinted that Trump would draw contrasts with Democrats, including possible election opponents sitting in the chamber. \"He will contrast his vision with radical proposals being floated on the left,\" the official said. \"Clearly, socialism is a rising force in the Democratic Party with very specific designs on our health care system.\" If Trump follows through with a partisan attack on Democrats, that would be a different tack than Clinton's aggressively bipartisan message of 21 years ago. The administration official wouldn't say whether Trump would mention impeachment. But last year, with the Russia investigation underway, Trump issued a warning to Democrats that \"if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\" The line landed with a thud in the House chamber with applause that failed to catch on and audible murmurs. In the end, there were investigations, yet there were also a handful of bipartisan legislative accomplishments. President Clinton goes over his 1999 State of the Union speech with speechwriter Michael Waldman and deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Jaffe/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Clinton goes over his 1999 State of the Union speech with speechwriter Michael Waldman and deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste. If Trump delivers the speech his White House has previewed, there could be awkward moments as Democrats who sought to remove him from office and others running to replace him sit and listen as he delivers the themes of his reelection campaign to a national television audience. Trump will deliver his speech just feet away from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, looking out on a chamber full of senators who will serve as jurors in his trial. The House impeachment managers who spent hours arguing passionately for his conviction will be there, too. There was awkwardness in 1999, too. Michael Waldman, then the director of speechwriting for Clinton, described the event as \"a truly miserable experience\" for many of the Republican senators. \"They had to adjourn the trial and trudge over to the House chamber and sit there while Bill Clinton got up to the rostrum and gave an ebullient, confident, even visionary State of the Union speech on national television,\" Waldman said.",

The cards are passed up to Chief Justice John Roberts.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senators are using these cards to hand-write their inquiries during President Trump's impeachment trial. The cards are passed up to Chief Justice John Roberts. Updated at 10:08 p.m. ET Senators fought a genteel melee over new witnesses in the impeachment trial on Wednesday but even hours' worth of questions, answers, and litigation on other issues didn't reveal an obvious path forward. Members used dozens of written submissions over several hours to argue for and against the case for witnesses, the strength of the impeachment case and, in some cases, to actually ask questions. But as the Q&A session rolled on Wednesday ahead of another session scheduled for Thursday, the way ahead still was not clear as to whether John Bolton or other witnesses might appear. \"At this point it's obvious \u2014 we don't have the votes yet,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., talking to reporters during a break. The issue about Bolton's testimony isn't only important to the substance of the evidence in the case, but how much longer the trial goes. If the Senate were to reject the admission of Bolton or other witnesses in a vote expected on Friday, it could close down the proceedings comparatively quickly \u2014 quickly in Senate terms at least. If the chamber admits Bolton, that could add days, weeks or more. Ambassador Bolton Although Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is understood to have told senators that he can't marshal enough support to block witnesses and simply end the trial, it also isn't clear whether, if senators voted to admit new witnesses, they could then agree on which ones or the rules under which they could testify. The White House has warned senators that it might resist an attempt to call former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials and that could result in months of legal gridlock that would idle the Senate. \"We're going to be here for a very, very long time and that's not good for the United States,\" warned lawyer Jay Sekulow. President Trump's attorneys also argue that the Senate shouldn't be a fact-finding body in the impeachment process and that it must deal with the evidence only developed so far by the House. Bolton himself also presents special issues, lawyer Patrick Philbin argued on Wednesday, because his role might be protected most strongly by the doctrine of executive privilege, which permits an administration to shield some of its workings from the public. \"National security and foreign affairs are the crown jewels of executive privilege,\" Philbin said. \"To suggest of the national security adviser, 'Oh, we'll just subpoena him, he'll come in, it'll be easy' \u2014 that's not the way it would work.\" Philbin also confirmed that the White House has notified Bolton that the manuscript he has submitted for pre-publication review contains what it considers top secret information and accordingly can't be published until it's been cleared. That raises the stakes for Bolton to appear himself, or for senators to get access to the manuscript \u2014 if they can reach some kind of accommodation among themselves. House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., warned Senators that he believed the White House is trying to stonewall them the way he argues it already has the House. Resolving issues over witnesses needn't take unduly long, he said, among other reasons because senators already have U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presiding over the proceedings. Schiff said he trusts Roberts to adjudicate questions of witnesses and process \u2014 and quickly. The bottom line, Schiff said, is to bring all relevant evidence into the process to make it legitimate. \"You can't have a fair trial without witnesses,\" he said. Questions to the deskSenators wrote questions on specially printed cards that were then carried to Roberts, who read them either for the House Democrats or Trump's lawyers. Senators used their questions to set up partisan allies to deliver talking points, ask questions of opponents that might embarrass them, and, occasionally, to try to elicit new information. Ears across Washington perked up each time Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah were associated with a query; they're among the small group of potential rebels who might join with Democrats to vote to add witnesses. Four such Republicans would be required. Although the descriptions about McConnell's remarks to senators this week suggested he may have a sense about which ones have reached that decision, their identities weren't certain. One thing that was resolved by events on Wednesday was that Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner would not vote for new witnesses, his office said. Arizona Sen. Martha McSally later joined him with a statement on Twitter. I have heard enough. It is time to vote. Otherwise much of the discussion in the Senate chamber involved lobbing parliamentary brickbats, with the odd philosophical digression about the nature of presidential power. The professor Another of Trump's attorneys, Alan Dershowitz, for example, argued that because a president always believes his own election and administration are in the public interest, it's virtually impossible for him to act officially without also acting for his own personal benefit \u2014 except in cases when he might profit financially. And that means he can't be impeached on the basis of motives that no outside person could parse, he argued. \"It cannot be a corrupt motive if you have a mixed motive that partially involves the national interest,\" Dershowitz said. Democratic senators rejected that notion in questions that set the stage for Schiff to repeat his criticisms of Trump's broad claims of power under the Constitution. \"What you see is a president who identifies the state as being himself,\" Schiff said. Another Democratic manager rejected the idea, raised in a question, that Trump circumvented any wrongdoing because the military assistance he froze for Ukraine last year ultimately was released and allowed to flow as Congress intended. No, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \u2014 first because the Government Accountability Office has since concluded that freeze broke the law but also because, under Democrats' \"attempted extortion\" metaphor, Trump still had abused his power. \"Getting caught doesn't mitigate the wrongdoing,\" Lofgren said. The Biden impeachment Other questions focused on the Constitutional standards for impeachable conduct, the president's power to conduct foreign policy and what standard of evidence should apply in the trial. Many of Democrats' questions emphasized witnesses and actions by Trump. Meanwhile, many Republicans' questions underscored what they called the weakness of the process so far and also included reminders about the role of Vice President Joe Biden in the Ukraine saga. Trump sought investigations by Ukraine's president including one into Biden and his son Hunter, who was paid by a Ukrainian gas company at the same time Biden was leading Ukraine policy for the administration of President Obama. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who gave a presentation about the Bidens earlier in the trial, reprised what she called the troubling story and used, as Trump's camp had promised before, the impeachment of Trump as an impeachment of Biden. Other subsequent questions afforded openings later in the evening for Trump's team to revive the subject of Biden and what his attorneys suggested might be wrongdoing during the Obama era. No official inquiry has \"cleared\" the Bidens or \"debunked\" the allegations they might have acted improperly, argued Trump attorney Eric Herschmann. House manager Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., urged senators to confine their discussion in the chamber to what she called the heart of the matter. \"As we go through this very tough, very difficult debate over whether to impeach and remove the president of the United States I'd ask that we stay focused,\" she said. \"The last few days we've seen many distractions, many things have been said to take our minds off the truth of why we're really here.\"",

Updated at 9:00 p.m. ET House Democrats on Friday finished their third and final day of arguments that President Trump, impeached by the House, now should be convicted and removed from office by the Senate. The president's lawyers will get their turn to lay out the case for acquittal starting this weekend. \"A toxic mess\" Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., continued to lay out the arguments behind the first article of impeachment, which charges that the president abused the power of his office by withholding $391 million in military aid to Ukraine while he pressured the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into the activities there of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. As Schiff did so, he played a clip of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saying, \"We are all Ukrainians.\" Schiff also asked senators, \"Do you think for a moment that any of you, no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president, do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated? Do you think for a moment that he wouldn't?\" He added, \"And if somewhere deep down below, you realize that he would, you cannot leave a man like that in office.\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., another manager, charged that Trump \"created a toxic mess at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\" He said Trump \"tried to cheat, he got caught, and then he worked hard to cover it up.\" House manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, said Trump \"does not have to respect the Congress. He does not have to respect the representatives of the people. Only his will goes. He is a dictator. This must not stand.\" As Schiff finished the Democrats' 24 hours of opening arguments just before 9 p.m. Friday, he pleaded with his last words to the Senators present. \"I implore you, give America a fair trial,\" Schiff said. \"She's worth it.\" Defense of the president Trump's legal team is set to begin its own opening arguments on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET. The lawyers will speak for about three hours on Saturday to lay out \"coming attractions\" for the impeachment trial next week \u2014 including a discussion of efforts to dig up dirt on Trump during his 2016 election campaign through a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele \u2014 said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys. Sekulow told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday that Trump's team will respond to issues raised by Democratic House managers, including foreign interference in the 2016 election and the hiring of Hunter Biden by a Ukrainian gas company. Like the House managers, Trump's lawyers have 24 hours over three days to make their case, before a period of questioning by the senators. Trump had weighed in against a long Saturday session, tweeting on Friday morning that Saturday \"is called Death Valley in T.V.\" Loading... The question of executive privilege Outside the Senate chamber, Republicans and Democrats continued their debate over whether additional witnesses should be called. Arguments were aimed in particular at a handful of Republican senators, such as Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, who might be persuaded one way or the other. Republicans have been arguing that hearing from additional witnesses would stretch out the proceedings, particularly if the Trump administration challenges the subpoenas as a violation of executive privilege. That's the doctrine that permits a presidential administration to conceal some of its workings from the public. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it could \"destroy executive privilege,\" if Democrats insisted on calling witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Schiff scoffed at the notion that the Senate should refrain from calling witnesses over such a possibility. Moreover, he argued, executive privilege is to protect legitimate deliberations and can't be used to shield wrongdoing. \"This is not a trial over a speeding ticket or shopping ticket; this is an impeachment trial involving the president of the United States,\" Schiff told reporters. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that if subpoenas were issued by the Senate, \"by definition, the subpoenas will be bipartisan and they will be signed by the chief justice of the United States\" \u2014 implying they would have additional weight and be less likely to be challenged in court. The president and his supporters have maintained that Trump had real concerns about corruption in Ukraine, saying the call for probes was not driven by a desire to boost Trump's own political prospects. They say it is Democrats who are seeking political gain by launching an inquiry in the first place. Republicans have largely stood by Trump, and because they hold a majority in the Senate, Trump is likely to be acquitted of both charges. Read more about the Senate trial process here.

That detail was among a trove of documents provided by Giuliani associate Lev Parnas that were made public by the House Intelligence Committee late Tuesday. The House impeached Trump last month for abuse of office and obstruction of Congress, and lawmakers delivered articles to the Senate Wednesday, where a trial is likely to open next week. The records provided by Parnas, who has been indicted in New York for alleged campaign finance violations, add to the evidence already released documenting Giuliani's efforts to get the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to publicly announce an investigation related to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had ties to a Ukrainian energy company. Among the documents is a note handwritten by Parnas on stationery from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Vienna, in which he appears to list tasks to carry out regarding Ukraine. The note begins with an imperative: \"get Zalensky [sic] to Annouce [sic] that the Biden case will Be Investigated.\" But it's a string of WhatsApp messages from late March 2019 taken from Parnas' phone that is drawing the most scrutiny. In those texts, Parnas and an associate named Robert F. Hyde, a retired Marine who is running for Congress as a Republican in Connecticut, criticize Yovanovitch, who was still a U.S. ambassador at the time. \"Wow. Can't believe Trumo [sic] hasn't fired this bitch. I'll get right in that,\" Hyde wrote in an encrypted message to Parnas. He added, \"She under heavy protection outside Kiev.\" In WhatsApp messages between Lev Parnas and Republican congressional candidate Robert F. Hyde in March 2019, Hyde describes apparent surveillance of then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine. The Trump administration recalled Yovanovitch months later.\n                \n                    \n                    Screenshot by NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In WhatsApp messages between Lev Parnas and Republican congressional candidate Robert F. Hyde in March 2019, Hyde describes apparent surveillance of then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine. The Trump administration recalled Yovanovitch months later. The messages also seem to indicate that Hyde might have been involved in monitoring Yovanovitch and her movements. \"They are moving her tomorrow,\" Hyde later wrote, quickly followed by, \"The guys over they asked me what I would like to do and what is in it for them.\" Hyde said Yovanovitch had turned off her phone and computer, and that his associates in Ukraine would give updates on the ambassador's movements. He added, \"They are willing to help if we/you would like a price ... Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money ... what I was told.\" \"Lol,\" Parnas replied. Two days later, on March 29, Hyde wrote, \"It's confirmed we have a person inside.\" Parnas said Wednesday in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC that he never took Hyde seriously and his replies were intended to mollify him. Parnas said in the interview that he regretted being part of the chain of events that ended with Yovanovitch being removed as ambassador. In a a flurry of comments Wednesday, Hyde said he has never been to Kyiv and that the highlighted exchange was all in fun and had been misconstrued. \"How low can liddle Adam Bull Schiff go?\" Hyde asked in a posting to both Twitter and Facebook. He later added, \"For them to take some texts my buddy's and I wrote back to some dweeb we were playing with that we met a few times while we had a few drinks is definitely laughable.\" Hyde then used some off-color language to describe Schiff and added, \"Have fun with your witch-hunt liddle Schiff.\" About two months after the WhatsApp exchange, President Trump abruptly recalled Yovanovitch from her post. He has repeatedly vilified the ambassador, at one point telling Zelenskiy over the phone that \"things were going to happen to her,\" according to an account released by the White House. Yovanovitch was asked about that comment during her testimony during the House impeachment hearings in November. \"I saw it as a threat,\" she replied. In response to the newly released Parnas documents, Yovanovitch's attorney, Lawrence S. Robbins, issued a statement on his client's behalf: \"Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing. We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.\" The exchange between Parnas and Hyde is \"profoundly alarming,\" says Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, who chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Citing the possible risk to Yovanovitch's security in Kyiv, Engel issued a statement Wednesday saying he will send the State Department a formal request for information and a briefing related to the revelations. \"This unprecedented threat to our diplomats must be thoroughly investigated and, if warranted, prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Engel said. NPR has also sought comment from the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which had not responded as of late Wednesday morning. The House documents also include a record of a previously undisclosed letter Giuliani sent to Zelenskiy on May 10, 2019, urgently seeking a meeting following the Ukrainian president's election victory. In it, Giuliani said he was reaching out as Trump's personal attorney and \"with his knowledge and consent.\" Signed by Giuliani, the one-page letter reads in part: \"I am private counsel to President Donald J. Trump. Just to be precise, I represent him as a private citizen, not as President of the United States. This is quite common under American law because the duties and privileges of a President and a private citizen are not the same. Separate representation is usual process. [...] \"However, I have a more specific request. In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming Monday, May 13th or Tuesday, May 14th.\" The letter fell into the committee's hands because it was on Parnas' phone: he texted a copy of the letter to one of Zelenskiy's aides, in an attempt to bolster Giuliani's approach to the newly elected leader. In releasing the documents, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff wrote, \"Giuliani's letter makes clear that his trip, which he publicly described at the time as an effort to 'meddle in an investigation,' was undertaken with the knowledge and support of President Trump.\" Schiff sent a flash drive containing the materials to House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler as part of the accumulation of evidence in the impeachment inquiry. In a letter describing the contents, Schiff said he was also sending a second flash drive in a sealed envelope, adding that it includes \"sensitive personal information that should be protected from public disclosure.\" NPR's Ryan Lucas and Michele Kelemen contributed to this report.",

Suburban voters have been growing as a share of the electorate since the mid-1990s, and they have become consequential in presidential elections. They could be determinative in this one too, as they make up roughly half of all voters. Since George W. Bush's reelection, the candidate who won the suburbs won the election, except in 2012. Then, Mitt Romney won the suburbs and lost to Barack Obama, showing why it's even more important for a Republican to win over suburban voters. Based on national exit polls, here are the percentages of the electorate that were suburban voters in recent elections, plus the margins for each candidate: 2004: 45% (Bush 52%-47%) 2008: 49% (Obama 50%-48%) 2012: 47% (Romney 50%-48%) 2016: 50% (Donald Trump 47%-45%) You can see that Trump won suburban voters narrowly in 2016, but he has since cratered with them. In recent polling, he's down by a historic margin, an average of 15 points. Some recent examples: ABC News/Washington Post: Joe Biden +9 Fox News: Biden +11 CNN: Biden +14 Quinnipiac University: Biden +22 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist: Biden +25 And it's especially bad among suburban women. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 66% of suburban women disapproved of the job President Trump is doing overall, and 58% said they \"strongly\" disapprove. That is stunning, considering suburban women have been a particular focus of Republicans in the last 20 years, dubbed everything from \"soccer moms\" to \"security moms\" to \"Walmart moms.\" Whatever you call them, they're not in Trump's corner \u2014 and the consequences have been massive for Republicans. They have been unable to pass any major legislative items since Democrats wrested control of the House in 2018. Democrats were able to do so because of their surprising strength in right-leaning suburban districts. An aerial view of Rancho Palos Verdes, a suburb of Los Angeles.\n                \n                    \n                    Daniel Slim/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An aerial view of Rancho Palos Verdes, a suburb of Los Angeles. Trump needs them back, and he's trying to use fear to do it. Amid COVID-19 spikes, Trump is trying to change the subject, running an ad called \"Abolished.\" It makes the case that \"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,\" because police departments would be defunded \u2014 even though Biden has said he's not in favor of defunding the police. And Trump seems to be trying to make his case with an anachronistic racial appeal to a declining audience. Trump has claimed that if his Democratic opponent were elected president, \"our suburbs\" would be destroyed. In recent weeks, he specifically called out a 2015 Obama-era fair-housing initiative that requires local governments to address historic patterns of racial segregation. \"Your home will go down in value, and crime rates will rapidly rise,\" Trump said. \"People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I'm here.\" But the suburbs have grown more diverse since the mid-20th century, when they were overwhelmingly white. The suburbs saw an explosion of growth then, as \"white flight\" from cities took hold. Leah Boustan, a Princeton University economics professor and author of the book Competition in the Promised Land: Black Migrants in Northern Cities and Labor Markets, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 2017: I compared the patterns of black migration into cities and white departures for the suburbs in 70 Northern and Western metropolitan areas from 1940 to 1970. I found that for every black arrival, two whites left the central city. This figure puts a precise value on what contemporaries already suspected: When black people moved in, white people moved out. Since then, though, particularly with Latino demographic growth, America's suburban counties are two-thirds white. A Pew Research Center study from 2018 found the suburbs to be 68% white, 14% Hispanic and 11% Black. The share of white people was down 8 percentage points from 2000. And in that time, Pew found immigrants made up a quarter of suburban growth. That kind of appeal, pitting whites against Blacks and Latinos, is outdated, Republican pollster Christine Matthews told NPR's Tamara Keith. \"He thinks it's basically the planned development of Levittown in the 1960s as opposed to today's suburbs, which are multiracial, diverse and highly educated,\" Matthews said. Trump's view of women's role in \u2014 or out of \u2014 the home is also antiquated. At his Tulsa, Okla., rally last month, he made up a story for effect that seems to have been a predecessor for the \"Abolished\" ad now running. He warned of what would happen, in his view, if police were \"defunded.\" \"Hey, it's 1 o'clock in the morning,\" Trump said, \"and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre, is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911, and they say, 'I'm sorry \u2014 this number's no longer working.' By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many.\" Trump also appealed to the \"Suburban Housewives of America\" in a tweet Thursday, saying, \"Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better!\" The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article. Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better! https://t.co/1NzbR57Oe6 But the percentage of mothers who stay at home has declined significantly from the 1960s, when they were about half of all mothers. Today they're about a quarter, according to Pew: 1967: 49% 2016 (latest data): 27% Trump has a view of America that seems frozen in time. He has said that America has most lived up to his \"Make America Great Again\" ideal at the start of the 20th century and in the \"late '40s and '50s,\" the postwar boom time. Nonwhites, though, hardly shared in the prosperity \u2014 or equality. There has been a sea change in America in recent decades on everything from views of race and protests to who Americans' neighbors are. The New York Times, for example, found that all-white neighborhoods are practically entirely gone, compared with their prominence 40 years ago: In 1980, about a quarter of the census tracts in America were almost exclusively white \u2014 97 percent non-Hispanic white or more \u2014 and one-third of white residents lived in such a neighborhood. Those figures are probably undercounts, as the 1980 census lacked tract boundaries for much of rural America. But by the latest census data, just 5 percent of white residents live in such a place, mostly in rural areas. Trump was able to squeeze out an Electoral College victory in 2016, despite losing the popular vote. And this year, as growing numbers of Americans disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, he's making a gamble with a shrinking part of the electorate.",

Voting rights advocates are batting 0-4 at the U.S. Supreme Court so far this year. A record number of election-related lawsuits are piling up in courts around the country as concerns mount about the safety of voting in person because of the coronavirus and the availability and reliability of voting by mail. With a pandemic raging and uncertainty brewing, some fear the Supreme Court's chilly attitude toward election lawsuits may add yet another obstacle to a free and fair election in November. Supreme Court declines to intervene The court's most visible decision on voting this year came in April, when, on the eve of the Wisconsin primary election, the five conservative justices voted to reverse a federal judge's order to expand the state's window for receiving absentee ballots. That lawsuit was brought in response to the coronavirus pandemic, as voters fearful of voting in person unleashed an \"avalanche of absentee ballots,\" in the words of the federal judge, that threatened to overwhelm the state's election system. Thanks to the Supreme Court's decision, thousands of ballots were thrown out for arriving too late. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented forcefully in that case and was joined by her liberal colleagues. She wrote that the court's decision \"boggles the mind\" as \"a voter cannot deliver ... a ballot she has not yet received. Yet tens of thousands of voters who timely requested absentee ballots\" were asked to do just that. The Supreme Court also demurred in two other pandemic-related election cases ahead of primary elections. In June, the court rejected a bid by the Texas Democratic Party to remove some barriers to absentee voting, particularly for voters under 65. Earlier this month, the court refused to make it easier for voters in three Alabama counties to use absentee ballots, keeping in place a requirement that voters submit an affidavit signed by a notary public or two adult witnesses. That decision blocked an opinion out of the normally conservative 11th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing relief to go forward. Last week, in a case from Florida, the justices preserved a last-minute order by the 11th Circuit that will bar hundreds of thousands of formerly incarcerated people from voting in the Aug. 18 primary and possibly the November general election as well. That litigation, unlike those involving the pandemic, involves a 2018 constitutional referendum to expand voting rights and the GOP-controlled state government's efforts to circumvent it. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan, accused the court of a \"trend of condoning disenfranchisement.\" With the exception of the Texas vote, which had no noted dissents, the decisions in these election cases fell largely along partisan lines with the court's five conservative and Republican appointees voting to deny relief that would make it easier to vote and most or all of the court's liberal and Democratic appointees noting their dissent. \"We know that we're always in an uphill fight in the Roberts court when we're fighting for voting rights,\" says Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU. But because of the \"emergency posture that we're going to be in between now and November ... however steep our hill is in normal circumstances, it's only going to be steeper.\" Voting rights on the Roberts court Chief Justice John Roberts has long been skeptical of voting rights claims, a view that has been on full display this term and will likely weigh heavily on the court's behavior this November. When he was nominated to join the bench, Roberts famously promised to call \"balls and strikes,\" which, says Duke Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles, should include \"patrolling the boundaries of the political process.\" Instead, under Roberts, Charles says we have a \"court that says, 'You know what, we're not going to get involved.' \" Ultimately, this may give rise to concerns about an \"unregulated democratic process and ... democratic legitimacy of the election.\" In 2013, the chief justice wrote the court's 5-4 opinion striking down a major provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, effectively gutting the law. In his opinion, Roberts said that because \"the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting\" in states and cities with a history of discriminating against Black voters, those jurisdictions could now be trusted to pass new voting regulations and create new congressional districts without fear of discrimination. That prophecy proved incorrect. The decision immediately ushered in a bevy of state laws designed to decrease the voting power of minorities and make it harder to vote. Ginsburg, joined by her fellow liberal justices, predicted just such a result in her dissent, saying that taking away voting rights protections because Black voters were now voting in large numbers was akin to \"throwing away your umbrella in a shower because you are not getting wet.\" Roberts' antipathy toward the Voting Rights Act long predates his time on the bench. As a young assistant in the Department of Justice during the Reagan administration, Roberts waged a months-long crusade against strengthening the Voting Rights Act when it was set for reauthorization in 1982. Roberts lost that battle, but not before authoring dozens of memos warning that Congress should not make claims of racial discrimination in voting cases \"too easy to prove.\" Roberts was also a behind-the-scenes player in perhaps the court's most prominent election decision: Bush v. Gore. According to The New York Times, Roberts advised then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during Florida's recount of the 2000 vote and later helped the George W. Bush campaign's lawyers prepare their arguments. Justice Brett Kavanaugh was also on the Bush campaign's legal team in that case. Court wary of last-minute election action Looming over these recent decisions is a Supreme Court precedent dating back to 2006, Roberts' first year as chief justice. That decision said that federal courts should be wary of intervening in elections at the last minute because, the court said, disturbing the status quo can lead to confusion among voters that may deter them from turning out. That decision, unsigned but likely written by Roberts, amounted to just five pages and garnered no noted dissents. Initially, it was quite limited but appears to have been greatly expanded, especially by the court's conservatives, to be far more wide-ranging. \"The reluctance of the court to do anything does make some sense,\" says John Fortier, the director of governmental studies at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. \"Last minute changes close to the deadline ... really do risk the possibility of making an election hard to run or messy or calling into doubt ... the outcome.\" Danielle Lang, co-director for Voting Rights and Redistricting at the progressive Campaign Legal Center, says she agrees that in theory, refraining from disrupting elections at the last second is an \"unremarkable\" principle. But, in practice, it has become a \"magic word ... to get to a preferred outcome in election law cases,\" she says. Thus, in Wisconsin, the court said, it was too late to change election rules. But in the Florida case, the court allowed the circuit court to upset the legal status quo, creating confusion about who was eligible to vote. That seemingly selective application of an otherwise uncontroversial principle has advocates like Lang worried, especially because the court seldom explains its reasoning very thoroughly in emergency decisions like these; instead, if there is any explanation at all, it is usually in a brief, unsigned opinion. \"We need to get back to first principles\" by also considering whether court orders create or alleviate voter uncertainty \"rather than just narrowly looking at how many days before an election we're at,\" says Lang. Moreover, as Lang and other voting rights advocates point out, the first pandemic in a century is a natural and obvious exception to the general principle that courts shouldn't intervene close to Election Day. \"We are facing kind of unprecedented uncertainty in our country.\" she says. \"The court will have to grapple more with how to make sure that voters have confidence in the election come November.\" Election lawsuits pile up The Supreme Court's decisions so far have arisen out of primary elections. But there is a growing tsunami of voting rights litigation ahead of the November general election, which could see as many as 150 million voters turn out and with an unprecedented number attempting to vote by mail. \"The fact that we are trying to conduct our election in the midst of a pandemic is going to cause a continued increase in the amount of election litigation that we're going to see through this season,\" says Rick Hasen, a law professor at University of California, Irvine. According to Hasen's Election Law Blog, there have been 163 election-related lawsuits filed in 41 states and the District of Columbia in response to the coronavirus alone. And experts had already expected 2020 to shatter records for the number of voting rights lawsuits even before the pandemic. Much of that COVID-19 litigation is spurred when \"states don't make accommodations to their normal voting rules,\" raising questions \"about whether or not people are going to be able to vote safely in the midst of a pandemic,\" Hasen says. But not every lawsuit is brought by voters hoping to force their state to make it easier and safer to vote. Several states, such as Pennsylvania and Nevada, have affirmatively sought to expand access to mail-in voting, prompting conservative groups to challenge those measures. \"The real question with absentee and mail-based voting isn't should we do it? Of course we should do it. The question is, how should we do it safely?\" says Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University. Some states, such as Colorado, have had success running all-mail elections for years, verifying the security of their ballots by matching signatures, scanning bar codes on ballots at multiple junctures and working cooperatively with the U.S. Postal Service. But Morley warns that asking states without a history of running elections by mail to suddenly expand their capacity to accept mail-in ballots could strain the election system past the breaking point, possibly raising questions about the integrity of the outcome itself. He says courts expanding access to mail-in ballots without a proper plan are pulling \"pieces out of the Jenga tower of election administration.\" Those concerns prompted the Trump campaign to challenge the security of Pennsylvania's new vote-by-mail scheme in court, suing to require the state to take additional measures to prevent fraudulent voting. A federal judge agreed to expedite that litigation with arguments set to begin on Sept. 22. President Trump has been a vocal skeptic of voting by mail, repeatedly claiming without evidence that mail-in ballots are vulnerable to theft, tampering and outright fraud. Meanwhile, Trump has publicly resisted any attempt to infuse the cash-strapped Postal Service with much-needed federal funds, even as it teeters on the edge of insolvency as early as October. While Congress approved a $10 billion loan in an early coronavirus relief bill, the Postal Service has yet to access those funds due to conditions imposed by the Treasury Department that Democrats say would effectively hand Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin control of the Postal Service. Trump's hostility toward mail-in voting, combined with his attacks on the post office, led Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to accuse Trump of sabotaging the post office to disrupt mail-in voting at a digital campaign event in June featuring former President Barack Obama. Voting by mail necessary, but not always reliable While the president's claims of voter fraud are unfounded, even voting rights advocates acknowledge there is reason for caution when it comes to states hastily building out their capacity to receive votes by mail. A recent NPR analysis found that thousands of mail-in ballots have been rejected already this year. Sometimes ballots are tossed out for irregularities or mistakes, but often votes are not counted simply because they arrive too late or never arrive at all, frequently through no fault of the voter. The percentage of rejected ballots is low in most states but could prove crucial in a close election. Moreover, rejected ballots are disproportionately likely to belong to voters using mail-in voting for the first time, and there likely will be many more first-time voters casting their ballots by mail. The ACLU's Dale Ho notes several onerous requirements in some state mail-in voting regimes that his voting rights litigation team has or may challenge ahead of November, including obtaining a witness signature, providing an excuse for voting absentee, submitting a photo ID, meeting early deadlines and lacking an opportunity to \"cure\" defects in submitted ballots. Thus, while increased access to mail-in ballots may be an important measure for expanding access to a safe and fair election this November, the specter of voter disenfranchisement is omnipresent with numerous pitfalls threatening to keep voters from having their ballots counted. Even so, says Ho, \"We're really trying to make sure that everyone can vote safely, and that's primarily through mail.\"",

            "article_content": "Trump is building a political case around suburban identity that's targeting mostly white voters. He is also planning to repeal an Obama-era housing rule that is aimed to combat racial bias.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump announced today that he would repeal and replace an Obama-era housing rule aimed at reducing racial discrimination. It is a move that's not just about housing policy; it's also about Trump's bid to get reelected. He is engaging in a larger political strategy here to target swing voters in the suburbs, and the president's leaning on fear and racial divisions as he makes that pitch. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben is here to talk with us about it. Hi, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hello. SHAPIRO: Begin by explaining for us what this Obama housing rule that Trump is repealing actually did. KURTZLEBEN: Sure. So it's a rule known as the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, or AFFH for short. It was created under the umbrella of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, so it was created decades after that landmark law was passed. And it was aimed at eliminating racial housing discrimination and segregation. And we should mention here that the Justice Department sued the Trump family business in the early 1970s for housing discrimination at their family properties, so there is some related history here. But basically this rule said this - that if you're a community receiving federal housing funds, you have to do an assessment that looks for patterns of housing discrimination or segregation and then have plans to eliminate it. So it was instituted in 2015, but then the Trump administration greatly weakened it just two and a half years later. So there wasn't a lot of time for it to really get off the ground and have an effect. Now, proponents of the rules say that this rule gave the Fair Housing Act more teeth and just made it more enforceable, that it might mean that a community looks and sees that it needs to, you know, add more apartments, for example, something that allows people who can't afford a house, for example, to live there. So it might mean in practice rezoning a community so it's not just for detached, single-family homes. SHAPIRO: Danielle, you said that the Trump administration dramatically weakened this rule in 2018. So why take this step now? KURTZLEBEN: Well, the White House today said that the rule is an example of federal overreach and that the rule will discourage homeownership. And we should say opponents also say that the rule doesn't effectively bring down housing prices. The White House says that they are instituting a new rule to replace this one that they say would give power back to local communities. But this is also, of course, part of a larger political play that you mentioned. We should say here that when Trump talks about this rule, he's generally not making a nuanced policy pitch about housing stock, for example. He's making a political pitch. He's been saying that Democrat Joe Biden, who says he is in favor of this rule, that he would want to, quote, \"end single-family zoning.\" Now, that's not true, but this rule definitely could lead some communities to reduce that kind of zoning. Trump then turns that into an argument that Biden wants to, quote, \"abolish the suburbs\" - of course, also not true. Biden has no such plan, and the Biden campaign has been calling this a smear. SHAPIRO: So if this is a political tactic to win suburban voters, tell us about how important that voting group is in this election in November. KURTZLEBEN: Very. They're very important. They're - in part because they're plentiful. They made up half the electorate in 2016. And also, there are a lot of swing voters in the suburbs, particularly white women. Trump knows this. Today he tweeted about how the, quote, \"suburban housewives of America\" should read up on this policy. And he's implicitly making a racial pitch here because this is about a race-based policy. But the suburbs have been growing more diverse and more educated, by the way, and those are trends that both work against Donald Trump. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you.

Updated 5:05 p.m. ET, July 23 The White House is repealing and replacing an Obama-era rule intended to combat historic racial discrimination in housing. In a Wednesday announcement, the White House said it would be rolling back the rule as a part of a broader deregulation push. The rule has gained attention because Trump has been referencing it heavily in his push for suburban voters, falsely saying that former Vice President Joe Biden wants to \"abolish\" suburbs. Biden has no such plan, and his campaign calls this argument a \"smear.\" It's another instance of Trump implicitly using race in his campaign pitch, which he's also been doing explicitly on other issues. In this instance, the president appears to be using a policy to fight housing segregation in an attempt to scare white voters about outsiders coming into their neighborhoods. In a tele-town hall last week, he said that Democrats want to \"eliminate single-family zoning, bringing who knows into your suburbs, so your communities will be unsafe and your housing values will go down.\" Trump is doing this while most voters are primarily concerned about the pandemic and the recession, and as his standing with voters has suffered due to his response to that crisis. Here is a rundown of what Trump is talking about with this housing policy and how it could affect the campaign. What does Trump mean? In making this pitch about the suburbs, Trump has been attacking an Obama-era regulation called the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which was meant to combat housing discrimination. (More details on this later.) On his website, Biden says he would implement the rule as president. Trump has repeatedly attacked the rule for weeks. At the start of July, Trump tweeted that he intended potentially to repeal it. At the request of many great Americans who live in the Suburbs, and others, I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas. Corrupt Joe Biden wants to make them MUCH WORSE. Not fair to homeowners, I may END! But his administration has been critical of AFFH for a long time. In his January 2017 confirmation hearings, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson criticized the rule as an example of federal government overreach. What does the AFFH rule do? It tells jurisdictions that receive federal housing funds that they have to assess what patterns of housing discrimination they have and then come up with a plan to diminish them. It also provides a data-based tool for communities to use in doing this assessment. The rule was implemented in 2015 under the 1968 Fair Housing Act, a federal law that says federal agencies have to administer any housing-related programs \"in a manner affirmatively to further\" fair housing. Advocates said that the rule at long last gave specificity and teeth to that provision. \"What was on the books wasn't working,\" said Kathy O'Regan, professor of public policy and planning at New York University, who also worked at HUD under President Barack Obama and helped craft the AFFH rule. \"They had the obligation from the Fair Housing Act,\" she added. \"But HUD had never designed or implemented a robust system to support jurisdictions in meeting those obligations or to enforce jurisdictions meeting [them].\" In practice, that may well look like rezoning in some communities, according to Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \"When local communities are required to take a look at how segregation developed in their neighborhoods, most of them are going to find that it was local zoning that led to that purposeful, policy-driven segregation,\" she said. So when those cities have to put forward their plans to improve, she added, \"most of the time that's going to require that they remove some of those restrictive zoning laws and allow for apartment buildings to be built and put in [neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes], where currently they're not allowed.\" Boosting apartment supply would allow people who can't afford those suburban houses to move in. That, Yentel said, could be what Trump is talking about when he incorrectly says Democrats want to \"end single-family zoning.\" But on the campaign trail, Trump hasn't been getting into any real policy nuance. He has been using this policy as a steppingstone to talk to white suburban voters about fear of how their communities might change as a result of a race-focused policy. Trump has some history of clashing with housing discrimination laws; in 1973, he was a defendant, along with his father, in a Justice Department suit saying that their company discriminated against black rental applicants. What has the rule's status been up until now? The rule went into effect in 2015, but in January 2018, the Trump administration gutted it, telling cities they no longer had to use the tool (and that they had two more years to submit their assessments). Now, the Trump administration says it will be replacing the rule with one that will give greater power to local communities. In its announcement, the White House portrayed the Obama version of the  rule as an example of federal overreach, and also one that will threaten Americans' ability to buy homes. What did the AFFH do in suburbs? The rule didn't explicitly target suburbs, said O'Regan, but she can see it having sizable effects on some suburbs. \"You can imagine if you look at the distribution of where housing that's affordable is and isn't, that you'll see disparities between the suburbs and the cities, particularly the outer suburbs,\" O'Regan said. \"So you can imagine the implication is, you might want to do things differently in the future to address that.\" In other words, this sort of rule could put more affordable housing into the suburbs. Opponents of the rule echo the White House, saying it imposes unnecessary red tape and doesn't efficiently address housing supply. \"It's very much required a lot of hiring of experts, planners and land-use people and attorneys to create these very complex plans,\" said Edward Pinto, director of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center. \"The situations in each of those places could be very different. And the first question you have to ask is, how well does that community meet the supply need for housing in that community?\" Either way, O'Regan added, it's hard to know how well the rule limited housing bias because it was only in effect for less than three years under Obama before the Trump administration greatly weakened it. And the process of assessing, planning, potentially rezoning or changing other rules and then following through is years-long. Why is Trump making this about suburbs? A likely reason is that suburban voters are key to a Trump victory. Suburban voters \u2014 and suburban white women in particular \u2014 are valuable swing voters for Trump and seen as necessary to help him win reelection. Suburban voters made up around half of the electorate in 2016. In his rhetoric about this policy, Trump is saying that \"a suburb is the kind of community where great Americans live because we've limited it,\" said Lynn Vavreck, professor of politics and public policy at UCLA. \"I think it's just straight-up racializing this idea of housing,\" she said. \"This is the kind of argument that Trump makes all the time: 'I'm going to tell you that these people are good, or us versus them. We, the good people, and they, the bad people. And we have to keep them out to keep our greatness.' \"",

It is one of the 10 Army bases name after a Confederate official and Congress is considering a bill to change those names.\n                \n                    \n                    John Bazemore/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A bridge over I 185 marks the entrance to the U.S. Army's Fort Benning in Columbus, Ga. It is one of the 10 Army bases name after a Confederate official and Congress is considering a bill to change those names. Maryland Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown is African American, and as an Army combat veteran he knows first hand about the military's tributes to the Confederacy. Brown served at four of the 10 Army installations named for Confederate officers. \"I went to flight school at Fort Rucker. I learned to jump out of airplanes at Fort Benning. I deployed to Iraq from Fort Bragg,\" the House Democrat says, respectively, of the bases in Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. He also spent time at Fort Hood in Texas. Now, Brown is leading the charge in the House to rename those installations. This month, a House panel adopted his bipartisan measure, which also looks to remove other Confederate tributes from the military, in the defense bill. \"I grew up not knowing about the savagery of slavery,\" Brown, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said while introducing his amendment. \"But I know today, and America knows today, that these installations are named after officers that upheld that peculiar institution that inflicted so much pain and suffering on Black people in America.\" The Confederate symbols are embedded throughout the military. For example,  Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., wants to see such honors gone from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in his district, which includes building and street names and paintings for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. \"You will see the House, with bipartisan support, pass a defense bill that includes the long overdue requirement to stop honoring traitors to United States Constitution,\" Maloney predicts. It's part of a larger theme that will play into larger focus for the traditionally bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which is entering its 60th year. Both the full House and Senate are slated to debate the annual legislation next week, including a slew of proposals on use of force, discrimination and diversity in the ranks. It comes after Congress failed to reach a consensus last month on a police reform bill triggered by national outcry following the death of George Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis police custody in May. Now, some are eyeing the defense bill as a chance to revive that debate. One of those lawmakers, Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, is betting that President Trump's struggling poll numbers will give Republicans the boost they need to join forces. \"I believe that by putting these into the NDAA, and the closer we actually get to the election, especially once senators... see Trump's numbers are bad, that maybe they'll actually end up siding with us and and pass these reforms,\" Gallego said. Defense bill could enact police, racial injustice reforms For years, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz has been working to limit what military weapons get passed on to police departments. Now, he has more company: California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris and Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are joining Schatz to try to add the proposal to the defense bill. It will get a debate next week on the Senate floor. \"It only recently became a mainstream issue as we see tear gas being used on peaceful protesters and police departments being armed with things like armor- piercing bullets and bayonets,\" Schatz told NPR from his home state. \"There's a recognition that we are increasingly militarizing our police force and it doesn't make anyone safer. It doesn't make our police, women and men safer, and it certainly doesn't make communities safer.\" Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine says since the upper chamber didn't get to take up a police reform bill, this will be the first opportunity for some of his colleagues to take a position on this issue. Last month, Democrats blocked Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott from bringing his proposal to the floor, saying the measure fell short. The Senate GOP, in turn, declined to take up a House Democratic plan. \"I think we'll get into it on the floor and have meaningful votes on on racial justice topics that the nation needs to see the Senate addressing,\" Kaine said. Already, Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, got his  bipartisan provision into the defense bill to prohibit the use of troops for peaceful protests. It's an effort to respond to a threat by Trump during demonstrations to invoke the so-called Insurrection Act. On the House side, Texas Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar tried to take a different approach than Kaine's to addressing the Insurrection Act threat. Her measure would require Congressional approval before the president can deploy troops in such cases. The measure failed in committee, so now she's tweaking it to gain new supporters for full House floor debate next week. \"President Trump threatened to, in my view, abuse his authority and send the military into American communities, communities where there was tremendous pain,\" Escobar said. \"It's never a bad thing to create added transparency and to ensure that Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, is at least playing somewhat of a role in major decisions like sending the military into an American community.\" A presidential veto threat hangs over bill Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first to gain traction for her plan to rename military bases named for Confederates by including the provision in the defense bill. \"The tens of thousands of Americans protesting the appalling killings of Black men and women are calling upon us, on all of us, not just to say the words 'Black lives matter' but to take a tangible step toward making it true,\" Warren recently said on the Senate floor. But recently, President Trump attacked Warren and threatened to veto the legislation if her provision remains intact. Before the veto threat, some GOP members had already expressed support. \"I can only speak for myself on this issue. If it's appropriate to take another look at these names, I'm personally okay with that and I'm a descendant of a Confederate veteran myself,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters last month. And some Republican senators have since reiterated their support for the Warren amendment, such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, or urged passage despite it, including North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer. They are buoyed in part by Trump's own military leaders, who are seeking their own related reforms. \"There is no place in our Armed Forces for manifestations or symbols of racism bias or discrimination,\" Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee this month. This, as House Republican co-sponsors have signed onto Brown's amendment to rename the bases \u2014 which would give the Defense Department one year to make the changes versus three years under the Senate version. One of those co-sponsors, Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, voted for the amendment a day after Trump's veto threat. Ahead of the vote, the Air Force veteran noted the bases were named for Confederates to appease governments of the South during the Jim Crow era. \"I think it's disrespectful to have names of bases of folks who violated their oath, led a civil war that led to 600,000 people being killed, and for the cause of slavery,\" Bacon said. \"I think we could do better.\" There's plenty at stake: the defense bill includes new funding for military hardware and priorities for a national defense strategy, an annual pay raise for servicemembers and boosts in troop levels. And there's an additional wave of provisions to address racial injustice concerns. California Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, is pushing a measure to make violent extremism a military crime and another to create a special inspector general focused on discrimination. Brown is also leading a provision to establish a \"Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council,\" which would include a Chief Diversity Officer. Other efforts would require a Pentagon study of minority representation at military academies and boost diversity for selection boards that decide promotions. Maloney says Republicans will face a big test for this year's legislation and whether they'll follow Trump's lead. The defense bill has often been approved by super majorities in both chambers, and that margin could especially be key this year. Two-thirds of the House and Senate would be needed to override a potential veto. \"If we don't have a defense bill this year, it will be because the president feels so strongly about honoring the leaders of a rebellion against the United States on behalf of racism and slavery,\" Maloney said. \"That's up to him. Whether my Republican colleagues want to follow him down that dark alley is up to them.\"",

Police brutality has sparked days of civil unrest. But the sparks have landed in a tinderbox built over decades of economic inequality, now exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET Wednesday The death of a black man at the hands of a white police officer has sparked days of civil unrest in the United States. Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man \u2014 George Floyd \u2014 on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Loading... Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites \u2014 depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. \"It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% \u2014 near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. \"There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,\" Perry said. \"COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics.\" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One \u2014 Derek Chauvin \u2014 has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. \"That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,\" Perry said. \"It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities.\" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. \"If we don't address the structural inequality,\" Perry said, \"we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits.\"",

It would be the last hike of the season, Jessica Newton posted on her social media platforms. With mild weather forecast and Colorado's breathtaking fall foliage as a backdrop, she was excited \u2014 convinced an excursion at Beaver Ranch Park would be the quintessential way to close out months of warm-weather hikes with her \"sister friends.\" Still, when that Sunday morning arrived in 2018, Newton was shocked when her usual crew of about 15 had mushroomed to include about 70 Black women. There's a first time for everything, she thought, as they broke into smaller groups and headed toward the nature trail. What a sight they were, she recalls, as the women \u2014 in sneakers and hiking boots, a virtual sea of colorful head wraps, flowy braids and dreadlocks, poufy twists and long, flowy locks \u2014 trekked peacefully across the craggy terrain in the crisp mountain air. It. Was. Perfect. Exactly what Newton had envisioned when in 2017 she founded Black Girls Hike to connect with other Black women who share her affinity for outdoor activities. She also wanted to recruit others who had yet to experience the serenity of spending time with friends in nature, which she fell for as a child attending an affluent, predominately white private school.

But their peaceful exploration of nature and casual chatter \u2014 about everything from food and family to hair care and child care \u2014 was abruptly interrupted, she says, by the ugly face of racism. \"We had the sheriff called on us, park rangers called on us,\" recalls Newton, now 37, who owns a construction industry project development firm in Denver. \"This lady who was horseback riding was upset that we were hiking on her trail. She said that we'd spooked her horse,\" she says of a woman in a group of white horseback riders they encountered. \"It just didn't make any sense. I felt like, it's a horse and you have an entire mountain that you can trot through, run through, gallop through or whatever. She was just upset that we were in her space.\" Eventually, two Jefferson County sheriff's deputies, with guns on their hips, approached, asking, \"What's going on here?\" They had been contacted by rangers who'd received complaints about a large group of Black women being followed by camera drones in the park; the drones belonged to a national television news crew shooting a feature on the group. (The segment aired weeks later, but footage of the confrontation wasn't included.) \" 'Move that mob!' \" attendee Portia Prescott recalls one of the horseback riders barking. \"Why is it that a group of Black women hiking on a trail on a Sunday afternoon in Colorado is considered a 'mob?' \" Prescott asks.

Studies show \"if you are outdoors for at least five minutes, it literally brings your stress level down significantly,\" says Newton. A man soon arrived who identified himself as the husband of one of the white women on horseback and the manager of the park, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office incident report, and began arguing with the television producers in what one deputy described in the report as a \"hostile\" manner. The leader of the horseback tour told the deputies that noise from the large group and the drones startled the horses and that when she complained to the news crew, they told her to deal with it herself, the written report said. The news crew told deputies that the group members felt insulted by the horseback riders use of the term \"mob.\" The woman leading the horseback riders, identified in the incident report as Marie Elliott, said that she did not remember calling the group a mob, but she told the officers she \"would have said the same thing if the group had been a large group of Girl Scouts.\" In the end, Newton and her fellow hikers were warned for failing to secure a permit for their group. Newton says she regrets putting members in a distressing \u2014 and potentially life-threatening \u2014 situation by unknowingly breaking a park rule. However, she suspects that a similarly sized hiking group of white women would not have been confronted so aggressively. \"You should be excited that we are bringing more people to use your parks,\" added Newton. \"Instead, we got slammed with [threats of] violations and 'Who are you?' and 'Please, get your people and get out of here.' It's just crazy.\" Mike Taplin, spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, confirms that no citations were issued. The deputies \"positively engaged with everyone, with the goal of preserving the peace,\" he says. Newton says the \"frustrating\" incident has reminded her why her group, which she revamped and renamed Vibe Tribe Adventures last year, is so needed in the white-dominated outdoor enthusiasts' arena. Jan Garduno says becoming a member of Vibe Tribe has offered the camaraderie and safety that comes with hiking in a group. Another benefit, she says, is that she's lost about 40 pounds and has been able to keep the weight off.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jan Garduno says becoming a member of Vibe Tribe has offered the camaraderie and safety that comes with hiking in a group. Another benefit, she says, is that she's lost about 40 pounds and has been able to keep the weight off. With the tagline \"Find your tribe,\" the group aims to create a sisterhood for Black women \"on the trails, on waterways and in our local communities across the globe.\" This summer, she secured nonprofit status and expanded Vibe Tribe's focus, adding snowshoeing, fly-fishing, zip-lining and kayaking to its roster. Today, the Denver-based group has 11 chapters across the U.S. (even Guam) and Canada, with about 2,100 members. Research suggests her work is needed. The most recent National Park Service survey found that 6% of visitors are Black, compared with 77% white. Newton says that must change \u2014 especially given the opportunities parks provide and the health challenges that disproportionately plague Black women. Research shows they experience higher rates of chronic preventable health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A 2020 study of more than 17,000 women found that racial discrimination also may increase stress, lead to health problems and reduce cognitive functioning in Black women. Newton says those findings underscore the need for stress-relieving activities, and the power of nature to deliver. \"It's been studied at several colleges that if you are outdoors for at least five minutes, it literally brings your stress level down significantly,\" says Newton. \"Being around nature, it's like grounding yourself. That is vital.\" Bear Creek Regional Park recreation coordinator Theresa Odello points out different types of plants to members of Vibe Tribe Adventures.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bear Creek Regional Park recreation coordinator Theresa Odello points out different types of plants to members of Vibe Tribe Adventures. Newton says participation in her group generally tapers off in winter. She is hopeful, though, that cabin fever from the pandemic will inspire more Black women to try winter activities. Atlanta member Stormy Bradley, 49, says the group has added value to her life. \"I am a happier and healthier person because I get to do what I love,\" said the sixth-grade teacher. \"The most surprising thing is the sisterhood we experience on and off the trails.\" Patricia Cameron, a Black woman living in Colorado Springs, drew headlines this summer when she hiked 486 miles \u2014 from Denver to Durango \u2014 and blogged about her experience to draw attention to diversity in the outdoors. She founded the Colorado nonprofit Blackpackers in 2019. \"One thing I caught people saying a lot of is 'Well, nature is free' and 'Nature isn't racist' \u2014 and there's two things wrong with that,\" says Cameron, a 37-year-old mother of a preteen. \"Nature and outside can be free, yes, but what about transportation? How do you get to certain outdoor environments? Do you have the gear to enjoy the outdoors, especially in Colorado, where we're very gear conscious and very label conscious?\" she asks. \"Nature isn't going to call me the N-word, but the people outside might.\" Cameron applauds Newton's efforts and those of other groups nationwide, like Nature Gurlz, Outdoor Afro, Diversify Outdoors, Black Outdoors, Soul Trak Outdoors, Melanin Base Camp and Black Girls Run, that have a similar mission. Cameron says it also was encouraging that the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group, pledged in the wake of the racial unrest sparked by George Floyd's death to help address a \"long history of systemic racism and injustice\" in the outdoors.

Efforts to draw more Black people, especially women, outdoors, Cameron says, must include addressing barriers, like cost. For example, Blackpackers provides a \"gear locker\" to help members use pricey outdoor gear free or at discounted rates. She has also partnered with businesses and organizations that subsidize and sponsor outdoor excursions. During the pandemic, Vibe Tribe has waived all membership fees through January. Cameron says she dreams of a day when Black people are free from the pressures of carrying the nation's racial baggage when participating in outdoor activities. Vibe Tribe member and longtime outdoor enthusiast Jan Garduno, 52, of Aurora, Colo., agreed that fear and safety are pressing concerns. For example, leading up to the presidential election she changed out of her \"Let My People Vote\" T-shirt before heading out on a solo walk for fear of how other hikers might react. Groups like Vibe Tribe, she says, provide camaraderie and an increased sense of safety. And another plus? The health benefits can also be transformative. \"I've been able to lose about 40 pounds and I've kept it off,\" says Garduno.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a case that pits the City of Philadelphia against Catholic Social Services. Elections come and go, but Supreme Court decisions can last forever. One of those potentially pivotal cases is before the court Wednesday. A case both poignant and profound, it pits the rights of a city to enforce its anti-discrimination policies in contracting against the rights of religious groups. On one side is the City of Philadelphia, which contracts with private foster care agencies, and as part of the contract requires that those agencies abide by the city's ban on discriminating against LGBTQ couples. On the other side is Catholic Social Services, which contends that complying with the city's requirement would violate its constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Philadelphia has protective custody of about 5,000 children who have been abused or neglected. The city contracts with private agencies to care for these children in group homes and to certify, supervise, and place children in individual foster care homes. Among the 30 private agencies that do this work is CSS, affiliated with the Catholic archdiocese, which has contracted with the city for these services for more than 50 years. But in 2018, the Philadelphia Inquirer disclosed that CSS did not certify and place children in the homes of same-sex couples. The city then stopped paying CSS for placing more children in private homes, though it continues to pay for fostering children already placed in the care of CSS families, and for operating group homes and providing other services where there is no discrimination problem. Can a foster parent be excluded from consideration? CSS and two Catholic foster parents sued, contending that the city was violating the Constitution's protection for the free exercise of religion. Two lower courts ruled in favor of the city, and CSS appealed to the Supreme Court, which hears arguments in the case Wednesday. The two parents who joined the CSS suit are single mothers, both African American, both Catholic. One, Sharonell Fulton, has fostered 40 children over 25 years. \"The biggest thrill that I get is when they all sleep and I can walk through and look in their little faces and check their dirty hands,\" she said. \"And I say ... I got this, this is what I want to do. And I wouldn't be able to do it without Catholic Social Services.\" The other, Toni Simms-Busch, has fostered five children, and through fostering has adopted brothers who are now 2 and 4. For Simms-Busch, who had worked with CSS as a child advocate, fostering through CSS was a \"no-brainer.\" She says that there simply are \"no other agencies that hold the same values and beliefs and religious foundation as Catholic Social Services.\" CSS is there when she needs them, she says, morning or night. There are, of course, other wonderful foster parents who are not in the CSS family. Among them are same-sex married couples like Lou Growmiller and his husband, Michael, who have been together for 15 years and fostered children over a 10-year period. Through their fostering experience, they have reunited one child with her parents the day before Christmas, and have adopted two \u2014 a girl, now 9, who they brought home from the neonatal intensive care unit as an infant, and a boy, now almost 7. Because Lou Growmiller, a social worker, oversees one of the largest adoption and foster care agencies in the city, he and Michael decided to work through an agency just outside Philadelphia. They see themselves as leading members of their community. Lou is now on the PTA board of his children's school and he views the CSS refusal to work with gay couples as making no sense when the need for foster parents is so great. Why, he asks, \"would that be a reason to deny people to be a temporary safe haven to children, vulnerable children and kids who need it?\" Of course, CSS sees the city's refusal to let it place more children in individual foster homes as equally nonsensical. Is the city discriminating against Catholics? There are basically two legal questions before the Supreme Court. First, whether Philadelphia's decision not to renew one of its contracts with CSS violates the First Amendment guarantee to the free exercise of religion. \"The City of Philadelphia is telling [foster parents] it will not place any more children in their homes because they're Catholic and they chose to partner with Catholic Social Services,\" says lawyer Lori Windham, of the Becket Fund, who will represent CSS in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Windham adds that \"at bottom this is about the City of Philadelphia trying to exclude Catholic Social Services from work it's been doing for two centuries.\" \"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" counters lawyer Neal Katyal, who will represent the City of Philadelphia in the Supreme Court. \"We adore CSS. We've been partners with them for years and years, and indeed right now we're giving them over $17 million a year in contacts\" for group homes and other services, he says. That said, however, the city has refused to renew the $2.9 million contract for future home foster care placements by CSS. As the city sees it, CSS has violated the terms of its contract by its policy of refusing to consider same-sex married couples for placement. \"You can't on Monday sign a contract that says we won't discriminate and on Tuesday go ahead and discriminate,\" says Katyal. And he notes that the Supreme Court has long said governments are at the apex of their power in contracting for goods and services. CSS explains that it would be happy to refer same-sex couples to other agencies, and that there are 29 others operating in Philadelphia. In addition, CSS maintains that no gay couple has even approached CSS for foster care home placement, prompting Katyal to respond that \"the National Baptist Association points out that if one of the agencies had a sign saying, 'No Baptists allowed,' it would be cold comfort to those folks who say, 'Oh, you could just go somewhere else.'\" Seeking the reversal of a 1990 Scalia decision In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that when the government has a \"generally applicable\" law or regulation and enforces that law neutrally, the government's action is presumptively legitimate even if it has some \"incidental\" adverse impact on some citizens. The court said that an individual's religious beliefs do not excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that government is free to regulate. Allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion, the court said, \"would open the prospect of constitutionally required exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind,\" from compulsory military service to vaccination requirements, and child-neglect laws. The author of that opinion was the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon and a devout Catholic. Which leads to the second major legal question before the court \u2014 whether the justices should, as CSS is urging, overturn Scalia's decision. CSS maintains that the decision should be reversed because the non-discrimination provision in the Philadelphia contract is unconstitutionally forcing the agency and its clients to endorse same-sex marriage, in violation of their faith. As Toni Simms-Busch puts it, \"It is taking away my right as a religious person, as a person of faith\" to \"foster or adopt through an agency who has a shared belief.\" Not true, says Katyal, the lawyer for the city. Philadelphia continues to pay for foster children already placed by CSS in homes like Simms-Busch's. \"The one thing that we aren't going to do,\" explains Katyal, \"is to allow them to screen new parents based on their discriminatory policies.\" Has Philadelphia targeted CSS for exclusion? CSS contends that the city has, in essence, targeted CSS because of its religious beliefs, and points to a comment made by the mayor. But Katyal counters that the mayor had nothing to do with the city's foster care contracts, and that stray political comments here were irrelevant, especially when compared to President Trump's comments about Muslims, which the Supreme Court ignored in upholding the travel ban. There simply is no hostility to CSS, Katyal contends, and the proof of that is that the city has not ended its other contracts with CSS. Nor, he argues, is the certification process undertaken by CSS a religious endorsement of prospective foster parents. \"All they have to do is a checklist and say, is this family is suitable ... to be foster care parents? They don't have to approve them in the eyes of God,\" Katyal argues. He maintains that CSS has \"manufactured some sort of tension between their obligations under state law and the contract\" to certify and supervise foster parents. \"There's simply no conflict, and that's the easiest way for the court to resolve this case,\" Katyal says. That's not how Mark Rienzi of the Becket Fund sees things. The state law and the city contracts are not neutral, he maintains. Yes, he says, if you have 10 stores you can go into, and you choose one, that choice would not normally raise the question of the free exercise of religion. \"But if you're being excluded from one specifically because of the religious exercise that's going on there, which is the case here, then I do think that is a free exercise problem\" he says. Several of the Supreme Court's most conservative justices have in fact urged revisiting Justice Scalia's 1990 decision. And the Court's newest Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, served on the board of her children's private religious school, which, according to the Associated Press, did not admit the children of same-sex couples. Revisiting LGBT versus religious rights In the last analysis, Wednesday's case picks up on the question the Supreme Court ducked two years ago in the case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The court in that case punted, ruling that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission exhibited hostility to religion in considering the baker's case. But the court did not say whether the state's non-discrimination provision would violate the baker's rights without that hostility. That is the question that hangs over the Philadelphia case. And if the court decides to overrule Justice Scalia's 1990 precedent, it would almost certainly accelerate the conservative court's trend toward greater and greater deference to religious rights, likely at the expense of other rights and values, including laws that bar discrimination.",

Trump and Modi have spoken of their friendship, but most Indian Americans say U.S.-India ties are low on their political priorities. Indian Americans \u2014 a small but possibly pivotal voting bloc \u2014 are overwhelmingly voting for Joe Biden this election, according to a new survey. Both Joe Biden and President Trump's campaigns have been courting Indian American voters this year. Indian Americans are about 1% of the U.S. population and make up .82% of all eligible voters in the U.S. \u2014 but are large enough in numbers to make a decisive difference in certain swing states. Indian Americans historically lean Democratic. In 2016, 77% voted for Hillary Clinton and 16% for Trump. President Trump's embrace of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi fueled speculation that it could drive many Indian American voters to the Republican Party. But researchers from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the University of Pennsylvania say there's \"little indication of a shift toward the Republican Party\" among Indian Americans, who view U.S.-India ties as a low-priority issue. \"The survey is pretty unambiguous,\" says Milan Vaishnav, one of the study's authors who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. Of the 936 Indian American citizens surveyed in September, 72% planned to vote for Biden and 22% for Trump. \"And that is actually in keeping with past trends of the pro-Democratic orientation of Indian Americans in this country in terms of their voter turnout,\" Vaishnav tells NPR's Noel King on Morning Edition. Vaishnav talked about the issues important to Indian American voters and how campaigns are reaching out. Here are excerpts from the interview: What are the issues that draw Indian Americans to the Democratic Party? The top three issues across the board were the state of the economy, health care and racism and racial discrimination. And in some ways, this isn't all that surprising, given that these are precisely the issues that all Americans are really worried about in the face of an economic crisis, a pandemic, and the kind of national conversation we're having around race and social justice. What surprised us was the extent to which foreign policy really didn't rate very much. We asked Indian Americans, you know, \"Will U.S.-India relations be an important determining factor for you?\" And there's been a lot of talk about this because of the close partnership between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And just 3% of Indian Americans said that this was going to be their No. 1 election issue this fall. A person might look broadly and say, OK, 1% of the electorate spread throughout the country. The Indian American vote doesn't really matter. It's not a swing vote, for example. Any truth to that? There is certainly truth in the absolute numbers. In fact, Indian Americans are less than 1% of the eligible electorate. However, there are two caveats to that. The first is that their numbers are growing rapidly. Indians in America have grown by more than 150% since the year 2000. Secondly, they are now sizable enough in certain swing states, places like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan, that their numbers are actually larger than the margin of victory in the 2016 presidential election. So while in aggregate they are not huge, they can be pivotal in certain swing states. How have Republicans and Democrats reached out to Indian Americans? We're seeing it in an unprecedented way this election. I mean, both the Trump and the Biden campaigns have cut television and online ads just for this demographic. What the Republicans have tried to do is really emphasize again the partnership between Donald Trump and Narendra Modi to say, \"We have formed a unique personal bond. And for this reason, if you want to see U.S.-India relations succeed in the future as Indian Americans, you should really come to our side.\" What Joe Biden, the Democrats have really done is to say, \"Indian Americans have really been the poster children for America's legacy of relatively open immigration. And if you want an America that is more inclusive, that is more tolerant, that is more welcoming to you and your family members and those who may wish to come from India after you, then there's really only one choice in this election: that is the Democratic Party.\" And so we are seeing both sides really court this vote, I think, in new and interesting ways, which is a recognition that their, sort of, time in the political spotlight has really arrived.

Like many well-worn bromides, there's a grain of truth to it: He left the Oval Office with dismal approval ratings, but in the 40 years since, he's developed a reputation as one of the country's most beloved humanitarians. But the truth, argues Jonathan Alter in his new biography of the former president, His Very Best, is more complicated. Carter was \"a surprisingly consequential president \u2014 a political and stylistic failure but a substantive and far-sighted success\" whose personality is deeper than his reputation as a modest, timid and somewhat prude Southern gentleman might suggest. Alter makes his case convincingly his fifth book \u2014 and his best one to date. Alter writes that he chose to tell Carter's life story because it \"might help light our way back to some sense of decency, accountability, and seriousness in our politics.\" And while it's evident that he admires Carter \u2014 the title of the book is a bit of a giveaway \u2014 His Very Best isn't at all a hagiography; it's a fair-minded assessment of the life and career of the politician from Plains. Alter paints a vivid picture of Carter's childhood in rural Georgia, where he grew up the son of a freethinking mother and a father who \"was comfortable upholding a system of rigid segregation and quiet repression.\" He follows Carter to Annapolis, where he was an accomplished midshipman who became a competent, if ambivalent, sailor \u2014 while serving aboard the USS Mississippi, he hung a banner that read \"Who Cares?\" above his bunk. Carter found his passion in politics, serving two years in the Georgia state senate before being elected governor in 1970. Alter is sharply critical of Carter's campaign for the statehouse, writing, \"While he didn't say anything explicitly racist, he figured out how to appeal to racist voters, a decision he claimed not to regret.\" Once elected, however, Carter stunned Georgians with his inaugural address, in which he stated: \"I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over\" \u2014 sadly, this was a remarkable comment for a Southern governor to make at the time. Carter's election as president was marked by a series of unforced errors that nearly cost him the race, including his now-famous Playboy interview in which he admitted, inexplicably, \"I have looked on a lot of women with lust; I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\" He also said he wouldn't force neighborhoods to be racially integrated, noting \u2014 again, inexplicably \u2014 \"I see nothing wrong with ethnic purity being maintained.\" Alter dedicates the bulk of his book to Carter's presidency, which he argues was successful in the long term, pointing to his work for environmental causes and his support for the Centers for Disease Control, among other accomplishments. But, as Alter notes, \"If there is a gene for duty, responsibility, and the will to tackle messy problems with little or no potential for political gain, Jimmy Carter was born with it\" \u2014 and the last two years of his term were disastrous, with the Iran hostage crisis that started in 1979 sealing his fate as a one-term president. While Alter makes the case \u2014 a familiar and uncontroversial one \u2014 that Carter's post-presidency proved him to be \"a world-class humanitarian\" who \"set a new standard for former presidents,\" he doesn't spend much time describing Carter's years after he left the White House. That's not surprising; His Very Best is, after all, a presidential biography. And if the past four decades of Carter's life don't get as much ink as some readers might hope, Alter does do a good job summarizing the former president's extensive humanitarian work with the Carter Center. Alter's book closes with Carter in 2020, reacting to the killing of George Floyd with heartbreak and dismay, and attending church via Zoom. Alter chooses to let the contrast between Carter and the current president speak for itself; it's a subtly bittersweet ending to the biography. His Very Best is a fascinating book, and Alter tells Carter's life story beautifully and with admirable fairness \u2014 he treats Carter as a real person, as flawed as anyone else, and not as a saint. Alter's pacing is wonderful; his accounts of some of the more dramatic events in Carter's presidency are thrillingly told, but this never comes at the cost of the humanity of the people involved. It's a book that's bound to fascinate anyone with an interest in American history, and an excellent look at the man whom Alter considers, justifiably, \"perhaps the most misunderstood president in American history.\"",

When Arthur Roland Kam thinks back to 1959, he remembers how everyone around him felt a huge political shift as Hawaii became the country's 50th state. \"For a Hawaiian citizen, it was great because it had been a long time coming,\" Kam describes. He was 28 years old, working for Pan Am on the island of Oahu. \"It was a big moment in my lifetime, to know that we are part of the union now,\" he says of the pride he felt. \"To me, it was a moment to cherish. Now, we have a star on the flag. And that star is Hawaii.\" But as the years have passed, many Hawaiians began to mark August 21, the anniversary of statehood, with solemnity, reflecting on the history of the United States' seizure and colonization of the Independent Kingdom of Hawai'i. \"There were benefits and protections that came with statehood, but there's still a painful aspect to the whole history of Hawaii and its overthrow, annexation and statehood,\" says Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. \"There are a lot of people who do not consider [today] as a time of celebration because of the painful history,\" she adds. Hawaii's journey to statehood was a complicated one, marked by a series of political calculations and maneuverings in Congress that were amplified by undercurrents \u2014 and very often overt displays \u2014 of racism. That story resonates today in the political disputes over the prospect for statehood for the District of Columbia, which has faded from headlines but not disappeared entirely after a push by House Democrats earlier this year. They called it an issue of justice and fairness; Republicans called it an attempted power grab. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., for example, said this month that she worries that if Joe Biden is elected president and Democrats gain a governing majority, they'll try to make states of D.C. and Puerto Rico. McSally implied the territories' racial makeup would mean they'd likely be easy seats for Democrats to keep and hold. \"We'd never get the Senate back again,\" McSally said of the GOP. Hawaii's fraught path to statehood Race and its implications often are subplots in a state's accession. In 1893, the monarchy of Hawaii, under Queen Lili'uokalani, was overthrown by white settlers. Five years later, the U.S. annexed Hawaii despite local opposition and protests. Petitions for statehood began in the first twenty years of Hawaii's territorial status, a process that intensified during the 1930s when sugar interests were threatened by Congressional legislation and the powerful sugar lobby got behind the statehood cause. \"The pressure from within Hawaii for annexation was from an economic elite of Europeans and European Americans seeking economic, political and military protection,\" says Roger Bell, author of \"Last Among Equals,\" which documents the history of Hawaii's path to statehood. \"The criteria for statehood the Congress imposes include that the population of the territory seeking statehood must demonstrate that they are sympathetic to and imbued with the principles of what Congress called 'American democracy,'\" Bell explains. \"In other words, that they were Americanized politically and culturally.\" During World War II, Hawaii's majority nonwhite population was regarded with suspicion, asked to demonstrate its loyalty to the United States over Japan. But fears over disloyalty faded after the war, in part because of the heroic efforts of the Japanese-American-led 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Former Speaker of the House Rep. John Boehner presents the Congressional Gold Medal to Susumu Ito of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an Army unit comprised of Japanese Americans from Hawaii which became the most decorated unit for its size and service.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Speaker of the House Rep. John Boehner presents the Congressional Gold Medal to Susumu Ito of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an Army unit comprised of Japanese Americans from Hawaii which became the most decorated unit for its size and service. Statehood efforts accelerated again following the war, but not without new political and racial roadblocks. In the mid-1950s, Hawaii shifted from being Republican to largely Democratic, which prompted Democrats to increase their push for statehood efforts for both Hawaii and Alaska, another Democratic territory, hoping to boost influence in the Senate by four votes. Senators from the south flatly rejected statehood. \"The profile of Hawaii racially and culturally was a threat to the rigid patterns of race relations in the American South and to the southern way of life, which was a euphemism, of course, for protecting segregation,\" Bell describes. Some senators were transparent about their motivations in keeping the prospective state out of the union. Admission of Hawaii would mean \"two votes for socialized medicines, two votes for government ownership of industry, two votes against all racial segregation and two votes against the South on all social matters,\" said Sen. James Eastland, D-Miss.

George Smathers, D-Fla. Efforts stalled, which frustrated then-President Harry Truman, who observed privately that many southerners \"still have that antebellum pro-slavery outlook.\" \"The main difficulty with the South is that they are living eighty years behind the times and the sooner they come out of it, the better it will be for the country and themselves,\" he wrote in a 1948 letter. Seven months before it would officially become a state, the Republican County Committee in Hawaii sent petitions to Congress for statehood. \"Our people have willingly and patriotically accepted and complied with any and all national requests, mandates or patriotic obligations required from all American citizens; be it in peace, or in war,\" it reminded Congress.

At right is Daniel K. Inouye, Democratic congressman-elect from Hawaii. In 1959, President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation making Hawaii America's 50th state. It wasn't until 1993 that the \"Apology Resolution\" passed in Congress, which \"apologizes to Natives Hawaiians ... for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ... and the deprivation of the rights of native Hawaiians to self-determination.\" Not just Hawaii Before the Civil War, two states were generally admitted to the union at the same time in order to prevent one party, and thereby the divided north and south, from gaining a political advantage. \"You had, up through the 1850s, this idea of balancing: that one state would come in as a free state and one state would come in as a slave state,\" says Paul Frymer, professor of politics at Princeton University and author of \"Building an American Empire.\" Following the Civil War, the dominant Republican Party looked westward to seize land and break it into states they believed would be Republican. In what Frymer describes as one of the \"biggest hang-ups at the end of the 19th century,\" the last two states on the continent \u2013 New Mexico and Arizona \u2013 vied for statehood. \"Arizona was always settled by more whites than New Mexico was,\" Frymer explains. \"They both pushed for statehood, but there was more support for Arizona. And here you see both partisan politics, with two parties fighting over what would constitute a state, and then racial politics.\" Much of the statehood debate over New Mexico, which had joined the U.S. as a territory in 1850, hinged on race. \"The conversation in Congress was, 'Was the state white? Was there a majority white population? Was there a large enough white population that spoke English?' All of these types of terminology were applied to what was largely an indigenous and formerly Mexican population,\" Frymer says. Republican Sen. Lot Morril of Maine went so far as to call New Mexico's residents \"Indians \u2014 the men that we hunt when we have nothing else to do in the summer season.\" Statehood for New Mexico failed to pass until 1912, when Congress felt satisfied the population was \"American\" enough. Will there ever be more stars on the flag? Puerto Rico's governor's race in November may bring with it a renewed effort to embrace statehood efforts. Former congressional representative Pedro Pierluisi defeated Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez in the primary election and is a supporter of statehood. This summer, the House of Representatives cast a historic vote to grant statehood to D.C, whose residents overwhelmingly support admission as a state. But strong Republican opposition in Congress and the White House dooms any movement on that legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told TV host Laura Ingraham last year that any Democratic push for D.C. statehood is \"full-bore socialism on the march in the House,\" a comment that critics felt hearkened back to justifications for keeping Hawaii out of the union. President Trump has been even more explicit about his reasons for opposing D.C. statehood, telling The New York Post: \"Why? So we can have two more Democratic \u2014 Democrat senators and five more congressmen? No, thank you. That'll never happen.\" A day before the House passed the legislation, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, issued a speech on the Senate floor categorizing statehood efforts as a power grab by Democrats and seemingly dismissing the value of District residents. \"Yes, Wyoming is smaller than Washington by population, but it has three times as many workers in mining, logging and construction, and 10 times as many workers in manufacturing,\" Cotton said. \"In other words, Wyoming is a well-rounded working-class state.\" His comments prompted outrage on social media, with many pointing out the civil rights implications of the district's lack of representation. The city has been majority-minority since the 1950s and of its over 705,000 residents, 46% are Black. But Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., says he views the push for statehood as purely political. \"If your interest is solely to be able to vote for representatives in Congress, you could have retrocession occur,\" he says, referencing small efforts in recent years to cede the city's land back to Maryland, a plan that would not change the number of senators. \"I think the most telling political thing is that when the retrocession bill to Maryland was introduced 10 years ago in Congress, no Democrats co-sponsored it, which belies the fact that the goal is a political goal, because if the goal was just representation then retrocession to Maryland would work,\" Harris says. Harris says even if Democrats win back the Senate and the White House this November, D.C. statehood is far from guaranteed. \"The constitutionality would immediately be argued,\" he says. \"I think the Supreme Court will ultimately agree that this is an issue of changing the Constitution because the federal capital city is described in the Constitution and the authorities over that capital city.\" It's the kind of opposition Sen. Hirono expects. \"I think there will be a lot of Republican resistance to having any state that will create more seats that would go Democratic,\" she says. \"Especially now in this much divided political environment.\" Frymer, of Princeton, says if the tables were turned, and D.C. was a Republican stronghold, it's unlikely the Democratic party would be rushing to grant statehood. \"No party wants one state to come in that's going to boost the other party. That's why historically, both parties have looked for some type of balance,\" he says. \"To me, this is one of those issues that historically will be resolved. The pressure is going to continue to build and build over time. The question is, when will the moment occur that the United States finally embraces it?\"",

Trump by Norman Eisen\n                \n                    \n                    Crown\n                    \n                \nhide caption When Democrats took back the House of Representatives in 2018, the Judiciary Committee hired Norm Eisen to be special counsel. He'd been a White House ethics czar and a U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic during the Obama administration. And when he showed up to work for Congress, he started preparing for the possibility that the House might impeach President Trump. Less than a year later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry. Eisen's new book, A Case for the American People: The United States v. Donald J. Trump, describes this moment in time through the House vote to impeach Trump and the Senate trial, which ended in acquittal. And the book reveals that Eisen had drafted 10 articles of impeachment a month before Pelosi's announcement. \"The speaker is a pretty savvy monitor of everything that goes on in Congress. So, I don't think it will come as a surprise to her,\" Eisen told NPR. On why he cast such a wide net President Trump's misconduct is so broad, and his whole pattern of misconduct, the collusion in the [Robert] Mueller report, the obstruction of justice that the special counsel found, the hush money payments, which are illegal campaign finance, and so much more. We've never seen anything like it in American history. So, we needed to start with a very broad base to work our way through to the articles that we thought could make it through the House. And that's just what we did. On whether impeachment might have gone differently if a broader list of offenses had been presented Having lived on the Hill for a year, I do think impeachment would have gone differently. I don't think there would have been an impeachment if we had insisted on all 10 of those articles, however meritorious I may feel they are. Politics is the art of the possible. And Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, who I worked for; Chairman [Adam] Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, who is a leader on all these matters; and Speaker Pelosi ultimately were able to come together around a set of articles that unified the caucus and that we were able to get through. On the idea of a possible quid pro quo happening not just beyond U.S. borders but also within the U.S. Even before we knew about the pandemic, I think everyone in the room got a chill [during Stanford Law School professor Pamela Karlan's testimony] because she had so expertly put her finger on the quid pro quo transactional nature of President Trump's way of doing business. And his handling of COVID \u2014 it has all the same features of the Ukraine scandal or the Russia scandal before that. The retaliation against whistleblowers. And above all, this radical selfishness \u2014 it's all about Trump. We've never had a president like that. On whether there is anything he wishes the Democrats had done differently to achieve a more bipartisan outcome The vote in the House actually was bipartisan because Justin Amash, not a Democrat, supported the impeachment. [He's a] lifelong conservative and Republican who had to leave his party because he spoke out against Trump. And then in the Senate, for the first time in American history, you had a president who had a member of his party cross the aisle, Mitt Romney, to vote against a president of his own party in an impeachment trial. Now, it's true, we saw more polarization around this impeachment than we did in, say, the [Richard] Nixon one or even the [Bill] Clinton one. I never imagined that only Romney among them would be willing to do the right thing. And you know what makes it even more shocking? Lamar Alexander said the House proved its quid pro quo. And Sen. Ben Sasse said, many of us agree with Lamar. And yet they still weren't willing to call it an impeachable offense. Shame. Shame. ... I do not believe that this constellation of Republicans could have been persuaded. No matter what. That being said, I'm very self-critical in the book. And I do talk about the mistakes that I made along the way. And I made plenty. So, yes, there are plenty of errors along the way. No, there was nothing we could have done, no matter how profound the offense. ... We saw scandal with the Russian bounties, total Republican silence \u2014 near total Republican silence. The president's intentional misconduct on COVID has led to the deaths \u2014 you can't blame every death but certainly his baubles have led to the deaths \u2014 of tens of thousands of Americans. They've done nothing. On whether the president has felt more empowered to take some steps because he got through impeachment Since the beginning of his career, he knows exactly how to surf the bubble of the law, how to go to the edge of the law. He started with an alleged racial discrimination case in his properties at the very beginning of his career. And he understands what he's doing. It is a pattern \u2014 that is one of the fundamental points I make in the book. And I describe what's going to happen next. And it's not pretty because we're seeing him now turn, once again, his predations to the coming election. So, no, it was the right thing to sound the alarm. It did not embolden him.",

Civil rights icon and longtime Georgia Congressman John Lewis has died after a battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. The son of Alabama sharecroppers, Lewis was a central figure in the key civil rights battles of the 1960s, including the Freedom Rides and the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. Lewis considered his native Alabama hallowed ground because of the blood shed there in pursuit of a transformation of America. For decades, the Democrat led bipartisan congressional delegations on annual pilgrimages to major civil rights sites in the state. On a 1996 trip, Lewis introduced his colleagues to the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a now-deceased leader of the Birmingham movement. Together, the two sang the old freedom song \"I ain't afraid of your jails.\" \"And they weren't either,\" Shuttlesworth said. \"Dr. King was speaking to me\" Lewis was arrested more than 40 times protesting segregation. He was involved in lunch counter sit-ins; freedom rides on interstate buses; and he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington. \"We're tired of being beaten by policeman. We're tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again,\" the 23-year-old Lewis said in a speech at the Lincoln Memorial. \"We want our freedom and we want it now!\" In a 1998 interview with NPR, Lewis described being attracted to the movement as a teenager when he first heard about the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. \"I knew then that Dr. King was speaking to me and for me and for so many other people who wanted to find a way to get involved in an effort to end racial segregation and discrimination across the South,\" he said. \"Means and ends are inseparable\" Lewis grew up on a farm in rural southeast Alabama, where his job was to tend to the chicken coops. He'd faced discrimination as a matter of course, often telling the story of how the public library in Troy, Ala., denied him a library card because of his race. His activism started in Nashville, when Lewis was in college at Fisk University, where he received a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy. He became a leader in SNCC \u2014 the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee \u2014 and was part of a group of young activists studying the philosophy of nonviolence. \"Some of us came to the conclusion that means and ends are inseparable,\" he said. \"If we are going to create the Beloved Community, an open society, if that is our goal, then the means and methods by which we struggle must be consistent with the goal, with the end we seek.\" Lewis said it became both a tactic, and a way of living. \"You never become bitter,\" Lewis said. \"You never become hostile. You never try to demean your opposition.\" He stuck by that creed even in the most brutal of circumstances. Most notably, as a co-leader of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. Sheriffs' deputies and state troopers attacked the peaceful protesters as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge over the Alabama River on March 7, 1965. Standing on the bridge 50 years later, Lewis described facing a \"sea of blue\" in an interview with NPR. \"They came forward, beating us with nightsticks, tramping us with horses, releasing the tear gas,\" Lewis recounted. \"I was hit in the head by a state trooper with a night stick. My legs went from under me. I thought I was going to die.\" Known as Bloody Sunday, the incident received international news coverage, sparking outrage that ultimately led to passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

At commemorative events in 2015, his sister, Rosa Tyner described being a little girl and watching her brother on the television news. \"My parents would be back at home praying for him,\" Tyner said. \"Now to see the results of all that.

Later, he helped usher passage of President Obama's Affordable Health Care Act in the House, and Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2016, Lewis actively campaigned for Democrat Hillary Clinton, and after she lost, he refused to attend President Trump's inauguration, citing Russian interference in the election. \"I don't see the president-elect as a legitimate president,\" he said on NBC's Meet the Press. Lewis was critical of Trump's nomination of former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, saying at a congressional hearing, \"We need someone as attorney general who is going to look out for all of us, not just some of us.\" His fighting spirit never waned, even in the face of advanced pancreatic cancer. \"I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the Beloved Community,\" he said in a statement revealing his diagnosis in December 2019. \"We still have many bridges to cross.\" Three months later, even as the nation was confronting the coronavirus pandemic, Lewis made a surprise appearance at a reenactment of the bridge crossing in Selma in March 2020. \"I'm not going to give up,\" he said. \"I'm not going to give in.\" Surrounded by a crowd of marchers, Lewis urged younger generations to take up the mantle to \"help redeem the soul of America.\" \"Keep the faith,\" he said. \"Keep our eyes on the prize.

But Bolton's accusations are notable for the splash they aren't making.\n                \n                    \n                    Logan Cyrus/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former national security adviser John Bolton, here at a February event in North Carolina, is releasing a memoir with strong allegations of misconduct against President Trump. But Bolton's accusations are notable for the splash they aren't making. Updated at 1:45 a.m. ET Friday The picnic that is political life in Washington seldom encounters a skunk of the magnitude of John Bolton. He was a centerpiece of the establishment, and now President Trump and Republicans have rejected him as a turncoat. Democrats, never fond of his worldview, now despise him as never before. Bolton's unique ability to be hated by everyone for different reasons means that all those involved with reacting to his explosive new memoir aren't behaving as they might have if someone else were involved or circumstances were different. The former national security adviser has leveled a series of what otherwise might be earthshaking allegations against his former boss in his book The Room Where It Happened. Trump does favors for foreign potentates because he wants help with his reelection, Bolton says; he gave his blessing to some of the worst human rights abuses of the modern era, according to the book; Trump knows almost nothing about even the basics of dealing with foreign nations, Bolton alleges. And so on. The president denies it all and calls Bolton disgruntled after a policy break with him and the administration. \"He's a liar,\" Trump told The Wall Street Journal. He's \"a traitor,\" added Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement Thursday night. \"We'll make a judgment\" Some of Bolton's assertions, however, are ostensibly verifiable. Will Democrats spring into action with hearings in which they compel Bolton to say it all under oath? Will they demand to hear from the other administration figures he quotes in his book? Will they fight Trump in court to access the transcripts, notes, emails and other materials that might substantiate his claims? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks during her weekly news conference Thursday on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The response so far boils down to: Ehhh ... maybe. \"We'll make a judgment,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday. She reiterated her junior colleagues' promises to confer about what action to take about Bolton, but she did not open her press conference by discussing him or volunteer any position until asked by a reporter. \"We'll be discussing how the American people are best served by oversight,\" Pelosi said. For Republicans, Bolton has sunk from being a top luminary on foreign policy and national security to a spinner of falsehoods interested only in his book royalties. \"It disappoints me,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"Money drives a lot of people to say a lot of things.\" House Democrats' campaign arm pointed out how abruptly Bolton's book has prompted the GOP to change its tune on him despite the years he spent as a trusted counselor to presidents and a respected commentator. \"John Bolton's tell-all book is just another reminder that Washington Republicans will always put their allegiance to their president and their political party ahead of the working Americans they were elected to serve,\" said Robyn Patterson, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. A failed attempt to force testimony Pelosi and House Democrats impeached Trump over the Ukraine affair, to which Bolton now openly acknowledges being a close witness. Bolton resisted taking part then, and Democrats calculated that they shouldn't wait for a legal fight over whether to compel him to tell his story publicly. It would have taken too long, they feared. So Democrats withdrew a lawsuit that might have yielded Bolton's testimony and that of a deputy, and went ahead with impeachment based on the evidence and other witnesses then in hand. Pelosi said Thursday that she had \"no regrets\" about what transpired and that blaming Democrats for Bolton's absence before Congress was \"a con.\" Republicans closed ranks to protect Trump earlier this year. They used their majority in the Senate to keep from having to hear, on the record, Bolton's accounts about Trump's actions and deal-making. Senate Republicans said it wasn't their job to come up with evidence in the impeachment, only to assess what had been developed by the House. Bolton said he would have testified if subpoenaed by the Senate \u2014 knowing the slim odds Republicans would authorize that. Republicans acquitted Trump of the articles of impeachment and permitted him to keep his office \u2014 then the coronavirus disaster changed life in the United States drastically. The focus around the nation and in Washington shifted, too. A different world So much appears to have changed \u2014 about both everyday life and politics \u2014 that Bolton's allegations are notable for the splash they aren't making in Washington. Where was House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., one of the drivers behind the impeachment effort? On Wednesday, when the accounts began to appear about Bolton's allegations, Nadler was presiding over a markup on police reform legislation, part of the Democrats' response to the protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Their agenda has changed since the last controversy in Washington over Bolton. Many in the party, in short, may have moved on \u2014 or at the very least feel lukewarm about helping to promote the accounts, and potentially, the book sales, of Bolton. \"I'm not paying any money for a book that was a substitute for testifying before Congress about the well-being of the American people,\" Pelosi said Thursday when asked about whether she would read it. The speaker and her colleagues may perceive that the climate has changed too much to engage seriously with Bolton following the pandemic, the national movement about race and police, and the now-solidified position of the party behind former Vice President Joe Biden as the presumptive nominee. Democrats view public polling on issues such as health care and efforts to address racial discrimination as clearly favoring their party going into the 2020 election. They appear unlikely to want to go back to the impeachment debate \u2014 which would only remind voters of their failed effort to remove the president. The threat of a legal battle The experience of the Ukraine affair and impeachment also have clarified how and when the White House will fight to protect witnesses and documents, and when it won't. Given the alacrity with which the Justice Department is attempting to suppress Bolton's book, including with a lawsuit and a request for a temporary restraining order, it's clear to all players that if Democrats tried to subpoena the records Bolton describes about Trump's conversations with foreign leaders, that would lead to a months-long court battle. The Supreme Court held up an ongoing dispute over material from the Russia investigation in such a way that the records involved might not appear publicly until after Election Day, even if the justices permitted their release. A question of priorities So even though Bolton has made some of the most serious charges against a president ever leveled by a top former aide, to say nothing of an ex-national security adviser, there didn't appear to be much eagerness among Trump's usual enemies to go about exploiting that. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who noted at one point he praised the president's tough rhetoric on China, cited Bolton's account about Trump pressing China for agricultural sales to states key in his reelection effort. Schumer said the president \"sold out,\" and, pointing to the Bolton book: \"We see why Trump caved to China so completely.\" \"I would have preferred Mr. Bolton to have told these stories under oath, at the impeachment trial,\" Schumer said \u2014 but not whether there would be any renewed effort now to force Bolton to answer questions. Instead, the New York Democrat focused on the Bolton book's criticism of Trump's dealings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying, \"President Trump cannot be trusted to deal with China policy any longer.\" Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have kept alive their counterattack from impeachment with ongoing investigations into the origins of the Russia inquiry and the business dealings of Biden's son in Ukraine. That's likely where they'll keep their focus over the coming months, as opposed to excavating Bolton's claims about Trump and China or the president's other dealings. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was asked about that Thursday. \"With everything else we have to do,\" he said, \"whether it's police reform or COVID-19, I just think those are more important.\" NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In a new book, lawyer/journalist Adam Cohen makes the case that the Supreme Court has been \"a right-wing court for 50 years,\" siding with corporations and the wealthy \u2014 and against the poor. The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle for a More Unjust America by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 416 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. A new book examines the conservative direction the Supreme Court has headed in over the past 50 years, ever since Nixon became president. The author, my guest Adam Cohen, writes, for five decades, the court has, with striking regularity, sided with the rich and powerful against the poor and weak in virtually every area of the law. He says, in campaign finance law, the court has opened the floodgates to money from wealthy individuals and corporations. In election law, it's upheld rules and practices that make it more difficult for the poor and racial minorities to vote. In criminal law, it's favored prosecutors so consistently that it's contributed significantly to the nation's mass incarceration crisis. And on a wide variety of issues, the court has ruled against the poor. Cohen's new book is called \"Supreme Inequality.\" His previous book, \"Imbeciles,\" was about the 1927 Supreme Court decision bound up in the eugenics movement that upheld a state's right to sterilize people deemed unfit to procreate because they were, quote, \"mentally deficient.\" Adam Cohen is a former public interest lawyer who worked with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center. He served as a member of The New York Times editorial board and as senior writer for Time magazine. Adam Cohen, welcome back to FRESH AIR. As you point out, your book paints a different picture of the Supreme Court than the one presented in civics class. Compare the two pictures. ADAM COHEN: Sure. I think, you know, a lot of us were raised to believe that the Supreme Court was the defender of the disadvantaged. We think of cases like Brown v. Board of Education; the Supreme Court integrated the South. There's a little bit of truth to that, but when you look at the large picture of what the Supreme Court has done historically, it's much more negative than that. They have consistently sided with the wealthy and the powerful. And that's a lot of what my book is about - is showing that siding with the wealthy and powerful is a feature of the court, not a bug. GROSS: You know, we've seen how politicized the Supreme Court has become, with it being pretty predictable what liberals will vote for on the court and what the conservatives will vote for on the court, and the team with the most people on it tends to win. Occasionally, there's swing votes and surprises, but is that a fair characterization in terms of the big decisions? COHEN: Absolutely. But, you know, it's really important to realize how counter that is to the traditional narrative, right? I mean, we're told that the Supreme Court is in the law business, not the politics business, right? I mean, it's those folks in Congress and in the White House who are political. The justices are supposed to be reading the text of statutes, reading the Constitution, using principles of interpretation and objectively arriving at the facts. But what you said is exactly right. It's amazing how political and, you know, recently 5-4 everything is. GROSS: Do you think that politicization is baked into the Supreme Court because the justices are appointed by the president and the president often has, you know, political motives? COHEN: Yeah. There is that element of it, but it's definitely gotten a lot worse. Like, if you go back to the Eisenhower era, Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren, who was the great liberal chief justice, and he appointed William Brennan, who was one of the great liberals of the modern court. And part of the reason was that he didn't really know exactly where Warren would come out, but part of it was, they just weren't as focused as we are now on the exact politics of people. Now when a president is going to make a nomination, the interest groups come out; you know, Trump got a list from the Federalist Society and things like that. It's all very carefully staged, and there's a lot of research, and no one wants to take any chances about, you know, not getting the, quote, \"correct\" kind of justice. GROSS: You trace the origins of the current conservative court to 1969, when Nixon became president. He inherited a very liberal court with Chief Justice Earl Warren. So let's start with some of the liberal decisions under Chief Justice Warren. COHEN: Yeah. Within a year of Earl Warren arriving at the court - he had been the governor of California - the court hands down Brown v. Board of Education 9 to nothing - just an enormous landmark that changed the South entirely. So they do that, and then as the court becomes more liberal, particularly when President Kennedy gets a couple of appointments, they begin to hand down decisions like Gideon v. Wainwright, which said that indigent defendants have the right to have a lawyer appointed; Miranda, the famous Miranda warning that the police can't just start questioning you without telling you of your right to remain silent; a few years later, a very important case striking down the poll tax. So they were really going off in many different directions - criminal justice, voting, welfare rights, defending the rights of those at the bottom of the societal hierarchies. GROSS: Do you think that the Warren court, the liberal Warren court, was a historic anomaly? COHEN: Absolutely. You know, if you look at the long sweep of the court, you know, before the Civil War and after the Civil War, they defended racial segregation. You know, Dred Scott - they said that a black man didn't have a right to sue for his freedom. After the Civil War, in Plessy v. Ferguson, they say that laws requiring segregation on railroad cars are constitutional. In the 1920s - my last book was about how the court very actively embraced the eugenics movement. In the 1930s, when FDR is elected and begins to roll out the New Deal, for several years, the court strikes down the most important New Deal laws, and it's only when FDR really kind of threatens them with a court-packing plan that they give in. So yeah. The Warren court was, you know, a big moment in the court's history but also, in terms of years, a small moment. GROSS: Chief Justice Warren told President Johnson, LBJ, that he intended to resign, and he wanted to resign soon enough so that Johnson could appoint a new chief justice in the spirit of Earl Warren before Nixon was elected 'cause apparently, Warren thought there was a really good chance that Nixon was going to be elected, and he was right about that. But that backfired. LBJ nominated Justice Abe Fortas to be this - the chief justice, and he didn't win Senate confirmation. What happened? COHEN: Yeah. It was one of the great fumbles in Supreme Court history and really unexpected in many ways because Johnson had been, you know, the master of the Senate, the famed majority leader who understood better than anyone how to count votes in the Senate. He didn't count them correctly this time. So he appointed his old, old friend Abe Fortas, who was a justice, someone who had actually helped him to win his very first contested election, which he may not actually have won. So they went way back. And that was one of the problems, is that critics in Congress and in the media labeled Fortas a crony of Johnson, so they said he wasn't an appropriate appointment to the court. But also, at that point towards the end of the Johnson administration, there was some backlash against the Warren court. You got - a lot of Democrats in the Senate were from the South. They didn't like the civil rights revolution. A lot of Republicans in the Senate were saying, well, we're about to have a presidential election; we'd like to keep this seat open in case, you know, a Republican's elected and can fill it. So Johnson just counted the votes wrong, and it was very unfortunate because the time was short. And when Fortas was not confirmed by the Senate, there wasn't enough time to try again, and the seat actually was waiting for Nixon when he came into office. GROSS: And Nixon appointed Warren Burger to be chief justice. What was Burger's judicial philosophy? COHEN: Well, Burger had been ingratiating himself to Nixon by saying how much he didn't like the Warren Court and also didn't like the liberals on his court, the D.C. Circuit Court that he was serving on - the appellate court. So he had been making clear to Nixon that he was going to be quite conservative. He had given speeches about how we're too lenient with criminals. And Nixon knew that with Burger, he would get someone who was as committed as he was to sharply changing the direction of the court. GROSS: Nixon also wanted Abe Fortas out 'cause although Abe Fortas didn't become chief justice, he was still a justice in the Supreme Court. So what did Nixon do to force out Fortas? COHEN: So Nixon comes in. And he gets that chief justice appointment - very exciting. And there have not been that many chief justices in history, so that's a big deal to be able to appoint one right away. But he's also counting, you know, noses on the Supreme Court. And he needs to get a majority to get a conservative court, and he's looking for any way to do that. He's checking on the medical condition of some of the older justices and frankly hoping that they don't last very long. But, yes, he sees a weakness with Fortas because Fortas had just been rejected by the Senate, and he's in a politically weak state. And Nixon has his Justice Department investigate Fortas for a relationship he had with a foundation run by an investor who ended up in trouble with the law himself and actually ended up going to jail. It wasn't illegal. There was no court rule against it. It might not have been the wisest thing to do. But Nixon used that opening and threatens Fortas with prosecution, criminal prosecution, also threatens to prosecute Fortas' wife, who was a lawyer at the firm Fortas had been at, who had been investigated for some other potentially criminal thing that she was cleared of. But Nixon and his cronies were really coming down hard and suggesting to Fortas he and his wife might both end up in jail. They were leaking stuff to the press. And they won. They got Fortas to voluntarily resign, and Nixon got a seat very quickly. GROSS: Who did Nixon replace Fortas with? COHEN: Actually, a close friend of Burger's, Harry Blackmun, who we may remember now - towards the end of his life, he was quite liberal. He wrote Roe v. Wade. But for quite a few years in the beginning, he was a conservative who voted with his old childhood friend Warren Burger. And the two of them began the conservative takeover of the court. GROSS: So by the time Nixon was forced out of office, how had he changed the court? COHEN: Well, incredibly profoundly because he then got two more appointments, Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist, who was an obscure lawyer in the Justice Department - very right-wing. So he had appointed four justices. He actually did that in his first three years in office. And with the couple of conservatives who were already on the court - some Eisenhower appointees - they - there was a conservative majority. So we had this Warren liberal majority that had been doing all the things we talked about for the disadvantaged, and suddenly, there's a clear conservative majority that wants to undo all that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Cohen, and he's the author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle For A More Unjust America.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Cohen. He's a lawyer, and a journalist and author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle For A More Unjust America.\" It's about how the Supreme Court has grown more conservative, often ruling against the poor, against workers' rights, against voting rights while favoring corporations and the wealthy, overall contributing to income inequality. You write that in the five decades since the Nixon presidency, there have only been three Supreme Court chief justices, and they've all been conservative - Burger, Rehnquist and Roberts. COHEN: Yes. And they've had a conservative majority behind them the whole time. And that's really stunning - right? - because if you think about going back to 1970, we've had so many changes in the White House, right? We've had conservatives. We've had, you know - we've had Reagan, and we've had George W. Bush, and we've had Clinton, and we've had Obama. Congress has switched parties multiple times - right? - back and forth, back and forth. We have just had a right-wing court for 50 years. GROSS: So do you think that's kind of coincidence that justices tend to leave or die during Republican presidencies? Or do you think that Republicans are better at getting Supreme Court justices appointed? COHEN: Well, they game the whole system much better than Democrats do, in many ways. So one way is that they do tend to step down in strategic ways that Democrats often don't. So Anthony Kennedy stepped down at a time when he knew that Trump would be able to replace him and get his nominee confirmed by a Republican-held Senate. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer did not step down towards the end of the Obama administration, so that's one part of it. But another part of it really is that they just do the skullduggery a little bit better, too, right? So when Obama nominated Merrick Garland, if Garland had been confirmed, that would have restored a liberal majority to the court for the first time in half a century. And look what the Republican Senate did. They just said, we're not interested; we're not going to do anything. So, you know, I actually say in the book that these are kind of two bookends on the half-century, that Nixon steals Fortas' seat, and Mitch McConnell refuses to allow a Democrat to fill Scalia's seat. And they both propped up the current conservative majority. GROSS: There's something about the process of nominating and confirming Supreme Court justices that seems to have changed. You know, you mentioned the - McConnell blocking the Merrick Garland nomination. But, you know, Trump named his potential justices during the campaign. That's kind of unheard of, isn't it? COHEN: It's gotten much more political. And just the way in which Trump is saying, you know, we're putting together this list, and we're consulting with the Federalist Society - and, you know, I think it's pretty much acknowledged that, you know, Trump, in many ways, was not a very traditional right-wing presidential candidate by background, by temperament and many other things. One thing he clearly did to solidify his support from the right wing, from fundamentalist Christians and all that was to make it clear to them, we're going to choose the kind of justices you want. And they've been very emphatic about doing that. GROSS: It used to be there was not supposed to be a litmus test for a Supreme Court justice. But now both Democrats and Republicans seem to be boldly mentioning (laughter) their support of a litmus test. I mean, some Democratic candidates have said that, yeah, they would choose, you know, a Supreme Court justice who supports abortion rights, that that would be essential. So I think that's something that's changed, too - that, you know, intentionally stating to the public, yes, this judge is coming in with, you know, certain points of view in advance. COHEN: I think that's right. The mask has fallen off, right? And everyone can see what's really going on. You know, in theory, if the court is the sort of legal body we like to pretend it is, what president should be saying is, I'm going to look for the best interpreter of the law. And we'll look for someone who maybe got very good grades or who wrote very good law review articles or who is a fabulous teacher or who has shown just general, you know, excellence in the craft. But that's not what they talk about at all. As you say, they talk about the politics because everyone's pretty much admitting now that the court is a political institution. GROSS: You write that the area in which the Supreme Court has changed the most is in the area of economic class. Give us an example of that. COHEN: Sure. During the Warren court, which we were talking about, the court really embraced poor people and their problems. So we began to see them being very active around issues like the poll tax but also really about welfare, right? I mean, welfare used to be something that was kind of disparaged and an embarrassment. And people didn't talk about it. And we looked down at the people who were on welfare. Well, the Warren court comes along and says, no. Welfare is an important thing in our society that allows people to subsist. And the - and actually, right after the Warren court ended but with the momentum of the Warren Court, in 1970, the Supreme Court did an amazing thing in a case called Goldberg v. Kelly. They actually ruled that, under the Due Process Clause, localities cannot remove people from the welfare rolls without giving them a formal hearing first, a chance to be heard. So that's something that is - you know, it would've been unheard of a decade earlier. So that was the kind of new approach the court took to the poor. But then when the Burger court rises and when the Nixon justices really begin to take control, the court very quickly turns its back on the poor. And it's actually just a couple of weeks later that the court issues a ruling that really sounded the death knell for the poverty law movement, a case called Dandridge v. Williams, where the court not only said that they were going to uphold a really discriminatory, unfair local welfare rule. But they basically said, you know, we're washing our hands of welfare law cases. You know, it's - this is something we're pretty much going to leave to the government to do as they want. And after that Dandridge case, on and on and on, the court began to rule against the poor and to make clear that they didn't care about things like whether welfare was fair. GROSS: Talk about the controversy over whether the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment should include poor people as a group with special protected status. COHEN: Yeah. This is one of the most fascinating things that was going on during the Warren era. So there is this notion of suspect class - is there are certain classes that, the court says, have a higher standing under the Equal Protection Clause. So it's mainly, you know, racial minorities, religious minorities, noncitizens, groups like that. And the idea is that if you're a discrete and insular minority that is unable to really effectively protect itself through the political process, which has often been true of the groups I just mentioned, the court will give you extra care. So the court had been for years identifying different groups that it considered to be in this class. And if you get in this class, the court is then much more likely to strike down any law that puts a burden on you or disadvantages you. And for years, the court was edging close to putting poor people in this category. They would say things like, you know, lines that the government draws against poor people are very similar to lines that they draw against racial groups and, you know, everything but actually calling them suspect class. And we don't know what the Warren court would have done if it had been allowed to continue. But one of the first things the Burger court did in that Dandridge case, as I mentioned, was to really make clear - no, the poor - not going to be a suspect class, and they're not getting any special attention from us. GROSS: So if the court had ruled differently and said poor people were a protected class, how might that have changed things? COHEN: The poor would have then been given a very powerful legal tool to use in a lot of different contexts to challenge a lot of ways in which they're harmed. So right now we have very unequal distribution of welfare around the country, right? There are some states that - if you live in California or New York - not that welfare is munificent because it is not - but there are other states where you get almost nothing, you know, if you're in Wyoming and you need help. So things like that could have been amenable to being challenged under equal protection. Poor people could say, look. We're not being treated equally by the federal government and how it distributes welfare. So there are a lot of categories like that where poverty lawyers would've been able to step up and say, this is a way in which a law is really hurting the poor. And remember, they're a suspect class. GROSS: My guest is Adam Cohen, author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality.\" After a break, we'll talk about the ways in which he says the Supreme Court has given the advantage to the wealthy. And jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a new album by the Carla Bley Trio. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE'S \"TUNJI\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with lawyer and journalist Adam Cohen about his new book \"Supreme Inequality.\" It examines the conservative direction the Supreme Court has headed in over the past 50 years, ever since Nixon became president. He writes that for five decades, the court has, with striking regularity, sided with the rich and powerful against the poor and weak in virtually every area of the law. Cohen is a former public interest lawyer who worked with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center. He served as a member of The New York Times editorial board and a senior writer for Time magazine. There's another case I'd like you to talk about pertaining to school equality over the question of whether schools in poor neighborhoods should get the same amount of funding as schools in wealthy neighborhoods, and we're talking about public schools. Tell us about that case. COHEN: Yeah. Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School board from 1973, one of the, really, most tragic cases, I think, in the Supreme Court's history. The context of it is that there had been a lot of momentum building around the country saying that when the government provides public schools, it has to provide them equally to all children. And under the Equal Protection Clause, you know, people have a right to be protected equally when the government acts, and this was being widely accepted. Important scholars were stepping forward and saying the Equal Protection Clause does not allow the government to fund schools in wealthy districts very highly and schools in poor districts very low. And courts were beginning to rule this way - lower federal courts, state courts. So this momentum was building, and everyone kind of assumed that the Supreme Court would, you know, put the cherry on the sundae in this decision and say, yes, this is what the U.S. Constitution requires. By a 5 to 4 vote, the court does the opposite. It says that there is no obligation to treat children in different school districts equally. So it's really - it was a horrible lost opportunity to extend equal opportunity in education and really in life out comes to all American children. GROSS: Yeah, tell us more about the potential of that decision to have changed the public schools in America. COHEN: Yeah. I mean, I know this quite well because I was a lawyer in this very area of equal educational opportunity at the - when I was at the ACLU, and I worked on a big case at Alabama about it. It's shocking the degree to which schools vary from one district to another within a state. The Washington Post did a story a few years ago looking at Pennsylvania, and the least well-funded school district in Pennsylvania, which is in coal country, got one-third of the funding of the highest-funded school district in the state per student. So think about that - a 3 to 1 ratio. And in Alabama, I mean, the things that I saw in the poor districts in the Black Belt, as they call it, around Selma, Ala., Wilcox County - I mean, children, you know, taking naps on wooden floors with fire ants coming through and biting them, you know, in the middle of their nap; textbooks that said, one day man will land on the moon - I mean, terrible, terrible deprivation, when if you go to Mountain Brook, one of the wealthy suburbs of Birmingham, you know, the schools look palatial. So this is really a pattern across the country, and it really does set up children for very different life outcomes. There's a lot of research on this. If you go to better-funded school, you're more likely to go to a good college, you're more likely to get a good job, not to end up in jail. So the idea that we couldn't just say, no, the government has to give every child the same opportunity in a public government school is, I think, a tragic missed opportunity. GROSS: So you've given us a couple of examples of how the Supreme Court in the '70s disadvantaged poor people. Give us an example of how the Supreme Court in the past few decades has given the advantage to the wealthy. COHEN: Well, the one we have to start with, of course, is campaign finance because it's so important. Until 1976, we didn't have this idea that money equaled speech. And in the wake of Watergate, Congress actually passed a really good, strong campaign finance law. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is one level below the Supreme Court, upheld the law and said that these are perfectly legitimate limits to put on how much you can spend and how much you can contribute in a campaign. The Supreme Court reversed that and said, no, money is speech; it's a First Amendment violation. And we've just gone so far down the hill from there, I mean, to Citizens United, where the court said that, actually, corporations have the right to spend unlimited amounts of money. This is so important because money changes everything in government. We know that Congress responds to people who give them money much more than to people who vote for them. And, you know, one example of that is when they do polls of whether people think the minimum wage should be raised, widespread support across the American public for raising the minimum wage, but the people who contribute money, you know, the retail industry, the, you know, wealthy bosses who employ some of these people don't want it. Well, when was the last time we raised the federal minimum wage? 2009 - because we've allowed money to determine everything, and that's the biggest gift that the court gave to the wealthy. GROSS: We're in an interesting position now in terms of the Democratic primary in the sense that Michael Bloomberg is both the candidate and the funder of his campaign because he's funding it out of his own money. What does the court have to say about that? COHEN: They allow that, right? There's no limits allowed on expenditures, so he can spend as much as he wants. But imagine if the court had gone a different way in 1976 in this decision called Buckley v. Valeo, where they said money equals speech and said money doesn't equal speech. You know, that would be like saying that you have a right to amplify your speech when you're on the sidewalks; you can have a sound truck be as loud as you want and wake up all your neighbors all night because you have the right to speak. They could have said, no, you have the right to say the words you want, but you don't have that right to amplify through money. If they had said that, there could have been limits on how much individual candidates spent on their own campaigns. And think of what a different election we would be having now if Mayor Bloomberg were running as someone who had strict campaign limits on how much he could spend and was roughly spending as much as everyone else; the campaign would be totally different right now. That's something the Supreme Court did for us. GROSS: While we're on the subject of campaigns, talk about how the court has dealt with voting rights in recent years. COHEN: Yeah. I mean, it's really been, I would say, a horror. You know, one of the most awful things they did was strike down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. And remember - the Voting Rights Act is a law that was really one of the crown jewels of the civil rights movement, right? Martyrs died fighting and, you know, marching and protesting for the right to vote. We got the Voting Rights Act. It was renewed over and over again by large bipartisan majorities in Congress. The reauthorization were signed by President Reagan and George W. Bush, who said very nice things about it. This is as close to an all-American law as we have. And the Supreme Court comes along, strikes out the heart of it in a case called Shelby County, and on the most bizarre of legal reasons - you might say, well, they had to do it - right? - because the largest required that, you know, we strike down this unconstitutional statute. But if you look at the reasoning the court used, it's really made up. The court said that the Voting Rights Act as it was constituted denied states their right to equal sovereignty. Well, there really isn't a right to equal sovereignty of the states. And that's not just me saying it; it's not just liberals saying it. Judge Richard Posner, who is a conservative appeals court judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, wrote after the decision, there is no doctrine of equal sovereignty, a principle of constitutional law of which I never heard for the excellent reason that there is no such principle. So this is how the court strikes down one of the most important voting rights laws. But it's not just the Voting Rights Act. They've upheld very strict voter I.D. laws saying, well, you know, it's not really going to be such a problem. And then, of course, it turns out it's a huge problem, and many people are turned away at the polls because they don't have the very exacting IDs that are required. And on the other hand, when people have come in and said, we'd like you to do something about partisan gerrymandering, where legislatures really draw lines that are so extremely based on party that in many districts now it doesn't really matter who votes or how you vote because the legislature's already decided who's going to win every election, well, the court, for years and years, sort of fumbled around maybe doing something about that and then recently decided they're not going to. So in all these decisions, the court has sided with the elite election officials, the people who are setting the rules, and they have not sided with the voters. And I just - I can't end this answer without mentioning, of course, Bush v. Gore, which was the absolute extreme of this, where the court had the opportunity to say, of course, we're going to require that every vote be counted. I think the nation looked to the court and thought, we've got this terrible mess going on in Florida in the presidential election; no one really knows for sure who has won and who's going to move into the White House. And people were, I think, expecting the Supreme Court would be the one institution that could step forward and fashion some kind of solution that was clearly not political, that drew on neutral principles of law. And I think one reason there was so much bitterness afterwards was it seemed very clear that all they did was act politically, and that was because of really the decisions of the five individuals on the court. They could have acted different. They could have acted better. Instead, they stopped the counting of the vote in Florida, and they did it on such made-up legal grounds. The conservatives suddenly embraced this very extreme view of equal protection that they never had before or since. And we know just what a game it was because remember - Bush v. Gore was the decision where the court said, oh, by the way, these rules apply only in this one case. This case is not precedent for anything else. And that's the clearest indication we've gotten from the court that when it comes to voting and rulings about who's going to win elections, for them it's all about power, and it's not about law. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Cohen, author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle For A More Unjust America.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Cohen. He's a lawyer and a journalist and author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle For A More Unjust America.\" And it's about how the Supreme Court became more conservative in the Nixon era and got increasingly so and, in many instances, ruling against the poor, against workers rights, voting rights, while favoring corporations and the wealthy. You know, your book is about how politicized the court has become, particularly in the past 50 years, since the Nixon administration. And, you know, you can argue, well, of course, the court is politicized because they're all appointees of the president, who's, you know, a political person himself and could have a political agenda in choosing a justice. Are there any ideas on the table for making the court less politicized? COHEN: There are a number of them. Some of them relate to the size of the court, right? I mean, it's not required that there be nine justices. It could be a larger number. And that might get us out of the current 5-4 deadlock that we have. Although, I think realistically it would be very hard to enact a change in the number of justices. But there's also been talk about mandatory retirement ages. You know, people are living a lot longer than they were when the founders decided that there should be lifetime tenure on the court. So that would be one way to get more of a cycling in and off the court. So those are a couple of suggestions that are out there. GROSS: Yeah, if a president appoints a young justice, that means that the president's choice is going to be there for perhaps decades. COHEN: Yes. And we talked about - earlier about the way in which Republicans have maybe been better at gaming the Supreme Court system than Democrats, and one thing is that they have nominated much younger justices. So someone like Clarence Thomas has been there for a very long time and may yet still serve for a very long time. GROSS: Before you became a journalist and an author, you were a public interest lawyer. You worked with the ACLU. You worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center. You worked in New York and Alabama. What kinds of cases did you take on? COHEN: When I worked in Alabama at the Southern Poverty Law Center, I did a big jail conditions case. Jails down there were pretty terrible. And I also worked on a case where we were suing the Ku Klux Klan. At the ACLU, I was in a unit that they had set up in the national office working on race and poverty. And one of the big focuses we had was trying to come up with state court solutions for the problem of unequal funding in schools that had been ducked by the Supreme Court in Rodriguez. So Rodriguez said that the federal Constitution does not require states to allocate funds equally across school districts. And we were going in and bringing state court lawsuits that said, well, maybe the state constitution requires that. And some of those have won, and some of those have lost. GROSS: What's an example of one of your biggest victories or defeats from the period when you were a lawyer? COHEN: Well, I spent the most time on a school case in Alabama where we were trying to equalize funding between rich and poor school districts. And in particular, we represented parents and school children from the Black Belt, from the very places that the civil rights movement was so active in the '60s - Selma Ala., Dallas County, Lowndes County. And we went to trial, and we put forward just shocking evidence of inequalities of just how good things were in the suburbs of Birmingham and just how terrible they were in the Black Belt in terms of, you know - there was one school where if you took all the classes they had, you couldn't graduate with a degree that would allow you go to the University of Alabama. I mean, it wasn't really a full high school. There were textbooks that, you know, had been written in the '40s and '50s. There were - you know, just an absence of science, you know, that sort of thing, and then things were quite different in the suburbs. We won a very big victory in the circuit court in Montgomery, and the problem was that the Alabama Supreme Court was very Republican, very conservative, and they ended up reversing it. So it really shows the limits of, you know, how far you can go in some states. And it was really very similar to Rodriguez on a state level, that ultimately you need to get a majority of the Supreme Court to say that you have this right, and a lot of courts are not willing to do that. GROSS: So when you became a public interest lawyer, did you see the courts as a good way to fight for civil rights for, you know, income equality, for social change, for better education? COHEN: Yes, all of those things. I grew up in the Warren era, and to me, that was what the Supreme Court did. Both of my parents were lawyers and judges. My grandmother had been a lawyer. And I did think of the law as being a force for social justice, just in the way the Warren Court had laid out. And when I graduated from law school, I did go into public interest law. But the post-Warren courts - the ones that, you know, Nixon created, the ones that I write about in my book - had already very much changed the law. So, you know, as I mentioned, when I got into education law, you know, Rodriguez had already said that there was no right to equal funding under the federal constitution. Another major case the following year, Milliken v. Bradley, had said that you can't have busing across urban-suburban lines. So that meant that in large cities in the North - like Detroit, where Milliken took place; but also Hartford, where I worked on a case for the ACLU under the state constitution, Connecticut state constitution - all this would have to be done under state constitutions because the Burger and Rehnquist Courts had really put up roadblocks to it. GROSS: Why did you leave the law? COHEN: Well, you know, for a number of reasons, but a big part of it was that cases like the Alabama case were not winning, and it seemed that it was not the force for social change that, you know, it had once been. And in many ways, it seemed that telling stories as a journalist and revealing facts that were not known and making arguments - you know, I spent quite a few years on The New York Times editorial board - making arguments might be a more effective way in this era to effect change than to hope for a kind of 1960s-style judge-led rights revolution. GROSS: So in which place do you feel like you've had the most impact - as a public interest lawyer or as a journalist? COHEN: Well, you know, if we had won the Alabama case, I would say that alone would have made an enormous difference in so many lives that that might have won. But since we didn't, I don't think that the things I worked on as a public interest lawyer had as much impact, although they had some. And there is a new jail - or it was new when - you know, a few years ago - in Chambers County, Ala., that was a result of a lawsuit we brought, saying that the old jail was inadequate. So you can effectuate change, but, you know, I do think that in some ways some of the journalistic work I've done I think might have had more impact. GROSS: Adam Cohen, thank you so much for talking with us. COHEN: Thank you. GROSS: Adam Cohen is the author of the new book \"Supreme Inequality.\" After we take a short break, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a new album by the Carla Bley Trio. This is FRESH AIR.

What women  are saying in the suburbs of Milwaukee.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The president is struggling to win over suburban women or, as he likes to put it, suburban housewives. And he has work to do. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this summer showed that two-thirds of women in suburbs and small cities plan to vote for Joe Biden. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben went to Milwaukee suburbs to see if the president's message is sinking in. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Ava Schultz (ph) doesn't feel like she can talk openly about her support for Donald Trump. She does talk about it with Joy Adams (ph), though, her neighbor and friend of 37 years and a Biden supporter. Sitting in Adams' backyard on a beautiful summer evening, the two women got into it once again. AVA SCHULTZ: Nowadays, if you say something, you're evil. And they go after you and then destroy your property. JOY ADAMS: But do you think that he's brought up all the white supremacists? SCHULTZ: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. J ADAMS: Really? So who are all those people that are out here... KURTZLEBEN: Schultz says Trump's messaging about the silent majority resonates with her. SCHULTZ: I would never tell anybody that I'm going to vote for him. You know, I would never put anything on my car bumper or anything like that. KURTZLEBEN: Adams, for her part, says she likes Biden more the more she learns about him. And, either way, she couldn't possibly vote for Trump. J ADAMS: I'm afraid. I'm afraid for our democracy. It scares me to put him in there for another four years. KURTZLEBEN: All that said, she also knows that arguing won't do her a whole lot of good. J ADAMS: You're not going to change anybody's mind, you know? It is what it is. KURTZLEBEN: Suburban women always get heavy attention in presidential elections according to Kathleen Dolan, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin. KATHLEEN DOLAN: They used to be the soccer moms. And then they were the security moms. And, you know, those of us who studied gender politics, it's like, OK, what are we going to call them this time? KURTZLEBEN: Talking about suburban women is often a way of talking about college-educated white women who have swung further toward Democrats in recent elections. It's also reductive, obscuring trends related to race and education, for example. But Dolan also points out that a few of the suburban counties around Milwaukee stand out demographically. DOLAN: The suburbs and those counties are much, much more conservative, much wealthier. They're much whiter. KURTZLEBEN: Lucetta Adams (ph) lives in the overwhelmingly white suburb of Hales Corners. Adams leans Democratic and, as a special education teacher, says she particularly trusts Biden on education. An incident from the 2016 campaign trail when Trump mocked a disabled reporter has stuck with her. LUCETTA ADAMS: It's - I don't know. I just think our kids have so much to give. And I'm dedicated to that population. And I've worked with them for a very long time. And to see a president mock that is terrible. KURTZLEBEN: This year, Trump is using fear to try to win suburban women's votes. That tactic is just driving Adams further away from him. She brought up a specific Trump super PAC ad. L ADAMS: I get very angry every time it airs. And I haven't seen it air in a while. But it's the one where the mom and the child are hiding under a bed and calling 911. And someone's breaking in their house. And I think that is a terrible message. KURTZLEBEN: Trump has, in particular, used the topic of affordable housing to reach white suburban women like Adams. This summer, he reversed a housing policy intended to fight racial housing segregation. His message is he's protecting suburbanites' home values, as well as their personal safety. Ashley Broadway (ph), who is Black, lives in the suburb of Brown Deer. To her, Trump's messaging is offensive. And she definitely won't be voting for him. ASHLEY BROADWAY: What makes that next person unsafe because they didn't purchase their house in that area? And why would you say that? I hate it in every aspect. It's incredibly racial. And it's just wrong. KURTZLEBEN: For some women from further out areas, the feeling is different. Mary Ludwig is from Watertown, a small city between Milwaukee and Madison, and said she will definitely vote for Trump. But it's not because she's heard Trump's message that Biden would make suburbs less safe. MARY LUDWIG: No. No. I haven't even really heard much about that. KURTZLEBEN: Rather, she's voting for him because she opposes abortion rights. Though, she has mixed feelings about Trump otherwise. LUDWIG: He says things. And he can be very offensive. And he talks before he thinks. But I personally think he's done great with the economy. He's an excellent businessman. And his kids are stellar. He has really great kids. KURTZLEBEN: Suburban women have been the apparent targeted audience of this week's convention. Trump will make his direct appeal to voters in his speech tonight.

Originally broadcast in 2009.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. We're going to listen back to the interview I recorded with John Lewis that was first broadcast on January 19, 2009. It was Martin Luther King Day and the day before the inauguration of America's first African American president, Barack Obama. In the 1960s, Lewis repeatedly risked his life working to end segregation and gain voting rights for Black people in the South. When he was growing up in Alabama, there was one county whose population was 80% African American, but there wasn't a single registered Black voter. Here's our interview. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: Congressman Lewis, welcome to FRESH AIR, and thank you so much for joining us. When you were a young man, were you ever challenged at the polls? Did you have a hard time registering, or did anyone ever try to prevent you from voting? JOHN LEWIS: When I was growing up in rural Alabama, it was impossible for me to register to vote. I did not become a registered voter until I moved to Tennessee, to Nashville as a student. GROSS: Why was it impossible? LEWIS: Black men and women were not allowed to register to vote. My own mother, my own father, my grandfather and my uncles and aunts could not register to vote because each time they attempted to register to vote, they were told they could not pass the literacy tests. And many people were so intimidated, so afraid that they would lose their job, they would be evicted from the farms and they just - they almost gave up. GROSS: Your parents were sharecroppers. Now... LEWIS: My mother and father and many of my relatives had been sharecroppers. They had been tenant farmers, like so many people in South. They knew the stories that had occurred. They knew places in Alabama where people were evicted from the farm, from the plantation. They read about, they heard about incidents in Tennessee where people were evicted from the farms and the plantation back in 1956, in 1957 in west Tennessee between Nashville and Memphis, Tenn. GROSS: Now, because of that, did you - did your parents tell you not to bother to try to vote because it would be dangerous, they might lose their farm? LEWIS: My parents told me in the very beginning - as a young child when I raised the question about segregation and racial discrimination, they told me not to get in the way, not to get in trouble, not to make any noise. But we had teachers. We had high school principals. We had people teaching in colleges and university in Tuskegee, Ala. But they were told they failed the so-called literacy test. GROSS: One of the more dramatic moments of the civil rights movement was a march that you helped lead in 1965 of about 600 people. The march was supposed to be from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., demanding voting rights. But the marchers were stopped soon after you started marching. And you were beaten by the police. Would you talk first a little bit about the goal of that march? LEWIS: In 1965, the attempted march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7 was planned to dramatize to the state of Alabama and to the nation that people of color wanted to register to vote. In Selma, you could only attempt to register to vote on the first and third Mondays of each month. You had to go down to the courthouse and get a copy of the so-called literacy test and attempt to pass the test. And people stood in line day in and day out, failing to get a copy of the test or failing to pass the test. So after several hundred people had been arrested and people had been beaten and one young man had been shot and killed, we decided to march. And on Sunday afternoon, March 7, about 600 of us left a little church called Brown Chapel AME Church and started walking in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion through the streets of Selma. We were walking in twos, no one saying a word. We came to the edge of the bridge crossing the Alabama River. We continued to walk. We came to the highest point on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Down below, we saw a sea of blue - Alabama state troopers. And we kept walking. We came within hearing distance of the state troopers. And a man identified himself and said, I'm Major John Cloud of the Alabama state troopers. This is an unlawful march. You will not allowed to continue. I give you three minutes to disperse and return to your church. In less than a minute and a half, the major said, troopers advance. And you saw these men putting on their gas masks. They came toward us, beating us with the bullwhips, nightsticks, shoving (ph) us with horses and releasing the tear gas. I was hit in the head by a state trooper with a nightstick. I thought I saw death. I thought I was going to die. I had a concussion there at the bridge. And almost 44 years later, I don't recall how I made it back across that bridge through the streets of Selma. But I do recall being back at the church that Sunday afternoon. The church was full to capacity, more than 2,000 people on the outside. And someone said to me, John, say something to the audience. Speak to them. And I stood up and said something like, I don't understand it - how President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam but cannot send troops to Selma, Ala., to protect people who only desire is to register to vote. GROSS: We're listening to the interview I recorded with John Lewis in 2009. We'll continue the interview after a break and hear how he started working with Martin Luther King. And Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel set during the 1918 flu pandemic by Emma Donoghue, who also wrote the novel \"Room,\" which was adapted into a film of the same name. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE'S \"ALABAMA (LIVE AT BIRDLAND JAZZCLUB, NEW YORK CITY, NY, 10/18/1963)\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded with John Lewis in 2009. When we left off, he was talking about leading the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., on March 7, 1965, a march that quickly ended when state troopers attacked the demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. That day became known as Bloody Sunday. It led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act five months later. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: What was the impact, do you think, of that march on the actual passage of the Voting Rights Act? LEWIS: The march created a sense of righteous indignation among the American people. When they saw the photographs, when they read the stories, when they heard the news on the radio or watched it on television, they didn't like it. A few days after Bloody Sunday, there was demonstration in more than 80 American cities - at the White House, at the Department of Justice. People were demanding that the government act. President Johnson didn't like what he saw. He called Governor Wallace, the governor of Alabama at the time, to come to Washington and tried to get assurance from the governor that he would be able to protect us if we decided to march again. The governor could not assure the president, so President Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard, called up part of the United States military. And eight days after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson spoke to a joint session of the Congress and made one of the most meaningful speeches any American president had made in modern time on the whole question of voting rights and introduced the Voting Rights Act. And I was sitting in a home in Selma, Ala., that evening when President Johnson spoke to the nation and spoke to the Congress, sitting with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And at one point in the speech, before Dr. - before President Johnson, rather, concluded the speech, he said, and we shall overcome. And we shall overcome. I looked at Dr. King. Tears came down his face. And we all cried a little to hear President Johnson say, and we shall overcome. And he said to me and to others in the room, we will make it from Selma to Montgomery, and the Voting Rights Act will be passed. Finally, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, we started on the third effort to make it from Selma to Montgomery. Three hundred of us marched all the way. But by the time we walked into Montgomery, there were more than 25,000 citizens. And that effort led the Congress to debate the Voting Rights Act and pass that act. And President Johnson signed it into law in August of 1965. GROSS: Can you talk a little bit about how your mindset changed to go from what your parents told you, which was don't make trouble, it's too risky - to making a lot of trouble, to leading marches, to be willing to get beaten on the head and knocked unconscious to stand up for what you thought was right? LEWIS: Well, growing up, I saw segregation. I saw racial discrimination. I saw those signs that said white men, colored men, white women, colored women, white waiting - and I didn't like it. I would ask my mother and ask my parents over and over again, why? They said, that's the way it is. Don't get in the way. Don't get in trouble. I was so inspired by Rosa Parks in 1955. I was 15 years old. I was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. I heard his words on an old radio. It seemed like he was saying to me, John Lewis, you, too, can make a contribution. GROSS: Well, what was he saying on the radio? LEWIS: He was saying that we must not just be concerned... GROSS: Was it a sermon or something or a speech? Was it a sermon or a speech? LEWIS: It was a speech but also a sermon. He was speaking at a church in Montgomery. And he was saying, in effect, that we must not just be concerned about the pearly gates and the streets with milk and honey. We have to be concerned about the streets of Montgomery and the doors of Woolworth, that we had to be concerned about jobs, about Blacks working as cashiers, of people being able to try on clothing and bringing down those signs. And I said to myself, if I ever got a chance to strike a blow against segregation and racial discrimination, I'm going to play my part. I'm going to do my part. I was so inspired by Dr. King that in 1956, with some of my brothers and sisters and first cousins - I was only 16 year old - we went down to the public library trying to check out some books. And we were told by the librarian that the library was for whites only and not for coloreds. It was a public library. I never went back to that public library until July 5, 1998 - by this time, I'm in the Congress - for a book signing my book \"Walking With The Wind.\" GROSS: (Laughter) Your memoir. LEWIS: And they gave me a library card after the program was over. And I was inspired. I studied the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence in Nashville as a student. And I staged a sitting-in in the fall of 1959 and got arrested the first time in February 1960. GROSS: Now, you describe the difficulty your parents had accepting the risks that you were taking as a civil rights activist. As an activist, did you find it was difficult to convince the older generation to join up with the movement? Was it easier to convince younger people than older people? LEWIS: It was much easier to convince younger people, to convince students, whether they were in high school or college students. In the South during that period, there was so much fear. But there were others who said - when we held the mass meetings, the rallies, the voter registration workshop in a church - it was this feeling, well, it's taking place in a church; it must be OK. It must be all right. There was ministers, religious leaders that was afraid to say anything from their pulpits 'cause they thought, for good reason, the church could be burned down, could be bombed. So we had to do a lot of convincing. And we would go into the fields where people were working in the fields. We'd go in the beauty shops, the barber shops and knock on the doors of people's homes trying to get them to become participants, to get involved, to come to a rally, come to a mass meeting. GROSS: Give me a sense of what you'd say. LEWIS: We would say to people, you know, you've been living here for 40 years, for 50 years. Your street is not paved. You have a dirt road. You don't have clean water. If you want to change that, you must register and you must vote. You can get someone else elected. Come to a mass meeting. Come next Monday. Your neighbors are coming. Your uncle is coming. Your children are coming. You should be there. Tell people we're going to have a march for the right to vote. Don't be afraid. You may get arrested, but there are a lot of other people that will be getting arrested with you. And some people will be convinced, and some will not. GROSS: We're listening to my 2009 interview with the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. We'll hear more of the interview after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MARVIN GAYE SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with John Lewis. It was first broadcast on January 19, 2009. It was Martin Luther King Day and the day before the inauguration of America's first African American president, Barack Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: I'd love to hear the story of how you first met Reverend King. LEWIS: In 1957, when I finished high school, I was 17 years old. This was two years after the Montgomery Bus Boycott, two years after Rosa Parks had taken her seat. And Dr. King had emerged as a national leader. I wanted to attend a little college about 10 miles from my home. It was an all-white state college. I submitted my high school application. I never heard a word from the college. So I wrote a letter to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I didn't tell my mother, my father. Dr. King wrote me back, sent me a round trip Greyhound bus ticket and invited me to come to Montgomery to see him. In the meantime, I had been accepted at a little college in Nashville, Tenn. So in September 1957, I went off to school to Nashville. And after being there for two weeks, I told one of my teachers that I had been in contact with Dr. King. This teacher informed Dr. King that I was in school in Nashville. So Martin Luther King Jr. got back in touch with me and suggested, when I was home from spring break, to come and see him. So my father drove me to the Greyhound bus station. I boarded the bus to travel from Troy to Montgomery. And a young lawyer by the name of Fred Gray, who was the lawyer for Rosa Parks, for Dr. King and the Montgomery movement, met me at the Greyhound bus station and drove me to the First Baptist Church and ushered me into the office of the church. I saw Martin Luther King Jr. standing behind a desk. I was so scared. I didn't know what to say or what to do. And Dr. King spoke up and said, oh, you the boy from Troy. Are you John Lewis? And I said, Dr. King, I am John Robert Lewis. I gave my whole name. And that was my meeting of Martin Luther King Jr. for the first time GROSS: So what did he do? Did he try to encourage you to keep trying to get into that white college? Or did he say, forget college; just come join the movement, work with me? LEWIS: No, Martin Luther King Jr. said to me, we want to help. If you want to go to Troy State, we will help you. We would hire Fred Gray as the lawyer to file a suit against Troy State. But he went on to say, if you really pursue this effort, your family home can be bombed or burned down. They could lose their jobs. You may be beaten. Things could happen to you, but you must be willing to do it. And I told him I was willing to do it. But he said, you must go home and talk to your mother and talk to your father and get them to be willing to file the suit. So that afternoon, I went back to Troy, Ala., met with my mother, met my father, told them about the discussion I had with Dr. King. And they were so scared. They was so frightened. They didn't want to have anything to do with me pursuing my effort to enter Troy State College. So I continued to study in Nashville. GROSS: And did other things in the civil rights movement instead. LEWIS: Well, I continued the sit-ins, got on the Freedom Rides and became an active participant, not just in Nashville but throughout the American South. GROSS: What impact did his assassination have on you? LEWIS: I mourned, and I cried like millions of our citizens did. I heard that he had been assassinated. I was with Robert Kennedy in Indianapolis, Ind., campaigning with him. But somehow I said to myself, I'm not going to become bitter or hostile. I'm not going to give up or give in. I threw myself more into that campaign, and I made a commitment to myself that I would do what I can to continue the work with Dr. King and later, after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated two months later, to continue his effort to make our country a more just, a more fair country. GROSS: I want to quote something that you wrote in an op-ed piece in October of 2003. And this was about gay rights and the right for gay people to marry. You wrote, \"I have fought too hard and too long against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up against discrimination based on sexual orientation. I've heard the reasons for opposing civil marriage for same-sex couples, cut through the distractions, and they stink of the same fear, hatred and intolerance I have known in racism and bigotry.\" LEWIS: Today, I think more than never before, we have to speak up and speak out to end discrimination based on sexual orientation. Dr. King used to say when people talked about Blacks and whites falling in love and getting married - you know, at one time, in the state of Virginia, in my native state of Alabama, in Georgia and other parts of the South, Blacks and whites could not fall in love and get married. And Dr. King took a simple argument and said, races don't fall in love and get married; individuals fall in love and get married. It's not the business of the federal government. It's not the business of the state government to tell two individuals that they cannot fall in love and get married. And so I go back to what I said and wrote those lines a few years ago - that I fought too long and too hard against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up and fight and speak out against discrimination based on sexual orientation. GROSS: Are you concerned that now that Barack Obama is about to become president that a lot of people might be thinking - whew, well, solved the racism problem - glad that's over, don't have to worry about that anymore, don't have to take that into account anymore? LEWIS: I am concerned that there are some feelings in certain quarters and some corners that - what do people of color want now? We elected Barack Obama as president - It's over. People talk about the post-racial America. I see his election not as the end but as a continuum - that we're not there yet. We have not yet created the beloved community that Dr. King spoke of. I see this as a down payment - a major down payment on the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. Even with his election, we still have a great distance to go before we lay down the burden of race. GROSS: Of all the people who have passed on who you were close to, who are some of the people who you were - who you most wish were here today to witness the inauguration of America's first African American president? LEWIS: Oh, I wish - I truly wish - there are so many people, many of these just Indigenous people that have stood in those unmovable lines in the heart of the Deep South. Many of the people that were on that bridge on Bloody Sunday, I wish they could be here today. But many of them have gone on, individuals like Fannie Lou Hamer, sharecropper in the Delta of Mississippi who was beaten but who testified at the Democratic convention in 1964. I wish that Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., President Johnson and President Kennedy and others could witness what is happening in America. I don't know how I'm going to take it all in because from sitting on the steps, I will be able to look right down the Mall and see past the Washington Monument and see the Lincoln Memorial, where we stood more than 45 years ago. And during those days, during that period, many of the people who voted for him could not register and vote. GROSS: Congressman John Lewis, thank you so much for talking with us. LEWIS: Well, thank you very much. Thank you. GROSS: My interview with Congressman John Lewis was first broadcast on January 19, 2009, the day before the inauguration of Barack Obama. Lewis died of pancreatic cancer on Friday. His death has led to a surge of support in the effort to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The bridge was the site of Bloody Sunday, the day in 1965 when Lewis and scores of other demonstrators he led demanding voting rights were attacked by Alabama state troopers. Edmund Pettus was a Confederate general and a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The people who want to remove Pettus' name want to rename the bridge the John Lewis Bridge. After we take a short break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel set during the 1918 flu pandemic. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOE HENDERSON'S \"ISFAHAN\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "In 2021, states will redraw voting district lines to redistribute political power. In many places, the fight over where lines fall is expected to be bitter and partisan.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Next year is a once-in-a-decade opportunity for all 50 states to redraw the lines of state and congressional voting districts. In most places, state lawmakers are in charge of drawing those maps, so both parties poured money into state legislative races this year. And the result was a major disappointment to Democrats. Republicans won in almost all the states that will be key to redistricting. We've got three reporters with us to talk about what these fights will look like in different parts of the country - Ashley Lopez from member station KUT in Austin, Texas; Dirk VanderHart from Oregon Public Broadcasting in Portland; and Steve Harrison of member station WFAE in Charlotte, N.C. Good to have you all here. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. STEVE HARRISON, BYLINE: Hi. DIRK VANDERHART, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Ashley, let's start with you in Texas. The state's getting more diverse, and it's one of many places where Democrats had hoped to take over the House and didn't. What happened there? LOPEZ: Yeah, so those hopes were totally dashed. Democrats were hoping to gain a majority in the Texas House - you know, at least one chamber - so they could have a seat at the table this time around because they've been completely shut out for decades. But much like every other state that Democrats were hoping to flip a chamber in, they were unsuccessful. In Texas, they had their sights set on flipping nine seats that were, quite frankly, just out of reach for them, largely because those districts were drawn to favor Republicans by Republicans 10 years ago. So in case you wondered if, like, redistricting was important, this is a good example why. So Republican lawmakers are again completely in charge of the process, you know, from top to bottom. And because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision recently that said that states can gerrymander for partisan bases, then they really don't have any reason to hold back. SHAPIRO: That makes it sound like Democrats in Texas have no tools at all. Is there any kind of check or balance on Republican power in the state? LOPEZ: Yeah. Well, like the last time, the courts are really the only check they have, right? So even though partisan gerrymandering is legal, which is drawing districts that favor a party over the other, drawing maps that discriminate against people of color is definitely not. That's illegal. And because race and partisanship sometimes go hand in hand, it might be kind of impossible for Republicans to gerrymander based on partisanship without, like, running afoul of racial discrimination laws. So - and in fact, Stephanie Swanson with the League of Women Voters of Texas - she said that this has actually been a persistent issue in Texas. STEPHANIE SWANSON: So in the past 50 years (laughter), Texas has been found to have racially discriminated or violated the Voting Rights Act in every redistricting cycle. They could very much still do the same thing. And that's all we have currently right now - are the courts to stop it. LOPEZ: Yeah. So Texas has, like, a pretty bad track record with this. And because of - so much of Texas's growth in the past few years and decades has been overwhelmingly because of growth among communities of color, groups say they're looking to make sure that those political lines, like, retain that political power and population growth that has accumulated over the past few years. SHAPIRO: All right. Let's turn from Texas to Oregon because Republicans next year are going to have total control of 20 state legislatures with map-making power, and Democrats are only going to have total control of seven. But Oregon is one of those seven. So Dirk VanderHart, what does that mean for redistricting in your state? VANDERHART: Well, that's right. Democrats here have supermajorities in the House and Senate, along with the governor's office. And as of January, they're going to hold the secretary of state's office as well. That's really notable here because in Oregon, if the Legislature and governor can't agree on how to redraw legislative maps, the secretary of state takes over the process. And actually, in the past half-century, the Legislature has failed to pass a plan much of the time. So that is one reason Republicans were really adamant about hanging on to the secretary of state's office in this year's election. There would have been at least some path for them to have meaningful influence in redistricting. Instead, though, a progressive Democrat named Shemia Fagan won the seat. SHAPIRO: So does that mean Republicans are totally frozen out in Oregon as the Democrats are in Texas? VANDERHART: You know, for 2021, that absolutely looks like the case. Earlier this year, there was an effort to try to establish a nonpartisan redistricting commission that would take control of the process from lawmakers. That's something Republicans were pretty supportive of, but it failed to even get enough signatures to make the ballot. So Shemia Fagan, the new secretary of state, has said she would appoint an independent commission to help advise her. We have not seen a lot of what that looks like. SHAPIRO: All right. Let's head east to North Carolina, which has been the site of many high-profile gerrymandering cases over the last few years. What do things look like now in Charlotte, Steve Harrison? HARRISON: Yeah, so I think it's safe to say North Carolina has been one of those bitterly contested states over political gerrymandering after Republicans took control here in 2010. It was a North Carolina case that was heard by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2019 in which the justices said that gerrymandering based on political party was not unconstitutional, and that was a decision that Democrats across the country said was bad for democracy. In North Carolina, there was also litigation in state court that was successful and forced Republicans to redraw legislative and congressional maps before the 2020 election. And with these new maps, Democrats were really hopeful they could win at least one chamber and have a say in drawing the new maps next year. But they had to win in rural and suburban areas. And like what happened in Texas and other places, those hopes really fizzled out. The GOP kept control of both the House and Senate. SHAPIRO: And so what does that mean for redrawing the maps next year? Has the GOP indicated what they plan to do? HARRISON: So they aren't giving any clues. But first, they're doing a little bit of gloating. They're saying, look; we won in 2010 on maps that Democrats drew, and we won in 2020 on maps that Democrats said were pretty fair. So they're taking a victory lap. The question is, are they going to take a hard-line approach next year and draw the maps themselves and lock Democrats out? Democrats here are pretty worried. Here's Natasha Marcus, a state senator from Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte. NATASHA MARCUS: What I do think is that Republicans who run the General Assembly are smart, and they're going to certainly take steps to make things look transparent. HARRISON: And one more thing. There's an assumption here that Democrats are going to benefit from new maps just because so much of the population growth is in cities like Raleigh and Charlotte, which are very blue. But the state's top Republican, Senate leader Phil Berger, is saying, not so fast. He's making this kind of interesting argument that Republican voters in these cities are disenfranchised because the GOP doesn't have any representation there. So he's saying, look; we have 30% of the vote and no members in the Legislature. So he's saying, hey, maybe we should draw a safe Republican seat in Charlotte. SHAPIRO: So take a step back. These votes in November have implications for political power in the U.S. over the next decade. What is this likely to mean? HARRISON: So yeah. One thing going forward - in North Carolina, there was hope to have an independent commission to draw maps. That's what Democrats wanted. That's not going to happen. And I think that's been a push in a lot of places around the country. And Republicans just aren't interested in doing that. So one thing I think you can have the possibility to continue nationwide is a situation where one party may get more votes for their state House chamber or state Senate chamber but still have fewer seats overall. SHAPIRO: That is Steve Harrison of member station WFAE in Charlotte, N.C., along with Ashley Lopez of member station KUT in Austin, Texas, and Dirk VanderHart of Oregon Public Broadcasting in Portland. Thank you all. VANDERHART: Thanks, Ari. LOPEZ: Thank you. HARRISON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF YPPAH'S \"NEVER MESS WITH SUNDAY\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Journalist David Zucchino says Wilmington, N.C., was once a mixed-race community with a thriving black middle class. Then, in 1898, white supremacists staged a murderous coup that changed everything. The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy by David Zucchino Hardcover, 426 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The American South in the post-Reconstruction era was a land of broken promises and brutal oppression for African Americans, as white leaders stripped former slaves of many of the civil and voting rights they'd won after the Civil War. But in the 1890s, the port city of Wilmington, N.C., was an exception. It had a thriving black middle class, a large black electorate and a local government that included black aldermen, police officers and magistrates. That ended in 1898 with a bloody campaign of violence and intimidation by white supremacists, which our guest journalist David Zucchino calls America's first and only armed overthrow of a legally elected government. Zucchino chronicles the events in a new book called \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" David Zucchino is a contributing writer for The New York Times. He's covered war and civil conflicts in more than three dozen countries and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from apartheid South Africa. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, David Zucchino, welcome to FRESH AIR. This is an amazing story. And it's set in Wilmington, N.C., in the 1890s. It's a coastal city, then the largest city in North Carolina - right? - and remarkable for the status that African Americans held at that city at a, you know - which was a city in the Deep South. Give us a sense of where black citizens stood in Wilmington then. DAVID ZUCCHINO: Wilmington was really an outlier. It was really a unique city in the South at that time. It was - first of all, it was a majority black city, and it was probably one of the very, very few major cities in the South that had a black majority. It was 56% black. There was a multiracial government at the time, where blacks served in positions of power, and that was extremely rare in the South at that time. There were three black aldermen. There were 10 black policemen. There were black magistrates. There was a daily black newspaper, which was very unusual in the South. There weren't that many because the white media really dominated. This was, really, more than the white supremacists could bear. They had been in power in North Carolina since Reconstruction but had lost control of Wilmington and the state Legislature in 1894 through a combination of the Populist Party, which was made up of poor whites, abandoning the Democratic Party and going over to the Republican Party and aligning themselves with not only white republicans but black Republicans, and the blacks were the ones that had put the Republicans in power. And so that's how they had reached this status in Wilmington with a burgeoning black middle class, with black doctors, black lawyers, black professionals. It was quite an unusual situation and, again, something that white supremacists were not going to allow to stand. DAVIES: Right. And to remind people who may not remember 19th century politics as well, back then, the Democrats were the party of white supremacy; the Republicans were the ones that African Americans joined and supported. So you had this black middle class and meaningful representation in government. How did whites handle this? What were race relations like in the city? ZUCCHINO: It was interesting. Take the black newspaper for example, The Daily Record, white businessmen bought ads in the paper. There were ads in the newspaper that appealed to both blacks and whites. Blacks worked in white businesses, with the whites clearly in charge but with fairly cordial relations. There was racial segregation at the time, but Wilmington was unusual in that a lot of the neighborhoods were mixed, where you had blacks and whites living together, even in the working classes, which was, again, a little unusual for a city in the South at that time. DAVIES: Obviously, there were whites who resented this. And a plan arose to to retake Wilmington and much of the state from this combination of Republicans and populists, which had given African Americans a meaningful role in government. The violence occurred in the November 1898 election, but the planning started months ahead of time. What happened? ZUCCHINO: It started in the spring, when the publisher of The News & Observer, which was the most powerful and influential paper in North Carolina, met with the head of the Democratic Party, a man named Furnifold Simmons. And they came up with a plan to overthrow the government in Wilmington, which was the largest and most important city. But they had a larger goal in mind, and that was to deprive the blacks of the vote and deprive them of the ability to serve in elected or appointed office ever again. And this plan was hatched over a period of several months during the spring, summer and fall of 1898, leading up to the elections in November. And the way they did this was to set up sort of a military formation in Wilmington, where they had block captains and block lieutenants assigned. They brought in weapons from as far away as Richmond and Baltimore. Whites armed themselves with shotguns and Winchesters. They did not allow blacks, on the other hand, to buy any weapons. The merchants of the city bought a new rapid-fire Colt machine gun for the state militia. And this was a very important point that people don't realize, that the white leadership had control of two state militias, the Wilmington Light Infantry and the city's naval reserves. These were both state militias that purportedly answered to the governor in Raleigh. They were basically the National Guard of the day. But they were made up of white supremacists, and they were controlled by the white supremacist leadership. And at the same time, the city's merchants would buy guns for poor whites who couldn't afford the guns. So the city was incredibly well-armed and prepared for the day when the leadership had set aside after the election to overthrow the government. DAVIES: Right. So there were clearly preparations for a military assault. But there was a huge effort here also in propaganda, in information, in disinformation, fake news, if you want. Give us a sense of what kind of information was propagated which helped to create the atmosphere for this counterrevolution. ZUCCHINO: Yeah. At the time, newspapers were the king of media. They were really the only media. And The News & Observer in Raleigh was the king of media in North Carolina. And Josephus Daniels orchestrated probably the most effective and impressive disinformation campaign up until that time. It was two-pronged. It focused on telling white voters that black public officials were incompetent and corrupt and utterly incapable of governing and utterly incapable of having the intelligence to vote and, at the same time, being sexually insatiable and on the prowl for white women. They even used a term for it - it was the black beast rapist. And Daniels planted these false stories around eastern North Carolina, and particularly in Wilmington, of black men supposedly attacking and assaulting white women and without any protection from a police force that they said was run by black policemen. So this was very, very effective, and it was picked up by other papers around the state and particularly the papers in Wilmington. And they incited whites to attack blacks. And part of the plan was to make sure that blacks did not register to vote because blacks outnumbered whites in Wilmington, and they could overwhelm them with sheer numbers. So during the summer, as part of this campaign, the whites created a Red Shirt militia. These were gunmen who dressed in red shirts, went out at night into black areas and would break into black homes, yank men out and beat them and whip them and threaten them - threaten to kill them if they registered to vote. At the same time, as part of this campaign, white merchants were told to find out whether any of their black employees had planned to register to vote or had registered to vote. If they had registered to vote, they were fired. If they hadn't, they were told that they would be fired if they did register to vote. DAVIES: Another thread of stories arose about - stories of a black insurrection coming. People remembered the Nat Turner revolt, which would have been - what? - the 1830s, right? I mean, many, many years. ZUCCHINO: 1831. DAVIES: Right. But the idea was sold that blacks were planning an armed revolt, thus justifying arming and, you know, oppressing blacks. ZUCCHINO: Yes, this was part of the whole newspaper campaign. I mean, day after day, The News & Observer in Raleigh and the papers in Wilmington and papers elsewhere in eastern North Carolina kept warning of a black revolution, of a black riot. They would print stories saying blacks were stockpiling weapons, when it was fact that - it was the whites who were stockpiling the weapons, that blacks were planning to kill white women and white children and take over the city, take over churches, burn them down, burn down white businesses and take over the town. And in fact, some of the whites believed their own propaganda, and they set up safe places for white families to flee when the black riots started. They set up churches and places of business where they would take white families for protection. And in fact, in the days before the election and before the planned riot - which was two days after the election - a lot of whites sent their families out of the city for fear of this black uprising. DAVIES: And we should just note here that it wasn't - blacks didn't run the entire government, but they had allies among populist whites. They had formed this coalition between populist whites and the Republican Party, which allowed them to win these elections, which were, you know, more tolerant of black participation and black voting rights. ZUCCHINO: Exactly. And part of the propaganda campaign was really targeted against what they called carpetbaggers, which were northern - white northerners who had come down and scallywags, which were southerners who were called race traitors, and these were people who were in positions of power in the government. The newspapers railed against what they called, quote, \"Negro rule,\" when in fact, only a very, very small proportion of public officials in Wilmington and in eastern North Carolina were black. Most of the power resided in their Republican white allies. But the white supremacy campaign - and that's another interesting point. They actually called it the white supremacy campaign. I mean, they were proud of it. And they made it very clear that they were going to restore white supremacy as official government policy. DAVIES: David Zucchino's book is \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THIRD WORLD LOVE'S \"SEFARAD\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with investigative reporter David Zucchino. His new book tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and significant representation in local government. Zucchino's book is called \"Wilmington's Lie.\" There was a very influential piece by an African American newspaper editor, Alex Manly, which played a role in all of these events. Tell us about this. Tell us about him, too. ZUCCHINO: Yeah. Alex Manly was a very, very courageous, crusading black editor. He was, in fact, the grandson of a white governor, in fact, and he could have passed as white, which many people with white ancestors did, but he chose to live his life as a black man. And he advocated for black civil rights, and he demanded that the federal government live up to its promises of equality and citizenship and voting rights for blacks. And he did so through the pages of his paper, The Daily Record. In August of 1898, he responded to a speech that was given by a woman in - a white woman in Georgia, who said the only solution to black aggression against white women was to lynch. And she said, I - she said lynch a thousand times a day, if necessary. And he felt like he had to respond to that. And I would like to read just a couple of lines... DAVIES: Sure. ZUCCHINO: ...From the editorial he wrote in August. Quote, (Reading) Every Negro lynched is called a big, burly black brute, when in fact, many of those who have been dealt with had white men for their fathers and were not only black and burly but were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them, as is very well known to all. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for a white man to be intimate with a colored woman. You set yourself down as a lot of carping hypocrites in that you cry aloud for the virtue of your women when you seek to destroy the morality of ours. And as you can imagine, that had an incredible incendiary impact on whites not only in Wilmington, across North Carolina and across the South because the white newspapers reprinted the editorial in full to try to incite whites against blacks. And in fact, after the editorial ran, there were - the Red Shirts, which was the private militia of the white supremacy movement, wanted to lynch Alex Manly that day. And to show you how premeditated and calculated this white supremacy campaign was, they were ordered by the leaders of the campaign to wait until after the elections in November, three months later, when it would have greater political impact. So Alex Manly did survive up until just before the election, and then the Red Shirts rose up again and wanted to lynch him. He found out about it, and he fled Wilmington and never returned. DAVIES: So November 8 is election day in Wilmington and across the state. What happened in Wilmington? ZUCCHINO: In Wilmington, blacks tried to summon the courage to go out and vote. And some of them did manage to vote, but a lot of them were intercepted by these gunmen, known as Red Shirts, and either threatened or beaten or intimidated and driven away from the polls. And the Red Shirts also went to polling stations and stuffed ballot boxes with phony Democratic ballots and destroyed Republican ballots. And there were instances in several precincts where the Democratic candidate won with more votes than the number of total registered voters in the district. So it was a complete fraud, and the election was stolen. The Democrats did take over county offices in the counties surrounding Wilmington, and they took back the state legislature. DAVIES: Right. And, of course, the municipal officials, which included some African Americans and their Republican - white Republican allies, were not on the ballot that day. And there was a plan to deal with them, and that really meant constraining the white mobs who wanted to really do violence and burn the black newspaper. The plan was not to do that on Election Day. What was the plan? ZUCCHINO: The plan was to wait two days until after the election and to use the newly empowered position that they had as a result of winning the election to overthrow the government. And this was very carefully planned. There was a mass meeting of white men the day after the election where they issued something they called the White Declaration of Independence. They said, from now on, black jobs will be given to white men. There will be no more black officials in public office or in appointed office. Whites will rule. This is white men's country, and whites will rule it. And then they planned and organized for the next day for the Red Shirts to go out and, first, burn Alex Manly's Record newspaper because as I say, the Red Shirts had been just determined all summer to lynch Alex Manly. And they were given permission to do that that day. Once they burned the newspaper and returned, the smoke and the sound of the fire alarms just terrified black workers in the city, and they all fled their jobs and went back to their neighborhoods. And some of them congregated in a black neighborhood that was on the edge of a mixed-race neighborhood. They congregated on a corner. Some of them had managed to grab a few weapons to try to defend themselves, and there was a showdown with the whites who had just returned from burning the black newspaper. And a huge crowd of white armed men developed and confronted this small group of blacks on a corner. And after some shouting and yelling back and forth, gunfire broke out. The whites fired first, and the riot began. And for the rest of the day, the Red Shirts and the two state militias rampaged through the streets, chased down black men, killed at least 60 black men and, at the same time, came up with a banishment list of some 50 people, black and white, who were to be banished from Wilmington forever. They rounded these people up and literally ran them out of town on a rail. They took them to the train station and put them on trains and told them never to come back, and not one of them ever did. DAVIES: What about the women and children? The gunfire was directed at black men. What about their families? What became - what did they do? ZUCCHINO: Black families were so terrified at their men being shot down in the street that they fled. Just hundreds of families just fled to the swamps, to a black cemetery where they figured whites would not enter, and hid in the woods for several days. This was in November. It was cold and wet at night. There were reports that some babies died during this horrible experience. Once the black families felt it was safe to come back to Wilmington several days later, in the weeks and months following the coup, more than 2,000 blacks fled the city. And a black majority city almost overnight became a white supremacist stronghold. In 1898, the black population of Wilmington was 56%, and today it is 18%. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with David Zucchino, a contributing writer for The New York Times and author of the new book \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy\". After a break, they'll talk about how Wilmington's white leaders passed discriminatory laws restricting voting rights for blacks in North Carolina that lasted for the next 70 years, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a recording that recently surfaced of saxophonist Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis and Johnny Griffin. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WYNTON MARSALIS SEPTET'S \"SUNFLOWERS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with veteran investigative reporter David Zucchino. His new book \"Wilmington's Lie\" tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and representation in local government. DAVIES: This wasn't simply a change of government. It was a radical transformation of the lives of black citizens. You want to just talk about that a little bit? Some of - I mean, you know, they were successful attorneys and merchants who had real lives and stakes in the community and lots of black people who were employed in working-class roles. How were their lives affected by this? ZUCCHINO: The leading - the black - the doctors and the lawyers and the funeral directors and the ministers were put on this list to be banished, and they were all confronted in their homes that night, the night of the riot, and told they had 24 hours to get their affairs in order and leave. And they were all put on trains and sent out of town, and not one of them ever came back. There was one man named Thomas Miller, who was one of the wealthiest people, black or white, in Wilmington. He was a real estate broker, a very shrewd businessman. He owned a restaurant. He had been a deputy sheriff. And he was so successful, he was seen as a threat by the white leadership. And he was dragged from his home by the militia - by the state militia - taken to jail overnight and, the next day, put on a train and driven from the city. And he, like all the others, never came back. This was not only a coup. It was a revolution. I mean, this had reverberations across North Carolina and the South that inspired white supremacists across the South. The effect of the coup and the aftermath was that blacks did not hold elected or appointed offices in Wilmington or in eastern North Carolina for another 70 years. I mean, after they drove three black aldermen from office at gunpoint, no black citizens served on the city council until 1972. The white supremacists also hounded the only black member of Congress in the country in 1898, a man named George Henry White who was from eastern North Carolina and represented North Carolina in Congress. They hounded him and his family, and he left after the coup, saying, I cannot live in North Carolina and be treated like a man. And from that point on, no African American citizen served in Congress from North Carolina until 1992. So this had major repercussions, and it was indeed a revolution. DAVIES: You know, one little detail which underlined the permanence of these changes were that Tom Miller, this wealthy black citizen of Wilmington, the real estate broker who was banished from the city, years later asked permission to just come back to attend his mother's funeral. What happened? ZUCCHINO: That, to me, was one of just the saddest episodes in this book. He begged. He wrote a letter to a white colonel he knew in the city who he thought he was a friend and just begged for permission. Just - I just want to come back and bury my mother. She's the oldest living resident of this part of Wilmington. And he was just refused permission, and he wrote this heartbreaking, plaintive letter where he just said he had been treated worse than a dog, that he had done nothing wrong. It was a terrible injustice. It broke his heart, and he died two years later just a broken man. DAVIES: You know, this was an occasion of horrific violence inflicted upon blacks, and it was a stolen election in that all of these state offices went from Republican to Democratic hands in what were clearly circumstances of corruption and intimidation. But there's a third element of this. I mean, you say that this was America's first and only armed overthrow of a legally elected government, and that's because there were local officials who were not on the ballot; that, even after these horrific events, were technically still in office, legally elected - some of them African Americans. What happened to them? ZUCCHINO: A mob of Red Shirts marched on city hall, led by a former Confederate colonel named Alfred Moore Waddell, at gunpoint, confronted the city councilmen and ordered them to resign. And they had no choice. They did resign. But the amazing thing was that they held an impromptu, quote, \"election.\" And the mob leaders, the people who actually led the riot and had run through the streets killing black men, were appointed or, quote, \"elected\" to fill their positions on the city council. And Colonel Waddell was, quote, \"elected\" as mayor. So the mob leaders put themselves in charge, and they ran the city for years afterwards. DAVIES: In the civil rights movement, it was the federal government that often was the difference-maker when local whites were in charge and denying blacks rights. There were efforts to get President William McKinley to intervene, both before these events and then to investigate afterwards. What became of that? ZUCCHINO: Yes. During the whole summer and fall of 1898, George Henry White, the U.S. congressman from North Carolina, met personally in the White House with McKinley and warned him that whites were planning this revolution and that were planning to intimidate and kill black citizens. Black clergymen met with McKinley and warned him about it. Black ministers in Washington, D.C., held several meetings, mass meetings where they warned of the, quote, \"race war\" coming in North Carolina. After the coup and the massacre, McKinley was approached again by George Henry White. He met with a black delegation, who told him what had happened and begged him to send federal troops. But in order for federal troops to come in, they had to be requested by the governor. And Governor Russell was besieged in his mansion. He was terrified, and he wasn't about to call in the troops. And at the same time, President McKinley, who was an abolitionist - he was a former union officer - had campaigned on bringing the nation together. And these events occurred during the summer of 1898 in the middle of the Spanish-American War, and that war had sort of reunited the North and the South 30 years after the Civil War. And I don't think McKinley really wanted to interrupt that sense of nationhood, even though there was a real undercurrent of jingoism there. And at the same time, like any politician, he was running for re-election, and he needed white votes from the South. And now, I don't think he wanted to antagonize whites, so he made a decision to stay out of it, and I could find no record that he made any public comment about the events in Wilmington, before or afterward. DAVIES: As the election approached, through the summer and fall of 1898, you had white militias forming in Wilmington and surrounding communities, violence being inflicted upon blacks, lots of, you know, incendiary language being thrown around in newspaper editorials. Did this attract national attention? ZUCCHINO: Absolutely. This was known as, quote, \"the race war in the Carolinas.\" And newspapers from around the country sent their white reporters down in the spring, summer and fall of 1898 to cover this race war. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Chicago Tribune, the Washington Evening Star, The Baltimore Sun - all the major papers of the day came down and covered it. And what was really interesting was when these reporters would arrive at the train station, the leaders of the white supremacy movement would meet them and hand out cigars and whiskey and arrange for their lodging. And they would also arrange, essentially, for them, to use a modern term, to embed with them. They took them around the city and filled them with stories of how blacks were stockpiling weapons in black churches and were planning to rise up and riot and take over the city. And the newspapers from the North repeated the talking points of the white supremacists almost word for word. So their stories were extremely slanted and even swallowed the white supremacy narrative that blacks were incapable of voting, that they weren't intelligent enough to vote and certainly were not intelligent or capable enough to hold office and had to be removed. DAVIES: We're speaking with David Zucchino. He's an investigative reporter. His new book is \"Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup Of 1898 And The Rise Of White Supremacy.\" We'll take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with investigative reporter David Zucchino. He has a new book which tells the story of the violent assault staged by white supremacist mobs in 1898 to take control of the city of Wilmington, N.C., at a time when African Americans there had real voting rights and significant roles in local government. His book is called \"Wilmington's Lie.\" So after this violence in 1898, what measures were - did the white leaders enact to make permanent the denial of voting rights for blacks? ZUCCHINO: Even before the coup, white supremacists had instituted poll taxes and literacy tests. In poll taxes, you were required to pay a fee in order to register to vote, and this was intended to keep blacks from voting because so many blacks were poor. The literacy test was run after whites stole the election. The poll watchers and the people who registered people were now suddenly all Democrats. And they would impose these literacy tests on blacks and force them to do things, like recite from memory the preamble to the Constitution. But the problem was that up to a quarter of all whites in North Carolina were illiterate and so they couldn't pass the literacy tests, and many whites were poor so they couldn't afford the poll taxes. So the leaders of the white supremacy campaign had been elected to the state Legislature, so they passed what they called a suffrage amendment, which contained a grandfather clause, which said that if your grandfather or any descendant had voted prior to 1867, you were exempted from the poll tax and the literacy test. Well, conveniently enough, blacks did not get to vote in North Carolina until 1868. So essentially, the grandfather clause eliminated almost all black men in North Carolina because very, very few of them - none of them, in fact - had an ancestor who had voted before 1867. DAVIES: And that law, clearly discriminatory provision, stood for how long? ZUCCHINO: It stood until the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, so for basically 70 years. DAVIES: You know, the name of your book is \"Wilmington's Lie,\" which is an interesting way to set a focus on this; it's not just the events, but how they were remembered over the years. In the decades that followed, how were these violent events characterized by white papers, white newspapers and leaders in the South? ZUCCHINO: Right. The first thing I should remind people is this was unique. There have been many so-called race riots in American history, both in the 19th century and the early 20th century, you know, such as Atlanta in 1906 and Tulsa in 1921. But these were spontaneous, and the spark was usually contact between a black man and a white woman. The coup in Wilmington was completely unique. First of all, it was not a race riot; it was a coup, and it was premeditated. It was calculated and planned for months, and there's never been another case like this in American history. And after the coup, in the years following, the white supremacists were quite proud of what they did, and they bragged openly about it in letters and in diaries and in memoirs. But then, gradually, over the years, it was covered up. It was not taught in history books in North Carolina, and if it was mentioned, it was mentioned as part of this lost cause mythology of the South of whites rising up in defense of good government and eliminating incompetent and corrupt blacks from government. So that's the way it was portrayed for more than a hundred years. I went to high school and college in North Carolina, and not once was this ever mentioned in any history class. DAVIES: Over time, in the late 20th century, attitudes changed, and people began to learn about it and consider the narrative of what happened in Wilmington in 1898. And then there was the approaching 100th anniversary, and that culminated in quite a debate about how these events were to be regarded. How did the community contend with this legacy? ZUCCHINO: The University of North Carolina at Wilmington decided that the time had come to really burrow down and find out what really happened and to educate people about what really happened. And they decided to try to bring whites and blacks together, including descendants on both sides of people who had been involved in the events of 1898. It was a very, very emotional and painful time, but I believe they did accomplish something. They had several symposiums. They - at one point, on exactly 100 years after white supremacists gave a speech before the election, vowing to choke the Cape Fear River with black carcasses, they held a joint black and white referendum where they signed what they called a declaration of black and white independence. They had church choirs from black and white churches sing hymns together. They came up with a definition of what had happened. And rather than a race riot, they decided that it was racial violence. The true story was told. But there were still quite a few resentments on both sides. For the whites, there was an undercurrent of why are we dredging up this ancient history? This happened 100 years ago. Let's just let it die. And obviously, for African Americans, a great sense of loss. Their middle-class community was destroyed and, really, never rebuilt. They had suffered - their families had suffered for generations. There were calls for reparations, which created more friction. But in the end, they created a memorial that was a block from the site of where the first gunshots rang out in 1898. They put up a plaque that told the true story of what had been called a race riot but was, in fact, a coup. So I believe, in the end, they did reach sort of an uneasy accommodation with the events of 100 years earlier. DAVIES: You also spoke with descendants of some of the African American leaders at the time, including Alex Manly. What did you hear? ZUCCHINO: I talked to Alex Manly's grandson, Lewin Manly Junior, who at the time was 85 years old. He's a retired dentist living in Atlanta. And he grew up - he knew his grandfather as a child for a few years. He knew Alex Manly's wife very well, his grandmother. And as he was growing up, he kept hearing these stories about Wilmington in 1898 and how his grandfather was directly involved. His family would not tell him anything. And it really pained him, and it bothered him that he could not get anything out of his family. And he realized much later that this was such a painful and searing experience for the family that they decided they would never talk about it again. Alex Manly did not tell anyone the details of what had happened. He said very little about it. He said he wanted to let the past bury the past, would not talk about it up until his death in the 1940s. His grandson learned the true story of what had happened in 2006. This was when a state commission, which had been appointed to - investigated the causes and the impact of the riot, had spent five years investigating it, and in 2006, came out with a 400-page report that just detailed what had happened. And Lewin Manly read this and was astonished, had no idea what had happened. And when I talked to him, I asked him, you know, can you ever forgive the whites for what they did to your grandfather 120 years ago? And he says, well, I'm not a religious man, and I can't forget, and I won't forgive. I hope they're burning in hell - all of them. DAVIES: Well, David Zucchino, thanks so much for speaking with us. ZUCCHINO: It's great to be with you, Dave. GROSS: David Zucchino is a contributing writer for The New York Times.

Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on Tuesday detailed a proposal to advance racial equity in the United States. The plan is the fourth and final pillar of his \"Build Back Better\" agenda for economic recovery, crafted in response to the coronavirus pandemic. \"[Biden] believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be included in the deal. An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants,\" the campaign proposal says. Biden outlined the plan Tuesday afternoon during remarks in his hometown of Wilmington, Del. Biden has significantly curtailed his campaign travel amid the pandemic, mostly staying in Delaware and next-door Pennsylvania. The former vice president took questions from reporters following his remarks. He said he plans to name his vice presidential pick next week, and he expressed confidence in Democrats retaking the Senate. Biden's new proposal seeks to address the country's racial wealth, opportunity and jobs gaps through what the campaign says would be a \"historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas \u2014 and particularly for Black, Latino, [Asian American and Pacific Islander] and Native American-owned businesses.\" The 26-page plan centers around the bolstering of small business opportunities for minority communities, reforming \"opportunity zones,\" investing in affordable housing and homeownership, and expanding access to resources for entrepreneurs of color. Many of the policy proposals detailed Tuesday have been released earlier by the campaign and reflect the priorities of the other three pillars of his plan to revitalize the economy, including a major expansion of access to child care, a $2 trillion climate agenda and a boost to manufacturing through a \"Buy American\" proposal. The racial equity plan would devote $30 billion \u2014 10% of the $300 billion Biden aims to invest in research and development to stimulate the economy \u2014 to a new small business opportunity fund. The campaign suggests the investment would yield $150 billion in venture capital and low-interest business loans. The housing plan includes an up-to-$15,000 refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers to combat racial inequality in housing markets, along with an investment to construct 1.5 million homes and public housing units, and the elimination of housing regulations thought to perpetuate discrimination. The plan also focuses on providing relief from student debt and would make public colleges and universities \u2014 and private historically Black schools \u2014 tuition-free for families with incomes under $125,000, something the campaign estimates would apply to about 90% of Black, Latino and Native American households. Additionally, the plan reads: \"As President, Biden will enact legislation to ensure that every person can go to community college for up to two years without having to pay tuition.\" Biden also called on the Federal Reserve to add targeting persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages and wealth to its core mandate. In response to the plan, President Trump's reelection campaign said in a statement that \"no one should listen to a lecture on racial justice from Joe Biden,\" citing his past relationships with segregationist senators and various comments he's made. Last week, during a virtual town hall organized by the Service Employees International Union, Biden controversially described Trump as the country's \"first\" racist president, which was first reported by the The Washington Post. \"No sitting president has ever done this,\" he said, mentioning that Trump often refers to the coronavirus as the \"China virus.\" Biden said: \"We've had racists, and they've existed. They've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has.\" Various American Founding Fathers, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, enslaved Black people. Still more presidents held racist beliefs, including President Woodrow Wilson, who segregated the federal government. The Biden campaign later clarified to the Post that while there have been other racist presidents, Trump \"stands out \u2014 especially in modern history \u2014 because he made running on racism and division his calling card and won.\" Trump dismissed Biden's comments during a White House press briefing, citing his administration's efforts at passing criminal justice reform and the low unemployment rate for Black people before the pandemic. \"I've done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible of exception of Abraham Lincoln,\" he said.",

Updated at 4:50 p.m. ET Facebook's decisions to put free speech ahead of other values represent \"significant setbacks for civil rights,\" according to an independent audit of the social network's progress in curbing discrimination. The auditors gave a damning assessment of what they called \"vexing and heartbreaking decisions\" by Facebook. Among them: Keeping up posts by President Trump that \"clearly violated\" the company's policies on hate and violent speech and voter suppression; exempting politicians from third-party fact-checking; and being \"far too reluctant to adopt strong rules to limit [voting] misinformation and voter suppression.\" The report reflects two years of investigation by Laura W. Murphy, a former American Civil Liberties Union executive, and the civil rights law firm Relman Colfax. They were hired by Facebook following widespread accusations that it promotes discrimination by, for example, letting advertisers target users based on race. The auditors examined policies and practices ranging from how the company handles hate speech to its work to stop election interference. \"What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go,\" Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, wrote in a blog post introducing the auditors' report. \"While we won't make every change they call for, we will put more of their proposals into practice,\" she said. Sandberg said Facebook would create a new role for a senior vice president dedicated to making sure civil rights considerations informed the company's products, policies and procedures. The audit echoed complaints that advocacy groups have made for years. Leaders of those groups expressed skepticism over whether Facebook would make meaningful change now. \"The recommendations coming out of the audit are as good as the action that Facebook ends up taking,\" Rashad Robinson, president of the nonprofit Color of Change, told NPR. \"Otherwise, it is a road map without a vehicle and without the resources to move, and that is not useful for any of us.\" Vanita Gupta, head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which along with Color of Change was instrumental in getting Facebook to make the audit public, said advocates would continue to put pressure on the company. \"It is a work in progress clearly, and this report in some ways is a start and not a finish for the civil rights community,\" Gupta said. \"We're going to continue to push really hard using multiple tactics to be able to get done what we need to to preserve our democracy and protect our communities.\" The audit comes as hundreds of brands have pledged not to advertise on Facebook this month to protest its laissez-faire approach to harmful posts. Some of the boycott organizers, which include Color of Change, the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, held a call with Facebook leaders on Tuesday and hung up disheartened. \"They showed up to the meeting expecting an 'A' for attendance,\" Robinson said of CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the other Facebook executives in a press conference after the meeting. Advertising accounted for more than 98% of the company's nearly $70 billion in revenue last year. The boycott campaign's stated goal is \"to force Mark Zuckerberg to address the effect that Facebook has had on our society.\" Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told NPR the roster of brands that have paused advertising has passed 1,000, including household names such as Hershey, Ford and Levi's. \"[Facebook executives] haven't addressed the concerns of their advertisers. They haven't addressed the concerns of the civil rights community. They haven't addressed the concerns of consumer advocates,\" Greenblatt said. \"If they fail to do so, we will press and we will push. This effort will amplify, this campaign will expand, and more organizations will join.\" The audit included further recommendations for how Facebook could build \"a long-term civil rights accountability structure,\" including hiring more members of the civil rights team and making a civil rights executive a part of decisions over whether to remove content. The auditors said Facebook had made progress in curbing discrimination \u2014 for example, by barring advertisers from targeting housing, employment and credit ads based on age, gender or ZIP code and expanding policies against voter suppression and census interference. But they warned that the company's decisions to prioritize free speech above all else \u2014 particularly speech by politicians \u2014 risked \"obscur[ing]\" that progress, especially as the presidential election approaches. They called on Facebook to enforce its policies and hold politicians to the same standards as other users. \"We have grave concerns that the combination of the company's decision to exempt politicians from fact-checking and the precedents set by its recent decisions on President Trump's posts, leaves the door open for the platform to be used by other politicians to interfere with voting,\" they wrote. \"If politicians are free to mislead people about official voting methods ... and are allowed to use not-so-subtle dog whistles with impunity to incite violence against groups advocating for racial justice, this does not bode well for the hostile voting environment that can be facilitated by Facebook in the United States.\" Editor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.",

He describes it as an active verb, not merely \"a flag waving.\" \"I have always had a profound appreciation for what this country has said its ideals are,\" Berry said. \"But being a Black American, in particular, one that served in uniform, I've quickly realized that there were just a lot of contradictions in there.\" Berry served as class president at West Point in 2013, one of few Black class presidents in the military academy's history. He now lives in New York and is a co-founder of Collaborate and Graduate, a nonprofit aimed at increasing representation in the military officer ranks. \"I think for Black veterans in particular, once you go overseas and you get back here, it's something you just can't get over, when things aren't the way they should be,\" he said. \"There are countless examples of shortcomings that this country has had, and ways it needs to get better.\" Just one-quarter of Black voters describe themselves as \"proud\" of the state of America today, compared to nearly half of whites, according to a poll released last month by The New York Times and Siena College. A little more than 6 in 10 Black voters say they feel \"hopeful\" about the state of the country. More than 8 in 10 Black voters say they feel \"exhausted.\" \"I think that if anywhere you find just how heterogeneous Black Americans are, it's around this question of patriotism,\" said Farah Jasmine Griffin, the chair of the African American and African Diaspora Studies Department at Columbia University. \"You have African Americans who are definitely patriotic, but not uncritically so, not naively so. And then you have others who find a problem with the very notion of patriotism, and I think that's always been an ongoing and consistent tension.\" We broached this topic in a series of conversations with more than a dozen Black people across the country from various backgrounds. At the core of all of the conversations was a question of conflict: How do Black people in America reconcile experiences of racism and systemic discrimination with pride in their country? Jonathan Horton lives in Pasadena, Calif., and works for for a Democratic member of Congress. \"As a Black American, it's always hard to express the fact that I am patriotic, and what that means to me,\" he said.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Horton\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jonathan Horton lives in Pasadena, Calif., and works for for a Democratic member of Congress. \"As a Black American, it's always hard to express the fact that I am patriotic, and what that means to me,\" he said. \"As a Black American, it's always hard to express the fact that I am patriotic and what that means to me,\" said Jonathan Horton, who lives in Pasadena, Calif., and works for Democratic Rep. Judy Chu. \"It's such a tragedy, because I feel kind of entitled to patriotism. Our ancestors built this country. We should be able to be proud of it, and it should serve us just like it serves everyone else,\" he said. \"But more often than not, it's not serving us equally.\" Kathy Watson of Annapolis, Md., said that \"being an American alone should band us together.\" \"I stand for the national anthem, always have,\" said Watson, 46. \"Black people have willingly fought and died for this. Every day when I drive to one of my businesses I drive through plantations, and honestly, I know I make my ancestors proud.\" Watson is a small business owner who is raising sons. She said that there's \"no other country\" she'd want to live in. \"As a black person, as a mom, does America have its problems? Yes,\" she said. \"But I personally feel that we need to stop looking at this as though this entire country is racist against us, when in fact that is not the case.\" Monica Moore grew up on Chicago's South Side, but in the seventh grade she started attending progressively whiter schools. \"I started to realize that even though I'm American, and America's the only place that I know, I don't feel like this country is talking about me when they talk about Americans or American ideals,\" she said.\n                \n                    \n                    Monica Moore\n                    \n                \nhide caption Monica Moore grew up on Chicago's South Side, but in the seventh grade she started attending progressively whiter schools. \"I started to realize that even though I'm American, and America's the only place that I know, I don't feel like this country is talking about me when they talk about Americans or American ideals,\" she said. Monica Moore grew up on Chicago's South Side, but in the seventh grade she started attending progressively whiter schools. \"I think it might have been early high school when some of the white kids would talk about being, you know, Irish American or Italian American or French American,\" she recalled. \"And it dawned on me that I don't have access to that kind of information about my heritage. That was when I started to realize that, even though I'm American and America's the only place that I know, I don't feel like this country is talking about me when they talk about Americans or American ideals.\" Moore said that she first began to think about patriotism more concretely when then-candidate Barack Obama was elected president. On election night in 2008, she remembered catching the bus to go home from a music rehearsal. \"There was this eerie silence and stillness, and I could feel the gravity of the moment. I remember so much pride, personally, but also in the city at that time,\" she said. But Moore also remembered some of the negative reactions to Obama's election. \"I remember just thinking how messed up it was, the sorts of things that we heard people say about him,\" she said. \"I would call them dog whistles, but there was nothing silent about it. I think that's when I really started to grapple with the idea of patriotism in a more concrete way.\" Brandon Hampton lives in Atlanta, within biking distance of where Rayshard Brooks was killed last month. The 39-year-old said that the last few weeks have been, \"pensive and anxious\" for him. He's been spending a lot of time talking to his nephews about the state of the country. He described patriotism in the way that one might describe the relationship with a beloved relative. \"When you love something, you demand better from it,\" he said. \"That's good parenting: If you love your child, you don't look at everything your child does and say, 'Oh, that's great!' At some point you are going to have to teach them a lesson or instill a value in them that they haven't been expressing.\" \"You have to correct the behavior,\" he said. \"And if you love the country, you have to correct the behavior.\" Rebekah Brevard has been thinking critically about what patriotism means for her for the last six years. She and her husband Abraham live in Long Beach, Calif. \"It's been a weird journey of seeing what patriotism was supposed to be, which is love of country,\" she said. \"And seeing how it actually is, which is blind love of country. Brevard has been specifically thinking about some of the things she learned growing up in her biracial family, but didn't feel comfortable questioning then. \"Patriotism growing up in my family was a really big thing. Military background, serving your country was really important. And the sacrifices that soldiers made was really emphasized,\" she said. \"And then, on the other hand, we would talk about, like, the civil rights movement. But the two never combined.\" She wasn't the only person to draw a link between patriotism and the struggle for civil rights. Armond Bragg of Birmingham, Ala., did, too. The 75-year-old was active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s. When asked how he saw patriotism, Bragg described himself as \"from the school of Colin Kaepernick,\" the former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers who sparked a movement when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality . \"I believe in kneeling on one knee to protest what's going on in this country,\" Bragg said. As he's watched protests continue, Bragg has wondered how much has changed. \"You know, there's not a better song to listen to than the national anthem. It can at times give you goose bumps. But knowing what's happening in the country, we don't have these patriotic desires as we used to have, even when we were dealing with segregation,\" he said. In Richmond, Va., where the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue have been a focal point for demonstrations, Maya Rogers described the beauty of the scene. \"One day we were walking somewhere that had nothing to do with the protests, but it literally stopped us, the beauty of everyone being together and singing, and standing around the monument drew us in,\" Rogers, 23, said. \"Me personally, I've felt so many emotions because I feel like I'm walking in ancestors' shoes in Richmond.\" She said that protesting made her feel like \"a true American,\" because she was \"fighting for something she wanted to stand up for.\" Madea Neyor's parents are from Liberia and she grew up in the U.S. That gives her a dual perspective on patriotism.\n                \n                    \n                    Madea Neyor\n                    \n                \nhide caption Madea Neyor's parents are from Liberia and she grew up in the U.S. That gives her a dual perspective on patriotism. Madea Neyor, 24, lives in New York but since the coronavirus pandemic took hold, she's been quarantining with family in Delaware. That's given her the chance to have conversations with family that grew up in Liberia. \"I've visited Liberia several times, being that both of my parents are from there, while growing up in the United States. I do see what it's like and what it can do to a country when people are at unrest,\" she said. \"One of the great things about growing up here in the United States is getting that dual perspective.\" When asked how she thought about patriotism today, Neyor connected it to what she'd learned from her parents.. \"I took it as, what can I do to help a country, a place that I love, be better,\" she said. \"Those are values of leadership that I think both my parents instilled in me, of being prideful of a country while assisting it and helping it to be better, too.\" Many people, including Andre Myrick in Charlottesville, Va., described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven. When asked about his experience learning about patriotism, Myrick brought up his father who is a Marine Corps veteran. He said his father cared a lot about service, but as time went on \"even he felt less and less patriotic about patriotism, generally.\" Myrick said this is one of the first times in his life that he's been finding his voice as it relates to issues of his own race. \"I've been going back and listening to civil rights leaders and just passionate black voices from the past. I was listening to a program with James Baldwin a couple of weeks ago, and he talks about speaking with a 16-year-old Black boy in San Francisco who feels like he doesn't have a country,\" said Myrick. \"And Baldwin basically says, 'I have nothing to say that proves that he does.' That kind of sums up how I've been feeling of late.\" Andre Myrick of Charlottesville, Va., was one of the many people who described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven.\n                \n                    \n                    Andre Myrick\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andre Myrick of Charlottesville, Va., was one of the many people who described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven. The Rev. Frantz Whitfield of Waterloo, Iowa, has also struggled with this challenge. When he first began decorating his office at Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, he hung a copy of the Declaration of Independence on the wall.  Several years later, he took it down and replaced it with a Nelson Mandela campaign poster. Whitfield, who is 38, said that when people ask why the campaign poster remains on his wall, he tells them that it's because, while Nelson Mandela stood up for his rights, Whitfield's country hasn't stood up for his. \"As a black man, I really don't take much pride in the independence of a country where I feel that in the year 2020, I have to talk about banning choke holds and police reform, all these years later,\" he said. \"I really feel like that's something that should have been done years ago. I celebrate the history of my culture, my ancestors who sacrificed so much for me to have a somewhat comfortable life.\" Instead of celebrating the Fourth of July, Whitfield said he thinks about July 5, the day in 1852 when Frederick Douglass delivered a speech in which he said: \"This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.\"",

Yet she points to the example set by other women she admires. \"Look at Michelle Obama. Look at my mom. Look at Jennifer Lopez. Look at Sanaa Lathan.

I understand how continuing to dream in the face of racism, in the face of the limitation, in the face of the words like diversity and like all those kinds of things, that being your whole self, being your full self, fighting and protesting or pushing and being awake, can still be held alongside of joy, passion, love, connection, softness. That the fullness of our humanity gets to be all of those things.We don't have to turn one off in order to make space for another. The same way black people are not a monolithic group of people. We're not all the same. I also, you know, each of us have all these spaces to who we are. And my job, I feel like my sort of mode of operating in life is walking towards wholeness, not perfection. Perfection is so boring.On sharing her singing in the recent film The High Note with mom Diana Ross I didn't tell her I was singing in the movie, not on purpose, I just didn't. ... Finally, after we had recorded enough of the demo tracks and I felt like I was kind of gaining my footing a little bit, I was like, 'Mom, I'm ready for you to hear.' She's like, 'What?' And I was like, 'The song.' She was like, 'OK.' So by then she knew, and I picked her up in my car. Listening to music in the car is always great because you're in sort of, you know, an enclosed space with speakers. So I picked her up. We sat in my car in her driveway. And she sat in the passenger seat. And we were holding hands on the, you know, the little thing in between the armrest. And then she finally \u2014 you know, she's got a lot of hair. So I couldn't see her face when she was looking for it. And then she kind of finally turned to me and her face is covered in tears. And she just looked at me and said, 'Finally.'

Kamala Harris topped a recent survey asking respondents for their preferred running mate for Joe Biden.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Ernst/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Sen. Kamala Harris topped a recent survey asking respondents for their preferred running mate for Joe Biden. One of a series of reports looking at Joe Biden's potential running mates More than a month before former Vice President Joe Biden's stated deadline for naming his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris is seen as the consensus front-runner to become Democrats' vice presidential nominee. Speculation about running mates can be wrong, of course. Ultimately, the choice is Biden's and Biden's alone \u2014 just as it was Barack Obama's call to tap Biden in 2008. But Harris is often the first name mentioned by Democrats inside and on the edge of the Biden campaign's orbit. She topped a recent multi-state survey asking respondents for their preferred Biden running mate. And, for what it's worth, she's the runaway favorite on online betting sites. That's all despite the fact that Harris' own presidential campaign was a disappointment, having never even made it to the Iowa caucuses. Still, Harris allies see the first-term California senator and former state attorney general and San Francisco district attorney as bringing needed demographic balance to Biden's ticket. They also see her prosecutorial r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as the ideal professional background in a political climate intensely focused on racial justice and policing, and her reputation as a sharp attack dog in Senate hearings as a key asset for a running mate. Perhaps most importantly for Harris' chances, though, many Democrats believe she has more political and governing credibility than any other potential picks, save perhaps Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"She knows the system from inside, and she knows we have to have this whole cultural shift in policing in this country,\" said California Rep. Barbara Lee, who endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. \"She's very well-qualified, because of her background, to understand how we have to dismantle many of those systems.\" Biden is facing increased pressure from other Democrats to select a woman of color. Media no longer available Credit:  NPR \"There is a cry, there's a clarion call, for us to do something different, for this country to literally face structural racism. ... We feel like a Black woman could actually bring that to the ticket,\" LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund and a political strategist, recently told NPR. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joined the push last week, when she took herself out of contention for the job and urged Biden to pick a woman of color as a running mate. \"If you want to heal this nation right now \u2014 my party, yes, but our nation \u2014 this is sure a hell of a way to do it. And that's just what I think after being through this in my state,\" Klobuchar, another former presidential candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday. Among the Black women viewed as most likely to be considered, Harris is the only one who has won statewide office, and the only one who has run a national presidential campaign. \"I'd be honored, if asked, and I'm honored to be a part of the conversation,\" Harris told late-night host Stephen Colbert on CBS last week. \"Honestly, let me just tell you something: I will do everything in my power, wherever I am, to help Joe Biden win.\" \"Joe Biden would be a great running mate\" Even before the coronavirus crisis and the outcry over systemic racism and police violence upped the pressure on Biden to pick a Black running mate, Harris was seen as a natural, maybe inevitable, running mate if Biden won the Democratic nomination. Harris, a 55-year-old Black woman, would complement the demographic weaknesses of a 77-year-old white man trying to lead a party increasingly focused on, and energized by, younger voters and voters of color. And Biden and Harris have seemed comfortable with each other: In 2018 and 2019, the two posed for pictures together on social media after chance encounters on the street and on Amtrak trains. Harris has a close relationship with many people in the Obama administration orbit and had worked alongside Biden's late son, Beau, when both served as state attorneys general. Harris hugs Biden after she endorsed him at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Harris hugs Biden after she endorsed him at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9. Campaign chatter about Harris as a veep-in-waiting percolated to the point that more than a year ago, she felt the need to deflate it with a sarcastic comment to reporters. \"If people want to speculate about running mates, I encourage that,\" she said at a May 2019 press conference, months after the launch of her own campaign. \"Because I think that Joe Biden would be a great running mate. As vice president, he's proven that he knows how to do the job. And there are certainly a lot of other candidates that would make, for me, a very viable and interesting vice president.\" \"That little girl was me\" The chatter suddenly came to a halt the first debate of the Democratic primary. Just before it, Biden had caught heat from progressives for talking nostalgically about his working relationship with two noted segregationist senators. \"It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,\" Harris told Biden during the debate. \"And it was not only that,\" she continued, \"but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\" The attack on Biden, who was then the front-runner, had clearly been planned and practiced. Shortly after the debate ended, Harris' campaign began selling T-shirts marking the moment, featuring a picture of Harris as a little girl. \"It was a debate!\" Harris said just last week, laughing, when Colbert noted on his show that Biden's \"teeth were like Chiclets all over the stage\" after the attack, and asked her how she and Biden can now get along. \"It was a debate! The whole reason \u2014 literally, it was a debate. It was called a debate.\" She added: \"In all seriousness, I've known Joe a long time and I care about him deeply.\" Many Democrats do not view the confrontation as something that would block Harris from getting the vice presidential nod. \"[Biden has] been in politics long enough that nothing is irreparable,\" said one Harris ally who asked for anonymity to speak about the issue. \"He gets primaries and debates and yelling one day and getting along the next. It's a Senate training.\" Perhaps more harmful to Harris' chances as a running mate, though, is the fact that the debate exchange marked the high point of her campaign. Harris briefly surged in the polls after the first debate, and Biden sunk. But soon after, Harris did something that would occur time and time again during her run: She appeared to retreat from the bold position she had previously taken. On busing, she struggled to make it clear how her views were substantially different than Biden's. \"Kamala is a cop\" During the primary, Harris also faced withering progressive attacks about her time as a prosecutor. \"Kamala is a cop\" became a shorthand attack in the vocal world of progressive activists on social media. Up until the presidential run, Harris had tied much of her political identity around the idea of being a more progressive, more nuanced prosecutor who championed what she called \"smart on crime\" approaches: addressing systemic problems like truancy, and trying to return people with criminal records to the workplace. University of San Francisco law professor Lara Bazelon crystallized the critique just as Harris launched her campaign, writing a New York Times editorial blasting Harris for repeatedly shying away from progressive fights over policing reform, wrongful convictions and drug reforms during her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general. \"At almost every inflection point when there was a progressive alternative or a centrist alternative, she chose the safe centrist alternative,\" Bazelon said in an interview. Harris struggled to respond to the sustained attacks, and her campaign stopped highlighting her prosecutorial background. By mid-summer, she was running on what she called \"3 a.m. issues\": economic policies designed to appeal to \"a parent, after feeding the kids and putting them to bed, is sitting at the kitchen table until midnight, figuring out to to make everything run, make everything work.\" By the fall, facing dropping poll numbers and campaign contributions, Harris returned to her time as a prosecutor, telling rallies that \"in 2020, justice is on the ballot.\" \"She's found her voice again\" \"There was never a clear rationale of why her, and why she was running. She was running for too many reasons \u2014 every week there was another major policy thing,\" said Brian Brokaw, a longtime Harris adviser who ran her two campaigns for California attorney general. \"People knew they liked her, but didn't know what she stood for.\" But since the coronavirus crisis began, Harris has been at the forefront of the congressional Democratic response. She's played a leading role in highlighting the fact that COVID-19 has hit the Black community harder than any other demographic group, and has repeatedly pressured the federal government to collect more data on that. She also joined Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other lawmakers pushing for monthly $2,000 payments to every American for as long as the pandemic lasts. \"People should be able to count on their government to see them and create a safety net for them, so that these families don't fall into poverty, or further into poverty, during the course of this pandemic,\" Harris told NowThis News. Then, Harris leapt to the next crisis. When protests filled streets across the country to rage against the killing of George Floyd and other African Americans in police custody, Harris was one of the first lawmakers to join the protests herself. She appeared in front of the White House, and on Washington, D.C.'s newly designated Black Lives Matter Plaza. The longtime prosecutor with the reputation for playing it safe played a lead role drafting a broad bill ending so-called qualified immunity for police, the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and making several other changes demanded by protesters. Joining House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and other Democrats to unveil the broad measure, Harris put it bluntly: \"We're here because Black Americans want to stop being killed.\" \"She's found her voice again,\" adviser Brokaw said. \"This focuses her.\" Even critics like Bazelon have taken notice. \"She did champion progressive causes,\" Bazelon said. \"And her record has been consistent, and it's been good.\" Bazelon said she was particularly impressed by an appearance Harris made on The View, where conservative co-host Meghan McCain pressed Harris on whether or not she supported the \"defund the police\" movement. \"I thought that Kamala Harris did a really masterful job of defining what needed to happen to reform the police,\" she said. \"And then when Meghan McCain pressed her to say yes or no, she said, 'What do you mean by defund?' And Meghan McCain had no answer for her.\" For the people who want to see Harris on the Democratic ticket, it wasn't too far of a leap to envision the fall debate, with Vice President Mike Pence in the spot of McCain.",

            "article_content": "President Trump has declared himself the \"president of law and order.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump has declared himself the \"president of law and order.\" Nearly a month after the killing of George Floyd while in police custody and the launch of massive protests against police brutality across the country, President Trump was asked what part of his response would he have handled differently. \"I think that tone is a very important thing and I try to have a very good tone, a very moderate tone, a very sympathetic \u2014 in some cases \u2014 tone, but it's a very important tone,\" Trump said. Though when pressed on what he would change, the president said, \"I would say if I could, I would do tone.\" No modern president has been as aggressive a culture warrior as Donald Trump. He announced his candidacy by accusing Mexican immigrants of being rapists. He criticized Black athletes who knelt during the national anthem. He championed police officers but promoted rough policing, telling law enforcement officers in a 2017 speech, \"please don't be too nice\" when making an arrest. Recently, he announced over Twitter that he would never consider removing the name of Confederate generals from military bases. Trump has also fixated on the historic phrase \"law and order.\" \"I will fight to protect you \u2014 I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden on June 1, as law enforcement began firing pepper spray on peaceful protesters in nearby Lafayette Park. \"Our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa and others,\" Trump said. Culture wars have been part of American politics for decades. Hot-button issues like immigration, family values and respect for the American flag can get a more powerful reaction from voters than dry debates over taxes or Medicare. But at a time when the country continues to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, an economic recession and, above all, heightened levels of racial unrest, the culture wars are changing, and Trump, who has always relished a fight over white identity and culture is struggling to adjust. Many of Trump's culture war allies are defecting \u2014 NASCAR decided to ban the Confederate flag and the NFL apologized for punishing its athletes who knelt to protest police brutality. According to David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, the most notable rift came when military leaders, whom Trump likes to call \" my generals,\" broke with him. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said they would not only consider renaming military bases but also rejected Trump's threat to use the U.S. military against protesters. \"That was a seminal, I think, development in this story,\" Axelrod said, who is also a CNN senior political commentator and host of the Axe Files and Hacks on Tap podcasts. Axelrod added that Trump also faced opposition from retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, his former defense secretary, and several prominent military leaders who criticized his decision to take a photo in front of St. John's Church following the removal of protesters on June 1. \"Trump has so tried to cleave himself to the military and claim the military as his own. And what the military was saying there is that 'No. We're not yours. We belong to the Constitution. We have principles and rules and norms and laws that we're going to follow.' And that was an incredible rebuke for him.\" Axelrod said. Despite a visible push away from Trump on many of the culture war issues, not every part of the conservative coalition is ready to call a truce. There has even been a backlash to the new positions of institutions like the NFL. Former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich says kneeling athletes will still be a cultural flashpoint and disagrees with the NFL's decision. \"Refusing to stand for the national anthem is an insult to America. It's not protesting racism. It's protesting the United States of America, and that's what the divide is going to become. If you want to be anti-American, you've got a party eager to be with you,\" Gingrich said. \"I can tell you I probably won't watch the NFL this year, and I'm a big Green Bay fan,\" he said. Gingrich, an experienced culture warrior in his own right, argues that Trump will be able to find new issues to push as his Democratic opponents find new ways to overreach. And that's why he believes the culture wars are not over. \"The nice thing in my entire career about dealing with the left is they can't contain themselves,\" Gingrich said, adding, \"so they go from very legitimate demand to reform the police, to defund the police because they just can't help themselves.\" Specific culture war issues can also come and go. In 2004, Republican strategist Karl Rove harnessed the backlash to gay marriage during President George W. Bush's 2004 campaign to help get him reelected. Although, less than a decade later, the same issue faded following the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage in 2015. Now, Rove says the same thing is happening, especially following the recent Supreme Court ruling that protects LGBTQ people against workplace discrimination under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \"They'll be some concern in some quarters about the latest decision by the court. But, yeah, that's the interesting thing about Supreme Court decisions. Not always, but many times, they tend to sort of diminish the controversy,\" Rove said. Another more fundamental reason why culture wars are shifting is that most modern cultural battles are racial. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons says that white voters have started to think differently in the wake of George Floyd's killing. \"The video of Black men being killed on television is much like the 1950s and '60s when Martin Luther King had even children marching in Alabama, and being attacked by fire hoses and dogs. That kind of thing really does speak to the morality that I think most Americans hold,\" Simmons said. Simmons, who also hosts #ThisisFYI on Instagram, says the events of the past month have changed how many Americans respond to and deal with acts of racism and, adding, \"They can't just sit by quietly and let it happen.\" \"It's raised the stakes on these questions of racial harmony and our ability to get past our history,\" Simmons said, adding, \"and what it seems like \u2014 as afraid as people may be of rioters and looters \u2014 they may be more afraid of a president who is not against racism and who's not trying to bring the country together.\" Trump was originally set to hold his first campaign rally since the COVID-19 pandemic on June 19 in Tulsa, Okla. After receiving criticism for scheduling the event on the holiday Juneteenth, in a city that experienced a racist massacre of black people in June 1921, Trump changed the date to June 20. \"Certainly in the television era, it's the first time that we've had a president who's been so willing to embrace a racially exclusive perspective on American politics, and that may be turning the tide against him,\" Simmons added.",

            "article_content": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg's hands-off approach to President Trump has set off a public revolt among Facebook employees that is the company's biggest challenge this year.\n                \n                    \n                    George Frey/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption CEO Mark Zuckerberg's hands-off approach to President Trump has set off a public revolt among Facebook employees that is the company's biggest challenge this year. Congressional Democrats and two influential Washington think tanks this week joined the mounting criticism of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for doing nothing about President Trump's most inflammatory post on the recent protests over police brutality and racism. Facebook's detractors \u2014 which also include civil rights groups, scientists who have received funding from Zuckerberg's charity, and the social network's own employees \u2014 are outraged at the company's response to a post in which the president wrote, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" When Trump tweeted an identical message, Twitter took the novel step of hiding the tweet behind a warning label, saying it broke its rules against glorifying violence. Zuckerberg saw it differently. Even though he was personally disgusted by the president's inflammatory rhetoric, he said, the post did not break Facebook's rules against inciting violence. On Monday, Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security sent a letter demanding the CEO explain Facebook's lack of action on Trump's \"violent, harassing, and dangerous rhetoric.\" \"There is a difference between being a platform that facilitates public discourse and one that peddles incendiary, race-baiting innuendo guised as political speech for profit,\" they wrote. \"Last week, your employees walked out to stand up against racism and in support of truth. You should decide which side you are on.\" Also this week, the Open Technology Institute and Public Knowledge, two left-leaning advocacy groups, said they would no longer accept funding from Facebook. Employee backlash overshadows other big challenges in 2020 The external outcry follows an unprecedented public revolt among Facebook employees that has become a major challenge for a company that prizes loyalty and discourages leaking. Zuckerberg has a lot riding on 2020. With the presidential election approaching, he is under pressure to show that Facebook has learned from the mistakes of 2016, when Russian trolls used the platform to spread divisive conspiracy theories and disinformation aimed at American voters. Zuckerberg is also grappling with the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. As a record number of people have logged onto Facebook, there is new urgency for the company to stop the spread of health-related hoaxes. And now, dissent that usually remains inside Facebook has spilled into public view. A dozen employees \u2014 using their real names \u2014 have tweeted against Zuckerberg's decision. Perhaps the most dramatic statement came from software engineer Tim Aveni, who announced on social media that he was quitting his job at Facebook in protest. \"I've seen a couple times now that Mark doesn't uphold his principles,\" Aveni told CNN. \"Zuck has told us over and over that calls to violence would not be tolerated on the platform, even if they were by the president of the United States,\" he said. \"If Mark keeps moving that goal post, moving his threshold for when someone has crossed the line, especially someone as powerful as the president of the United States, we're in danger.\" Controversy shines light on Facebook's lack of diversity The criticism reflects a pileup of new and old frustrations. Like most big Silicon Valley tech companies, Facebook has few employees of color, especially in leadership and technical roles. Less than 4 percent of its U.S. employees are black, according to its latest diversity report. \"More people are encouraged to be vocal because now, a lot of employees are seeing that Facebook isn't really doing anything and is putting us deeper and deeper into trouble,\" said Mark Luckie. He left Facebook in 2018, after just a year with the company. Luckie, who is black, was hired to build relationships with influencers from underrepresented communities. But he says he encountered exclusion and discrimination at Facebook. \"When I saw that I was going up against this company to do what they hired me to do, I was like, well, I shouldn't be here,\" he said. He wrote a scathing memo accusing the company of \"failing its black employees and its black users.\" The criticism Luckie voiced almost two years ago is also a big part of the current backlash. Many employees were particularly disturbed that only one black person \u2014 Maxine Williams, the chief diversity officer \u2014 was involved in the decision to leave up Trump's post. Zuckerberg told employees he wants to \"make sure the right groups and voices are at the table.\" Facebook told NPR in a statement: \"We have teams from around the company giving serious attention to the ideas we're hearing, especially those from our Black community. This is a time not just to listen but to act.\" Zuckerberg: \"People should be able to see what politicians say\" But so far, the CEO has stuck to his position on Trump and, more broadly, his hands-off approach to what political leaders say on his social network. \"I think political speech is one the most sensitive parts in a democracy and people should be able to see what politicians say,\" he told CNBC in an interview before Trump posted his message about the protests. \"Political speech is the most scrutinized speech already by a lot of the media.\" As the backlash has built up, Zuckerberg has acknowledged just how upset his employees are. In a staff memo last week, he said he wanted \"to acknowledge that the decision I made last week has left many of you angry, disappointed and hurt.\" In a small concession, he said Facebook will review its policies on allowing \"discussion and threats of state use of force\" and on voter suppression, the subject of another controversy about a Trump post. He also said he would consider taking Twitter's approach of labeling posts that break the rules. That would be a departure from Facebook's current policy, which states that posts should either be removed entirely or left untouched. Financial pressure: \"Facebook is all about the brand\" Some Facebook critics say the biggest pressure point to force real change at the social network is money. The company's business depends on $70 billion in annual advertising revenue, which in turn depends on keeping billions of users tuned in to the platform. \"Let's be honest, Facebook is all about the brand, because at the end of the day, it's just a website,\" said Dipayan Ghosh, who used to work on policy issues at Facebook and is now co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. Losing some of those users or advertisers would get Zuckerberg's attention, Ghosh said. But for now, the CEO has made his stance clear. In January, he told investors that Facebook would start explaining its policies better, and worry less about whether those policies are popular. \"My goal for this next decade isn't to be liked,\" he said, \"but to be understood.\" Editor's note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.",

The top prosecutor in Omaha, Neb., will request a grand jury to take a second look at the shooting of James Scurlock, a 22-year-old African-American man who was killed by a white bar owner Saturday night as George Floyd protests in the city turned violent. Douglas County District Attorney Don Kleine had released the shooting suspect Jake Gardner from custody on Monday, ruling that he acted in self defense. Across the city, there are spray-painted signs on boarded up shopfronts and makeshift memorials that say \"His Name is James.\" The apparent reversal by the authorities in favor of a broader investigation is being met with some hope. Birthplace of Malcolm X The historically segregated African-American neighborhood of North Omaha is where Malcolm X was born. Not far from his memorial center and museum, is the Culxr House, a space for artists and activists. It's been transformed into a staging area for Omaha's demonstrations. Activists unload cases of donated bottled water and gatorade. There are boxes of rubber gloves, masks and first aid kits on the carpet. \"We've been dancing this dance for 50 years,\" longtime local civil rights activist Michelle Troxclair tells some of the younger people gathered.

For Omaha's African-American leaders, Saturday's shooting of James Scurlock is a reminder of what they say has been a legacy of violence and police brutality in this conservative-leaning Midwestern city. Last year, the community marked the 100-year anniversary of a lynching that occurred on the courthouse steps after a black man was accused of raping a white woman without evidence. Troxclair points more recently to 1969, when Vivian Strong, a 14-year-old black girl, was shot without warning by police. It sparked three days of riots. These last six days of heated protests across Omaha are a response to what Troxclair sees as the country lurching backwards. \"The election of Donald Trump is a backlash and an outward assault on the perceived loss of power of white people in this country,\" she says. \"They are terrified and there's nothing scarier than scared white people.\" \"Systemic racism\" The white bar owner who was in a scuffle with James Scurlock \u2014 Jake Gardner \u2014 has said he shot him because he feared for his life. Some blurry cell phone video of the evidence has gone viral. Omaha police are now pleading with the public to come forward with any more evidence from that night. Eyewitnesses told NPR the atmosphere in front of the bar's smashed windows leading up to the shooting was racially charged. Since then, there's been an overwhelming police presence in the streets: cops in riot gear supported by the National Guard have shown up in force in the evenings, following peaceful protests during the day. Curfews will again be enforced Friday night in the city's Old Market district, site of the Scurlock killing. Local Black Lives Matter activists describe the large police presence as chilling. You can't not look at the big red hemorrhage in community organizer Morgann Freeman's right eye. She got it after tear gas caused her to fall to the street. \"It looks worse than it is, but, to be frank, I am looking forward to seeing and talking to our political leadership,\" Freeman says. \"I want to literally look them in the eye so they see what they did.\" African Americans make up about 13% of Omaha's population but people in North Omaha say their neighborhood has long been victim to over-policing. Freeman, 29, ran for Congress last year, the first Black woman to do so in Nebraska. She says the November elections are still the best place for change. But there's a lot of anger on the streets right now. \"Whether they will admit it or not they have declared martial law on black lives and anyone that is standing in support of them,\" Freeman says. Incremental Progress \"Wow, they said that? Okay,\" is the response of Ben Gray, the only black member of the Omaha City Council. He represents North Omaha. But in his view, the relationship between police and communities of color has actually gotten a lot better in the past few years. \"I'm not saying that we have a perfect police department, let me say that,\" Gray says. \"I know we have some officers that probably should not be on the force, but by and large the leadership at the top reflects what happens at the bottom.\" Gray says the police chief has brought reforms. Among other things, there's also now a weekly meeting called Omaha 360 where a racially diverse mix of cops, business owners and residents of North Omaha get together to talk. Black Lives Matter activist Morgann Freeman has an unmistakable red hemorrhage in her right eye after she says she fell to the ground as police tear gassed a peaceful protest.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Black Lives Matter activist Morgann Freeman has an unmistakable red hemorrhage in her right eye after she says she fell to the ground as police tear gassed a peaceful protest. Gray also led the pressure calling for a grand jury and a special prosecutor to further investigate the Scurlock shooting. \"I have been pleased this week, in spite of all the circumstances that existed that were negative around us, I've had a number of CEOs, a number of other people call [to say] 'how do we do this,' we gotta fix this,\" Gray says. Gray says this moment is a narrow window to fix institutionalized racism for good. Talking in his empty office through a mask, he added the coronavirus pandemic poses additional challenges to the fight. The virus has not seemed to hit the city's African American population as hard as in other parts of the country, though like in other neighborhoods, job insecurity is a huge issue amid rampant nationwide unemployment. Generations of mistrust Due to delays from the pandemic, any likely grand jury investigation may not begin for weeks, if not even months. After initially resisting, the district attorney here on Wednesday said he welcomed an independent review of his findings that he insisted he still stands by. But he also cited broad public mistrust in the justice system in announcing his support for a second look at the Scurlock case. That mistrust is definitely clear \u2014 and widespread \u2014 in North Omaha. That's definitely clear in North Omaha. In the neighborhood's leafy Benson Park, Yashica Sanders said the discrimination has gone on too long. \"They're tired of being silent, people are willing to stand up,\" she said. Her cousin, Terrell Von, said he's frustrated that some of the protests had gone violent and there was looting \u2014 the two only just were able to return to work after two months of being in lockdown from the pandemic. \"This nation needs some healing,\" Von said. \"It needs a good leader that can at least empathize and sympathize and ... talk to the people.\" City leaders anyway have pledged to keep doing that going forward.",

            "article_content": "Election cases are among those before the U.S. Supreme Court, though none that will change President Trump's defeat.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Election cases are among those before the U.S. Supreme Court, though none that will change President Trump's defeat. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court embarks on the second half of a term with a fortified 6-to-3 conservative majority. But unlike the first half of the term, there will be no norm-busting President Trump often railing at the court's election decisions. In tone, President Biden probably will be the functional opposite, but his policies are likely to be greeted with more skepticism. For decades, the court's five-justice conservative majority was split between those who wanted to move slowly in a more conservative direction and others who wanted to move more aggressively. But now, with the more centrist conservatives retired and three Trump appointees on the court, there is a conservative supermajority of six, meaning one vote to spare. No longer, as during the last term, does the reliably conservative but more incrementalist Chief Justice John Roberts have the controlling vote. The other five can now prevail without him. Bottom line: The current court may well turn out to be the most conservative since the 1930s. \"On religion, abortion, gun rights and race, for example, there is a solid majority to change the law and ... move whip quick,\" says Supreme Court advocate and SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein. Obamacare and religion Already argued this term, but not decided yet, are two big cases. One tests whether the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, must be struck down entirely because one provision \u2014 the so-called mandate \u2014 was eliminated by Congress. But the law, including the mandate, has already been upheld twice before by the high court. Republicans in Congress have failed dozens of times to kill the ACA, even when they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. In the meantime, Obamacare has become a very popular program, and if the court were to declare the entire law invalid at this late date, Republicans could end up in the position of a dog that chases the car for years and finally catches it. It could be bloody. The other case heard earlier this term tests whether the city of Philadelphia may refuse to award some foster care contracts to Catholic Social Services because CSS, based on religious objections, refuses to screen LGBT couples, as required by the city's anti-discrimination laws. The tea leaves, as of now, indicate CSS will win. If so, the power of government to make contracts \u2014 the one area long viewed as relatively immune to religious challenges \u2014 would become fair game for religious objectors. It would be \"quite a significant departure from what the court might have done 15 or 20 years ago,\" observes professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law Houston and co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know. A decision in favor of CSS would also be quite a departure from the court's 1990 decision written by conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That 6-to-3 ruling declared that a valid and neutrally applied law is constitutional even if it has some incidental negative effects on some religious groups. As Scalia put it back then, allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion \"would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\" Still, the current court appears headed in the direction that Scalia warned against. Indeed, even before the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, there was a firm conservative majority in religious liberty cases. The only religious liberty case in which Chief Justice Roberts split with fellow conservatives involved the public health measures that governors have taken during the pandemic. Early on, Roberts sided with the liberals in allowing governors to limit attendance at religious services in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But that was before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In what could be a harbinger of things to come, Roberts' vote became irrelevant after Barrett joined the court and provided a fifth vote against Gov. Andrew Cuomo's actions in New York. Similar orders limiting church and synagogue attendance were soon struck down. Executive power On a different question, the executive power of the presidency, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has generally deferred to Trump's muscular assertions of presidential power. So, will the conservative court majority be similarly deferential to Biden? \"I think the short answer is no,\" says University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \"Some of that is going to reflect ... the fact that the court will be more suspicious and skeptical of some of the policies that the Biden administration attempts to pursue by executive order.\" SCOTUSblog's Goldstein agrees, noting that \"historically, the Supreme Court's view about whether a president has powers [to do certain things] has tended to track whether the justices in the majority like the president and his policies.\" Goldstein adds that it will be \"really fascinating\" to see whether a court that has \"breathed more life\" into presidential powers \"will stick with that even if they don't like the policies of a much more liberal president.\" Both Goldstein and Vladeck note, however, that the conservative majority has been cutting back on the regulatory power of administrative agencies to carry out objectives spelled out in legislation. That trend, they observe, is likely to increase, making it more difficult for agencies to make rules carrying out everything from environmental to consumer protection laws. \"This term is like an iceberg,\" says Goldstein. \"There are big cases above the surface,\" like the ACA case. But below the surface, there are cases being pushed by big business that could make it hard for \"the little guy\" to go to court and harder for agencies to enact regulations. If big business prevails, he maintains, \"it'll be an earthquake\" in terms of consequences. Abortion and guns On the hot-button issues of abortion, guns and race, the court's conservative majority is most likely to start moving aggressively next term and thereafter. Will Roe v. Wade, the court's 47-year-old abortion rights precedent, be overturned? There are two schools of thought on that. One is that the court will systematically hollow out the right to abortion so that it is a right on paper only. The other school of thought is that leaving Roe a shell is not enough for those opposed to abortion. \"There is, I think, a galvanizing view within the pro-life movement that the time has come to call the question,\" observes New York University law professor Melissa Murray. If Roe is to be overturned, however, it likely will take more than a year or two to come to fruition. Former Obama-era Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has said that he thinks it likely will happen within five years or so. On guns, though, the court looks \u2014 for the first time \u2014 to have a clear majority that is hostile to gun regulation. Last term, the court once again punted, and punted again on the issue, declining to hear 10 gun-rights cases. Presumably, Chief Justice Roberts' then-deciding vote was still in doubt. But now, with Barrett newly on the court and Ginsburg gone, there appear to be five conservative votes ready to march down the path of expansive gun rights, and Second Amendment activists are teeing up new cases. \"I can tell you people are getting more aggressive,\" says professor Blackman, a gun-rights advocate. Gun-rights groups \"are emboldened to try to push new frontiers\" now. Election cases and race plus affirmative action Election cases are also before the court, though none that will undo Trump's defeat. But, left over from Trump's fight, there is a possible case from Pennsylvania testing whether state supreme courts have the authority to interpret state laws and state constitutions in federal elections. The justices declined to review the case prior to the election \u2014 and affected ballots, relatively few in number, would not have changed the outcome. But the justices may yet agree to hear the case to resolve the issue. Also on the docket are cases involving state laws that make it more difficult to vote. In 2013, the high court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts confidently wrote, \"Our country has changed,\" and he said that the protections in the law were no longer needed. Within days, though, Republican-dominated state legislatures in the South began writing new laws that made it, once again, more difficult to vote, and they started redrawing legislative lines to further limit minority influence in state and federal legislatures. So, will that reality on the ground have any influence in the current voting rights cases before the court? No, say voting rights experts. UT's Vladeck says that while the current court did hold the line against Trump's post-election attempts to change the outcome, the court's conservatives believe states should be free to enact pre-election laws that restrict early voting and voting by mail, while at the same time allowing states to purge voting roles and tighten voter ID requirements. The conservative majority does not see such restrictions as aimed at intentionally stacking the deck against poor and minority voters. \"For the chief justice and easily a majority of this conservative Supreme Court, their views about race are fully baked,\" says SCOTUSblog's Goldstein. In the same vein, by next term the court will likely hear arguments in one of several cases testing affirmative action in higher-education admissions. The court, for a half-century, has repeatedly ruled that some consideration of race in college admissions is permissible, but a racial quota is not. But now, there may well be a conservative majority to reverse those rulings and bar all consideration of racial diversity in college admissions. After that, affirmative action in employment could be next. In the coming year, other key developments also could shape the Supreme Court's future. Retirements on the horizon? Eighty-two-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court's three remaining liberals, could step down. But he may feel constrained by the fact that Republicans currently control the U.S. Senate, and GOP leader Mitch McConnell has never hesitated to use his power as Senate majority leader to block or advance Supreme Court nominees based solely on whether the nominating president is a fellow Republican or a Democrat. So, Breyer might stay his hand. If, however, the Democrats win two Senate seats in Georgia in January, giving Democrats the upper hand in the Senate for the first time in 10 years, Breyer may well pull the trigger on retirement.",

If you paid attention to the stories about exit polling, you heard a lot of talk about how Latinx and Black voters showed up in bigger numbers this year than back in 2016. But on this week's episode, we also focus on a conversation that's not happening: The one about a group whose support for Donald Trump hasn't wavered. We're talking about the white vote, and in particular, white evangelical voters. Trump's support is overwhelmingly white, but no one goes harder for him than the white voters who have been the beating heart of the conservative movement for decades. No matter what happened over the last four years \u2014 Charlottesville, 'sh*thole countries,\" the disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 about 80 percent of white evangelicals consistently approved of President Trump's performance. While their numbers have dwindled from 21 to 15% of the U.S. population, white evangelicals are a force to be reckoned with in politics, says Robert P. Jones, the author of White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity and the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. They make up a little over a third of Republicans, Jones says, and have an outsized impact on elections, making up about a quarter of voters. That's right\u201415% of Americans account for around 25% of those who turn out to vote. We talked to Jones about the power of this voting bloc, and what that means for the national discussion around race in this country. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. You said that the number of white evangelicals dropped from 21 to 15%. What's happening there? Is that just attrition, people growing old and dying, or people no longer identifying as evangelical? It's a mix of those things. It's more decline than would be accounted for than just simply generational replacement; there are lower birth rates, and so there are  more people dying than are being born. So there is that dynamic. But what's really turbocharged the drop in the last decade has been younger people leaving the group. So one of the other things we're seeing is that, as [the group] is shrinking, it's also becoming older. The median age has been ticking up; the median age now is in the high 50s in this group, and only around one in 10 are under the age of 30. How different are white evangelicals from white voters in general? Do they have regional bases? How educated are they compared with white voters more broadly? They are older, and they tend to be concentrated more in the South and the Midwest. So they're more populous in those states. But notably, if you talked to [a white evangelical person] a generation or two ago, they would have been less likely to have a college education than Americans as a whole. But there's actually been a decent amount of upward mobility in this group. And in fact, it's actually tied to the lower birth rates; one of the things that has led to lower birth rates is more evangelical women getting college degrees, wanting a career and spacing out having kids. So we're actually [finding] now that they're roughly comparable to the country as a whole in terms of the number of who have four year college degrees. In some of the recent polling data that you found before the election, eight in 10 white evangelicals said that they would vote for Trump. Given Trump's very particular biography and demeanor, his appeal among white evangelicals is confusing for a lot of us who are not part of that world. So why have they embraced him so enthusiastically? I think I've probably spent more time answering this question over the last four years than maybe any other question in my career. It is perplexing. And the reason it is perplexing is that this group has defined itself as so-called values voters, right. That's the internal history there. But there are two things here.They have supported Republican candidates, no matter who they were, going all the way back to Reagan. So [their support for Trump] is not atypical. Now, it was notable that [white evangelical support of Trump] reached 81 percent in the exit polls in 2016, which was even higher than what George W. Bush got. And he was kind of one of their own, who himself identified as evangelical. Trump's appeal among this group really was a cultural appeal. It was really the \"Make America Great Again\" mantra. I think most of the power of that slogan was in the last word: again. It was hearkening back to a kind of 1950s America, where white Christians and particularly white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were more dominant in the society demographically and culturally. That's also obviously before Brown v. Board of Education, desegregation and the civil rights movement. And it really had that power. I even started calling them nostalgia voters in the 2016 election cycle, because it was that backward pull that was really the real attraction. In 2016, the question [about evangelicals] was: How could you vote for someone who's been divorced and remarried multiple times, who talked about sort of sexually assaulting women, who paid off a porn star? I think the more relevant question for 2020 is: How could white evangelicals continue to support a candidate who has openly refused to call out white supremacist groups, who has said derogatory things around immigrants? Now, we've had four years of this: the denial of systemic racism, criticizing protesters and what can only be called really racist rhetoric. And I think the answer to that is that it's actually part of the worldview that white evangelicals still hold. And so those kinds of appeals actually weren't repellant; they were actually part of the attraction of Trump to white evangelicals. You found that white evangelicals are the only religious group to think that Islam is at odds with American values. And while most Americans say that police are discriminatory towards Black folks, white evangelicals overwhelmingly do not think that's the case. But there is a minority of white evangelicals who don't feel that way, according to your survey data. What do we know about those white evangelicals? And why are they breaking with the wider evangelical world on issues around race? It's interesting. There are only modest age differences here, and the differences there do tend to be more along educational lines. Those with a four-year college degree tend to be more able, I think, to see these patterns of systemic racism. And in our survey, what we asked was: Do you think that the recent killing of African-Americans by police is part of a pattern of how police treat African-Americans? Or do you think they were isolated incidents? And what we find is, overall, 7 in 10 white evangelicals say that these are just isolated incidents. They're the only religious group with that level of kind of denial of systemic racism in policing. They're also the only religious group that has not moved over the last five years. That's worth saying as well: Other white Christian groups, like white Catholics and mainline Protestants for example, have moved 10 percentage points on this question. They're much more likely to see this as part of a pattern and something that needs to be addressed, whereas white evangelicals remain as dug-in and really unmoved by five years of protest, by five years of more police shootings and police killings. The other thing to say is it's [somewhat about] education, but the biggest driver is partisanship. The 20% of evangelicals that identify as Democrats are by far the ones who are more likely to see this systemic racism. Given this generational attrition, what does that mean for the power of white evangelicals going forward? We'll need a long horizon to see it. But there's no doubt that the group is shrinking and aging, and that only means one thing for the future. There's only so long it can really continue to hold up that kind of influence, just because the numbers simply won't be there in that way. If you look at the two political parties today, a third of the Republican Party is white evangelical. But if you add in the other white Christian groups, it's about two thirds white and Christian. If you add in white Catholics and white mainline Protestants, the Democratic Party is only about one third white and Christian. And if you map those on to the generational cohorts, it means that the Republican Party, in terms of its racial and religious composition, looks something like 70-year-old America. And the Democratic Party in terms of the racial and religious composition, looks about like 30-year-old America. And so, you know, if you're thinking from a partisan lens or from a religious lens, this is not a long term recipe for power, really. I think sooner or later, there will have to be more of a political reckoning to rethink this trajectory in the Republican Party. Unfortunately, I think it's going to take decisive losses at the national level that are probably of a magnitude bigger than the ones we've just seen, for that message to really sink in.

The pandemic has had a chilling effect on freedom around the globe, according to a new report from Freedom House, a nonpartisan group that advocates for democracy and whose founders include Eleanor Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie. The notion that democracy is being \"impinged upon in this pandemic is not surprising. The idea that people's freedoms are being curtailed is absolutely true and objectively verifiable and is happening,\" says Margaret Kruk, professor of health systems at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved with the report. Certain countries show how a global health emergency can have far-ranging repercussions on the overall health and well-being of a country \u2014 but also how countries can rally and do the right thing. The report, Democracy Under Lockdown: The Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Struggle for Freedom, was published in October in partnership with the survey firm GQR. Researchers surveyed nearly 400 journalists, activists and other experts in governance and democracy from March to September to find out how the pandemic is affecting freedom in 192 countries. The picture looks bleak. Since the outbreak began, the condition for democracy and human rights has grown worse in 80 countries. The report points to clear cases where governments have used COVID-19 as a pretext to shut down opposition, marginalize minority groups and control information. It is too early to say whether these infringements will persist after the pandemic, Kruk says. According to the report, 64% of survey respondents agreed that the impact of COVID-19 would have a negative impact on democracy over the next three to five years. \"I would just caution that in the middle of a pandemic, assessing something as big as the future of democracy seems a bit premature to me,\" she says. Still, Kruk says, \"we should carefully monitor\" these abuses \"just as the virus has to be carefully monitored.\" Here are three highlights from the report. According to the survey, 59 out of 192 countries saw some kind of violence or abuse of power as a result of lockdowns and other pandemic measures. \"Police were using the quarantine as an excuse to beat people or forcibly take them into custody,\" says Sarah Repucci, coauthor of the report. She cites cases in Zimbabwe as one of the most egregious examples. The country has been using \"COVID-19 restrictions as an excuse for a widespread campaign of threats, harassment and physical assault on opposition\" she says. In July, the U.N.'s human rights office received reports of Zimbabwean police using force to arrest at least 12 nurses and health care workers protesting on the street for better salaries and work conditions. According to the authorities, these protesters were breaching lockdown restrictions. In a July tweet directed to Zimbabwean officials, the U.N. said COVID-19 measures \"should not be used to clamp down on fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and right to peaceful assembly.\" Some authorities are using the virus as pretext for a political agenda that was already in place. \"There have been a lot of crackdowns on minority groups who had already been a target before the pandemic, such as Muslims in India,\" explains Repucci. \"They've been scapegoated throughout COVID-19 as being spreaders of the virus.\" Indeed, in April, NPR correspondent Lauren Frayer reported that Muslims say they have faced increased discrimination, harassment and attacks in India. The violence has been fueled, victims and observers say, by right-wing Hindu nationalist TV channels, misinformation on social media and statements from ruling party politicians. At least 91 of 192 countries had some kind of restriction on news media during the outbreak, according to the survey. \"That's really an alarming figure,\" says Repucci. \"The media is the only way that people can get information that is not just the government line. Even if the media might have certain biases in certain countries, they serve a really important role for getting people information.\" In an effort to control information, governments have cracked down on the media, from preventing journalists from covering COVID-19-related press events to harassment, intimidation and arrests. The report cites examples from around the world: In Nigeria, a journalist who covered the alleged collapse of a COVID-19 isolation center was detained by the authorities and threatened with criminal prosecution on false news charges in May. In Tanzania, a journalist was suspended for allegedly reporting about a COVID-19 patient without the patient's consent in April. And in Singapore, the government is using its new anti-fake news law to take down social media posts and news stories that clash with government messaging. One of Freedom House's measures of democracy in the report is transparency around coronavirus information. According to survey respondents, the U.S. has not been great at that. The Trump Administration has been criticized for using a number of tactics to control the narrative around the virus. This includes scapegoating, pushing unproven cures and downplaying the severity of the crisis. What the U.S. does in this pandemic matters, says Repucci. \"So many countries look to the U.S. as a model.\" In response to these charges, White House spokesman Michael Bars emailed NPR this statement: \"The Administration's coronavirus strategy is fundamentally rooted in the bedrock objective of saving lives and helping our country \u2013 our schools, businesses, churches and other institutions \u2013 safely open and stay open .... [W]e now have more information on how to better treat patients and protect the most vulnerable through increased care, life-saving therapeutics, state-of-the-art testing, mitigation techniques to prevent community spread and hospitals that are better prepared.\" Only one country reported a positive trend over the past few months: Malawi. \"They had a really bad election in 2019 \u2014 lots of fraud \u2014 and people just assumed that the result was going to stand,\" Repucci says. \"But then it was contested and it went to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court actually surprised everyone with a show of independence from the ruling party and said, yes \u2014 the election was fraudulent, it needs to be redone.\" In June, Malawi was successfully able to hold a rerun election, voting out the ruling party and transitioning to a new regime. It's notable that the country was able to keep its democratic process on track despite concerns about the coronavirus, explains Repucci, because half of the 22 countries that held an election this year were affected by the pandemic. According to the report, officials in seven countries moved the election date and four changed election rules, citing COVID-19. Another country surprised Repucci: Tunisia. \"The activists we surveyed were largely positive about the government response,\" she says. Working quickly to shut down schools, mosques and transportation, Tunisia was one of the first countries in the Middle East to contain their COVID-19 outbreak, according to a July report from the Brookings Institution, a think tank. And Tunisia's communication strategy was widely lauded for being \"transparent and extensive,\" according to the report. The government broadcast daily press conferences on TV and the radio; it also created a website and two Facebook pages with coronavirus information. \"People felt that the government was in control and that they had instituted measures [to control the virus] that were necessary,\" says Repucci, \"and in the process of that, the government was able to refrain from serious infringements on freedom.\"",

            "article_content": "City Hall tags along as Boston mayor Marty Walsh attends various appointments and public appearances \u2014 including this meeting about violent crime.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Zipporah Films\n                    \n                \nhide caption City Hall tags along as Boston mayor Marty Walsh attends various appointments and public appearances \u2014 including this meeting about violent crime. Frederick Wiseman's new documentary, City Hall, was shot in 2018 and 2019, which means that it already plays like a pre-COVID-19 time capsule. I'll admit, I spent at least some of this long and absorbing four-and-a-half-hour film picturing what the 2020 version might look like: a disaster movie, perhaps, about dedicated civil servants frantically trying to help their communities survive unprecedented disruption. And of course, Wiseman's signature scenes \u2014 the workplace meetings where budgets are broken down and bureaucratic procedures are hammered out \u2014 would have been shot as a series of Zoom sessions. I'd probably watch it anyway: Such is Wiseman's gift for making riveting cinema from the minutiae of the everyday. Still, I'm grateful for the version of City Hall we have before us: a sweeping, panoramic vision, both hopeful and tough-minded, about how local government works \u2014 and sometimes doesn't work. It's the 45th feature directed by the now 90-year-old Wiseman, who has spent more than six decades capturing the intimate bustle and flow of life in America's institutions in films like High School, Hospital and Ex Libris: The New York Public Library. City Hall is one of the few films Wiseman has shot in his hometown, Boston, not that you'd necessarily know about that connection from the film. While Wiseman's style is never impersonal, he avoids familiar documentary techniques like commentary or narration. He edits all his own films, and his point of view emerges in the movie's almost musical structure: Watch closely and you'll start to notice recurring themes and meaningful patterns. Wiseman's camera eavesdrops on meetings where city employees discuss issues like homelessness, substance abuse and unemployment \u2014 as well as their particular impact on communities of color. He also breaks up the flow by taking us outside those conference rooms: We witness a lesbian couple's wedding, a Chinese New Year celebration and a Thanksgiving dinner for people with disabilities. These moments are braided together with beautiful shots of Boston's streets and buildings, including the imposing concrete fortress of City Hall itself. Wiseman's films don't really have protagonists, but with City Hall he almost makes an exception. The person we spend the most time with, not surprisingly, is Marty Walsh, the city's Democratic mayor, who at one point seems to be taking us along to every meeting and public appearance on his busy calendar. We see Walsh giving a sobering speech about the city's response to a rash of shootings. A little while later we see him at Fenway Park, happily celebrating the Red Sox's 2018 World Series victory. In another scene, he informs senior citizens about the resources available to them through the city's Elderly Commission. Walsh has an empathetic touch: At one point, addressing some of his Latino constituents, he criticizes the Trump administration's attacks on people of color and reflects on the discrimination endured by past generations of his Irish Catholic family. In another scene, he attends a fundraiser for nurses and reminisces about the kindness of the care he received as a childhood cancer patient. Sometimes Walsh overreaches in his attempts to relate to his fellow Bostonians, but it's moving to see him make the effort. And he seems genuine in his belief that municipal government can effect real, beneficial change in his citizens' lives. At heart, Wiseman seems to share that conviction; he's spent an entire career chronicling the work of individuals and establishments doggedly trying to make a difference. But he also understands that empathy and good intentions have their limits, especially in a system that often greets serious problems with one-size-fits-all solutions. As much as we see of Mayor Walsh early on, there are lengthy stretches where he's conspicuously absent; we're reminded that he can't be everywhere at once. He's the public face of a government that, like most governments, fails at least as often as it succeeds. The movie's most extraordinary sequence takes place at a public meeting over a cannabis dispensary that is about to open in Dorchester. The store owners, who are Asian American, speak loftily about the economic benefits they'll bring to the community. The residents, many of them Black, push back with concerns about traffic, safety and crime. As the debate continues for several minutes, Wiseman keeps cutting between the two equally defensive sides, showing us just how difficult real communication can be in the face of profound racial and economic differences. Fortunately, not every problem is so intractable. One of my favorite scenes shows two different men trying to get their parking tickets excused \u2014 and successfully doing so, with a mix of earnest excuses and humble, open-faced charm. It's a sweet throwaway scene, but it feels almost utopian in its sense of how government should be: competent, efficient and deeply human. As City Hall reminds us, our institutions don't always rise to that standard even at the best of times: They're at once fragile and resilient, and forever in a state of flux. No filmmaker has ever captured that as clearly as Frederick Wiseman, who has become an enduring institution himself.",

Every election cycle, there's an endless stream of voter demographics stories that trot out the same tropes and truisms: about the \"Black vote,\" the \"youth vote,\" the \"women's vote.\" And true to form, pundits have been making the carbon-copy predictions about the Latinx voters for decades. The bloc, according to them, is a \"sleeping giant,\" unaware of their full electoral power \u2014 but this election will be the one where they'll finally turn out in huge numbers. But those predictions are rarely realized; despite their increased presence in the U.S., a little less than half of eligible Latino voters turned out back in 2016, a number well below Black and White ones. However, those cliches conceal a greater truth: Latinx voters have seldom been taken seriously by electoral politics. Sure, they've been courted by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 but that often takes the form of Hispandering. (Remember the list of \"7 ways Hillary Clinton is just like your abuela\"? Or Jeb Bush's ad, in Spanish, celebrating Cinco de Mayo?) And that lack of serious effort has shown. In August, two thirds of Latino voters polled by Latino Decisions said they had not been contacted by either Republicans or Democrats ahead of the 2020 election. But if there was ever a time to take Latinx voters seriously, it's this year. For the first time, they are projected to be the second-largest voting demographic, trailing only behind non-Hispanic white people. The reason for that? Well, the youth. Every 30 seconds, a Latinx person turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote, according to Census Bureau data. And according to historian Geraldo Cadava, there are a million more eligible Latino voters this election cycle than there were in 2016. So we wanted to ask these new voters: Who do you plan to vote for? What issues do you care about? And what do you want the rest of the country to know about you? On this week's episode, you'll hear this new generation of Latinx voters speak for themselves about what's gotten them fired up in 2020. Here's a sampling of what people told us; their responses have been edited and condensed for clarity. Victor Samuel Martinez-Rivera, 23, is from Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, but has been living in Orlando, Fla. since Hurricane Maria hit the island.

The assumptions that I already had about Republicans were that they were racist, but I had never actually seen flat-out racism like that, unapologetic, that they weren't hiding the fact that they're racist.\" -Alanisse Pineda, 18; Chicago, Ill. \"I think I was 14, so I was just starting high school. I remember feeling very surprised by the outcome. I remember reading some news articles and watching the news and seeing that Hillary had actually won by popular vote. But then the actual outcome was Trump became president. And I was like, how? How did the system become so messed up that the people haven't been represented? I think that's something that sparked my interest in politics right now and just in organizing and volunteering, and how I am working today to ensure that doesn't happen.\" -Laura Hermosillo, 18; Tucson, Ariz. \"Being a freshman in high school was very scary, because my parents are immigrants from Mexico.

Heber Toscano, 19, was born in El Paso, Tx., but spend a lot of time right across the border in Juarez.

There will be plenty of firsts on Monday as the Senate Judiciary Committee opens hearings on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the first time that a confirmation hearing is taking place amid a pandemic and with two committee members, both Republicans, recently having tested positive for the coronavirus. It is also the first time that a confirmation hearing is taking place at the same time early voting has begun in many states, and in a presidential election year. And while political hardball is not new, Senate Republicans are playing a confirmation game that is wildly more aggressive than at any time in memory. Four years ago, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused for nearly a year to hold hearings on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, arguing that it was an election year and that the voters should have a chance to weigh in. But now, with a Republican in the White House and the election just over three weeks away, McConnell has scheduled Barrett's confirmation hearing to take place just 16 days after her nomination was announced. That's warp speed for modern times. The average time between nomination and confirmation hearing for the eight current Supreme Court justices was 56 days. A 2016 warning from Barrett Still, expect plenty of rhetorical mortal combat at the hearings this week because the stakes are so high. If Barrett is confirmed to fill liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, many of the court's precedents could be at risk. Barrett herself understood the stakes four years ago, when just five days before the 2016 election, she warned that if Hillary Clinton were elected and had a chance to fill the then-vacant seat previously occupied by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, the appointment would have \"the potential to flip the balance on the court.\" That possibility is writ large now because this is President Trump's third nominee to the court. There already is a five-justice conservative majority, and if Barrett is confirmed, conservatives will have a six-justice majority on the nine-justice court, giving conservatives a dominant upper hand not just in the outcome of cases but in crafting far more broadly written conservative decisions. A threat to the future of abortion rights? So this week, the focus will be on Barrett and her judicial philosophy. Would she vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, strike down the Affordable Care Act, give greater powers to the president or limit congressional powers? Just what kind of a justice would she be? Many of the speeches noted in her Senate questionnaire are no longer available on various websites where they may once have lived. And a website involving a charismatic Christian religious group she has long been involved with appears to have been scrubbed, according to The Washington Post. And on Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released an update to Barrett's committee questionnaire that included a lecture, a seminar and an ad she signed criticizing Roe v. Wade. Walking in Scalia's footsteps When Trump announced her nomination at the White House, Barrett described herself this way: \"I clerked for Justice Scalia more than 20 years ago, but the lessons I learned still resonate. His judicial philosophy is mine, too.\" Scalia was a conservative icon who more than any modern legal theorist popularized the concept of originalism \u2014 the idea that the Constitution should be read to mean what the Founding Fathers intended at the time it was written and ratified. He was a fervent opponent of Roe v. Wade and the court's gay rights and same-sex marriage decisions, and he was the author of the court's two major gun-rights rulings. So if Barrett is a justice in Scalia's mold, she will move the court decidedly to the right. The problem for Democrats is that Barrett is a very accomplished nominee \u2014 a star professor at Notre Dame Law School, a mother of seven, including two children she and her husband, Jesse, adopted from Haiti and one child with Down syndrome. At the same time, however, many of the features of Barrett's life that point strongly to her conservative views also involve her religion. For instance, in 2006 she signed a two-page ad in the South Bend Tribune declaring that \"it's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\" According to The Guardian newspaper, the ad was sponsored by St. Joseph County Right to Life, a group that Barrett and her husband were members of. The group also opposes in vitro fertilization. Barrett, for her part, has consistently said that a judge should rule on the law, not her personal beliefs. \"I would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law,\" she said at her 2017 confirmation hearing for the appeals court judgeship she now holds. Legitimate inquiry vs. religious test But probing that assertion is politically tricky. Democrats who tried in 2017 found themselves branded as anti-Catholic. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., famously asked Barrett this question: \"I think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different, and when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Republicans reacted with fury. \"It appears that professor Barrett has one big strike against her, and that is her religious faith,\" said then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. \"It is despicable.\" It is a theme that Senate Republican leader McConnell picked up 10 days ago, declaring on the Hugh Hewitt Show that \"discrimination against people of religion is on full display.\" McConnell went on to say that Senate Democrats \"need to be reminded there is no religious test for public service in America whatsoever.\" So Democrats in the next few days almost certainly will try to find ways of questioning Barrett that don't directly involve her religious beliefs. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., for instance, says he will focus on other questions. \"We have an incumbent president, whose reelection is at risk, publicly saying, 'I'm choosing this judge so she can rule on an election dispute if one arises,' \" he said, noting that at the same time, Trump is \"casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election.\" Coons, who met with Barrett by phone last week, said she refused to say whether she would recuse herself from an election dispute should it reach the court. Then, too, there's the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which is scheduled to be argued before the court for a third time a week after the election. Twice before, the court has upheld the health care law by votes of 5-4 and 6-3, but Barrett has been critical of both decisions. And if she is confirmed, she could well be the deciding vote in this latest attempt by the Trump administration to get the court to strike down the law in its entirety. For her part, Barrett has made clear that while she believes that the Supreme Court's doctrine of following precedent is important, there are times when it is not. As she wrote in the Texas Law Review in 2013: \"I tend to agree with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution ... rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.\" Contributing research for this article were Marisa Manzi, Christina Peck, Timur Akman-Duffy, Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred, Leemah Nasrati, Alexandra Benton, Gabriel A.

Left to right: Elbernita \"Twinkie\" Clark, Jacky Clark Chisholm, Dorinda Clark-Cole and Karen Clark Sheard. We don't think of flowers and Black folks together enough. But it is the Black church, and Black art, that tell us about the sound of flowers. In 1965, James Cleveland, the late \"King of Gospel,\" released his definitive version of \"Give Me My Flowers\" with The Angelic Choir in Nutley, N.J. Originally by The Consolers, the song bespeaks the necessity of offering flowers to those you cherish while they are alive, such that they can sense the beauty such gifts produce. It is a plea towards the sensuousness of color and odor and touch, a plea toward recognizing that delight is something Black folks can, should and do cultivate, and that this cultivation is a spiritual practice. More recently, the poet Hanif Adburraqib was watching a Black peer offer words about the beauty of flowers at a reading shortly after the 2016 election, when he heard a white person behind him ask, \"How can Black people write about flowers at a time like this?\" The moment set him off on a path to talk, precisely, about flowers as a poetics, in a series of poems named for the overheard question. Recounting the story in an interview last year, he asked, \"What is the Black poet to be writing about 'at a time like this' if not to dissect the attractiveness of a flower \u2014 that which can arrive beautiful and then slowly die right before our eyes?\" What Cleveland's choir hints at through singing, what Abdurraqib writes about, is the absurdity of thinking Black life is or can ever be devoid of sensuality, of beauty unfolding and flowering. Black folks are given attention in moments of spectacular crisis, but in our world there is always a crisis. Since at least the 15th century and the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to Europe, this supposed new world is the crisis. It is easy to forget, then, that Black creative verve and drive are not only, not even primarily, a response to white supremacy. And we forget at our own peril. Concerned with cataclysm, with crisis, with the spectacular, we do not attend to the ordinary and the everyday. In the past several years, phrases like \"Say Her Name\" and \"Trust Black Women\" have served as important calls to accountability against police violence, and against the ways the words and lives of Black women in particular are deemed inconsequential. But those phrases almost immediately lose focus, because in a misogynoiristic world, there is a refusal to think about and imagine Black women as more than raw material for sloganeering. We lose specificity: \"Say Her Name\" grows overshadowed by \"Say His Name\" and \"Say Their Names,\" such that even in death Black women cannot be held with care. \"Trust Black Women\" becomes a last-ditch effort for electoral political maneuvering, not a mandate to think with and alongside the beauty of Black women as thinkers. At this current moment of pandemic and protest, we are again called upon to refuse to forget: The sound of Black life is more than a rejoinder or rebuttal to white violence. It flowers. It unfolds. It provides safety and refuge. This moment, the ongoing time like this, is matched with the propulsion of Black livingness. Can you sense it, this propulsion, as sound and song? That is the sound of Twinkie Clark on the Hammond organ. Known since the early 1970s as the anchor for the famous gospel group The Clark Sisters, Twinkie is pedagogy: She is a way we can understand something about Black women and performing in an inhospitable place. She gives us the sound of flowering and blooming, not against white supremacy but as a practice of Black love. She is a way to understand what it means to write, and think, and consider, the sound of flowers at a time like this. Listening to her, I ask: Is there a way to say the names of Black women while they live, to trust in their capacity for thought and imagination? Could the soundtrack of Blackness be the sound of living in the along? And what can such a soundtrack teach us for these times, our times? I want to give flowers. At a time like this.

Propulsion is the word that always comes to mind. The doubled \"p\" sound, the rhythm of it, the way it increases in intensity as it is enunciated: pro-pul-sion. It is the word I use to describe Elbernita \"Twinkie\" Clark's musicianship, the way she writes lyrics, her chord changes on the Hammond, especially when she plays what is known in Blackpentecostal circles as \"shout\" music \u2014 music used in the practice of elaborate ecstatic praise. Her artistry drives, it propels, it pushes forward. Raised in the historic Church of God in Christ, the five original Clark Sisters \u2014 Jacqueline Clark Chisolm, Denise Clark Bradford, Elbernita \"Twinkie\" Clark, Dorinda Clark-Cole and Karen Clark-Sheard \u2014 were fashioned into a group by their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, emerging from Detroit in 1966. They began singing in churches, as Black musical groups did and do, but by the early 1980s, songs like \"You Brought the Sunshine\" could be heard both on gospel radio programs and in secular dance clubs. Their signature sound is found when their voices are closest together \u2014 in tight harmonies and in unison \u2014 as their mother compelled them to blend so well you can hardly distinguish one voice from another. They practiced and practiced and practiced, rigor and constraint the occasion for the flowering you can hear in songs like \"Is My Living in Vain\" and \"Expect Your Miracle.\" They are not the only group of their kind to cross over from gospel to the mainstream, but they are one of the most important. Their singing set an example for many who followed: Faith Evans, Mary J. Blige, Missy Elliott, Kim Burrell, so many more. But they are not just singers. In Twinkie Clark, we find a musician who transforms the mechanical object of the Hammond organ into a voice-like instrument, who can use the sounds of her sisters, their harmonic structure and pattern and dissent, as extensions of her own vocality. The way she plays is deeply personal and intimate but also curiously social and connective. What Hortense Spillers, in the essay Interstices: A Small Drama of Words, says of the Black female vocalist is instructive: \"To find another and truer sexual self-image the Black woman must turn to the domain of music and America's Black female vocalists, who suggest a composite figure of ironical grace.\" If we attend to Twinkie Clark as musician, we find the ironical grace of desiring to be made instrument in the service of something other than the self. Twinkie's voice is found in the flesh of the Hammond organ and the Leslie speaker, in the flesh of her sisters, in the sounds of Black praise. Her voice, her instrument, is propulsive. Her technique is instructive for how to live in, without always being responsive to, a time like this. Listen, for example, to the end of the recording \"Accept What God Allows\": how she coaxes the congregation and edges them on, how she encourages and pushes them between chord changes. It's as if she uses the organ and her speaking to break with normal temporality, and in such breaking, moves against the notion that crisis is the only temporality that organizes Black life. The way Twinkie Clark plays the organ is deeply immanent and about this material world, while also somehow sublime and transcendent of all that is. What we discover in her music, in other words, is a world in which responses to pandemics and policing are not the primary concerns for Black living. We discover a world organized by Black joy, Black pleasure and Black breath. The sound of the Clarks has been well known for decades in the church: Even before the first recordings of The Clark Sisters in the 1970s, Mattie Moss Clark used her daughters' songs to teach choral arrangements to congregations in the Church of God in Christ organization throughout the United States. But this spring, many more learned of their artistry by way of the Lifetime film The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel, which first aired April 11, 2020. Beautiful and moving, the film gives me a way to think about the unalterable importance of representing this family's lives with grace, care and complexity, like a song. Black church folks have had plenty of visibility in film and television, from The Blues Brothers and almost all of Tyler Perry's films to comedy shows like Martin, Living Single, Black-ish. Yet to me, these depictions always seem to show Black religiosity as fundamentally silly, inept, lacking in depth, thoughtfulness and care. We see comedic relief: lots of shouting and running and loud clapping and hallelujahs. And when serious, the religiosity manifests in a gendered \"soulfulness\" and \"wisdom,\" embodied by matriarchal characters who, curiously enough, lack character. Their children's bread is suffering, not of a structural kind but wrought from personal moral failures, and that suffering leads to redemption as the denouement. Lots of quoting scripture, little careful love. To treat Black religiosity seriously, these stories would need to honor the working-class Black church women at their centers. In most cases, they refuse. And because they deny such characters depth and development, they also deny us the sonic world these Black women create and sustain. The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel is the rare exception, a film that takes as its line and root the interior lives of Black church women who are talented, flawed, troubled, who are humorous and lively, holy and loved. We see, for example, the ironical grace of Mattie Moss Clark (played by Aunjanue Ellis), a Black church woman who knew her daughters were talented enough to move congregations and, yes, the world, in the ongoing time like this. And so she honed their craft as children, waking them in the middle of the night to teach them lyrics and harmonies. There is not anything natural or given about their sound: It took work to produce it. Their mother believed in and strove for and demanded excellence from them, even to a fault. Mattie Moss Clark, played by Aunjanue Ellis (foreground), leads her daughters and choir in the 2020 Lifetime film The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel.\n                \n                    \n                    Amanda Matlovich/A&E Networks\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mattie Moss Clark, played by Aunjanue Ellis (foreground), leads her daughters and choir in the 2020 Lifetime film The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel. The late nights, the sleepy days at school. Mattie Moss as choir director, throwing shoes at members who haven't learned their parts quickly enough. We see all of this onscreen. But we also see a Black church woman who protected her children and herself from her husband's physical and emotional abuse, who was willing to leave that house for her children's sake, who laughed with her daughters when they sang with her, who showed deep empathy even as she held fast to a holiness doctrine that sometimes made her appear simply mean. We see a mother who performs with The Clark Sisters at the Grammy Awards, even though the Church of God in Christ would deem the performance secular and sinful. And when the organization ultimately threatens her removal as its international minister of music if she continues, we see her give up performing with her daughters. What the film depicts with such lushness and care, with such vitality and concern, is that these are not perfect women. Denise (Raven Goodwin) is a sort of outcast, misunderstood by the family, but cared for deeply by her sister Twinkie (Christina Bell). Karen (Kierra Sheard, Karen's real-life daughter) is the youngest, the shy one, who has to be encouraged by her mother to break out into her own artistry by moving through fear. Jacky (Angela Birchett) holds a nursing job, anxious to provide for herself and her family and unsure if the group alone will support them. Twinkie, like her mother, endures domestic violence and struggles with self-esteem and depression. And Dorinda (Shel\u00e9a Frazier), too, struggles with depression and suicide ideation. This is not the capitalist consumptive model of Black excellence that often seems to function as a response to white supremacy. This is not an exceptionalist narrative of excellence, but is about Black life, Black living in the normal thick of things, in the everyday tensions that make worlds beautiful and flower. It is the kind of excellence \u2014 of the popular and regular, of labor and faith \u2014 that white supremacy responds to, not the other way around. I have not seen a piece of mass media attempt to show this texture, this arpeggio kinda life, for Black church women \u2014 ever. I cannot remember a film that takes such lives seriously enough to show complexity and contradiction, to depict care and concern, to make apparent difficulty and damage, to allow the rough edges of unresolved spiritual questions to emerge. If these women are strong, their strength is not the antithesis of weakness, not that ableist stereotype of the Strong Black Woman. If they are weak, it is not because they are unaware of their context, of the sexist, racist, capitalist world in which their music is created. The women we see onscreen are not heroic, they are human. And it is this that should be praised. Arpeggios, a kind of breaking apart of a chord in order to show its internal coherence and logic and structure, might be a good way to think about Black women and performance. Twinkie, the virtuoso organist, utilizes arpeggios in her playing often. Listen, for example, to how she breaks chords to their component parts in playing \"High Place.\" Look at the way she plays, but does not concentrate on, the mechanical object. Questions and concerns that animate playing the instrument well \u2014 Are these the right chord changes? How should I riff on that note? What texture should I use in my voice for that crescendo, that diminuendo? \u2014 are sort of backgrounded. She is never too caught up in the asking, because being so would interrupt the flow. I call it a \"holy nonchalance\": the way a skilled church musician has to know their instrument, how they have to have a deep intimacy with it, in order to be fully attentive to the complex interplay between the spirit moving and the saints. The musician must practice a kind of knowledge of their interior life that is in service of the external world. We can understand Twinkie's musicianship as a strategy, a way of living in the deep ambivalence religiosity produces for Black church women, who are marginalized by the very patriarchy, sexism, misogynoir that makes their work and struggle consequential. When discussing the discography of the Clark Sisters, people will speak most often of \"You Brought the Sunshine\" or \"Is My Living in Vain\" because they were crossover successes. But there's a song that I think captures the essence of Twinkie as musician, of the sisters and mother together as Black church women who teach us what the sound of Blackness is. \"A Praying Spirit,\" first recorded on their 1978 album Count It All Joy, illustrates the kind of contemplative practice of deep quietude and propulsion that animates Twinkie's musicianship. We often don't think about quietude and softness when talking about Black church women, especially from the Blackpentecostal tradition. But we should. It's all about the \"yes\": Lord give me a praying spiritA praying spiritLord help me to say yes (yes Lord)Yes, yes LordYes, yes LordYes, yes LordYes, yes Lord Blackpentecostalism might be said to have cultivated a practice and posture of this same \"yes.\" There is a passage of the Church of God in Christ hymnal, first published in 1982, that reads: \"Yes, Lord! The sound of this phrase bespeaks a high exaltation found in God. Since the inception of the Church of God in Christ, the praise 'Yes, Lord!' has carried a wealth of spiritual meaning. ... When the saints sing 'Yes Lord!' we are saying 'Yes' to God's will; 'Yes' to God's way; and 'Yes' to God's direction in our lives.\" What we find in this \"yes\" is an openness to life, a posture that accepts fragility and vulnerability. That is the practice of a holy nonchalance grounded in joy \u2014 not happiness necessarily, but a zest for life and breath, a kind of love for creaturely existence and a desire to share with others to alleviate suffering and harm, to carry burdens as a collective kind of care. This saying-yes is what you sense when folks scream, with masks on, gathered in streets during a time like this, \"BLACK. LIVES. MATTER.\" This is the propulsive force of protests during a pandemic, how one has to know their flesh in order to make their flesh instrument, implement, conduit, for otherwise possibility. It is a saying-yes to chance and opportunity. One has to notice, but figure out ways to negotiate, suffering. Gotta know it's there, but not get caught up in it. What is this but the attention to detail of form as a spiritual practice of delight? What is this but an attention to the complexity of flowers? Holy nonchalance is not innocence or indifference nor ignorance: It is fully aware of the context of its emergence. Twinkie makes herself into an instrument in order to move congregations to praise. But this practice ain't easy, and is often dangerous. Oluwatoyin Salau and Riah Milton knew something of the necessity for a holy nonchalance, a glance at the context of their livingness \u2014 the sexism, the misogynoir, the transphobia \u2014 and attempted to live a life in and against that context. We have to sense their voices, listen, be attentive to their sound even in the face of their violent and untimely deaths. A holy nonchalance, like Audre Lorde says of poetry, is not a luxury. It is urgent. Twinkie Clark will turn 66 this fall, near the end of a year that in addition to the Lifetime film has already included a new Clark Sisters album titled The Return, a livestreamed \"virtual experience\" concert and a featured appearance on PJ Morton's Gospel According to PJ. Though they have not always been the group they began as \u2014 Denise exited in the mid-1980s, their mother Mattie Moss died in 1994 and Twinkie spent years as a solo artist \u2014 the sisters remain foundational to the sounds of the Church of God in Christ, not only in terms of singing, but choral arrangements and organ playing and the very sound of Blackpentecostal preaching. Still, like so many Black church women, they are not considered to be models for a knowledge practice of which they are also foundation and cornerstone. We forget, because we do not consider the thinking and thought of Black church women. We reduce their work to style, failing to understand style as a kind of knowledge. We forget that this styling itself encapsulates the holy nonchalance of Black living, the saying-yes towards birth and breath. That it is a kind of protest that emerges from, even though it is not primarily about, a time like this. A holy nonchalance that glances at the momentary rupture while it sounds out alternatives to the norm. It has always been a time like this. In the midst of political and moral upheaval, protests against policing and the state, and a pandemic underscoring the racialized, classed hierarchies of difference, we are here again. And it is a holy nonchalance that will carry us through these times, that will allow us to cultivate delight as a spiritual practice. Black people do not exist only to respond to the violence of white supremacy. We are more.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday afternoon, the news came in that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, picked Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate. That makes her the first Black woman and the first South Asian woman to be on a major party ticket as vice president. It's a historic moment that underlines the themes of our episode this week, which is all about Black Democrats: Kamala Harris is a polarizing figure, especially within this voting bloc, and her selection isn't an automatic shoo-in for winning Black votes for Biden. Pundits talk a lot about how Black people are the base, even the heart of the Democratic party. It's common wisdom that in a presidential election, you have to win Black voters if you want to win the Democratic primary. There's a myth about Black voters, who are often considered as one big, happy family who all want the same things; at least, that's what Joe Biden suggested when he recently said that \"unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes.\" But the reality is that many Black Democrats want very different things. There's the KHive (Kamala lovers), and then there's the #KamalaIsACop constituency. (And in case you're confused, those people...don't like Kamala Harris.) So this week, we're tackling some of the messy conversations among Black Democrats, which have really come to the foreground in this monumental election cycle. To understand more about Black Dems, we talked to Chryl Laird, a political scientist at Bowdoin College. Along with Princeton Prof. Ismail K. White, she's the co-author of Steadfast Democrats: How Social Forces Shape Black Political Behavior. Below is an excerpt of what she told us, which has been condensed and edited for clarity. Can you give us a quick summary of what Steadfast Democrats is about? African-Americans heavily support the Democratic Party, at levels reaching 80 to 90%. We've seen that over time. And we were wondering, well, why is that? And our argument is that Democratic partisanship amongst African Americans is maintained through social networks. The partisanship isn't just about African Americans aligning with the party politics, but that the social connections that African Americans have also serve as motivation and a norm for how they participate in politics. Black voters are often called a \"captured constituency.\" Can you tell me more about what that means? That comes from the work of Paul Frymer from Princeton. It means that African Americans kind of are limited and constrained in their options politically. So in terms of how they would then support parties within this two party system, they're kind of stuck. They have to make a decision between these two parties in a way that is going to be a challenge, because one party is going to be the main one that speaks to their issues. And so people consider them captured by the Democratic Party, because they seem to be constrained in the options that they have politically. There's the idea that Black voters are just stuck there, and don't have a lot of leeway to move in any other direction. And I think that speaks somewhat to actual constraints, but it doesn't speak to the way that Black people are actually leveraging their political behavior and their collective behavior as a group. There are the systemic challenges that Black voters are going to be facing in making a choice, because of this two party system.But there's an awareness of what's going on, and African Americans are able to kind of work in a way that is deliberate and purposeful. The Democratic and Republican National Conventions are slated to happen in the next couple of weeks. And there have been a lot of prognostications about the way Black people would behave in the primaries. What do you think were the biggest myths about the ways Black folks vote? I think the biggest misconception was about the support for Joe Biden amongst African Americans, that African Americans didn't feel strongly about Joe Biden. And I feel like polling that was being done in the lead up to some of the primaries didn't have large enough African American samples to be able to determine what impact that was going to have. So I think there was an underestimation of Joe Biden's meaningfulness to a large constituency of Democratic voters. I think there was an underestimation of the influence those black voters would have. Were you surprised that someone like Elizabeth Warren didn't do better with black voters? No, because she was dealing with a challenge: She's a New England Democrat, so she is not as known to African Americans. I think she has party politics and policies that are appealing in a lot of ways. But I don't think she very much resonated. She seemed to have appeal among women, particularly educated women and white women\u2014and among some African American women with the same kind of educational background. But she has a bit of a distance from the group, and wasn't really able to get that to happen. In the primaries, we saw Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both attempting to make appeals to Black voters and having events where there were almost no Black people there, even though they were meant to be Black events. So they were trying, but they were up against a situation where Biden was already tapped into the social networks they wanted to tap into. There seems to be this generational divide among black Democrats. During the primaries, young Black people were basically begging their Boomer and Gen X parents to move away from Biden and pick more candidates like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. So what do you think Biden's nomination augurs for these younger black voters in November? I think he's going to deal with a turnout challenge among young voters. Youth turnout is always something that's waned a bit. At certain points, especially during the Obama years, we saw turnout at levels that we hadn't really seen before. But that still was not comparable to what we saw of older voters. So Biden is going to have a challenge with the mobilization of those young voters on his behalf. I think if a young voter is going to turn out, and they weren't a Biden supporter and are African-American, they will reluctantly vote for Biden. It's going to be an issue of getting those who are not as motivated to vote for him to turn out at all. Right now, the issues around Black Lives Matter is an opportunity for Biden to attempt to appeal to those voters, because those young people are a lot of the people who are being very vocal about what they want to change. And he has space here to show that he would be taking a more progressive stance on these types of policy issues. Thus far, he's made some comments that don't necessarily seem to indicate that he's there with them. But he could be willing to speak more about some of these issues, or he could speak about appointing people into positions to create overarching policy that would try to stem issues of police brutality and police violence. What might Biden's choice of a vice president mean for Black turnout in November? We don't actually have the data to predict what that would look like; we don't know what having a person of color on your ticket does for the mobilization of Black voters. But it signals a direction in Biden's politics that maybe people wouldn't believe he is embodying, except through symbolic rhetorical appeals. Black women are the Democratic party; wherever Black women go, so goes the party. They are the most loyal to the party, even when they themselves may not see representation that reflects themselves. They were there with Barack Obama, although he was a man. They were there with Hillary Clinton, more than any other racial group of women, even though she's white It could be even more energizing for Black women who are already very engaged, but they also have a very strong influence on others in the group. Black women don't just vote by themselves. They vote more with the collective in mind. That one Black woman can mobilize 10 other people to vote. They are the aunties. They are the mothers, the grandmothers; they are the people who are very revered in the community. Right. Like the matriarchal positioning of black women in the black community. They have been denied a lot of opportunities politically, due to patriarchy. But at the end of the day, they still turn out. They still mobilize, they still do the activism, even when they don't see themselves being represented.

            "article_content": "Four years ago, I was, thankfully, challenged to think more globally about Black Lives Matter. This was while on assignment covering the London Jazz Festival, just days following the election of our current president. During a conversation with my friend Nadia Gasper, a London-based writer and story consultant, she rightly pointed out that much of the then-recent galvanization and discourse around racial inequality in the United States had overlooked the rampant struggles for Blacks living elsewhere, namely in England. Jorja Smith puts a \"face\" to that very issue in the accompanying video for \"By Any Means,\" rather highlighting the many faces of color who comprise the U.K. The British singer-songwriter renders an evocative, all-encompassing anthem of empowerment, resilience and fortitude, felt by Black people everywhere. Released as the lead single from the forthcoming Reprise initiative that features songs curated by Roc Nation, Smith joins a host of artists lending their talents in solidarity with protestors and organizers worldwide, fighting for those who continue to face discrimination and brutality. Inspired by the words of Malcolm X in a speech he delivered during the last year of his life, Smith draws out the revolutionary spirit at the onset of \"By Any Means,\" challenging the many institutions and legacies designed to oppress and marginalize an entire people. With sparse production of rhythm and backing vocal effects, as the tune shifts mid-tempo, Smith finds strength in numbers, emboldened and aware that all are needed in this collective battle: \"I take pride in the things that we've done / Side by side in the revolution / Won't stay silent for things that I love / 'Cause we know dem nuh care about us.\" We Insist: A Timeline Of Protest Music In 2020Previous Song  |  Next Song&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp",

Jones is the founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that conducts research on issues at the intersection of religion, culture and politics.\n                \n                    \n                    Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption Robert P. Jones is the founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that conducts research on issues at the intersection of religion, culture and politics. Growing up in Texas and Mississippi, author Robert P. Jones was a very active member of his Southern Baptist Convention church. Between youth group, Bible studies and prayer services, he spent about 6-7 hours each week at church or doing church related things. But in all that time, he never really heard about the church's history \u2014 including the fact that Southern Baptists split from the North around 1844 because the Northern Baptists opposed slavery. \"I was 20 years old before I got a hint of that history ... and even had the possibility of beginning to think about what the implications of that were,\" Jones says. In his new book, White Too Long, Jones examines the legacy of white supremacy among Southern Baptists and other Christian denominations. Jones says the Southern Baptist Convention tends to focus on each individual's interior relationship with God \u2014 and \"essentially screens out questions of social justice.\" \"I cannot remember a single sermon calling attention to racial inequality, racial injustice [or] the struggle for civil rights,\" he says. As the U.S. begins to grapple more seriously with issues of racism and white supremacy, Jones says the time has come for churches to be more in vocal about social justice. \"There's so much work still to be done,\" he says. \"White Christians have been largely silent ... and have hardly begun these conversations.\" White Too Long, by Robert P. Jones\n                \n                    \n                    Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption White Too Long, by Robert P. Jones On how the Southern Baptist Convention split from the North around 1844 because of slavery The precipitating event was really whether someone who was being called as a missionary to spread the gospel could simultaneously be a slave owner and still be a church member in good standing. And the members of the churches in the South actually put this issue forward very intentionally, to test what their Northern brethren would say about this. And the North responded very clearly, and Northern Baptists said, \"No, you know, under no circumstances will we be behind this.\" And that really was the precipitating split. And just a few short months later, the Southern Baptist Convention was formed very intentionally with the word \"Southern\" and the front of it to indicate its allegiance really to this slave-owning society. On how the Southern Baptist Convention used the Bible to justify slavery The slave owning argument really had more of the Bible on its side, at least read literally. You know, there's plenty of things to point to in the Bible where there's slavery mentioned [and] it's not condemned. The whole book of Philemon in the New Testament ... talks about slaves obeying their masters and even returning to their masters, a slave who's escaped is commended to return to slavery. And so the more straightforward arguments out of the Bible were simply there. And then read into that, I think, also was this idea of white supremacy, ... that God's design for human society was that whites of European descent would really be the vanguard of society, and at the top of society. And their goal was to \"civilize\" everyone else from their place at the top of the political and cultural hierarchy. On how the Southern Baptist Church maintained its stance after the Confederacy lost The term that historians use is ... \"lost cause religion,\" and that sounds like an admission of loss, but what that term really means, it was not at all a concession. It was really about keeping these embers burning, and this idea that ... from the ashes of defeat there would still be a rise of the South and a rise of victorious Southern religion. And you can see this in the Confederate monuments, for example, that sense of: Yes, political defeat, military defeat, but not really admitting a kind of religious and cultural defeat. ... Again, it was about this idea that God was still behind this vision of society. On how some Northern churches imposed segregation even after the Civil War the Catholic Church had long had a practice of African Americans sitting in the back. [They] couldn't come and take part of the Eucharist until all the white members had done so. Robert P. Jones It wasn't just in Southern evangelical churches or Baptist churches. ... Even when [the Methodists] admitted African American churches into the larger Methodist denomination, they segregated them into one jurisdiction. It was essentially a version of religious gerrymandering so that they would get one bishop instead of possibly competing for power in other jurisdictions; they were all locked into one jurisdiction, so their voice inside the denomination will be smaller. And even among white Catholics, the Catholic Church had long had a practice of African Americans sitting in the back. [They] couldn't come and take part of the Eucharist until all the white members had done so. New York, for example, did the same thing, and actually segregated the African American Catholics into a single parish and also made only one Catholic school available to African Americans and made it a segregated school. And these practices continued in the middle of the 20th century, even even among Catholics in the North. On the contradictions within white churches that supported the civil rights movement The United Methodist building here in Washington, D.C., was the staging ground and playing a lot of supporting roles for the March on Washington in 1963. The Christian Century, the kind of flagship magazine of the mainline Protestant world, was the place where Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail was originally published. He was on the editorial board of essentially this white mainline Protestant magazine. So there's certainly very prominent figures, places that showed up and helped in organizing, but [also] this huge gap between the official statements, leaders who showed up in those things, and the vast majority of folks on the ground. At the same time The Christian Century is publishing A letter from Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King and his wife apply for their son, Martin Luther King III, to attend a private Episcopalian school in Atlanta. And he's turned down on the basis of race. At the same time there's a very mainline denomination helping support the march on Washington ... another wing is denying his [son's] admission to a school on the basis of race. It's a very mixed bag. ... The symbolic things that were done and even courageous leaders that were out in the front of the civil rights movement never quite fully brought the great bulk of people in the pews with them.

As of Friday, 15 of the top 20 bestselling books on Amazon were about race or racism. Earlier this week, Code Switch was number one on Apple Podcasts \u2014 which, as host Gene Demby said, is \"dope,\" but unfortunately occurred under \"soul-crushing circumstances.\" And The Help is trending on Netflix (ahem, a film that drew immediate ire upon release). We're in the middle of one of those awfully predictable news cycles \u2014 a video of police killing a black person goes viral, protests ensue and broader America suddenly realizes we need to talk about race. Of course, while this week has happened before, it's also happening on a much larger scale than ever before, with demonstrations in all 50 states. To help people be better allies, lists of antiracist books, films and podcasts are being published in droves. There's never a bad time to learn, but such a list can become erroneously prescriptive, a balm to centuries-old lacerations that cut deeper than the individual reader. As Lauren Michele Jackson wrote for Vulture, \"The word [anti-racism] and its nominal equivalent, \"anti-racist,\" suggests something of a vanity project, where the goal is no longer to learn more about race, power, and capital, but to spring closer to the enlightened order of the antiracist.\" So, with that in mind, we've compiled a list of books, films and podcasts about systemic racism, acknowledging that they are just books, films and podcasts. You'll find research on how racism permeates everything from the criminal justice system to health care. We hope you spend some time with these resources (and that you listen to Code Switch \u2014 here's a list of episodes to get you started). Information is power \u2014 you decide what you do with it. Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race by Beverly Daniel Tatum This classic text on the psychology of racism was re-released with new content in 2017, 20 years after its original publication. By providing straight talk on self-segregation and inequality in schools, Tatum shows the importance \u2014 and possibility \u2014 of cross-racial dialogues starting young. Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor A finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in History, Race for Profit chronicles how the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 failed to stop racist, exploitative mortgage lending practices. Since the policy was supposed to be a balm to the 1960s uprisings \u2014 much like the ones we're seeing now \u2014 it serves as a reminder to remain vigilant when policymakers promise change. A Terrible Thing To Waste: Environmental Racism And Its Assault On The American Mind by Harriet A. Washington From lead poisoning to toxic waste, Americans of color are disproportionately harmed by environmental hazards. This is detrimental to physical health \u2014 air pollution is linked with higher COVID-19 death rates, according to Harvard researchers. But Washington also argues that environmental racism is causing cognitive decline in communities of color. A deconstruction of IQ and an indictment of EPA rollbacks, A Terrible Thing To Waste is a stirring read. From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America by Elizabeth Hinton The origins of mass incarceration \u2014 which disproportionately puts black people behind bars \u2014 are often pinned on Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. But Hinton argues the carceral state was erected \"by a consensus of liberals and conservatives who privileged punitive responses to urban problems as a reaction to the civil rights movement.\" The 1965 Law Enforcement Assistance Act, part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society plan, led to today's police militarization. This account of history poses relevant questions for today's land of the free. Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police and Punish the Poor by Virginia Eubanks Algorithms are made by humans, so they are susceptible to human biases. From deciding which neighborhoods get policed to who gets welfare benefits, discrimination has gone digital. By scrutinizing statistical models and telling personal stories, Eubanks shows that machines do not correct racist systems \u2014 they only shift blame. The End of Policing by Alex S. Vitale In the wake of high-profile cases of police brutality, the same ideas for reform are trotted out \u2014 implicit bias training, body cameras, police-community dialogues. But Vitale argues that this fails to get to the root of the problem \u2014 policing itself. While calls to abolish the police are often met with skepticism, academics and activists have long-discussed alternatives to addressing homelessness, domestic disputes and substance abuse. A free ebook of The End of Policing is available now. (And you can read Code Switch editor extraordinaire Leah Donnella's conversation with Vitale here.) Blackballed: The Black Vote and U.S. Democracy by Darryl Pinckney As young Americans take to the streets to say black lives matter, they're often told to vote. While voting is important, it's also important to remember how black political representation has been chipped away by voter ID laws, gerrymandering and felon disenfranchisement. Blackballed addresses the struggle for voting rights and for racial equality more broadly, drawing on Pinckney's own experiences and writings of civil rights leaders to create a complicated picture of black political identity. Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class by Ian Haney L\u00f3pez \"Entitlement mentality.\" \"Quotas.\" \"Welfare queens.\" From Barry Goldwater to Bill Clinton to the Tea Party, politicians have relied on racially coded language to win over white voters and decimate social programs. Dog Whistle Politics makes the case that not only does this strategy endanger people of color, but it also hinders economic mobility for all Americans. Medical Bondage: Race, Gender, and the Origins of American Gynecology by Deirdre Cooper Owens The foundational knowledge of American gynecology relied on the exploitation of enslaved black women's bodies. In Medical Bondage, Cooper Owens centers the stories of black women that have been overshadowed by the \"discoveries\" of white male doctors who experimented on them. Baseless theories about black inferiority and higher pain tolerance still permeate medical schools today. Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight against Medical Discrimination by Alondra Nelson The Black Panther Party is most remembered for its militant action, but health care was also a major pillar of its activism. The People's Free Medical Clinics tested for hypertension and assisted with housing and employment. Its outreach also brought attention to rampant discrimination within mainstream medicine. Nelson writes that the Black Panther Party understood health as a human right, echoing today's fight for universal health care. You can read Body and Soul online for free. 13th The U.S. imprisons more people than any other country in the world, and a third of U.S. prisoners are black. In this infuriating documentary, director Ava DuVernay argues that mass incarceration, Jim Crow and slavery are \"the three major racialized systems of control adopted in the United States to date.\" I Am Not Your Negro Narrated by the words of James Baldwin with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson, I Am Not Your Negro connects the Civil Rights Movement to Black Lives Matter. Although Baldwin died nearly 30 years before the film's release, his observations about racial conflict are as incisive today as they were when he made them. Whose Streets? The 2014 killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Mo. was one of the deaths that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Frustrated by media coverage of unrest in Ferguson, co-directors Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis documented how locals felt about police in riot gear filling their neighborhoods with tear gas. As one resident says, \"They don't tell you the fact that the police showed up to a peaceful candlelight vigil...and boxed them in, and forced them onto a QuikTrip lot.\" LA 92 LA 92 is about the Los Angeles riots that occurred in response to the police beating of Rodney King. The film is entirely comprised of archival footage \u2014 no talking heads needed. It's chilling to watch the unrest of nearly 30 years ago, as young people still take to the streets and shout, \"No justice, no peace.\" Teach Us All Over 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education, American schools are still segregated. Teach Us All explains why that is \u2014 school choice, residential segregation, biased admissions processes \u2014 and talks to advocates working for change. Interspersing interviews from two Little Rock Nine members, the documentary asks how far we've really come. Black America Since MLK: And Still I Rise In this two-part series, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. chronicles the last 50 years of black history through a personal lens. Released days after the 2016 election, some themes of the documentary took on a deeper meaning amid Donald Trump's win. \"Think of the civil rights movement to the present as a second Reconstruction \u2014 a 50-year Reconstruction \u2014 that ended last night,\" Gates said in an interview with Salon. Floodlines from The Atlantic An audio documentary about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Floodlines is told from the perspective of four New Orleanians still living with the consequences of governmental neglect. As COVID-19 disproportionately infects and kills Americans of color, the story feels especially relevant. \"As a person of color, you always have it in the back of your mind that the government really doesn't care about you,\" said self-described Katrina overcomer Alice Craft-Kerney. 1619 from The New York Times \"In August of 1619, a ship carrying more than 20 enslaved Africans arrived in the English colony of Virginia. America was not yet America, but this was the moment it began.\" Hosted by recent Pulitzer Prize winner Nikole Hannah-Jones, the 1619 audio series chronicles how black people have been central to building American democracy, music, wealth and more. Intersectionality Matters! from The African American Policy Forum Hosted by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a leading critical race theorist who coined the term \"intersectionality,\" this podcast brings the academic term to life. Each episode brings together lively political organizers, journalists and writers. This recent episode on COVID-19 in prisons and other areas of confinement is a must-listen. Throughline from NPR Every week at Throughline, our pals Rund Abdelfatah and Ramtin Arablouei \"go back in time to understand the present.\" To understand the history of systemic racism in America, we recommend \"American Police,\" \"Mass Incarceration\" and \"Milliken v.

The coronavirus has in recent days edged closer to President Trump. At least two White House aides who've been in proximity to the president and the vice president have tested positive for COVID-19. Because of that, three key members of the Trump administration's pandemic response team are quarantining themselves: Drs. Robert Redfield, Stephen Hahn and Anthony Fauci. Redfield is head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hahn heads up the Food and Drug Administration and Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the nation's top infectious disease expert. All three, plus the assistant secretary for health, Dr. Brett Giroir, are slated to testify before a key Senate committee Tuesday. The hearing, which is ironically titled \"COVID-19: Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School,\" will now be done via video conference. The chair of that committee, Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, is also self-quarantining. His office announced Sunday night that a member of the staff tested positive for COVID-19. Alexander will chair Tuesday's hearing from Tennessee. In recent days, Alexander has said that the coronavirus testing the United States has done so far is \"not nearly enough,\" and \"there is no safe path forward to combat the novel coronavirus without adequate testing.\" Trump has touted the overall number of tests that have been conducted in the country \u2014 now more than 8 million. But at times he's read a different message in them. \"If we did very little testing, [America] wouldn't have the most cases,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.\" And Trump's reservations about testing appear to be rooted in politics. Trump said Friday he believes some Democrats hope the economy doesn't bounce back. \"I will tell you, you look at some cases, some people think they're doing it for politics,\" Trump said on Fox News Channel. \"Here we go again. But they think they're doing it because it'll hurt me, the longer it takes to \u2014 hurt me in the election, the longer it takes to open up.\" But Trump's focus on how the pandemic makes him and the nation look doesn't get the country closer to being prepared and able to live with the coronavirus. \"We have to figure out how to live with this virus, and that's what we're not doing,\" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. On the White House schedule Monday: a press briefing about testing. 1. Climbing coronavirus death toll: The confirmed number of Americans who have now died from the coronavirus is about 80,000. At a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 deaths per day, the U.S. would surpass 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 between May 21 and May 31. The country's curve has plateaued, but it appears to have a long tail. And that flattening is masked by New York and New Jersey's daily new cases coming down, because new cases are on the rise in other places. Loading... 2. Those CDC guidelines for reopening: If you're wondering why \u2014 despite access to some of the top scientists in the world \u2014 there haven't been clearer and more detailed reopening guidelines for states, businesses and religious institutions coming from the federal government, you're not alone. And now we know why: The White House buried them. The guidelines from the CDC were shelved, the AP reported. Following the publication of the report, CDC Director Redfield issued a statement that appeared to run contrary to his published internal emails. He took responsibility and said the document was \"shared prematurely,\" \"was in draft form and had not been vetted through the interagency review process.\" Because of that, Redfield added, he \"was not yet comfortable releasing a final work product.\" Will the CDC release new guidelines at some point now that this is out there? 3. Will the White House push for another relief package \u2014 or not? White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNN's State of the Union Sunday that another relief package would be \"premature\" given the others that have already passed and trillions total in aid. \"We think that we have a little moment, the luxury of a moment, to learn about what's going on so that the next step that we take can be prudent.\" Luxury of a moment? The country on Friday hit its highest unemployment rate, 14.7%, since the Great Depression, most economists think that number is actually higher, and Americans lost a whopping 20 million jobs \u2014 in one month. 4. U.S. Supreme Court on religious freedom, Trump's financial records and faithless electors: People may be home, but the Supreme Court justices are working \u2014 even if remotely. On Monday, the court considers arguments about whether lay teachers at parochial schools are protected from discrimination or whether the schools can have carte blanche in hiring and firing. On Tuesday, it's Trump's financial records and whether Congress has the power to subpoena records from when before Trump was president \u2014 and whether those can be used in a potential criminal investigation. On Wednesday, the quirky Electoral College system sees a challenge. Electors are actually people, and sometimes they don't go the way their state voted. The court considers whether that's OK. For everyone's sake, let's hope those mute buttons are working better this week, especially close to any toilets. 5. Will Bright be reinstated? Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a key agency in vaccine development, will testify before a House committee Thursday. It comes after he filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration for being dismissed from his position, he says, for sounding alarms about the coronavirus early on and expressing opposition to unproven treatments favored by Trump. Bright's lawyers say the Office of Special Counsel has made a determination that he was dismissed for retaliation and should be temporarily reinstated while the office investigates. Trump has ignored the same office's recommendations before, but Bright's case will continue to be in the public eye, especially this week \u2014 and as the pandemic fallout continues. \"It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset \u2014 of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' \u2014 when that mindset is operationalized in our government.\" \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on the Trump administration's coronavirus response.

At the heart of a story now playing out in schools, workplaces and courts across the U.S. is a disagreement over the legal meaning of the word \"sex\" \u2014 and whether discrimination against gay and transgender people for being gay or transgender is sex discrimination. The White House has a particular kind of power over this question. It has the power to interpret whether LGBTQ people are protected by sex discrimination protections in laws passed by Congress, to issue rules and policies that reflect that interpretation, and \u2014 through those actions \u2014 the power to send a message to the country. In the last several years, two White House administrations have used this power in diametrically opposite ways. LGBTQ activists and their allies say it feels like civil rights \"whiplash.\" Take, for instance, the Obama administration's guidance to schools on transgender students that came out in the spring of 2016. It required schools to protect transgender students from harassment, accommodate their preferred names and pronouns, and give them access to the locker rooms and bathrooms of their choice. Sasha Buchert clearly remembers the relief she felt when that guidance came out. At the time, she was an attorney with the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, Calif., tracking these issues closely, and watching as the country became consumed with what the New York Times editorial board referred to as \"trans bathroom hysteria.\" Earlier that year, a bill called HB2 had passed in North Carolina requiring people to use the bathrooms that matched their birth certificate. During debate on that bill in the North Carolina statehouse, Buchert listened to the untelevised special session from her office in Oakland \u2014 it was 4 a.m. on the West Coast. \"It passed and my heart just sank,\" she says. Attorney Sasha Buchert now works for Lambda Legal, in Washington, D.C., on LGBTQ federal policy and litigation.\n                \n                    \n                    Max Posner/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attorney Sasha Buchert now works for Lambda Legal, in Washington, D.C., on LGBTQ federal policy and litigation. The law sparked protests and a national financial backlash against North Carolina: PayPal decided not to bring 400 jobs to the state, Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert, and the National Basketball Association moved its All-Star Game out of the state. At the same time, Virginia teenager Gavin Grimm's lawsuit against his county school board for its policy on transgender students was headed for the Supreme Court. As he explained to NPR at the time, \"The alternative facility was a unisex bathroom. I'm not unisex. I'm a boy.\" More and more personal stories from young transgender people flooded the news, including one about a 9-year-old who said she was \"really mad and sad,\" to have an anonymous note slipped into her homework folder that read: \"You're a boy not a girl get it throu your head.\" When the Obama education department issued its federal guidance to schools in May of that year, Buchert felt empathy and relief \u2014 first of all \u2014 for young transgender people around the country, she says. \"There are real people \u2014 real trans people \u2014 who are suffering discrimination, not going to the bathroom, skipping gym class. Those kinds of discriminatory conditions can have a lifelong impact on these youth.\" She says she also felt relief on behalf of the schools around the country that needed clarity. \"I don't think that all schools have deep-seated animus towards transgender people,\" Buchert says. \"I think they're just confused and they don't know what their liabilities are, what they're required to do under the law. The guidance was helpful for them \u2014 it clarified what their duties and responsibilities are.\" Krys Didtrey, left, and Gloria Merriweather, center, led chants in a Raleigh, N.C., statehouse protest in 2016 in opposition to HB2, a state law that, in effect, required people to only use designated bathrooms that matched the sex on their birth certificate.

The law was repealed in 2017. One thing she did not feel was that the White House was creating new law, or acting on an activist agenda. \"It was based on existing law,\" she says. Buchert had studied the legal history years earlier, as a newly out transgender lawyer living in Washington, D.C. \"I would go to the American University Law School and just read through the case law and just try to get a better idea about trans rights,\" she says. Though the U.S. had a history of discrimination, Buchert realized, \"there is just so much case law holding that trans people are protected\" when it comes to discrimination on the basis of \"sex.\" The Obama administration's school guidance \u2014 in her view \u2014 was correctly applying that existing law. Ryan Anderson's reaction at the time was very different. He's a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and he's written books about religious liberty, gender and marriage. \"This was the executive branch of government making new law, which violates separation of powers,\" he says of the Obama White House's 2016 guidance to schools on transgender issues. Anderson also felt the guidance only considered the needs of transgender students. \"It didn't take into consideration the concerns of other students \u2014 whether that would be female athletes who have concerns [about] competing against boys who identify as girls, whether that's female students have concerns about privacy and bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms, etc.\" Sudden policy reversals under Trump The turnabout from the Trump administration came quickly. In February 2017, just a few weeks after President Trump's inauguration, his administration rescinded the transgender student guidance. Weeks after that, because of the reversal, the Supreme Court took transgender plaintiff Gavin Grimm's case off its calendar.

Obama's policies in regards to Iran, the Paris Climate Accord, many environmental regulations and more have also been reversed. Much of that was telegraphed in campaign promises. But the reversals on LGBTQ rights and protections were not, Buchert says. \"It did shock me,\" she says, \"that this was one of the first things they decided they needed to move on.\" Before President Trump came into office, he seemed to be moving in a different direction on these issues \u2014 vowing \"to protect our LGBTQ citizens\" in his convention speech, and posing with a rainbow flag while campaigning. Trumps reversal of Obama's transgender student guidance was just the first \"warning shot,\" Buchert says, that the courtship of LGBTQ voters ended with the campaign, and as president, Trump planned to move aggressively to roll back LGBTQ protections. For Anderson, Trump's pivot was no surprise. Despite the signals that he might be friendly to the LGBTQ community, Anderson says, \"the general stance that Trump had taken was, 'Look, I'm going to be a friend to social conservatives. I'm going to be a friend to evangelicals and Catholics.' \" Rolling back Obama's transgender student guidance was a priority for those groups, Anderson says. Plus, he adds, rescinding the guidance was simply a return to how things had been less than a year before. \"I don't think that's a particularly extreme, outrageous, controversial position to hold.\" More reversals soon followed. In July 2017, Trump tweeted that transgender people could no longer serve in the military. Buchert, a veteran who served as a scout sniper in the Marine Corps, says she found that particular policy change \"extremely insulting.\" In October of 2017, then Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo that the U.S. Department of Justice would no longer argue in court that transgender people are federally protected from employment discrimination. By that point, Buchert had packed up her belongings and moved to Washington D.C. to work for Lambda Legal on LGBTQ federal policy and litigation, so she could \"be in the fight.\" Behind all of these reversals is the Trump administration's position that being gay or transgender is a category of identity that is different from \"biological sex,\" and therefore not protected under current law \u2014 a complete about-face from the position taken by the Obama administration. \"It deeply concerns me as a transgender person that they're going after our protections, placing our lives at risk. But it's also offensive as an attorney,\" Buchert says. \"They just are willfully ignoring the rule of law.\" For instance, she points out the department of Justice memo on transgender people and employment discrimination cites a dissent in a sexual orientation case, which she calls \"very, very sketchy justification.\" Transgender Army veteran Tanya Walker addressed protesters in New York's Times Square on July 26, 2017. The demonstrators had gathered near a military recruitment center, angry at Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Buchert knows that most transgender people are not reading and analyzing these memos and rules as legal documents. What they are hearing, she says, is the message that they're not protected by the federal government and that they should be afraid. Buchert emphasizes there are many years of judicial cases establishing the protections and rights of transgender people. \"We've tried very hard to reassure people that those protections still exist and we'll keep fighting for you,\" she says. As an attorney working on these issues, she says it's \"hard not to carry the weight.\" \"I keep hoping our country is better than this,\" she says. A failed 'poison pill' in a landmark law To better understand the history of sex discrimination and U.S. law, a good place to start is a major piece of legislation that established broad protections for many vulnerable groups: the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \"The original Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination based on race, color, national origin, etc., but did not include discrimination based on sex,\" says law professor Samuel Bagenstos of the University of Michigan. \"Sex\" was added to Title VII \u2014 the part of the law that prohibits employment discrimination \u2014 in an amendment put forward in late stages of debate of the bill that became the Civil Rights Act. The group behind the amendment was what Bagenstos calls a \"weird coalition\" of Southern conservatives (who believed the word would be a \"poison pill\" that would doom the whole bill) and women's rights advocates (who thought it was an important and necessary protection). \"Obviously, the people who calculated that adding 'sex' would sink the bill were wrong,\" Bagenstos notes.\" 'Sex' got added, and the bill got passed anyway.\" Still, even though it was on the books, sex-based discrimination initially was viewed as \"kind of a joke,\" Bagenstos says. \"It really took a lot of work by social movement actors within the feminist movement to organize and mobilize and bring cases \u2014 and bring political pressure \u2014 so that by the end of the 1960s, both the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and the courts were beginning to recognize the prohibition on sex discrimination was something serious.\" Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, says when it comes to LGBTQ people, if you took a time machine back to the year the law first passed \u2014 1964 \u2014 you'd find a \"pretty bleak\" legal landscape. \"There isn't a state-wide anti-discrimination law that protected LGBTQ people [at that time],\" Kreis says. \"There's no relationship recognition for same sex couples. And trans people are targeted \u2014 because many municipalities had anti cross-dressing laws.\" It didn't take long for people involved in the growing gay rights movement to begin considering how the protection against discrimination on the basis of \"sex\" might impact them, Kreis says. \"In 1966, there was a protest at Julius's Bar in Manhattan \u2014 the bar, citing state regulators, refused to serve these openly gay men,\" Kreis says. \"And at the time, the chairman of what's essentially the New York City's version of the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, suggested that this was a form of sex discrimination \u2014 and this is only two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.\" In the 1970s and 1980s, gay and transgender people began to file lawsuits making this argument, Kreis says, but it took decades before judges began to side with them. Two important Supreme Court decisions set the foundation for their arguments. The first was Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins in 1989. Ann Hopkins was not promoted to partner at the firm because those in charge thought her too aggressive and not feminine enough. (One partner at the firm advised her, she says, that if she wanted a promotion, she should \"walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup and jewelry, have my hair styled.\") Ann Hopkins, pictured with her children, was the plaintiff in a landmark case about sex-discrimination in the workplace \u2014 Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. The Supreme court ruled in 1989 that \"sex stereotyping\" \u2014 discriminating against someone for not conforming to gender-based expectations \u2014 is a form of sex discrimination.\n                \n                    \n                    Lucian Perkins/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ann Hopkins, pictured with her children, was the plaintiff in a landmark case about sex-discrimination in the workplace \u2014 Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. The Supreme court ruled in 1989 that \"sex stereotyping\" \u2014 discriminating against someone for not conforming to gender-based expectations \u2014 is a form of sex discrimination. The court ruled that \"sex stereotyping\" \u2014 discriminating against someone for not conforming to gender-based expectations \u2014 was a form of sex discrimination. Then, another landmark decision emerged from the high court in 1998: In Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., Joseph Oncale claimed that he had been harassed on the basis of sex by his male co-workers on an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The court ruled unanimously that this did constitute sex discrimination. Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the decision, made a crucial point: \"Male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws, rather than the principal concerns of our legislators, by which we are governed.\" LGBTQ advocates have built on that argument, Bagenstos of the University of Michigan explains. \"In 1964, maybe no one was thinking about this law protecting gays and lesbians and transgender individuals \u2014 they may not have had all the same words to describe actually the kind of discrimination at issue here that we do now,\" he says. \"But they wrote a law that said if you're treated less well because of your sex, that is unlawful. And these are people who are being treated less-well because of their sex.\" Today, the argument attorneys for LGBTQ people are making goes something like this: \"If you're fine with Jane coming to work as Jane, but you have a problem with Jane coming to work as Joe, the only thing that's changed is the sex,\" explains Buchert of Lambda Legal. \"Or if Jane has a picture of her husband on her desk and you're fine with that, but she puts a picture of her wife on her desk and you have a problem with that \u2014 that's a sex-based consideration.\" The counterargument from the Trump administration and its allies is that someone's sex refers to whether they are a man or a woman, and that even if discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is unjust, it's not sex discrimination \u2014 and is currently not legally protected. To illustrate this idea, Anderson from Heritage uses the example of how Caitlyn Jenner, a celebrity who is transgender, might experience sex discrimination in applying for a job: \"Someone could say, I think you're really a man and therefore I'm not going to hire you because only women can do this sort of work, or I think you're a woman and I won't hire you because only men can do this sort of work.\" In either of those cases, Anderson argues, \"Caitlyn is still protected against sex discrimination. But if someone was to say, 'Oh, I won't hire you because you're trans,' that's not a statutory protection that Congress has chosen to enact.\" A need for clarity In the early days of the Obama administration, Bagenstos worked in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, and says it was a clear priority within the White House to \"try and see where \u2014 within existing law \u2014 they could extend more protections against discrimination to LGBT individuals.\" It started around 2011, when officials in the Obama administration's Employment Equal Opportunity Commission decided they needed to make a clarifying call on the question of whether \"sex\" encompassed sexual orientation and gender identity. The story of this process is laid out in an amicus brief in three employment discrimination cases currently before the Supreme Court \u2014 a brief submitted by federal officials who worked in the Obama administration. In the brief, they write: \"The evolving and increasingly confused case law, and escalating need to address real, ongoing discrimination, prompted the EEOC and several Departments to undertake deep and detailed analyses of whether the prior exclusionary approaches to Title VII and similar laws were correct.\" After creating an LGBT working group and doing careful analysis, the EEOC concluded that sexual orientation and gender identity \"are intrinsically subsets of sex and, thus, are squarely covered by Title VII's prohibition of discrimination based on sex.\" Other departments and agencies around the same time were coming to the same conclusion. In 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote in a memorandum: \"I have determined that the best reading of Title VII's prohibition of sex discrimination is that it encompasses discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status.\" In 2016, the Defense Secretary announced that transgender servicemembers could serve openly. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Health and Human Services, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development all issued rules and policies in the same vein in those years. Destiny, transgender and, at the time, homeless, talked with a friend near a Chicago homeless shelter in 2011. The Trump administration has proposed reversing an Obama-era rule that requires homeless shelters to house transgender people according to their gender identities.\n                \n                    \n                    David Pierini/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This was part of a systematic effort across the executive branch. \"One of the principles that has heretofore governed government policy is that the government should speak with one voice,\" says Jocelyn Samuels, who directed the HHS Office for Civil Rights in the Obama years, and now runs the Williams Institute, a LGBTQ think tank at the UCLA School of Law. The collective efforts were painstaking, she says. \"The agencies involved took a very careful look at the language of each statute underlying the programs, at the legislative history and at the case law,\" she says, in coming to the conclusion that sexual orientation and gender identity were legally protected. That process stretched beyond Title VII and employment discrimination to include, for instance, sex discrimination in health care, as outlined in Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, and sex discrimination in schools in Title IX of the of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Buchert says the work happening in the federal government was \"the culmination of a lot of advocacy that had been done and a lot of recognition that trans people exist,\" she says. \"That visibility also brings along with it a lot of opposition.\" A 'tit for tat' response Under the Trump Administration, each of these policies has been rolled back or rescinded, one by one. \"The Obama administration was working to advance LGBTQ rights within the scope of what the law permitted,\" says Anthony Kreis, the law professor who studies LGBTQ discrimination. \"The Trump administration is \u2014 tit for tat \u2014 going back and trying to reverse-engineer every single one of those advances.\" Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Kreis says it's created a feeling of \"whiplash\" between the Obama andTrump administrations, especially in the context of Trump's signals early on that he would be more supportive of LGBTQ rights than past Republican presidents. The Trump administration does not just demonstrate \"a resistance or passivity towards LGBTQ rights,\" Kreis says. \"It's openly hostile in a way that I don't think anyone really quite could have predicted.\" Buchert describes the reversals as \"hurtful and infuriating.\" She adds that the administration has also, in her view, appointed many anti-LGBTQ judges, and has made moves to stop collecting data on LGBTQ people in a \"drive to erase LGBT people from from the record.\" Evidence for those charges was detailed in a report last year by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that advocates for openness in government. Jocelyn Samuels \u2014 the former HHS director \u2014 says watching the current administration undo the work that she and other officials labored over is \"heartbreaking, because it stands to put vulnerable people at risk across a whole spectrum of activities in which they should be able to engage without fear of discrimination.\" The Trump White House pushes back on the notion that President Trump is against gay or transgender people. \"President Trump has never considered LGBT Americans second class citizens, and has opposed discrimination of any kind against them,\" White House spokesperson Judd Deere tells NPR in an emailed statement. He notes Trump's participation in Washington's Pride activities last year, and that the president has hired and promoted White House staff who are gay, and pushed for international decriminalization of homosexuality. The Trump administration has also launched a plan to end the HIV epidemic \u2014 \"a commitment that, when achieved, will save LGBT lives across the country,\" Deere says. Anderson adds that the Trump administration's reversals are \"entirely appropriate.\" If you have determined, as the Trump administration has, that Obama overstepped the authority of the executive branch and misinterpreted the meaning of sex discrimination, Anderson says, \"then all of the various actions that the Obama administration took where it interpreted the word sex as gender identity were unlawful. So going back to the original meaning of the word isn't a 'tit for tat,' it's a restoring \u2014 upholding the rule of law.\" What's next from Congress and the Supreme Court Will these legal reversals on protections for LGBTQ people continue to toggle back and forth every time the White House changes parties? The answer to that depends in part on what the Supreme Court decides in those three upcoming cases related to LGBTQ people and employment discrimination: Altitude Express v. Zarda; Bostock v. Clayton County; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Oral arguments in those cases were heard in October 2019. In each case, a gay or transgender person was fired allegedly because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Supreme Court's decisions, expected sometime this spring, will establish whether or not those firings are legal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits \"sex\" discrimination in employment. Aimee Stephens was fired from the Michigan funeral home where she worked in 2013 \u2014 because, she says, she'd recently come out as being transgender. Stephens' lawsuit is one of three cases now under consideration in the Supreme Court that explore federal civil rights law as it relates to LGBTQ people.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The Supreme Court, when it weighs in on these Title VII cases, will probably tell us a lot about what the law is going to be \u2014 unless and until Congress acts,\" Bagenstos says. Those decisions will determine how \"sex\" can be interpreted under current law. But, he adds, \"ultimately you'll get more stability when Congress passes a new law.\" A bill called The Equality Act has been kicking around Congress for decades \u2014 it was first introduced in 1974, just 10 years after the Civil Rights Act became law. The current version of the Equality Act would enshrine in law many of the protections conferred by the Obama administration's rules and policies, by explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, federal funding, employment, housing, and more. Last year, the Democrat-controlled House passed the bill and sent it to the Republican-controlled Senate, where it is not expected to be brought up for a vote. Kreis makes the point that polls suggest that, in comparison to past eras, American society is now much more accepting and understanding of people who are gay or transgender. \"Those lessons from the social movement \u2013 the LGBTQ rights movement \u2013 haven't changed and most Americans' views on this have not changed [since Trump's election],\" Kreis says. That's \"what makes the Trump administration's about-face so hard for so many people to swallow.\" Anderson from the Heritage Foundation doesn't think there's a contradiction between social progress and Trump's rollbacks \u2014 he says it's about \"nuance\" on these issues. \"I don't think anyone in America wants to be bullying or harassing or denigrating LGBT people,\" he says. \"But I also think there are reasons that women are concerned about privacy and safety in public restrooms or locker rooms or the equality on athletic fields and tracks.\" Joaqu\u00edn Carca\u00f1o, at his home in North Carolina in 2016.

They had high hopes and it didn't work out \u2014 there was a lot of support and a lot of love for trans people in the community, and people saw through the charade that [allowing trans people to use certain bathrooms] is harmful for women in some way.\" She says she sometimes reminds herself of a saying about social movements: \"First, they do ignore you, then they do laugh at you and then they fight you \u2014 and then you win.\" \"For a long period of our history, we've been ignored and laughed at,\" Buchert says. \"If you look at the sitcoms from '60s, '70s, '80s TV \u2014 a man in a dress is 'the most hilarious thing ever,' \" she says. \"The folks that oppose us have moved from laughing at us to fighting us. It's not over \u2014 we're rolling up our sleeves because it's gonna be a long fight.\" Along with her work on policy and LGBTQ discrimination cases \u2014 Buchert also wants to fight the message she says the Trump administration's actions are sending: that gay and transgender people should not be protected from discrimination and that they should just disappear or pretend to be something they are not. Her own message? \"We're just people,\" Buchert says, and laughs. \"We like dogs. We like ice cream. We're real people \u2014 this is how we were made.\" And, she adds, \"we're not going back in the closet.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump nominated William Perry Pendley in June to lead the Bureau of Land Management, but it has never been clear he had enough support to win confirmation in the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump nominated William Perry Pendley in June to lead the Bureau of Land Management, but it has never been clear he had enough support to win confirmation in the Senate. Amid pressure from Democrats and some Republicans, the Trump administration is planning to withdraw its controversial nominee to head the federal Bureau of Land Management. The sprawling public lands agency, which manages roughly a tenth of the landmass of the United States, has not had a permanent, Senate-confirmed director for the entire Trump era. The nominee, William Perry Pendley, has been leading the agency since last August through a series of controversial continued appointment extensions. Prior to coming to Washington D.C., the Wyoming native had spent much of his career at the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation challenging the very agency he now leads. President Trump formally nominated Pendley to lead the bureau in June, though it has never been clear whether even the current Republican-controlled Senate would confirm him. An administration official confirmed to NPR that his nomination was being withdrawn. Democrats and environmentalists have been actively pushing for Pendley to step down, pointing to his previous statements in support of selling off federal public land. Pendley has also drawn criticism for his past support for the rancher Cliven Bundy, who in 2014 led the largest armed standoff against the federal government in a generation over the use of public land. \"Unfortunately, the ignominious end of Pendley's nomination is more of a cynical nod to political realities than a retreat from the nihilist ideology he championed,\" said Collin O'Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation, in a statement. That Pendley will no longer appear before lawmakers for a confirmation hearing is seen as a relief to at least three western Republican senators in tight re-election races: Martha McSally of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana. Democrats had been eager to get those Senators, all of whom sit on the committee responsible for sending a nominee to the full Senate, on the record with an up or down vote. Political analysts say the lawmakers had been in a tough bind: no mainstream candidate in the West can afford to be portrayed as  against public lands, but a vote against Pendley would have risked the scorn of President Trump on Twitter. Polls have consistently shown bipartisan support for federal ownership of public lands, long cherished for their environmental and recreational values, as well as their natural resources. \"You do see most politicians, Democrat and Republican in the West position themselves as champions of public land,\" said Rob Saldin, a political scientist at the University of Montana in Missoula. Pendley, who has maintained he has no plans to transfer or sell off public lands, will continue to lead the agency as its deputy director for programs and policy. But his long-term future at the agency remains uncertain. Two federal lawsuits have been filed accusing the administration of keeping him installed as acting director at the BLM far longer than what's legal under federal law. One of those suits was filed recently by Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat who's challenging Sen. Daines this fall.",

Republicans up for reelection in key Western states could be facing an uncomfortable vote soon as President Trump's controversial nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management is expected to come before the Senate for confirmation. Last week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee received final documents and paperwork from the administration that were needed to hold a hearing for William Perry Pendley, who has been serving as the Bureau of Land Management's temporary director since last August. A date has not been set. But with the election less than three months out, Democrats are eager to get vulnerable GOP senators on the committee on the record about a nominee who as recently as 2016 suggested that federal public land should be sold to states or private entities. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said Republicans may be trying to delay a vote until after the election. \"Just because members of Congress don't want to be put on the hot seat about his philosophy that is out of step with the mainstream of the public is very troubling,\" Cantwell said. Last week, conservationists began running online political ads in Montana that attempt to align Pendley with that state's Republican Sen. Steve Daines, who also sits on the committee and is in a tight reelection bid against Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. \"Tell Steve Daines our public lands are not for sale, stop Pendley,\" can be heard on the video paid for by Montana Conservation Voters. Daines hasn't said how he'd vote. Fellow GOP committee member Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado hasn't either. Gardner is trying to fend off a challenge from his state's former governor, John Hickenlooper. Neither Daines nor Gardner's offices made the senators available for interviews, though the two have said they plan to ask tough questions of Pendley if there's a hearing. A Daines spokeswoman did call the recent attack ad an attempt to distract from the senator's work getting a huge conservation bill signed last week \u2014 the Great American Outdoors Act \u2014 that puts billions of dollars toward public lands protections. Sen. Gardner was also seen as key in its passage. \"That was a big political win for those two in particular,\" said Rob Saldin, a political scientist at the University of Montana. \"They'd like to be able to bask in the glow of that for a while, ideally all the way through Election Day and now this Pendley nomination risks overshadowing that.\" Saldin says Daines and Gardner are in a bind because no Western politician can afford to be portrayed as anti-public land. But the two men also can't risk the ridicule of President Trump if they don't support Pendley. Pendley is especially big news in the West with its vast open spaces. Here, the decisions of the Bureau of Land Management director or interior secretary can have a lot more direct effect on people's daily lives than the president. \"What we're looking at in this vote is somebody with such an extreme and terrible track record for issues that matter in the West,\" said Jesse Prentice-Dunn with the Center for Western Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Colorado. For his part, Pendley has maintained that his character is being unfairly maligned. In an interview earlier this year, he insisted he has no plans to transfer or sell off federal public lands, even though, officially, that language is still included in the GOP party platform. \"I've made it very very clear, the president of the United States has made it clear, the secretary of the interior has made it clear,\" Pendley said. \"The United States government will not engage in the wholesale transfer or disposal of the public lands.\" Meanwhile, Pendley's future at the Bureau of Land Management remains uncertain regardless of his pending confirmation hearing. Two federal lawsuits have been filed accusing the administration of keeping him in an acting role there far longer than what's legal under federal law. One of those comes from Bullock, Montana's Democratic governor, that Republicans have charged is politically motivated.",

Updated at 8:41 a.m. ET Cori Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist, has ousted longtime Missouri U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay in a Democratic primary, according to The Associated Press. It's the latest example of a progressive challenger topping a long-tenured Democratic incumbent. \"It is historic that this year, of all years, we're sending a Black, working-class single mother, who has been fighting for Black lives since Ferguson, all the way to the halls of Congress,\" she said in her victory speech. Clay, who's also Black, has represented the state's 1st Congressional District, around St. Louis, since 2001. He succeeded his father in representing the district. Loading... The younger Clay topped Bush by 20 percentage points in the 2018 primary, but Bush's profile has risen since then, partly because of a documentary that also profiled New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Bush raised $562,309 for this year's primary challenge \u2014 not too far behind the $740,525 Clay raised. Bush was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Justice Democrats, a group closely aligned with Ocasio-Cortez; and Jamaal Bowman, who dispatched with longtime New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel earlier this summer. Clay's backers, including fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, maintain he's \"no moderate Democrat,\" citing, for instance, his support of \"Medicare for All.\" \"This is a huge upset and another groundbreaking win for our movement against a corporate-backed political dynasty,\" Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement late Tuesday. The district is very liberal, so it's likely Bush will win November's general election. In 2018, Clay topped a Republican challenger by 63 percentage points. If elected, Bush would become the state's first Black woman in Congress, according to St. Louis Public Radio.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's top public lands chief is still helping lead the Bureau of Land Management, despite a federal ruling removing him from the top post there.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A Trump administration official is ignoring a court order. A judge said William Perry Pendley should stop running the federal Bureau of Land Management. He's never been confirmed by the Senate as the Constitution requires. Defying both the Senate and the judge - in other words, ignoring the separation of powers - Perry has stayed. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The Bureau of Land Management regulates who gets to do what on about a tenth of all the land in the U.S. It also helps run the National Interagency Fire Center here in Boise. Normally, a bureau director stopping by for a pep talk and briefing wouldn't get much attention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM PERRY PENDLEY: It's an honor to be here. We've had a horrific fire season, as you all know. SIEGLER: But in September, a federal court order removed William Perry Pendley from leading the bureau. The ruling said his 424-day appointment to the agency violates federal law and the Constitution's requirement that the Senate confirm him. So what's he doing here? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENDLEY: I'm doing what a deputy director of policy and programs, a political appointee at the Bureau of Land Management, does, which is help run, based on the advice and instruction of the secretary. SIEGLER: Pendley has been under fire for telling a local reporter in Wyoming that he's still running the bureau. And yesterday, he often went out of his way to point out that he's not the acting director despite a federal judge ruling he was. That court order also says any public lands decision he signed off on is void. The administration disagrees and says it will appeal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENDLEY: I've never been acting director. And folks, I hope you could all get that right. If you'd write that down - I've never been acting director. SIEGLER: This conflicts with the bureau's own Twitter feed, which called him that at times, as did numerous administration documents. Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat and former attorney general, filed the suit that removed Pendley from the top post. STEVE BULLOCK: At the end of the day, you know, if he's not the acting director, both before and the way he's acting now, I mean, we're living in \"Alice In Wonderland.\" SIEGLER: Bullock is in a tight U.S. Senate race, which has led to charges by Republicans that this court battle is political. But Pendley's past advocating for selling off U.S. public lands is also seen as one of the reasons why his nomination never moved forward. BULLOCK: We could go back. Twenty years ago, William Perry Pendley sued to get rid of our stream access rights in Montana. You know, we can talk about whether he's qualified, someone that has literally said the Founding Fathers never intended the federal government to hold public lands. SIEGLER: With Election Day three weeks out, the administration has not yet given a timeline for its appeal. Meantime, early voting has already begun in Montana, where the lawsuit could give a boost to Bullock's bid for the U.S. Senate. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise.

In the age of social distancing, car and truck caravans of MAGA flag-waving supporters of President Trump have hit the road from New York to California. \"We stretched for a very long distance; I mean miles back,\" said Shawn Farash, who organized a caravan of hundreds of motorcycles, cars and trucks that drove through the streets of Long Island last weekend. Farash describes himself as a \"regular guy\" who works in advertising, not politics, and says even he was surprised by the turnout. In his best Trump impression, he deadpans: \"You don't have to trust the polls. Just look at the people who are showing up every weekend. The silent majority, silent no more.\" Guys... Trump isn't losing the election.1500+ cars on Long Island in support of @realDonaldTrump and our country yesterday. What a day. Thanks to all who made it out pic.twitter.com/DmXKrZXHvS The caravans are promoted on social media, and in some cases, organized by people who have never before been politically active. Just this past weekend, boisterous convoys, with horns honking and Trump flags flying, also rolled through Michigan and North Carolina. These mobile rallies have continued, even after one turned deadly last month in Portland, Ore. A supporter of a far-right group was killed following clashes between participants in a pro-Trump caravan and counterprotesters. The suspect, who supported antifa, a militant leftist movement, was killed by authorities serving a warrant for his arrest. Most of the events since then have been peaceful, though tensions have flared. In Elon, N.C., on Saturday, a pro-Trump caravan drove through town, hurling insults and white supremacist slogans at a lone counterprotester, who posted a video of the incident on Twitter. While the caravans haven't drawn much national media attention, videos of some of them have been shared online by RT, the television network funded by the Kremlin. This comes as U.S. intelligence experts warn that Russia is again trying to influence the election in favor of Trump. Car caravans emerged in the spring as part of protests against state lockdown rules to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Those events were coordinated, in part, by pro-business lobbying groups in Washington, D.C. Organizers of the latest caravans say these are grassroots efforts aimed at showing the country is united \u2014 not divided by racism or violence. They say they deliberately try to avoid clashes with counterprotesters. \"We don't condone any racism, racist comments,\" said Keith Lee, a convoy organizer from Texas. \"We don't want people dragging a Black Lives Matter flag or an antifa flag underneath their truck. If we see any of that stuff, they're out of there.\" Lee is one of the organizers of MAGA Drag the Interstate, a group that's helping to coordinate caravans on major highways around big cities. So far, he says they've held events in 46 states, and they're planning to host caravans nationwide during the first weekend in October. \"This is about making America patriotic again,\" Lee said. But counterprotesters said some events have stoked hate. Megan Squire, who studies far-right extremist groups at Elon University, where she's a professor of computer science, was the one who filmed the North Carolina caravan. She was holding up a Black Lives Matter sign, and video shows people driving by shouting, \"No they f****** don't, b****\" and \"white power.\" \"I was literally standing on that corner silent, listening, and I heard exactly what they had to say, and it was hate,\" Squire said. \"He even, like, cupped his hands to make sure, and he enunciated. And I remember thinking that at the time, I was like, 'Wow, you really wanted me to hear that.' Creepy, really.\" The caravan was organized by a local activist who's well-known for defending Confederate monuments. He did not respond to a request for comment. Other caravans have gone off without incident. In Ohio on Saturday, a caravan of Amish and Mennonite Trump supporters in horse-drawn buggies drove through Fredericksburg. And in Michigan on Saturday, hundreds of cars and trucks drove through Grand Rapids. Christina Medema, a stay-at-home mom, helped organize the Grand Rapids caravan. She also said she'd never done anything political until now but was motivated in part by the relentless stream of \"negative\" stories in the news. \"It surprised me just because I'm a little Rockford housewife,\" Medema said. \"Not a ton of people know me, so it shocked me to see all of those people coming, all of those cars coming.\" Video from the Michigan event taken by RT features clips of participants talking about the \"silent majority\" against \"radicals\" who don't like America and \"BLM garbage.\" Experts say RT is a Russian propaganda machine that tries to highlight divisions in U.S. society, but Medema doesn't see it that way. She said American media just won't cover this story and only focus on caravans when something goes wrong. \"I was actually really thankful that he was there. He pretty much posted everything that we did, showing it all, not splicing it or editing in a weird way,\" Medema said of the RT producer. \"It made me a little bit disappointed in our local news outlets for sure.\" Medema said she believes turnout at her caravan is an indicator that Trump will win Michigan \u2014 and the election \u2014 even though polls show former Vice President Joe Biden in the lead. \"I would be pretty shocked if he didn't, to be honest,\" she said of a possible Trump win. \"Every car that passed us, it felt like honked and gave us a thumbs-up.\"",

The team's players have embraced the Black Lives Matter movement while Loeffler has called on the WNBA to drop its support for BLM.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A U.S. senator up for reelection this year stands at the crossroads of politics, business and race. Republican Kelly Loeffler joins the president today as he visits Georgia. She is in a tough campaign and under pressure in her business. She co-owns Atlanta's women's pro basketball team, and she's been criticized for pressing the league to drop its support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Here's Emma Hurt of our member station WABE. TIM ECHOLS: With no further ado, welcome with me our senator, Kelly Loeffler. EMMA HURT, BYLINE: Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler is with a few dozen people in downtown Winder, Ga., in the midst of a statewide tour. She's had only months to introduce herself to voters after being appointed in December, and a letter she wrote to the WNBA last week has made an impression. KELLY LOEFFLER: Let me say a few words about some news that I've been in recently. Look; we have a situation our country. There is no room for racism in this country. We cannot have it. But there's an organization different from the saying, an organization called Black Lives Matter founded on Marxist principles. Marxism supports socialism. HURT: Loeffler objected to the WNBA and its union's decision to put Black Lives Matter slogans on warm-up gear and jerseys. The WNBA commissioner rejected the appeal. The players' union has demanded Loeffler be removed as an owner of the Atlanta Dream. LOEFFLER: I think it's a really uninformed, political, reactive statement that just divides our country. And in a league that has always sought tolerance, it's pretty shocking. HURT: Loeffler says she's standing up for people who feel attacked for voicing conservative beliefs. Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols, who has endorsed Loeffler and introduced her at the Winder event, says this is resonating. ECHOLS: I think a lot of Republicans are very sympathetic to the attack that's being placed on her right now, and I think this has helped her. Kelly has had the courage to be able to stand up, and I think Republicans are giving her some credit for that. HURT: While Loeffler argued that her stand was about removing politics from sports, it's difficult to ignore the context in which it's happening. Loeffler's ownership stake in the team has become a campaign liability. Brian Robinson is a Republican strategist and communications consultant. BRIAN ROBINSON: It's really the only option that the Loeffler campaign had. Doug Collins had attacked Loeffler over the WNBA and the Dream's partnership with Planned Parenthood. HURT: Collins is running ads about it. Here's one calling out Loeffler for honoring former Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams at a game. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) Here's a story of a woman named Kelly, who invited Stacey Abrams to her game. Then they stood at center court together, trying to grow Stacey's fame. HURT: Robinson says Loeffler also has to go on the offense to win over Georgia's Republican base because while she is in a free-for-all special election, she's basically competing for the Republican spot in a likely runoff election in January. ROBINSON: Let's be serious. This is not a general. This is really a primary by a different name. HURT: Meanwhile, the entire Atlanta Dream roster has split with Loeffler over supporting Black Lives Matter. Elizabeth Williams has played on the Dream since 2016. ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: It's clear that she's trying to use the idea of Black Lives Matter and, like, politicizing it for her gain. And, like, that's on her if that's what she wants to do. But I think, again, at the end of the day, the movement and what we as players stand for is a movement of unity, is a movement of justice. HURT: She says it was disappointing to read Loeffler's statements, especially because the league is made up of about 80% Black women. WILLIAMS: I think it's, like, ironic for her to make these statements and for her to still want to be associated with the team. HURT: Loeffler has said she won't back away from her ownership stake, despite the blowback. For NPR News, I'm Emma Hurt in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Because of the pandemic, the Bureau of Land Management held virtual public hearings in April on a proposal to expand oil drilling in Alaska's North Slope.\n                \n\n                    U.S. Department of the Interior / screenshot by NPR\n                    \n\nhide caption Because of the pandemic, the Bureau of Land Management held virtual public hearings in April on a proposal to expand oil drilling in Alaska's North Slope. Do public hearings over Zoom unfairly suppress opponents' comments, or allow even more people to engage? That's just one point of dispute as the Trump administration pushes ahead with some of its most controversial environmental policy changes this spring despite the coronavirus pandemic. November's vote is driving momentum, since policies finalized too late could be overturned more easily should President Trump lose re-election or Democrats gain control of the Senate. But environmentalists, state regulators and lawmakers say the public is distracted by the coronavirus pandemic.  They've asked the government to hit pause on a host of proposals, with little success so far. Recently finalized rules include scaling back regulations for fuel efficiency in cars and trucks, air pollution coming from power plants and water pollution in streams and wetlands. The administration is also pushing ahead with a string of more localized policies, such as expanded logging and oil drilling in Alaska. \"It really switched the power dynamic\" In April, the Bureau of Land Management canceled in-person meetings and instead held eight Zoom sessions on a plan to develop as many as 250 oil wells in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. \"It really switched the power dynamic, incredibly, during these hearings, in terms of who had the control,\" says Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director for Defenders of Wildlife. She complains that one man's microphone was muted as he was providing his opinion. Whittington-Evans acknowledges the man was swearing and probably would have been asked to leave an in-person meeting. But \"you can't just, like, hold your hand over somebody's face in a public hearing,\" she says. During the Zoom sessions many opponents of the drilling plan complained that the hearing format was unfair. You can't just, like, hold your hand over somebody's face in a public hearing. Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director, Defenders of Wildlife, about people being muted during public hearings on Zoom But BLM spokeswoman Lesli Ellis-Wouters says Zoom hearings actually have some big advantages. One meeting drew people from both southeast Alaska and the state's northern edge. \"There's 1,000 miles in between those two communities, and they were able to come to the same meeting,\" she says. \"So we were getting perspectives from people that we traditionally have not heard from before.\" BLM says the eight sessions had about 300 unique attendees, plus another 2,000 on Facebook Live, far more people than had attended community meetings before the pandemic. In March, federal agencies also canceled hearings on a proposal to remove dams to help threatened salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Thirteen members of Congress from the Pacific Northwest asked to extend the comment period. \"The current crisis cannot plausibly provide for an environment conducive to robust public comment,\" they wrote. The request was not granted, and the comment period is now closed. The Trump administration has also moved ahead with changes that affect state water pollution permits and liquefied natural gas development, in addition to relaxing the Obama-era rules on fuel efficiency and pollution in streams and wetlands. Sharlett Mena, special assistant to the director of the Washington Department of Ecology, says all this undermines state environmental protections for air and water. \"All of these rules have gone forth with our very vocal objection,\" she says.  \"And they were finalized now, when we're flat-footed and we're worried about our communities. We're worried about recovery.\" Northern Dynasty Vice President Doug Allen pitched the Pebble Mine to potential investors February 28, 2020.\n                \n                    \n                    Image via YouTube\n                    \n                \nhide caption Northern Dynasty Vice President Doug Allen pitched the Pebble Mine to potential investors February 28, 2020. \"So much going on in the world\" Lindsey Bloom thought she finally had the goods to oppose development of Alaska's Pebble Mine. The Obama administration had blocked the gold and copper mine, saying it would threaten the nation's most valuable salmon fishery, but the Trump administration reversed that. Bloom discovered a video from a conference in late February, when an executive from Pebble's parent company pitched investors. She considered it proof of what fishermen and environmental groups have been warning \u2013 that Pebble is minimizing the scope of its plans. \"One of the ways you ensure you can get a permit is you de-risk it by taking something modest and conservative into the permitting process in the first place. And we did that,\" Northern Dynasty Vice President Doug Allen says on the video. He went on to say the company expects to get a permit to extract more gold at a later date. Bloom, who works for Commercial Fishermen for Bristol Bay, sent a transcript of the comments to multiple news outlets, expecting to generate headlines. But \"I haven't been hearing anything back from reporters,\" she says. \"The airwaves are so crowded right now. So much going on in the world.\" Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole declined to be interviewed, but pointed out in an email that the public input period on the mine ended last year. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now in the final phase, working with government agencies and tribes before it decides on issuing permits. One of those select agencies is supposed to be the Curyung Tribe, but its leaders say they can't keep up with the Pebble documents or attend the biweekly agency meetings. \"All of our tribal focus right now has become COVID and maintaining the health and safety of our people here in Bristol Bay,\" says administrator Courtenay Carty. Thousands of workers are heading to the area for the annual salmon fishery despite concerns about a possible outbreak of COVID-19. \"We're really disenfranchised at this point in time,\" Carty says. \"To (not) be able to focus on something as important as the Pebble permitting process, that we've dedicated over a decade to, to have it come to decision essentially over summer in the midst of a global pandemic, is unfathomable.\" Last month, Pebble changed its preferred transportation route for getting the gold out, prompting more criticism that interested parties are not able to adequately respond. EPA employees have risen to the test of carrying out their duties during this challenging time, and I applaud all of them. Andrew Wheeler, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Pushing through rollbacks while easing enforcement At a recent Senate hearing, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler defended the flurry of action during the pandemic. \"EPA employees have risen to the test of carrying out their duties during this challenging time, and I applaud all of them,\" Wheeler said. But Democratic Senators criticized Wheeler for making changes that could worsen air pollution, even as the nation grapples with a pandemic from a respiratory disease. They also questioned his agency's move to relax compliance and monitoring of clean air and water laws during the crisis. Nine states and a dozen environmental groups have sued EPA over the measure, alleging it gives polluters too much leeway. Wheeler countered that EPA is still carrying out enforcement. And the agency said in a statement that there is \"no leniency for those who exhibit an intentional disregard for the law or for accidental releases of oil, hazardous substances, hazardous chemicals, hazardous waste or other pollutants.\" Still, the move rankles Brett VandenHeuvel, Executive Director of Columbia Riverkeeper in Oregon. \"We're seeing simultaneously that they can't do their jobs to enforce environmental laws, but they can push forward dirty pollution-causing projects,\" he says. Environmental regulators in Oregon and Washington State say easing federal compliance puts more of the onus on them to make sure industrial facilities are operating properly, even as their own agency budgets are collapsing because of the pandemic's economic fallout. But states are still challenging the administration's rollbacks, most recently with a lawsuit against weaker standards for fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director Richard Whitman calls the rule \"ill-advised\" and says it would set back his state's climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. \"In my mind, this is really about propping up our petroleum industry,\" Whitman says. Doing that \"in the middle of the pandemic, I will say, grates on us.\" This story is a collaboration with Oregon Public Broadcasting and Alaska Public Media.",

            "article_content": "Western GOP senators facing tough reelection bids may be in the spotlight when it comes time to vote on President Trump's controversial nominee to head the nation's largest public lands agency.  NOEL KING, HOST: President Trump nominated a man named William Perry Pendley to lead the Bureau of Land Management. It's a big job. That agency controls what goes on on about 10% of all the land in this country. And now a couple of Republican senators in Western states may be sweating Pendley's confirmation hearing. NPR's Kirk Siegler explains what's going on. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Before arriving at the Bureau of Land Management a year ago, acting Director Pendley spent much of his career as a property rights attorney fighting the agency he now leads. It's never been clear whether even the GOP-controlled Senate would confirm him, and Democrats are eager to get vulnerable Republicans on the record about a nominee who as recently as 2016 suggested that federal public land be turned over to states or private entities. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"FOR SALE\") UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR: Montana for sale? Donald Trump... SIEGLER: This new ad by environmentalists tries to align Pendley with Montana's Republican Senator Steve Daines. Daines sits on the Senate committee that would take up the Pendley nomination and is in a tight reelection bid against that state's governor. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"FOR SALE\") UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR: Tell Steve Daines our public plans are not for sale. Stop Pendley. SIEGLER: Daines hasn't said how he'd vote, neither has fellow committee Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado. He's trying to fend off a challenge from his state's former governor John Hickenlooper. The senators' offices did not make them available for interviews, though the two have said they plan to ask tough questions of Pendley if there's a hearing. A Daine spokeswoman did call that attack ad an attempt to distract from his work getting a huge conservation bill signed last week that puts billions of dollars toward public lands protections. Senator Gardner was also seen as key in the passage of that Great American Outdoors Act. ROB SALDIN: That was a big political win for those two in particular. SIEGLER: Rob Saldin is a political scientist at the University of Montana. SALDIN: And they'd like to be able to bask in the glow of that for a while, ideally all the way through Election Day. And now this Pendley nomination risks overshadowing that. SIEGLER: Saldin says Daines and Gardner are in a bind because no Western politician can afford to be portrayed as anti-public land. But the two men also can't risk the ridicule of President Trump if they don't support Pendley. Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell sits on the committee with Gardner and Daines. MARIA CANTWELL: You can't hide just behind the Great American Outdoor Act. SIEGLER: Cantwell says the American public has the right to know more about who is in charge of their land. Pendley is especially relevant in the West, where the U.S. government owns a lot of the vast open spaces. And here, the decisions of the Bureau of Land Management director can have a lot more direct effect on people's daily lives than the president. CANTWELL: Just because members of Congress don't want to be put on the hot seat about his philosophy that is out of step with the mainstream of the public - but yet if, you know, they can push him through later after the election is very troubling. SIEGLER: For his part, William Perry Pendley has maintained his character is being unfairly maligned. In an interview earlier this year, he insisted he has no plans to transfer or sell off federal public land even though that's still in the official GOP party platform. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM PERRY PENDLEY: I've made it very, very clear, the president of the United States has made it clear, the secretary of the interior's made it clear that the United States government will not engage in the wholesale transfer or disposal of the public lands. SIEGLER: A confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled. But regardless, Pendley's future at the Bureau of Land Management remains uncertain. Two federal lawsuits have been filed accusing the administration of keeping him in an acting role there far longer than what's legal under federal law. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise.

            "article_content": "In Los Angeles, Black Lives Matter activists are taking energy from the streets to the ballot box to oppose the reelection of a district attorney who faces pressure over police accountability.  TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: Black Lives Matter activists are trying to pull together a daunting feat in next month's elections. They're trying to vote out the county's district attorney who has come under pressure for what activists call a lack of police accountability. And many see this race as a test on whether the energy from this summer's protests for racial justice can be channeled into the ballot box. NPR's Adrian Florido reports. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Outside the district attorney's office in downtown LA, Black Lives Matter activists unfurled a scroll half a block long. It was inscribed with the names of hundreds of people killed by LA police or sheriffs in the eight years since LA County's top prosecutor, Jackie Lacey, took office. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Jackie Lacey must go. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Jackie Lacey must go. FLORIDO: Police accountability has become a top issue for Black Lives Matter activists across the country. In Los Angeles, BLM activists have made it the top issue in the race for district attorney. Their message - that Jackie Lacey does not hold police who kill accountable, having prosecuted only one in her eight years in office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSEPH WILLIAMS: No people have ever voted their way to freedom or to liberation. FLORIDO: Joseph Williams is a local BLM organizer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAMS: But we also know that during this time, we have the opportunity to do the most concrete thing in our power to make sure that Jackie Lacey is not still our district attorney next year. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That's right. FLORIDO: Among those in the crowd was Rahad Coulter-Stevenson, an actor. He started coming to these rallies after Minnesota police killed George Floyd in May. He said they've made him more engaged in local politics. RAHAD COULTER-STEVENSON: I see how important it is to know who the DA is and, like, what their record is and what they've been doing and holding them accountable. FLORIDO: Melina Abdullah is a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter LA chapter. She says organizing some of BLM's supporters to vote has taken work. Many of the movement's young, progressive core activists are disillusioned with their options for the White House. MELINA ABDULLAH: But it's important that we be aware of everything that's on the ballot. And the role of the district attorney is huge. FLORIDO: The district attorney decides whether to prosecute police, she tells people, and how aggressively to go after low-level offenders. When she puts it that way, she says... ABDULLAH: We are met with much less resistance. And in fact, a lot of our younger and more radical organizers are enthusiastic about going to the ballot box, even if it's only to vote her out. FLORIDO: A spokesman for Lacey declined an interview request. But in a recent debate with her challenger, Lacey defended her record on police accountability. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JACKIE LACEY: I am fair. I do prosecute law enforcement officers. On the other hand, I don't demonize them. I don't prosecute them for political reasons. And I think it's important for people to remember that, that the LA County District Attorney's Office has never looked the other way. We do, in fact, look at these cases. But they're challenging. They're difficult. FLORIDO: Her challenger is the former district attorney of San Francisco, George Gascon. He's running as a progressive reformer and has promised to reopen closed cases of police killings. In recent weeks, the persistence of BLM activists has paid off for them. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti withdrew his support for Lacey and endorsed Gascon. Lacey's also lost support from many of the county's top Black leaders. University of Southern California law professor Jody Armour says that is significant because Lacey is Black and has often made her race central in her campaigns. JODY ARMOUR: But her strongest critics are also Black women. And so there's growing understanding that representational politics alone are not enough. FLORIDO: BLM's campaign against Lacey has at times grown tense. In March, her husband pointed a gun at protesters outside the Laceys' home, prompting a lawsuit. Professor Armour says unseating the leader of the nation's largest local prosecutor's office will be no easy feat. But he said if BLM's campaign succeeds, it'll be a clear affirmation of the influence of this summer's racial justice movement. Adrian Florido, NPR News, Los Angeles. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.
