As former President Donald Trump steadily ramps up public events, he held his first rally since leaving office on Saturday night in Ohio. \"We're gonna take back the House, we're gonna take back the Senate,\" Trump said, speaking before a crowd of thousands at a fairground in Wellington, a town southwest of Cleveland, in a county and state he won in 2020. \"My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun.\" Trump railed against \"left-wing indoctrination\" in schools, \"fake news media\" and Big Tech \"tyrants,\" while championing Georgia's controversial voter ID law. He pushed baseless claims to argue what he said were America's biggest threats \u2014 election fraud and illegal immigration \u2014 and resurfaced a favorite but false assertion that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from him. Trump has left the door wide open to running again. \"We won the election twice,\" Trump told supporters. \"We may have to win it a third time.\" The 90-minute speech was punctuated by chants from an energetic crowd: \"Trump won\" and \"four more years.\" The event was held in support of a former Trump advisor, Max Miller, who is now running for Congress trying to unseat Republican incumbent Anthony Gonzales. The former president disparaged Gonzales, who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection. He also lashed out at Rep. Liz Cheney, Sen. Mitt Romney and other GOP leaders he views as having crossed him \u2014 a group he said were \"worse than the Democrats.\" Trump is expected to continue to hold many score-settling rallies and make lots of grievance-based endorsements ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, as Republicans seek to wrest control of one or both chambers of Congress from Democrats. Trump's popularity with the GOP base has put somewhat of a freeze on the 2024 field, but some are running versions of shadow campaigns. Just this week, other top potential GOP presidential candidates were making public appearances and made the news, as they jockey for position \u2014 if Trump doesn't run.

            "article_content": "President Biden pledged during his election campaign to end privately-run immigration detention centers. But advocates say his administration is not following through on his promises.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Since the campaign trail, President Biden has made clear his intention to put an end to the business of detaining immigrants for profit. Hundreds of privately run detention centers across the U.S. hold immigrants who are in the country illegally. But immigrant advocates say the administration is not following through on Biden's promise. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: When President Biden visited the battleground state of Georgia for a rally to celebrate his 100th day in office, immigrant advocates were there to protest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: End detention now. End detention now. ROSE: Normally, the president would just ignore the hecklers until security could escort them out. But that is not what happened in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I agree with you. I'm working on it, man. Give me another five days. ROSE: Not only did Biden engage with the protesters. He made sure the rest of the audience knew what they were talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: There should be no private prisons, period - none, period. That's what they're talking about - private detention centers. They should not exist. And we are working to close all of them. ROSE: This is Biden doubling down on his campaign promise to end privately run detention centers, including those that detain immigrants. Immigrant advocates have heard this before, and they're getting impatient. GRACE MENG: President Biden made some strong promises about reforming detention that we applauded, and we would like to see him carry them out. ROSE: Grace Meng is a lawyer with the nonprofit Human Rights Watch. She and other immigrant advocates are disappointed that the Department of Homeland Security shows no sign of dismantling its detention network that relies heavily on private contractors. Immigration officials warn they may need that detention space, especially with the ongoing influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. And in California, the Department of Justice was in court this month arguing against a state law that bans privately run prisons and immigrant detention centers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Speaking Spanish). ROSE: Protesters were there, too, outside the federal appeals court in Pasadena, including Grace Meng from Human Rights Watch. MENG: It just seems like another kind of kick in the teeth to say that you're going to defend a position that the Trump administration took to help private prison companies continue to keep contracts. ROSE: The Justice Department says the California law should be struck down, arguing that the state can't tell the federal government who it can contract with. Meanwhile, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement says he's concerned about what will happen when the U.S.-Mexico border reopens. Since the pandemic began, immigration authorities have been able to quickly expel thousands of migrants under an emergency public health order, so many of ICE's detention beds are empty. But acting ICE director Tae Johnson told Congress that could change very quickly, which has happened before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TAE JOHNSON: Just overnight, we could start seeing 3,000 and 5,000 people a day again - and then finding ourselves back in a situation like we were in 2019 where Border Patrol had, you know, 15,000 people in custody and no place for them to go. ROSE: But watchdog agencies and human rights groups say the private detention industry has a long track record of detainee abuses and inadequate medical care. DHS has announced plans to shutter two ICE detention centers, including a privately operated facility in Georgia where a doctor allegedly performed unwanted gynecological procedures on detainees. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he's reviewing concerns about ICE detention centers. And he was asked at a congressional hearing last month if he expects to close any more of them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Congressman, we are studying the issue very carefully. My direction could not have been clearer, which is that we will not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in detention or substandard conditions. ROSE: A few days after Mayorkas testified, DHS submitted its budget request, asking Congress to fund tens of thousands of detention beds, most of them in privately run facilities. Advocates say that's a long way from what Biden promised. Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF NEARLY ORATORIO SONG, \"OCCLUDE\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

House Democrats passed the bill in March. The Senate Rules Committee on Tuesday held a contentious markup of legislation to revamp the nation's voting and campaign finance rules, laying bare the deep partisan divide over how elections should be run. A series of party-line votes on amendments made clear there is little ground for compromise, and the bill's fate is very much in doubt in the upper chamber. A tie vote of 9-9 prevented the panel from passing the measure out of committee, but there are procedural ways it can still be brought to the Senate floor, something Democratic leaders have vowed to do. The debate is unfolding against the backdrop of the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by those repeating former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. It also comes as numerous Republican-led state legislatures are pushing bills to impose new voting restrictions. On Tuesday afternoon, Arizona became the latest GOP-run state to enact a restrictive voting measure. \"The stakes could not be higher,\" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, committee chair and sponsor of the bill, called the For the People Act. \"We need to take these threats to our democracy head on with immediate action to restore Americans' confidence in our political system.\" Klobuchar said the legislation's changes are needed to ensure that all eligible voters have access to the polls and to reduce the role of special interests in American politics. But Republicans called the bill, which passed along party lines in the House in March, a blatant power grab by Democrats. \"We all learned early in life, if you can write the rules, you can win the game,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said. He noted, among other things, that the legislation would change the makeup of the Federal Election Commission to give one party control of a panel that is now bipartisan. Republicans also complained that the bill would impose sweeping federal requirements on elections, an activity traditionally run by the states. McConnell said the changes are not needed, noting that last year's election saw a record turnout \u2014 almost 160 million voters. \"Our democracy is not in crisis and we aren't going to let one party take over our democracy under the false pretense of saving it,\" he said. Among other things, the almost-900-page bill would require states to allow same-day and automatic voter registration and restrict the purging of names from voter registration rolls.  It would also require at least 15 days of early voting and reduce limits on mail-in voting. States would be required to use paper ballots, give voters time to fix mail-in ballot mistakes, and allow voters to sign affidavits attesting to their identity if they do not have the required photo ID. The bill would also would tighten campaign finance laws to reduce secrecy and prevent foreign influence in U.S. elections.

Republicans argued that many of the provisions would make the voting system more vulnerable to fraud. Democrats countered that there is little evidence that this would be the case, citing existing protections in state voting laws. Trump's claim of widespread fraud in last year's election has never been backed up, but polls show a majority of Republicans believe the election was stolen. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of using what he called the \"big lie\" to justify restricting voting rights in an effort to hold onto power. He said new GOP state voting laws are about \"one thing and one thing only: making it harder to vote.\" That, he said, made the need for federal legislation more crucial. But Republicans insisted they're trying to protect the integrity of elections, and bolster public confidence in the system. Among their biggest objections in the Senate bill is a provision that would allow third parties to collect and deliver voters' ballots, something Republicans refer to as \"ballot harvesting.\" They say it could lead to voters being pressured by party operatives, although Democrats argue that it allows more people \u2014 especially those who cannot get to polling places on their own \u2014 to vote. Texas Republican Ted Cruz also alleged that requiring automatic voter registration at motor vehicle departments would open the floodgates to millions of undocumented immigrants getting registered, something election officials of both parties have disputed. Still, Cruz insisted \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 that the bill would dilute the votes of legitimate voters by allowing \"millions of people to vote illegally.\" Numerous efforts to amend the bill failed along 9-9 party line votes. That included a Democratic amendment that would require states to allow volunteers to provide water and food to voters waiting in long lines, a response to a controversial new law in Georgia that would make such activity a crime.  Republicans argued that it was not up to Congress, but the states, to make such rules. Also defeated was an amendment by Klobuchar to tweak the bill in an effort to win broader support, after election officials said some of the deadlines to make voting changes would be difficult to meet. The bill's prospects for passage are not good. The Senate is divided evenly, 50-50, and one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has already expressed reservations about the measure. Even if sponsors are able to win his support, the bill would need at least 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, a near impossibility. That has led to Democratic proposals to eliminate the legislative filibuster, but that idea too has yet to gain sufficient backing.",

His wife, Heather Kobach, is to his left. Thursday he announced his run for the office of Kansas attorney general. Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach kicked off a race for state attorney general Thursday, aiming his hardline immigration and voting policy politics at the state's top legal and law enforcement office. Kobach called the office a last line of defense against policies pushed by President Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress. He raised concerns about limiting gun rights, the federal government setting election laws and immigration policy. \"If the Biden administration tries to take away our Second Amendment rights here in Kansas, they'll have to get through me first,\" Kobach said at an event in Wichita announcing his run. \"If the Biden administration tries to relocate illegal aliens to Kansas in violation of the standards of federal law, they'll have to get through me first.\" Kobach raised the profile of the secretary of state's office by bringing it to the forefront of voter security fights. That office typically flew under the radar. With duties in law enforcement and representing the state in court as attorney general, Kobach would hold an even more powerful platform for pushing those issues. Should he win the Republican primary and the general election \u2014 he's got deep support among conservatives, and just as strong opposition from moderates and Democrats \u2014 he'd enter the job with a national profile rare for a state attorney general even rarer for a Kansas politician. His latest move comes after high-profile losses for the aggressively conservative Republican \u2014 losing the governor's race to Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018 and falling short of the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 2020. Kobach has also been a close ally of former President Donald Trump, winning Trump's 11th-hour endorsement in the GOP primary for governor. Kobach also led a voter fraud commission created by Trump that Trump dissolved after pushback from states and a lack of evidence of widespread cheating. Kobach defended Trump's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the 2016 and 2020 elections. He also advised the president on immigration issues. Kobach said he'd work to defend any abortion restrictions approved by state lawmakers. \"When the Legislature passes a law to protect the unborn or to protect our way of life in a manner the Left does not like, the ACLU and its allies inevitably sue,\" Kobach said in a news release. \"The attorney general must have the expertise and the willingness to defend our laws in court.\" The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects the right to an abortion. Voters will decide in the August 2022 primary, when Kobach seeks his party's nomination for attorney general, whether to reverse that ruling. Critics of the amendment say it could open the door to lawmakers approving much stricter abortion laws or even an outright ban. Supporters say it's needed to protect regulations Kansas has already imposed on abortion. Kobach had filed documents late Wednesday night to appoint a treasurer for his campaign. That's the initial step for raising money. After losing the governor's race, some Republican groups turned on him during his 2020 run for the U.S. Senate. They argued nominating him would risk losing the office to a Democrat. Kobach ultimately lost the GOP primary to then-U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall. Serving as attorney general would bring Kobach back into a statewide office \u2014 a potentially bigger stage than what he had as secretary of state. Even in that job, a largely record-keeping job that politicians often use as a stepping stone, he built a national reputation as an immigration hardliner and for pressing often-refuted claims about the prevalence of voter fraud. Kobach pushed through the passage of a strict Kansas voting law that required proof of citizenship, arguing it kept elections secure. Critics said it prevented thousands of eligible Kansans from registering to vote. The law was eventually knocked down in court, and he faced judicial sanctions for how he performed in the case. His arguments before the Kansas Supreme Court brought him chastisements from the judge. In the years following his 2018 loss to Kelly, Kobach served as director and general counsel for We Build The Wall \u2014 a 501(c)4 nonprofit that was crowdsourcing millions of dollars to build a private border wall on the country's southern border. The group's leaders, except Kobach, were later charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. It's still very early in the race, so there's time for candidates to change their minds and run for different offices or drop their races altogether.

It's now called the Northwest ICE Processing Center.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Northwest Detention Center is pictured in Tacoma, Wash., in 2017. It's now called the Northwest ICE Processing Center. The sprawling detention center in Tacoma, Wash., housed more than 1,300 immigrants on average at the height of former President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Now nearly four out of every five beds at the facility are empty. That's because Immigration and Customs Enforcement released hundreds of people to lower the risk of COVID-19, and because the agency is arresting and detaining fewer unauthorized immigrants under orders from President Biden. But that doesn't translate into savings for the U.S. government \u2014 or the American taxpayer. In fact, because of the way ICE structures its contracts with private companies and localities that own and operate the detention centers, the agency guarantees it will pay for a minimum number of beds whether they are filled or not. For dozens of detention centers across the country with these \"guaranteed minimums,\" ICE pays more than $1 million a day for empty detention beds, according to an NPR analysis. \"The numbers that we have right now on detention are the lowest they've been in 20 years,\" said Silky Shah, executive director of the nonprofit Detention Watch Network. \"But we have the capacity for a lot more, and a lot of those beds continue to get paid for.\" Beyond the Southwest border, where temporary holding facilities are overflowing with unauthorized migrants and children, the Biden administration faces a very different challenge in the interior of the country. After the number of undocumented immigrants in detention peaked under Trump at more than 55,000, the pandemic hit and President Biden won the election. Since then, the number of immigrants in ICE detention has plummeted to just over 14,000, as immigration detention centers have emptied out. Loading... ICE and the detention companies argue that a guaranteed revenue stream is needed in order to keep operations going. But these deals have been controversial for years. In February, a government watchdog agency criticized how ICE awards detention contracts. Now ICE is paying for more unused space than ever before, and a larger national debate has been heating up about whether the government should be locking up many of these immigrants in the first place. Critics say this isn't just about money but about the morality of putting immigrants behind bars for civil violations. Many ICE detainees have not been convicted of any crimes. Shah, from Detention Watch Network, wants to see this system dismantled, and she says having so many guaranteed beds makes that harder. \"I think that's a real question for the administration,\" Shah said. \"Do they want to continue to detain people because of what the Trump administration put in place? Or do they want to actually move towards the more morally appropriate position of actually not detaining tons of people.\" ICE does not own or operate most of the facilities in its detention network. Instead, the agency contracts with a patchwork of private operators and county jails. The agency says it guarantees it will pay for about 29,000 beds per day. Loading... This story is playing out across the country. At the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma run by the private detention company GEO Group, the daily detainee population has plunged. But ICE is still paying for about 800 beds that are empty. \"It used to be really, really bustling,\" said immigration attorney Alison Hollinz, who would wait hours to visit with clients in the past. Now Hollinz gets a front-row parking spot and walks right through an empty waiting room. After a recent visit, she said, \"There were a total of two attorney visits today, which is very, very different from how it used to be.\" ICE said in a statement that predicting how many immigrants will be detained is a \"complex challenge.\" According to ICE, it's a mistake to draw conclusions about its contracting process during a pandemic that has forced the agency to comply with social distancing guidelines in its detention facilities. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office published a report earlier this year documenting a significant jump in the number of guaranteed minimum beds ICE agreed to in detention contracts signed during the Trump administration. \"ICE has not taken a strategic approach to these decisions,\" the GAO found, \"and has spent millions of dollars a month on unused detention space.\" In preparing its report, the GAO interviewed ICE's own staff in a number of field offices around the country, and even they raised red flags about these deals that locked in more guaranteed payments. \"They viewed these contracts and agreements where they included guaranteed minimums as not always being in the best interest of the government,\" said the GAO's Rebecca Gambler, who oversaw the report, in an interview. The number of guaranteed beds in ICE's detention system grew 45% during the Trump administration, according to the GAO report. As of mid-May 2020, the GAO found that ICE was paying for more than 12,000 empty beds per day, at a cost of more than $20 million a month. But ICE's leadership in Washington is pushing back. The GAO's findings \"lack context,\" ICE said in a statement, because the watchdog agency doesn't take into account the \"dramatic fluctuations\" in the number of immigrants ICE detained between 2018, when arrests surged, and 2020, when the pandemic struck and authorities released thousands of detainees. The sudden drop in the detained population is not at all what Trump administration officials expected. In a FY2021 budget proposal from the Department of Homeland Security, ICE requested funding for 60,000 detention beds at a cost of $3.1 billion. The agency received funding for 34,000 beds. ICE defends the use of guaranteed minimums, arguing they help the agency negotiate a lower rate per detainee. ICE \"is committed to ensuring that all those in our custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments and under appropriate conditions of confinement,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Guaranteed minimums allow the federal government to procure beds at a reduced rate and ultimately save the taxpayer money.\" The private companies that operate these detention facilities like guaranteed minimums, too. \"You can't just scale up and scale down very quickly in any of our federal facilities,\" said George Zoley, the founder and CEO of GEO Group, one of the private detention companies that together account for 80% of ICE's detention beds. On an earnings call with investors in February, Zoley explained that these operators are required by ICE to have a certain number of people on staff \u2014 and that staffing up can't be done quickly. \"That's because it takes so long through the clearance process to bring any new employee on board. It's a matter of several weeks if not months,\" Zoley said. Zoley also said that while the pandemic clobbered the nation's economy, these minimum payments helped cushion the blow for GEO Group. \"It could have been much worse if there weren't for some of these guarantees,\" Zoley said. Immigrant advocates have long argued that these deals are good for the private detention industry \u2014 and bad for immigrant communities and taxpayers. In 2017, Congress agreed to drop a requirement that ICE maintain a minimum number of detention beds. Then President Trump ramped up his immigration crackdown \u2014 and ICE continued to write guaranteed minimums into its contracts anyway. Now activists see a new opportunity with President Biden in the White House. During the campaign, Biden's platform said that the federal government \"should not use private facilities for any detention, including detention of undocumented immigrants.\" And when he took office, the president moved to phase out privately run federal prisons within the Justice Department. But so far, he has not moved to address immigration detention.",

ROME \u2014 The second Roman Catholic president in American history is a devout man who makes no secret of the importance of faith in his life. President Joe Biden is a regular churchgoer, often quotes St. Augustine and carries a rosary that belonged to his late son Beau. In one of the first images released of him in the Oval Office, a photo was visible behind his desk showing him with Pope Francis. The Argentine-born pope and the new American president have both staked out liberal stances on issues like climate change and economic disparity, and have taken different positions from their \"culture warrior\" predecessors. Biden diametrically differs from former President Donald Trump in his support for a more inclusive society, on issues ranging from immigration and health care to LGBTQ equality. Francis has moved away from Pope John Paul II's and Benedict XVI's emphasis on sexual morality, preferring to focus on social justice and the rights of the poor and marginalized. He has repeatedly lashed out at what he describes as the destructive effects of laissez-faire capitalism on society and the environment. The pope and the president have a lot in common, says Paul Elie, a scholar of Catholicism at Georgetown University. \"Their informality, the fact that they were elected late in life, the fact that they seem to take issues as they come, listening, discerning and then acting,\" he says. \"And both of them, I think, have surprised their people by turning out to be more progressive than was expected.\" In the November election, just over half of American Catholics voted against Biden, in great part because of his support for laws such as those guaranteeing abortion rights that run contrary to Church doctrine. Nevertheless, the new president has a friend \u2014 and potential ally \u2014 at the Vatican. On Inauguration Day, Pope Francis sent Biden a warm note saying, \"Grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses.\" Relations between Pope Francis and Trump were at best chilly. When Trump was still a candidate in 2016, Pope Francis suggested he was \"not a Christian\" for his campaign vow to deport more immigrants and build a wall along the border with Mexico. A year later, the pope wondered how Trump could claim to be \"pro-life\" while ordering policies that broke up the families of immigrants and asylum seekers. Biden's election was welcomed by the Vatican \u2014 but without mention of his support for abortion rights, says Villanova University theology professor Massimo Faggioli. \"It's clear that they see this moment as a return to some sanity. This is what the Vatican really holds dear,\" says Faggioli, \"so that that there is a predictability in the relations between countries and leaders.\" Faggioli, the author of Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States, argues that under the influence of the previous two papacies, the U.S. Catholic Church leadership became increasingly traditionalist, ignoring any discourse on racism, rule of law or voting rights \u2014 and has thus become more closely allied with the political right. He points out that Biden and the pope share the same detractors among American Catholic leaders \u2014 the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which he says \"is dominated by ultraconservative Catholic bishops whose political sympathies lie very clearly with the Republican Party, and not just on the abortion issue.\" The Vatican was reportedly annoyed by a bishops' conference statement on Inauguration Day. Signed by the group's leader, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 H. Gomez, the statement lamented that \"our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.\" It added that \"for the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the preeminent priority.\" An unnamed senior Vatican official told the Catholic publication America, \"It is most unfortunate and is likely to create even greater divisions within the Church in the United States.\" \"So, there is an extremist wing of the Catholic Church,\" says Faggioli, \"which is a handful of bishops, but a bigger chunk of the clergy.\" For example, last August, the Rev. James Altman of La Crosse, Wisc., posted a video to YouTube in which he proclaimed, \"You cannot be Catholic and be a Democrat, period. Their party platform absolutely is against everything the Catholic Church teaches. Repent of your support of that party and its platform or face the fires of hell.\" It has been viewed more than a million times. Not all conservative Catholics strike such an apocalyptic tone toward Democrats. But many share a message of condemnation. In a podcast last month with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, George Weigel, an author and political analyst who has written extensively about the Catholic Church, said the new president seems quite sincere in his personal piety. But he went on to attack Biden, saying he \"facilitates grave moral evils. Mr. Biden is an incoherent Catholic and incoherent Catholics should not be presenting themselves for Holy Communion as if they were living in full communion with the church.\" As both Francis and Biden ignore their Catholic critics, presidential historian Timothy Naftali sees potential parallels now with a period at the peak of the Cold War six decades ago. Six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation in 1962, Pope John XXIII issued the Pacem in Terris encyclical. Addressed not just to Catholics but to all people \"of good will,\" it called for peacemaking through negotiation. A week later, President John F. Kennedy cited the document in a major speech, and was subsequently able to win domestic support for a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Naftali believes the pope and Biden could join forces against climate change \u2014 the great threat facing humanity today. \"Given the prominence of Pope Francis on this issue, the fact that he has identified climate change as an existential threat,\" says Naftali, \"there is a natural partnership with a secular leader who has also identified climate change as an existential threat. These are two leaders powerful in different realms. That's an opportunity. And it's not an opportunity that comes every generation.\" Naftali is convinced that amid so much disinformation on the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, these two prominent Catholics could also work together to convince more people that science and faith are not mutually exclusive.",

President-elect Joe Biden plans to send a sweeping immigration proposal to Congress after he is sworn into office on Wednesday, a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The proposal would need to be approved by Congress, which balked at similar reforms proposed by former President Barack Obama in 2013. But the plan, which also would also immediately protect millions of people from being deported, marks a dramatic shift from President Trump's hardline policies that made life increasingly more difficult for people living in the country without legal status. \"This legislation provides new pathways to citizenship, promotes smart border controls, and ... addresses the root causes of migration,\" said Susan Rice, Biden's incoming domestic policy adviser, on a call with reporters previewing the new administration's Day 1 actions. \"The bill also creates an earned path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers and essential workers who risk their lives to serve and protect American communities,\" she said. The proposal calls for a fast-track to citizenship for young \"Dreamer\" immigrants brought to the country by their parents, as well as certain farm workers and past recipients of Temporary Protected Status \u2014 such as people who fled wars. This group would be able to get green cards immediately and could apply for citizenship after three years. Other undocumented immigrants could apply for green cards after five years, and then three years afterward could apply for citizenship. In all cases, immigrants would need to pass background checks and pay their taxes. The Biden administration is under pressure from immigration activists to take broad steps to protect those in the United States illegally, concerned that Biden won't move fast enough on campaign pledges. Their unease dates back to 2008 when the Obama administration pursued priorities other than immigration reform early in his term when Democrats held the majority in both the House and Senate. Biden's plan would focus on family reunification and also increase the diversity visa program, which the Trump administration sought to eliminate, boosting available spots to 80,000 visa per year, up from 55,000 visas. The bill also calls for $4 billion to be spent over four years on aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to help the nations address problems spurring migration to the United States. The bill also would replace the term \"alien\" in U.S. immigration laws with \"noncitizen.\" Biden's incoming team said it plans to boost technology at the border to increase security, among other measures, but there were few immediate details. Officials briefing reporters did not say whether the plan would propose more funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which enforces much of the country's immigration laws. One official said there is currently $26 billion allocated for immigration enforcement right now, and said it would be up to Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's Cabinet nominee for the Department for Homeland Security, on how best to spend that money. Separate from the bill, Biden also plans to sign executive actions on Wednesday to reverse Trump's travel ban on a group of primarily Muslim nations, repeal Trump's hardline immigration enforcement orders, stop construction of his wall on the southern border with Mexico, among other measures.",

            "article_content": "The Asian population in Fort Bend County is Texas' largest. When the Texas Legislature met to redraw congressional maps, many Asian Americans hoped it would reflect that. That didn't happen.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: People of color accounted for virtually all of Texas' population growth over the past 10 years, yet when lawmakers meant to redraw the state's congressional maps, they actually created more white-majority districts. The Justice Department is now suing Texas for violating the voting rights of its Latino and Black citizens, but the suit only makes passing mention of one of the state's fastest-growing racial groups - Asian Americans. Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider has more. ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, sits at the heart of Texas' 22nd Congressional District. It's home to the state's biggest Asian American population, including large numbers of immigrants. So when the Texas Legislature met to redraw congressional maps, many Asian Americans hoped Texas-22 would reflect that. But that didn't happen, says Nabila Mansoor. NABILA MANSOOR: What's actually happened is that, even though we've seen the population grow and really been charged by immigrants, those lines, when they were redrawn, have been redrawn in a way such that it's actually diluted our power. SCHNEIDER: Mansoor is a resident of Sugar Land, where she met me at a restaurant. She's headed the local chapter of Asian American Democrats of Texas and was redrawn out of the 22nd District. MANSOOR: Sugar Land is a very Asian American-heavy city, and yet it is divvied up in three districts such that its immigrant population has lost out on the chance to get some real representation. SCHNEIDER: Texas-22 was a safe Republican congressional seat for decades, reelecting such conservative stalwarts as Tom DeLay and Pete Olson. But in 2018 and 2020, the district became highly competitive. Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni came close to flipping the seat both years thanks in no small part to the near doubling of the Asian American population in Fort Bend County. But attorney and activist Niloufar Hafizi says Republicans have made sure that won't happen in 2022. NILOUFAR HAFIZI: Our concerns are that it has been redrawn explicitly to keep Troy Nehls in office as a Republican. SCHNEIDER: And how would it do that? HAFIZI: I don't know how to say this in a different way, but it whitens the district. SCHNEIDER: Craig Goodman teaches political science at the University of Houston at Victoria. CRAIG GOODMAN: Under the old boundaries, you know, this was basically a 50-50 district - Democrat and Republican at the presidential level. With the new boundaries, it shifts the district that it's a plus-16 Republican district at the presidential level. SCHNEIDER: Goodman says Republicans did the same thing elsewhere. GOODMAN: From Dallas-Fort Worth to the 2nd Congressional District also in Houston, we're seeing this broader pattern of shoring up these districts that were trending Democratic and figuring out ways to kind of move enough voters around to basically allow Republicans to maintain the status quo. SCHNEIDER: That suits the 22nd's Republicans just fine. Precinct chairman David Vrshek says there's nothing wrong with Texas GOP lawmakers drawing boundaries that benefit them. Vrshek notes Democrats have done the same thing. DAVID VRSHEK: You know, they complain about redistricting in Texas, and at the same time, they're - they turn a blind eye to redistricting in Illinois and other places. SCHNEIDER: The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, associated with Princeton University, gave Illinois' congressional maps an F for partisan fairness, the same failing grade it gave Texas. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is moving ahead with its lawsuit against Texas with scant reference to the Asian American community. But the community may have its day in court yet. The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund has filed its own legal challenge to the state's redistricting plans, saying CD-22 is a prime example of anti-Asian discrimination.

The Department of Justice has broken off negotiations to pay monetary damages to families who were forcibly separated at the border during the Trump administration. The negotiations, which began in the early months of the Biden administration, were aimed at settling claims brought by migrant families that were separated under the \"zero tolerance\" policy while seeking to enter the U.S. for asylum and other reasons. But government officials abruptly pulled the plug on all settlement talks on Thursday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, and one of the lead negotiators told NPR. Gelernt said the Justice Department did not explain why it was walking away from the talks. \"We can see no reason for this other than this administration does not want to use any political capital to help these children,\" Gelernt said in an interview. \"History will not judge this decision kindly.\" In a statement, the Department of Justice said the parties have been unable to reach a settlement, but \"we remain committed to engaging with the plaintiffs and to bringing justice to the victims of this abhorrent policy.\" The controversial immigration policy was dismantled within Biden's first week as president. In all, the Trump administration separated more than 5,000 families who crossed into the U.S. without visas. Under the policy adults who entered the U.S. from the southern border were prosecuted for illegal entry. Because children cannot be imprisoned with adults, the young kids were taken into separate federal facilities. Government reports ultimately found the administration had no clear plan nor had it allocated resources to help reunite parents or guardians with their children when it implemented the zero tolerance enforcement policy. Hundreds of families remain separated, many more say they are still suffering the effects of the separation. More than 100 have brought claims seeking monetary damages from the government, Gelernt said. Republicans and Democrats appeared united against the draconian policy, calling it a humanitarian failure. President Biden called it a \"moral and national shame.\" And settlement talks proceeded quietly behind closed doors for several months \u2014 until October, when the Wall Street Journal broke the story that financial compensation amounts could reach as high as $450,000 per person in some cases. At that point, the negotiations became a political liability for Biden and his administration who came under fire by Republicans in Washington. Lawyers representing families who'd been torn apart, have insisted most settlement amounts would be far lower, But the story generated enormous outrage among GOP members, who tried to link the issue to the soaring number of arrests at the southern border. They argued that giving large cash settlements to migrant families would encourage more illegal immigration. In a Department of Homeland Security hearing on immigration last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he takes the entire concept of compensation as a personal affront. \"As you can imagine, many Americans think it's a pretty outrageous idea to offer massive taxpayer funded payments to illegal immigrants who broke our laws,\" Grassley told DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, blaming the Biden administration for the current immigration crisis. Grassley noted that the families of service members who die on active duty receive a tax repayment of $100,000. \"Under what circumstances, if any do you think it's appropriate for an illegal immigrant who broke our laws to receive more money from the government than the family of a fallen service member,\" he asked. Biden administration officials and the president himself were asked frequently about the settlement talks, which appeared likely to become an election-year issue in 2022. Lawyers representing the families say they're deeply disappointed and contend everyone who was a victim of the zero tolerance approach deserves recompense, including financial settlements. They also say the government could easily wind up spending even more money fighting these cases than if it had simply reached a settlement. The Women's Refugee Commission condemned the decision by the Justice Department to pull out of the negotiations. \"This move is a shameful, profound betrayal of the government's responsibility to redress the harms of this heinous policy,\" Katharina Obser, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program with the group, said in a statement. \"While the U.S. can never undo what happened, we expected the Biden administration to engage in good faith with efforts for redress and repair,\" she said, adding that \"the cruelty of intentionally tearing families apart inflicted unspeakable and permanent trauma on children and their parents coming to the U.S. border seeking safety.\" Kathryn Hampton, deputy director of the Physicians for Human Rights Asylum Program, also noted the long term effects of the separation on children. The organization has documented the psychological harms and trauma many have suffered, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety. \"Instead of bowing to right-wing ideologues, the Biden administration should pursue justice and accountability for the deeply traumatized children and parents who endured these atrocious acts perpetrated by the United States government,\" Hampton said in a statement. The Biden administration says it will continue to identify and reunify families that were separated under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the ACLU is in negotiations with the administration over other issues, including the possibility of legal status for separated families. Those talks will continue, Gelernt said \u2014 but the end of financial negotiations won't make them any easier.",

U.S. officials have accused Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of taking advantage of desperate migrants. The White House has become increasingly concerned about migration being used as a weapon. U.S. officials have accused Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of being the latest to take advantage of desperate migrants. They say he helped bring migrants from war-torn nations to the Belarus border in order to create a humanitarian crisis and put political pressure on his European neighbors. \"People are being used as pawns in a terrible, terrible game,\" said Ivo Daalder, who served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration. \"It takes a particularly evil mind. It takes a particularly evil mindset to see that people and their vulnerability and humanity can actually be used as a means to achieve political ends.\" It takes a particularly evil mindset to see that people and their vulnerability and humanity can actually be used as a means to achieve political ends. Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO It's the kind of geopolitical tool that the White House is concerned could be used even more as increased instability and climate change drive more people from their homes. The world was shocked last month by images of desperate people from Africa, the Middle East and as far away as Cuba trapped \u2014 and dying \u2014 in the cold forest trying to cross the border into Poland. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, traveled to Washington, D.C., late last month to discuss the crisis with President Biden. She called it a \"hybrid attack.\" \"This is not a migration crisis,\" she told reporters at the White House. \"This is an attempt by an authoritarian regime to try to destabilize its democratic neighbors. This will not succeed.\" The U.S. later joined the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada in imposing new sanctions on Belarus officials and organizations accused of facilitating the transportation of migrants to the border. They were just the latest in series of sanctions allies have slapped on Belarus over political repression and corruption since Lukashenko's controversial 2020 election, which the United States and European Union say was fraudulent. But Karolina \u0141ukasiewicz, a fellow at the Centre of Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, said Lukashenko succeeded in getting some recognition from the European and the international community. \"Until very recently, European leaders has not been speaking to Lukashenko,\" she said. \"He was not recognized as a legal president.\" She says world leaders are talking to him now, noting his call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, before she left office. \"So you can say it's already working,\" \u0141ukasiewicz said.

She also accused the Polish government of taking advantage of the crisis to build support among anti-migrant groups in Poland and distract from criticism over its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lukashenko is not the first leader to see opportunity in a migration crisis. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used Syrian refugees fleeing a civil war to push for billions in payments and political concessions from the European Union. Daalder says the practice is part of an increasing trend of using migrants in asymmetric warfare. \"What we're seeing is certain leaders being willing to find another tool to gain leverage over a stronger adversary and to do so in ways that might not have been conceivable,\" he said. The White House has taken notice. It put out a report this fall warning that increasing climate-related migration could be used by malign actors to \"induce political instability in several ways.\" \"Large migration flows are frequently framed as a threat to both domestic and international stability and social cohesion,\" the authors write.

She accused Belarus of making a \"hybrid attack.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen speaks outside the White House on Nov. 10. She accused Belarus of making a \"hybrid attack.\" The United Nations reports that an average of 21.5 million people were displaced a year since 2010 by floods, storms, wildfires and extreme temperatures. The White House estimates that tens of millions more will likely be displaced over the next two to three decades because of climate change. One big concern is that adversaries like Russia and China could try to take advantage of migration, particularly migration caused by climate change. The White House says Russia is already trying to benefit from anti-migrant sentiment in Europe. And China is looking to curry favor by providing support for countries \"grappling with political unrest related to migration.\" Sherri Goodman, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said China is using all its \"instruments of political influence.\" Goodman, who was one of the first to make the case that migration caused by climate change is a threat to national security, says China is actively building up its soft power with small nations in the South Pacific threatened by climate change. \"If it comes in as the rescuer \u2014 'I'm going to improve your infrastructure or I'm going to provide you fresh water where you're running out' \u2014 that is compelling to countries that are increasingly at risk,\" Goodman said. The White House emphasizes it's not just a problem overseas. Migration from Central America is a huge political challenge in the U.S. \u2014 and could be exploited by adversaries. And that's more reason the White House argues the U.S. should model good, humane practices for the rest of the world. \"Policy responses in the developed world will have a direct impact on political stability elsewhere,\" the White House report states.",

            "article_content": "An extreme-right TV commentator has thrown the political world in France into turmoil by launching a presidential campaign ahead of next April's election.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The presidential race in France is being shaken up by an unexpected but not unknown candidate - longtime right-wing journalist and TV pundit Eric Zemmour. He is now taking his incendiary rhetoric on the campaign trail, where he's being met by eager crowds. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley went to a rally near Paris and brings us more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC ZEMMOUR: (Speaking French). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: \"They thought they'd muzzle us by sticking us out here, far from their upscale neighborhoods and their media. But they were wrong,\" Zemmour told the crowd. (APPLAUSE) BEARDSLEY: Fearing clashes with anti-fascist demonstrators, authorities did move Zemmour's rally to a convention hall out near the airport. But this only added to the feeling among Zemmour supporters that they're being muzzled by the elites in power. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Booing). BEARDSLEY: Sixty-four-year-old retired policeman Jacques Severine says they came out to defend the values of France. JACQUES SEVERINE: (Through interpreter) Everything is being trashed - our traditions, way of life, culture. And no politician in the last 40 years has had the courage to stop it. There are cities that no longer look like France anymore. Immigrants no longer assimilate. They impose their way of life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BEARDSLEY: Zemmour's campaign video played on giant screens, contrasting images of France's cultural and historical riches - Notre Dame, Versailles and Joan of Arc - with more recent scenes of migrant encampments and hooded youths wreaking chaos on city streets. Zemmour has framed next April's election as a struggle for the soul of France. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZEMMOUR: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: The wiry, bespectacled intellectual is not your typical populist. He's the son of immigrants who came from Algeria in the 1960s during that country's war of independence from France. And while antisemitism has long been a feature of the French far right, Eric Zemmour is Jewish. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZEMMOUR: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"They say I'm a racist,\" he jokes with the crowd. \"Me - a little Berber Jew from the other side of the Mediterranean.\" (APPLAUSE) BEARDSLEY: Twenty-four-year-old Antoine Cohen is a member of Generation Zemmour, the campaign's youth wing. He says Zemmour is different because he's not a professional politician. ANTOINE COHEN: (Through interpreter) He's the one who best understands what's at stake - the great replacement and the great downgrading. We're exiles in our own country. And France is slipping internationally because of globalization and the loss of sovereignty. BEARDSLEY: Many supporters here have come from the mainstream right, which they say has let them down. Others voted Marine Le Pen, the long standard-bearer of the far right in France. But they say she's watered down her ideology and is not sharp enough to take on Macron. Political analyst Christian Makarian says Le Pen has been blindsided by Zemmour. CHRISTIAN MAKARIAN: She cannot criticize openly Eric Zemmour because she knows that a significant part of Eric Zemmour's audience is supposed also to vote for her. BEARDSLEY: Makarian says the French electorate has moved to the right in recent years, but their voting power lags behind because the mainstream and far right are not united. He says that can't happen as long as the Le Pen family dynasty holds on to the far right like its personal property. But Zemmour is changing that, he says, and making far-right views more acceptable to conservative voters. MAKARIAN: He's potentially the game-changer of the right. If he succeeds in beating Marine Le Pen, for instance, it will change the rules inside the right camp. BEARDSLEY: President Emmanuel Macron, a centrist, is counting on the unelectability of Marine Le Pen if they face off in the second round of next year's vote. But if the right camps come together, says Makarian, Macron knows he will be beaten. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. (SOUNDBITE OF BLOCKHEAD'S \"CARNIVORES UNITE\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with U.S. Special Envoy for Belarus Julie Fisher about the migrant crisis along the Belarus-Poland border.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: To news now that Belarus has cleared the migrant camps at its border with Poland. These are the camps that have been at the center of what has blown up into both a humanitarian crisis and a standoff between the government of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus and the West. European leaders accuse Lukashenko of trying to destabilize Europe, of weaponizing human desperation. And the U.S. says it stands with Poland, an EU member. Well, I want to bring in the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, Julie Fisher. She joins us from another of Belarus' neighbors, Lithuania. Ambassador, welcome. Good to talk to you again. JULIE FISHER: Thanks very much. It's a pleasure to be here. KELLY: Let's start with these reports that camps have been cleared. They come via the Belarussian state news agency. And I wonder, can you confirm them? How significant a development would this be? FISHER: Well, I'm not sure that I can confirm that the camps have been cleared as if it is something that is completed. What I have seen are reports that at least one flight in fact departed Minsk this afternoon and returned and flew to Baghdad carrying close to 400 passengers. I understand that perhaps as many as 500 were looking to leave. And I am aware and closely following reports that migrants have been provided shelter on the ground. So it's not entirely clear that this is something that has been completed, but we're going to continue to monitor it very closely. KELLY: Yeah. The EU, as you know, says that this is a totally manufactured crisis and manufactured by Lukashenko, who's been luring migrants on flights coming in from the Middle East and beyond and then pushing them to try to cross into Europe. Is there any doubt in your mind that this is a manufactured crisis? FISHER: I'm sorry to say that, no, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a fully manufactured crisis. And it's really important that what we not do is sort of fall into the trap of thinking that there is a migrant crisis and somehow that is separate from the political crisis that Belarus is facing. There is a migrant crisis because there is a political crisis in Belarus. It is because of the instability. It is because of the violence and the repression that Alexander Lukashenko has brought to bear in the aftermath of a fraudulent election and how the West has responded to that that, in fact, Lukashenko has taken this additional - moved to this hybrid tactic. KELLY: I want to get to what the U.S. role is here and what yours is. I addressed you as ambassador at the beginning. I just looked. Your verified Twitter account is the official account of the U.S. Ambassador to Belarus. FISHER: Yes. KELLY: But you're not in Belarus. You're next door in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. This is because... FISHER: Yes. KELLY: ...They won't let you in? FISHER: There has been a series of steps with regards to my deployment to Minsk over the course of this year. I was confirmed by the Senate at the end of 2020. And what became increasingly clear as Lukashenko increased the violence, as he increased the number of political prisoners that he was holding, he also became increasingly intolerant of those who have views that are independent or distinct from his. And we have seen the repression he has brought to bear on his own people. We've also seen a growing intolerance for Western diplomats. So what was initially a reluctance to issue a visa then turned into the revocation of their official agreement to accept me as an ambassador. KELLY: Has there been any contact between the U.S. and the Lukashenko regime during this crisis? FISHER: There - look, we maintain diplomatic relations. So there is a certain level of discussion. I would not characterize it as particularly robust, but we have not severed diplomatic relations with Belarus, and they still maintain an embassy in Washington. And we still have diplomats on the ground in Minsk working incredibly hard and under very difficult circumstances to advance our interests there. KELLY: I'm asking in part because Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor, has been on the phone this week with Lukashenko. FISHER: Yes. KELLY: I'm curious what the U.S. take on that is and whether it raises any worries that getting a phone call from Angela Merkel gives Lukashenko legitimacy, gives some kind of recognition that he is the de facto leader of Belarus, which is what he wants? FISHER: Underlying that call, I fundamentally see a leader who is a humanitarian and is focused on the humanitarian question around those who are suffering in the cold and who are hungry. And I think that everyone who has looked at the pictures can understand that instinct. I think it's incredibly important to recognize the patterns that Lukashenko has built over decades. The question of whether or not it is possible to make arrangements to try to resolve one discrete issue, whether he can be trusted to live up to any such agreements, you know, these are questions that, you know... KELLY: And whether direct contact does give him legitimacy, which is something that the U.S. and the West has resisted. FISHER: And I think that Europe, to a large extent, continues that policy. I think that the decision that came out of the European Union on Monday with regards to Belarus announcing their expectation for another round of sanctions in the near future, I think, you know, spoke incredibly clearly that the unity of the 27 on this question - we have been clear that we intend to roll out additional sanctions with them. And I think that Europe's view has not changed. KELLY: Does the U.S. have any leverage here aside from sanctions, which so far have not achieved the desired U.S. result in Belarus? FISHER: Sanctions are an incredibly effective tool. And I will tell you that I believe that Belarus is one of those cases where we have seen sanctions drive to specific results. We have seen our sanctions effective at gaining the release of political prisoners. I think it's really important to note that. I also think that sanctions aren't a tool that work overnight. Our most significant sanctions, we really started to roll those out just this summer. So I believe it's a little too early to say that our sanctions aren't yielding results. KELLY: Last question - you tweeted yesterday, Belarus' best days are ahead, and we'll get there together. What gives you confidence that Belarus has good days ahead? FISHER: I think the thing that gives me real confidence about this is the Belarusians with whom I have the opportunity to interact. There are so many Belarusians who have been driven out of their country because of the climate in Belarus and that - many of them have found a home here in Lithuania. There are also many in Poland. They're in Ukraine. There are also many in Georgia and in other countries. I've had the opportunity to meet and to hear from them and to learn. I see what a deeply engaged generation is coming up in Belarus; how they are motivated to build a better future for their country; how they understand that 27 years of Alexander Lukashenko's rule, it may have yielded much for Alexander Lukashenko and for his family, but it hasn't yielded so much for the average Belarusian. I see that Belarusians care an awful lot about the economy and COVID and all the things we all care about. And there's - you know, they're being held back right now. I know that there's opportunity for them in the future. KELLY: Julie Fisher is the U.S. special envoy for Belarus. She spoke to us from next door in Lithuania. Julie Fisher, thank you. FISHER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO'S \"SECOND SUN\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Chile holds the first round of its presidential election Sunday. A far-right candidate is the unexpected front-runner.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: We turn now to Chile, where there is a presidential election on Sunday. Voters will decide who should replace the unpopular multimillionaire Sebastian Pinera. As NPR's Philip Reeves reports, Sunday's vote is the first round in a contest that has taken an unexpected tilt towards the far right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Speaking Spanish). PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Two years ago, millions took to the streets of Chile. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: The protests went on for weeks. DIEGO LEPPEZ: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: There are problems with the current government, says Diego Leppez, who took part in that uprising. He lost an eye to a missile fired by the police. Even after that, he carried on protesting, believing this would end social inequality and bury the economic model imposed decades ago by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. These days, Leppez isn't sure his sacrifice was worth it. He says his life hasn't improved. LEPPEZ: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: He's still suffering psychological trauma from his injury, he says. At 29, he's struggling to hold down jobs. Now Leppez is watching with alarm as Chile enters a presidential election in which an unexpected frontrunner is Jose Antonio Kast, a candidate from the far right. ROBERT FUNK: Jose Antonio Kast belongs to a political family. His brother was a minister during the dictatorship of Pinochet. REEVES: Robert Funk is a political scientist at the University of Chile. He explains that Kast is a 55-year-old lawyer who used to be a mainstream congressman. In 2018, he set up his own party and shifted ground. FUNK: Kast has moved from a more traditional kind of Chilean right to what you might want to call something like a populist, nationalist right, which is the kind of right we've seen emerging in other places like Brazil and the States, places in Europe. REEVES: When Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was elected, Kast wasted no time in visiting, says Funk. As for Donald Trump, Kast has a less strident style than him, but he shares some of Trump's views. FUNK: One of his proposals is to build a ditch or a moat on the northern border to prevent immigrants from slipping through. So we can - you know, you can imagine where he gets that idea from. REEVES: It's the final televised presidential debate. Seven candidates are running. All eyes are on Kast. A moderator challenges Kast over complaints he's made about what he calls Chile's gay lobby. \"Isn't that discriminatory,\" she says. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). JOSE ANTONIO KAST: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: \"Why,\" Kast says. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). KAST: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: \"There is a gay lobby,\" he says. The other favorite in the race weighs in. Gabriel Boric is a former student leader who's only 35. He heads a leftist coalition allied to the Communist Party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: Boric quotes passages from Kast's program about banning same-sex marriage, cracking down on left-wing activists and scrapping Chile's ministry for women. Kast's rise is a departure from 2019, when Chileans appeared to be tilting leftwards. They demanded government provide decent health care and pensions and later elected a people's assembly to rewrite the Pinochet-era constitution. Yet the picture was always more complicated than that, says political analyst Lisa Zanotti. LISA ZANOTTI: I wouldn't say that the ideology of the people who took the streets was, like, necessarily left-wing. So I think it was a sort of protest of the people versus the elite. REEVES: Kast's success is still far from certain. Polling in Chile is often inaccurate, and analysts think he may struggle in the second round. Diego Leppez, the protester who lost an eye, hopes they're correct. LEPPEZ: (Speaking Spanish). REEVES: He says he'd rather leave Chile than be ruled by President Kast. Philip Reeves, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Some European countries have accused Russia of encouraging Belarus in its strategy of trying to push migrants across its border with the EU, but the Kremlin says it's not involved.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: There seems to be no end in sight for the migrant crisis on the border between Belarus and Poland. The EU has accused Belarus of enticing the migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to fly there and then try to enter the EU through Belarus. But Poland is blocking the migrants and accusing Belarus and its ally, Russia, of using the migrants as pawns in an attempt to destabilize the EU - lots of complex things going on there. NPR's Charles Maynes joins us from Moscow to explain. Hey, Charles. CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Hi there. Good to be with you. KELLY: Start with the latest - just what is happening at the border today. MAYNES: You know, well, today we saw - Belarusian state media showed videos of migrants being taken to a shelter inside a logistics center near the Polish border. This is the first time many have spent the night indoors since arriving to Belarus in this quest to make it from their home countries to the EU. Now, I should say the shelter for migrants seemed awfully well-timed. Western film crews were allowed near the border to witness the migrants there, to film and see what was happening. They also were there to see Polish border guards firing water cannons and smoke grenades at the migrants as they made a run for the border. So, you know, it just seemed like a media event designed to present Belarus as much more humane than the EU. It has the added benefit, I suppose, of delegitimizing Europe as an alternative model in the eyes of Lukashenko supporters - this is the Belarusian leader - saying, look how, you know, they treat these migrants. Look at these sort of fake European values - so ultimately, just an attempt, I think, to win the optics of this crisis. KELLY: Now, to the claims that the EU is making that Lukashenko manufactured this on purpose - I know he denies it. However, reporters are finding some evidence that suggest there may be something there. If it is true, why? What does he get out of this? MAYNES: The roots of this really go back to the 2020 presidential elections. Lukashenko claimed to have won the election in a landslide. Many in Belarus and certainly the West disagree. The EU and the U.S. have both refused to recognize Lukashenko and sanctioned his regime for a brutal crackdown against the thousands of people that really has kept him in power over the past year. And so along comes this migrant surge, and it's a way to punish Europe for recognizing his political opposition. It's a way to force them to recognize him as the legitimate leader and maybe even demand sanctions relief. I spoke with Artyom Shraibman. He's a Belarusian analyst now with the Moscow Carnegie Center who argues that, you know, fundamentally, this is a plea for dialogue - his quote - by Lukashenko. ARTYOM SHRAIBMAN: He wants to be appreciated. He wants to be, if not respected or admired, then at least treated as someone who is necessary, who is, like, indispensable for the stability in the region. MAYNES: So in other words, Lukashenko is creating chaos to show how good things were before he was forced to act out. KELLY: And then we're talking about a crisis on the border between Poland and Belarus. What is Russia's role here? What is Vladimir Putin's stake in all this? MAYNES: Well, you know, Russia says it has nothing to do with this crisis, but Belarus certainly is a Kremlin client state. But that doesn't mean that Lukashenko does everything that Russia or the Kremlin or Putin tells him to. In fact, it can be almost a little entertaining to watch how much Lukashenko seems to drive Russian President Vladimir Putin crazy. You know, when you watch them during press conferences or when they have to make appearances together, Putin rolls his eyes and kind of sighs as Lukashenko gives these long, long answers. And it just seems like he can't stand him. And yet, Russia offers him political support time and time again. Well, why is that? Well, Lukashenko in power means Belarus is safely seen as a buffer against the West, against NATO. And the Kremlin clearly saw this kind of Ukraine-type scenario - in other words, a popular uprising in the events in Belarus over this past year. They simply don't trust the opposition. So Putin is essentially stuck with Lukashenko, at least until he can find a better option. And Lukashenko, through his prison system, you know, he does a pretty good job making sure there are no other options. KELLY: NPR's Charles Maynes giving us the view from Moscow. Thank you, Charles.

A standoff between migrants and Polish border guards has become the biggest challenge to the EU's borders in years. The crisis appears to be stoked by the leader of Belarus over the country's tensions with the bloc. Poland's defense minister said on Wednesday that the crisis at the border with Belarus, where thousands of migrants are trying to cross, could take months to resolve, even as there were signs that the confrontation might be ratcheting down. Although some have managed to cross the border with Belarus in recent weeks, Poland has now strengthened its border fence and closed crossings in response to what is widely seen as a manufactured crisis by Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who is accused of using the migrants as pawns in a game of blackmail with the EU. Here's a look at how the crisis started, and what Belarus appears to be trying to accomplish. Since early this month, a wave of migrants from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries, have been camped in the sprawling Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest at the border in freezing temperatures. They are hoping to cross into Poland. Belarus has been accused of encouraging migrants to fly to its capital Minsk, before pushing them toward the border with Poland, and even encouraging them to clash with Polish authorities. It's a  charge than Lukashenko's regime has denied. The standoff has seen Polish border guards using water cannons and tear gas this week to turn back stone-throwing migrants on the Belarus side. Belarus is not a European Union member, but Poland is. For the migrants, Poland represents a doorway to the EU and the promise of a better life. Although only about 3,000 to 4,000 migrants are trying to cross, it has become the biggest challenge to the EU's borders since 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants gathered in Turkey to cross over into Europe. More than a million migrants were eventually allowed into the bloc. The body of Gaylan Delir Ismael, 25, from Iraq's Kurdish region, arrives at Irbil Airport, Iraq, early Monday. Like thousands of other Iraqis and Syrians, Gaylan had traveled to Belarus on an easily obtained tourist visa in the hope of getting to Germany and starting a new life. But he never made it there, dying in a dark and soggy forest on the Belarus-Poland border.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The body of Gaylan Delir Ismael, 25, from Iraq's Kurdish region, arrives at Irbil Airport, Iraq, early Monday. Like thousands of other Iraqis and Syrians, Gaylan had traveled to Belarus on an easily obtained tourist visa in the hope of getting to Germany and starting a new life. But he never made it there, dying in a dark and soggy forest on the Belarus-Poland border. \"It's a terrible situation,\" for those caught in the forests without food or proper clothing, says Hanna Liubakova, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. Many of them were lured there by Belarus, the EU says. Liubakova tells NPR that tourism agencies in Belarus have offered promises that \"it would take only a few hours to get through the forest and swamps,\" to cross the border. For most, she says, Poland is seen as only a first stop in the EU. They are hoping to settle in countries such as Germany. Several migrants trapped at the border and living in the open or in makeshift tents have died in the freezing conditions. People are being \"duped\" says Emre Peker, the Europe director at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

Some are coming from not so ideal backgrounds and circumstances,\" Peker tells NPR. \"They're paying good money to take that risk and to try and make a make a better life for themselves.\" Last month, NPR spoke with two migrants from Cuba, Doniel Machado Pujol and Raydel Aparicio Bringa, who said they'd survived on river water and kernels of raw corn and slept under piles of leaves before they were apprehended by Polish police. \"We flew from Havana to Moscow, and then a man picked us up and drove us to Belarus, and that's where our journey got a lot worse,\" Machado Pujol, injured and malnourished, told NPR's Rob Schmitz. Russia is a close ally of Belarus, and Moscow is \"a significant transit hub,\" Peker says. \"Russia has so far not shown any desire or willingness to scale back flights to and from the Middle-East and Minsk to sort of curb the arrival of these would-be migrants.\" This week, Polish guards used water cannons and tear gas against stone-throwing migrants at the Kuznica-Bruzgi border crossing. These are the kind of scenes that appear to play into the hands of Lukashenko, who is angry at the EU for sanctions imposed on his regime in the wake of Aug. 2020 elections. Lukashenko, who has held power in Belarus for more than a quarter century, was returned last year for a sixth-term as president in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent.

What followed was a violent crackdown on dissent amid anti-government demonstrations that followed the fraudulent poll. In May, Belarus forced an international flight to land in the Belarussian capital of Minsk so that authorities there could arrest journalist Roman Protasevich, the former editor and founder of an opposition blog and social media channel, who was aboard the Ryanair jet. The brazen act prompted the EU to impose retaliatory sanctions. Shortly after, Lukashenko then hinted at his ability to quickly gin up a migrant crisis against his EU neighbors \u2014 Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. \"Lukashenko wants to show his revenge for sanctions,\" says Liubakova of the Eurasia Center. But the leader also wants to switch the discussion from political prisoners, torture and repression under his rule to something external, she says: \"He wants to focus to refocus the situation and force the West to see the crisis at the border and ignore the human rights situation in Belarus.\" But the Belarusian leader \u2014 a virtual pariah except for Russia \u2014 has also been diplomatically isolated since last year's election. \"His key aim is to restore contact with European leaders,\" Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, tells NPR. \"He understands force... and believes that [the EU] can be forced to restore dialogue,\" Samorukov says. The EU is planning additional sanctions against Belarus in response to the migrant crisis. But since sanctions are a main reason that the situation has come to a head, it's not clear how much impact they would have. Meanwhile, outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the situation on Monday with Lukashenko in a rare phone call between the two leaders. Germany would likely receive the largest influx of any new migrants if Poland opened its doors. She and Lukashenko agreed that the situation needed to be defused, but Lukashenko said he and Merkel did not see eye to eye on how the migrants got to Belarus, according to Deutsche Welle. Their talk appears to have helped de-escalate the situation at the border amid reports that Belarus is putting migrants on buses to be transported out of the area. Merkel also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, asking him to use his leverage on Lukashenko. So, Lukashenko has succeeded in re-opening dialogue, but it's unclear where that might lead, given continued international distaste for his heavy-handed and undemocratic tactics. Meanwhile, the fate of the migrants is also unclear. Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells NPR's Morning Edition that \"both sides of this abject power play should take responsibility for these migrants, who are vulnerable people.\" \"They are men, women and children that have now come in some kind of a political crossfire,\" Egeland says. \"The European Union and Poland are obligated to hear the case of asylum-seekers. That's international law. And Belarus and Russia have to stop this using them as pawns on some kind of a chessboard.\"",

            "article_content": "Poland is sending more troops to its border with Belarus. Thousands of migrants are trying to cross the frontier there, apparently at the instigation of the Belarusian regime.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Poland has closed one of its main border crossings with its neighbor, Belarus, after thousands of migrants arrived in the area seeking to cross into the European Union. It's the latest step to try and curb an influx of migrants who are getting assistance from the Belarusian regime. NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us now to talk about all this. Hey, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So can you just paint us a picture here? What's been happening at the border? SCHMITZ: Yeah, we've gotten a lot of videos recently from the Belarusian border with Poland, and it's showing - the latest video shows hundreds of migrants attempting to destroy the razor wire fence separating the two countries by throwing cut-down trees on top of it, cutting it and then when some of them make it across, they're pushed back by Polish soldiers. CHANG: Wait, so can you just explain why is Belarus pushing migrants into Poland? SCHMITZ: Well, this started after the EU placed sanctions on Belarus over its crackdown on protests against Lukashenko's claim that he won last year's election. International observers say the election was rigged. Lukashenko's government responded by issuing visas to thousands of people from war-torn and impoverished countries in the Middle East, Africa and beyond, and then arranging travel for them. After they arrived, migrants are typically bussed to the border, where soldiers help them cross illegally into Poland. CHANG: And you were just there recently. How is Poland's government reacting to all of this? SCHMITZ: Yeah, Poland's government and the EU say Lukashenko's regime is attempting to destabilize Europe by weaponizing migrants. This has put Poland in a very difficult position. Most of these people are seeking asylum, and humanitarian groups say Poland is legally bound to hold asylum applicants while they process their requests. But instead, when Polish soldiers catch groups of migrants who've made it to Poland, they drive them back to the border and release them on the Belarusian side. But as we've seen in recent weeks, Belarusian soldiers are becoming more violent towards those who returned from Poland, often beating them and sending them back to Poland in what for many has become this vicious and deadly cycle. Several people have died. CHANG: Wow, this sounds absolutely terrifying for the migrants caught in the middle of all this. What have you heard from them directly? SCHMITZ: Yeah, I've heard awful stories of people walking for days through freezing swamps, living off of river water and raw corn from frozen farm fields, only to be caught and then sent back where soldiers beat people with batons. And there are many families who are trying to make this journey with young children. I met a Syrian family whose children nearly died of hypothermia before they were found. You know, this border area is filled with forests, swamps, and it's freezing. And the people crossing are from temperate climates. They are not prepared for this type of wilderness. CHANG: Well, meanwhile, I understand that Germany's government urged the EU today to do more to help Poland secure its border with Belarus. I mean, beyond that, what more can be done here? SCHMITZ: Yeah, Russia's government, which financially backs Lukashenko and his regime, came out today and suggested the EU provide financial assistance to Lukashenko in return for stopping this migration flow. But this has only made the EU angrier. They've likened this request to gangster behavior, and they're now threatening even more sanctions. Poland's parliament has voted to build an 18-foot-high wall along the border that would be completed by next summer. CHANG: That is NPR's Rob Schmitz joining us from Berlin. Thank you, Rob.

            "article_content": "Democrats say they are closing in on votes to turn much of President Biden's domestic agenda into law. Some Democrats say the bargaining has taken on a new urgency after Tuesday's election losses.  NOEL KING, HOST: Disappointing results for Democrats in this week's elections, like losing the governor's race in Virginia, may have lit a fire under them. At least, President Biden hopes so. He said yesterday, voters want Democrats to, quote, \"get things done.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: People need a little breathing room. They're overwhelmed. And what happened was, I think we have to just produce results for them to change their standard of living and give them a little more breathing room. KING: House Democrats want to pass legislation that commits resources to child care, cheaper drugs, better infrastructure and fighting climate change. And they say a vote is possible today. NPR Congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell is on this one. Good morning, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So House Democrats say the bill is done. What's in this version? SNELL: Well, this version is very similar to previous versions that we've seen. As you said, it does have measures like making child care more affordable and easier to access, has more than $500 billion to address climate change and funding for universal pre-K and affordable housing, among a lot of other things in this bill. But this new version also includes four weeks of paid family and medical leave and a new, much higher cap on state and local tax deductions. It was from a deal that was put together kind of to allow more Democrats to come on board. There was also a deal to allow some negotiation on the cost of drugs for Medicare patients, including a $35 monthly cap on expenditures on insulin. You know, the paid leave and prescription drug provisions have been left out of earlier versions of this framework, but they have a lot of support among House Democrats. KING: House Democrats - but would this pass in the Senate? SNELL: Well, possibly not exactly this version - you know, Joe Manchin of West Virginia still has issues with the paid leave portion. He says he wants to take it out and deal with it on a bipartisan basis. And Senators Bernie Sanders and Bob Menendez have a very different way of dealing with state and local tax deduction, which many critics say is a tax cut that mostly helps the wealthy. Plus, there's a whole process of making sure the bill sticks to Senate rules. And most Democrats say they think other elements, like funding for immigration reforms, could be stripped out of the bill that way. KING: How are Republicans characterizing their wins this week? SNELL: Well, you know, I've heard some say that they feel vindicated. They say Democrats are pursuing spending that makes - that they expect will make inflation worse. And they say all of the fighting between Democrats and the lack of action on this bill gives Republican candidates plenty to run against. You know, either way, they see a compelling narrative that they hope will win back voters who fled the party in 2020. They also see a chance to really make culture wars a focus of this election. You know, the concept of critical race theory and parental control of education became central in the Virginia governor's race, despite the fact that teachers and school boards say that critical race theory isn't currently being taught in Virginia schools. But that kind of messaging really got people excited, Republicans say. And that's something Democrats are watching closely. KING: NPR Congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell - thank you, Kelsey.

            "article_content": "Michelle Wu will be the next mayor of Boston, Mass. It's the first time the city had elected a mayor who is not a white man. She has promised universal preschool and a city-wide Green New Deal.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: A popular local politician and city councilor winning a mayoral race isn't so unusual in Boston. But the election of Michelle Wu, the 36-year-old daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, is making headlines because she's the first person elected to mayor there who is not a white man. WBUR's Anthony Brooks reports on what makes her historic victory a turning point. ANTHONY BROOKS, BYLINE: Michelle Wu will be the first woman and the first Asian American to lead Boston since the city elected its first mayor 200 years ago. Declaring victory last night, Wu said one of her young sons asked her if boys can be elected mayor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: They have been, and they will again someday, but not tonight. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING AND CLAPPING) BROOKS: Wu has been a city councilor since 2014. She grew up in Chicago and says running for mayor was never part of her plan. But when her mother suffered a mental health crisis, Wu became head of the family and a guardian of one of her sisters. She says the struggle to navigate broken health care and school systems pushed her into politics. Her campaign for mayor promised free public transportation, universal preschool and a citywide Green New Deal, which will not only plant trees but also tackle racial inequality and Boston's soaring rents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WU: We're ready to be a Boston that doesn't push people out but welcomes all who call our city home. And yes, Boston is ready to become a Green New Deal city. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING AND CLAPPING) BROOKS: Wu defeated fellow city councilor Annissa Essaibi George, an Arab American and a moderate Democrat. She called Wu's plans unworkable and too costly. She also made an issue of the fact that Wu came from Chicago. By contrast, Essaibi George is a local who leaned into her Boston roots and accent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANNISSA ESSAIBI GEORGE: I'm going to be the teacher and the mother and the mayor to get it done. BROOKS: That pitch worked for a core of Essaibi George's supporters, who are generally older, whiter and more conservative than Wu's. Teddy Ahern grew up in the same neighborhood as Essaibi George and refused to vote for Wu. TEDDY AHERN: She's promising things she can't deliver - Michelle Wu is. And I don't want a person from Chicago coming into my city and saying, oh, OK, you know what? I'll come here as a stepping stone. Like, why didn't they stay in Chicago and do it? BROOKS: Ahern was once part of a powerful voting bloc in Boston that elected white, Irish and Italian men to City Hall. But today, Boston is younger, more diverse, with a growing population of immigrants and progressives like Laurel Radwin, who embraced Wu's agenda. LAUREL RADWIN: I'm voting for Michelle because she understands that affordable housing is housing ownership. And the only way to decrease the racial wealth gap is through homeownership. BROOKS: In the end, Wu overwhelmed Essaibi George by more than 28 points. Now, Wu has just two weeks to assemble a team and take over City Hall. That will be her first big challenge as Boston's next mayor. For NPR News, I'm Anthony Brooks in Boston. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

People of color made history on election night in 2021, bringing diversity to leadership roles in some of America's biggest cities, and in some states as well. Boston, New York, Pittsburgh and Dearborn, Mich., were among the places that a majority of voters embraced minority candidates. Here's a rundown of some of the most high-profile wins \u2014 a list that we'll be updating as results continue to come in: The city councilor and daughter of Taiwanese immigrants broke Boston's 199-year streak of white, male city leaders. Michelle Wu defeated fellow Democratic City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George, a self-described first-generation Arab-Polish American. As NPR's Vanessa Romo reports, \"For many, the race came down to competing visions of the future with Essaibi George's version cast as more of the old guard and Wu's perceived as new-school Boston.\" Here are some of Wu's priorities. Pittsburgh native Ed Gainey, pictured during a visit to his former 4th-grade classroom, is the winner of the city's mayoral race.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Swensen/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pittsburgh native Ed Gainey, pictured during a visit to his former 4th-grade classroom, is the winner of the city's mayoral race. The western Pennsylvania metropolis, which is 23% Black, largely favored the Democrat Ed Gainey over Republican challenger Tony Moreno. Gainey was born and raised by a single mother in Pittsburgh, where he lived in public housing and later found a career in politics. \"We know how people have talked about Pittsburgh, how siloed it is, how segregated it is,\" Gainey told supporters on Tuesday, according to member station WESA. \"But today, you changed that.\" New Yorkers chose Democrat Eric Adams, a former police department captain, as the city's second Black mayor. It was lopsided victory for Adams, a former state senator who is currently the Brooklyn borough president. \"I am you,\" he told supporters Tuesday night, according to the Gothamist website. \"For a young man from south Jamaica Queens that grew up with all the challenges that New Yorkers face, it is not just a victory over adversity, it is a vindication of faith.\" Adams ran on a promise to improve public safety and fight gun violence and to boost the efficiency of the city's police force. More on the race here. The 39-year-old Democrat started his political career six years ago as an outsider, member station WVXU reports, and last night, he defeated 82-year-old opponent David Mann, \"a longtime pillar of Cincinnati City Hall.\" The Tibetan-Indian son of immigrants, Aftab Pureval, earned his law degree and worked for Procter & Gamble before running successfully for Hamilton County Clerk of Courts in 2016. He is the fourth person to be elected under the direct election of the mayor system, in a race that saw remarkably low turnout at 24%. WVXU has more on Pureval here. Winsome Sears takes the stage on election night. The Republican will become Virginia's next lieutenant governor, reaching new heights for Black women in the state.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Winsome Sears takes the stage on election night. The Republican will become Virginia's next lieutenant governor, reaching new heights for Black women in the state. It's the highest office a woman of color has won in Virginia's history. Winsome Sears, a Republican, won a race that highlighted diversity: her Democratic opponent, Hala Ayala, comes from a family with Salvadoran, Irish, Lebanese and North African heritage. \"Just 10 Black women in the U.S. have ever held statewide office,\" member station WAMU reports. \"What you are looking at is the American dream,\" Sears, a pro-Trump former Marine, said, according to WAMU. \"I didn't run to make history. I ran to leave it better than I found it ... Help is on the way.\" The Detroit suburb boasts one of the largest Arab communities in the U.S., but that had never been reflected in the city's highest office. Abdullah Hammoud, the son of Lebanese immigrants, dedicated his victory speech Tuesday night to \"any young girls or boys who have been ridiculed for their faith or ethnicity.\" The Democratic state representative defeated his opponent, longtime Michigan politician Gary Woronchak. In his first political race, Tyrone Garner unseated one-term incumbent David Alvey in the race to lead Kansas City, Kan., and Wyandotte County \u2014 which have a unified government. Garner is a former high-ranking police officer. He retired as deputy chief in June 2019, according to member station KCUR. His campaign focused not on getting tough on crime but on improving economic equity and public services, particularly for people in neglected neighborhoods. \"I am a forward thinker that wants to be a unifying force to facilitate opportunity, equity and hope,\" he told KCUR. A native of Harlem, Alvin Bragg was most recently the chief deputy attorney general of New York State. He'll lead an office that's currently pursuing an investigation into former President Donald Trump's business practices. Former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced earlier this year that he would not seek a fourth term. Bruce Harrell would be the first Asian American and the second Black person to lead Seattle. All of the city's votes are not yet counted, but Harrell has 65% of the tally as of early Wednesday morning, compared with 35% for Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez, who would become the city's first Latina mayor if she manages to stage a comeback. Harrell is a moderate who took Gonz\u00e1lez, a progressive, to task over her support for defunding the police. \"I would say to the abolitionists and the defunders that we need to drive outcomes and invest in outcomes that we want,\" he said, according to member station KUOW. \"We want culturally competent, de-escalating officers who take their oath of office in such a way that they will protect all communities.\" It will be days before Seattle's vote is final, in part because ballots can still be mailed on Election Day. In recent years, no candidate has surmounted a 30% early deficit, The Seattle Times says. KUOW says, \"Seattle's Election Night reflected a regional and national trend, of liberals getting trounced.\"",

New Yorkers chose Democrat Eric Adams, a former New York Police Department captain, to become the city's second Black Mayor in a landslide election that offered little surprise given that Republicans are outnumbered by a margin of about 7 to 1. Adams, who is currently the Brooklyn borough president and a former state senator, will take the reins from Bill de Blasio, whose second term was mired in the effects of the pandemic, historic job losses, skyrocketing housing prices and rental rates, extreme income inequality, and a broke transportation system. Throughout the race, the 61-year-old branded himself as the blue-collar mayor, gaining the approval of homeowning voters across the five boroughs. He made combating gun violence and improving public safety a main focus of his campaign, while also calling for cuts to the NYPD's budget and the shifting of some jobs to civilians that have been done by officers, which he says could save the city up to $500 million a year. Following a worrisome surge in shootings not seen since the 1990s, Adams says he'd like to reestablish a controversial plainclothes anti-crime unit that was dismantled by de Blasio just last year. He would also increase patrols at train and bus stations. He is adamant about paring back overtime, and supports establishing a requirement that new officers live in the five boroughs while also luring back current officers who live outside the city, with various incentives. The final weeks of the race between Adams and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa were dominated by personal attacks and public name-calling. Adams repeatedly slammed Sliwa as a \"racist\" and called him a Mini-Me of Donald Trump. Sliwa, on the other hand, has called the 110th mayor-to-be an elitist, as well as Bill de Blasio 2.0. Sliwa, 67, is a well-known, if odd and controversial fixture in the city whose run was considered by a former radio host colleague to be the latest in a series of media stunts to gain attention. He is best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels, a volunteer anti-crime group that was established in the 1970s during an alarming period of high crime in the city. The group was welcomed by some New Yorkers who felt abandoned and unprotected by the city government at the time. But after surviving a horrific shooting in 1992, Sliwa confessed he'd made up stories of bogus attacks on members of the Guardian Angels and fabricated reports that he'd been abducted by off-duty transit police. In his campaign, Sliwa hoped to appeal to voters with an array of proposals that included opposing vaccine mandates and critical race theory in public schools, increasing property taxes on Madison Square Garden, boosting the NYPD's budget and footprint, and converting the mayor's mansion into a cat and dog sanctuary. As he went to the polls to vote for himself on Tuesday, Sliwa carried a small kitten in his arms, boasting it is the 17th feline he has adopted with his wife. In another mayoral election, Boston chose City Councilor Michelle Wu as the city's first woman and first person of color elected to the office. She defeated another Democratic city councilor, Annissa Essaibi George. Wu is the daughter of immigrants from Taiwan. Essaibi George has called herself a first-generation Arab-Polish American.",

            "article_content": "Japan heads to the polls soon, and the ruling party is counting on low turnout from apathetic young voters and independents in order to hang onto its parliamentary majority.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: When Japan heads to the polls this weekend, the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to hang on to power. It's ruled the country for all but four of the past 66 years. In recent elections, low turnout by young, independent voters has helped. As NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports, the ruling party hopes it stays that way. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Before the last general election in 2017, Japan's government tried to encourage young people to vote by lowering the voting age from 20 to 18. Four years ago, just over half the population turned out to vote. But among 20-somethings, it was only 34%. Yutaro Yamaguchi is a senior at Kyoto Sangyo University in Kyoto, Japan's former capital. He remembers his first trips to the ballot box. YUTARO YAMAGUCHI: (Through interpreter) The voting age was lowered when we were in high school, and I voted about three times. But that was only because my parents made me do it. KUHN: His schoolmate, Risa Asonuma, says whether she votes or not may depend on her schedule. RISA ASONUMA: (Through interpreter) I wish there was a system that allowed us to vote online any time, anywhere during the election period. KUHN: Professor Ayumu Nakai, head of the Faculty of Law, says he's a bit surprised by his students' apathy. AYUMU NAKAI: (Speaking Japanese). KUHN: I want them to understand we are the voters, he says. We should vote to say that those politicians and parties are our servants. Gill Steele, a political scientist at Doshisha University in Kyoto, says apathy is not the youth's fault. Instead, she argues, it's partly the result of a strategy that discourages political participation. GILL STEELE: The Japanese state has cultivated or even mandated an atmosphere of depoliticization that discourages citizen interest and engagement. KUHN: It includes jargon-filled political platforms, yawn-inducing political reporting by Japanese media and education which generally discourages political debate and protest. That's too bad, Steele says. STEELE: There are all sorts of exciting ways to teach politics, even to the youngest children in elementary school, to connect decisions that get made to their own interest. And here it's just not allowed and not considered. KUHN: Steele admits that there are bright spots and occasional pockets of activism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Your vote is your voice. (Speaking Japanese). KUHN: In this video, Japanese celebrities try to convince young people that voting is cool. Here's actor Ken Watanabe, who starred with Tom Cruise in \"The Last Samurai.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KUHN: (Speaking Japanese). KUHN: When I exercise my right to say what I want to say, I feel refreshed, he says. Many progressive youth, though, find the LDP anything but refreshing. Gill Steel notes that it's against LGBTQ rights, feminism and immigration, and more than 90% of LDP candidates in this election are male. STEELE: The movement of the country as a whole is being more progressive on social issues. So for the LDP to be clinging onto to these policies is not a good look. KUHN: Instead, the LDP focuses on bread and butter issues. Those are more important to voters 60 and over, who outnumber the youth. The LDP reminds voters that while the economy isn't booming, stock prices are high and unemployment low. Kyoto Sanyo University student Tatsuya Yamagoshi says he'll be saddled with student loan debt for years, but he's OK with it. TATSUYA YAMAGOSHI: (Through interpreter) Sometimes I care about politics, but as time goes by, I feel I'm not dissatisfied with my current situation. And then I kind of forget about it. KUHN: Gill Steele predicts that if the LDP can keep voter turnout around 50%, it should hang onto a comfortable majority in parliament. But an increase in turnout of even a few percentage points, she adds, could put that majority at risk. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul.

Some of these changes that we've told you about, like in Texas, come with accusations of being unfair and diluting the voting power of a growing number of Black and Latinx voters. But in South Carolina, there is a slightly different complaint - that the state hasn't taken up any changes to its voting map so far, despite how much its population has changed.

CHANG: So, Mark, I want to start with you because you wrote that South Carolina's current maps are, quote, \"worse than gerrymandered. They are malapportioned.\" Can you just first break down - exactly what does malapportionment mean and why, as you put it, is it so dangerous? STERN: Yeah. So today, when we talk about gerrymandering, we're usually talking about lawmakers drawing lines that favor their party by packing in a bunch of voters who will support them into as many districts as possible. Sometimes they do this along racial lines, sometimes partisan lines, sometimes both. But with malapportionment, you can have districts of extreme, varying size. Some districts in a state might have 30 people, others might have 30,000. And that means that the folks who are living in those underpopulated districts have more voting power than the people who are living in overpopulated districts. They are essentially casting multiple ballots because of the way their districts are drawn. This has been prohibited by the Supreme Court since 1964. CHANG: Right, in a case called Reynolds v. Sims, which gave us the one-person-one-vote rule, right? STERN: Yes. That's right. CHANG: OK. So, Mark, if these maps in South Carolina end up not changing very much, can you just spell out what could that mean for voters in the state, especially for voters who live in more populated cities now? STERN: Yeah. So it will mean that voters in overpopulated districts will have less of a say over their representatives in the House and also their representatives in the state legislature. There are currently legislative districts in South Carolina that have twice as many people in them as others. That is a reflection of the shift in population over the last 10 years in South Carolina, which is largely made up of a growing number of racial minorities and a growing number of city dwellers. Malapportionment has traditionally disfavored urban voters, giving them less power over their representatives and shifting political representation toward predominantly white rural areas. CHANG: And let's talk about this lawsuit now. Somil, the ACLU, along with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, you guys are suing South Carolina officials. You're claiming that they are dragging their feet in trying these new maps. Can you explain? Why is time such an important factor here? TRIVEDI: What's happening here is that South Carolina legislators have gone home for the fall. And here's the problem. Election dates in 2022 are still set where they were before the pandemic and before we got census results back, right? So candidates in South Carolina have to file their intention to run for office by March 30. And yet, sitting here on October 26, we still don't even have maps, so they don't even know where they're going to run. And their voters don't even know who they're going to vote for, right? So that's the problem. Worse yet, this is compounded by a thing in constitutional law called the Purcell principle that says that we shouldn't make changes to electoral rules too close to an election because it might confuse people. In this case, it's true. If we don't have new, valid constitutional maps in place by the time folks need to file their candidacy for office, we really won't know where they're running and where their voters need to vote. And if they don't pass maps soon, they could have an argument that the malapportioned maps currently in existence have to stay in place. That would be such a perverse result. CHANG: Well, let's talk about what the other side is saying. Late last week, attorneys for the state House speaker said that your lawsuit is premature, that any delays are due to factors completely beyond their control, like the pandemic having held up the Census Bureau data that forms the basis to draw these new maps. What is the ACLU's response to that? TRIVEDI: That argument would hold water if they were in session right now, drawing maps, but they're not. They have adjourned and have not indicated that they are going to reconvene for a special session. Every day, they're not in session, their argument holds less water and ours holds more. CHANG: Well, when it comes to the speed in redrawing maps, I'm curious, Mark, how does South Carolina's timeline in putting these new maps together compare to other states this year? STERN: South Carolina is very obviously lagging behind, and anyone who pays attention to the news can see that because in most states, we're seeing redistricting battles play out right now, places like Texas, Illinois. We're seeing legislators brawl over new maps. And South Carolina, meanwhile, hasn't even really begun the formal process of drawing new maps, which, when done by the legislature, always takes months. It can extend even farther. And in South Carolina, for the last 50 years, there has been litigation following redistricting that goes on for months or years. And so if there were any state where a legislature would want to get those new maps in order pretty early, it would be South Carolina, a state with a pretty dark history of successful lawsuits against new districts that discriminate on the basis of race or partisanship. CHANG: Well, I just want to take a step back for a moment and just note that, you know, both Republicans and Democrats have engaged in partisan gerrymandering as well as malapportionment. I mean, South Carolina's legislature is Republican controlled, but Mark, are there any Democratic-led states right now where we could be seeing malapportionment happen? STERN: No. We are seeing Democratic-led states engaging in partisan gerrymandering. In places like Illinois and New York, they are scrambling to carve up districts that benefit them and entrench their power. We aren't seeing Democrats engage in malapportionment today, though certainly we did in the past. A lot of the Supreme Court cases that involved malapportionment that ultimately established the principle of one person one vote did involve Democratic-led legislatures. So it's not as if this is an entirely one-sided issue throughout history. It's just that today we only see Republicans toying with the idea in South Carolina. CHANG: And, Somil, I want to give you the last word because, you know, practically speaking, if time is already running out in South Carolina, what is the outcome that the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund - what is it that you are ultimately aiming to achieve with this lawsuit? TRIVEDI: We want fair maps, and so we want legislators to come back and draw them for us. Fair maps determine the rest of our politics. They determine criminal justice policy. They determine reproductive rights. They determine our immigration policies. Everything stems from how we draw our maps right now, so we want South Carolina legislators to take it as seriously as the rest of us are. CHANG: Somil Trivedi, attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, and Mark Joseph Stern, staff writer for Slate, thank you so much to both of you. TRIVEDI: Thank you. STERN: Thank you.

An estimated 16,000 migrants have been stopped by Poland's border patrol for illegally crossing the country's 250-mile-long border with Belarus since August. Editor's note: Poland's government announced Thursday it plans to build a new barrier on its border with Belarus. The move comes as Poland says migrants from around the world are sneaking in from across the border. NPR's original story, published Tuesday, follows. SOKOLKA, Poland \u2014 For the past 10 days, Doniel Machado Pujol and Raydel Aparicio Bringa say they've been surviving on river water and kernels of raw corn, plucked from dying stalks among the frozen fields of eastern Poland. Sleeping under piles of leaves and hiking through forests and farmland for days was more than they bargained for when they left Cuba three weeks ago. \"We flew from Havana to Moscow, and then a man picked us up and drove us to Belarus, and that's where our journey got a lot worse,\" says a malnourished and injured Machado Pujol,who has just been caught by Polish police after sneaking into the European Union. The two men are among an estimated 16,000 migrants stopped by Poland's border patrol for illegally crossing the country's 250-mile-long border with Belarus since August. Leaders in the EU say Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's government is organizing the illegal passage of migrants from war-torn and impoverished countries into Poland and other EU neighbors. They suspect this comes in retaliation for EU economic sanctions placed on Belarus after the bloc accused the authoritarian leader of stealing last year's election and ordering human rights violations. Now humanitarian groups are criticizing Poland for pushing some migrants back to Belarus rather than reviewing their asylum applications. Raydel Aparicio Bringa (left) and Doniel Machado Pujol are photographed while being apprehended by Poland's Border Guard in the town of Sokolka, on the Polish border with Belarus. The two men, from Cuba, are among thousands of migrants from impoverished or war-torn countries that the regime of Alexander Lukashenko is accused of luring to Belarus to be sent across the border into the EU.\n                \n                    \n                    Grzegorz Sokol for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Raydel Aparicio Bringa (left) and Doniel Machado Pujol are photographed while being apprehended by Poland's Border Guard in the town of Sokolka, on the Polish border with Belarus. The two men, from Cuba, are among thousands of migrants from impoverished or war-torn countries that the regime of Alexander Lukashenko is accused of luring to Belarus to be sent across the border into the EU. But for Machado Pujol, the crisis is more personal. After Polish border guards arrive to take him back to Belarus, he struggles and cries, screaming, \"Don't send me back! They'll kill me! Look at what they've done to my legs!\" The 29-year-old's legs are cut, bruised and swollen, and he walks with a limp. Polish border guards have already sent him back to Belarus twice, he says, and he accuses Belarusian soldiers of beating him with metal pipes and threatening worse if they saw him again. \"They have no respect for human dignity or human rights,\" he says. \"We are like footballs in a game between Poland and Belarus. Nobody wants us.\" The two men are not alone. \"There are many Iraqis, Kurds, there are people from Yemen, Syria, there are people from African countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Congo, and now we've got people from Afghanistan,\" says Kalina Czwarnog, who works for the Polish humanitarian organization Ocalenie Foundation. The group is delivering food and water to migrants and helping them with asylum applications. She says the government of Belarus is orchestrating this humanitarian crisis. \"They are inviting them to Belarus, saying that they can cross the EU border from there. And they are getting a seven-day visa or stamp,\" she says. From there, Belarusian soldiers escort them to the border and help them across. Czwarnog says when Polish border guards catch them, they're supposed to allow migrants to apply for asylum. Instead, she says, they're putting most of them in vans and taking them back to Belarus, where soldiers often beat them and send them back to Poland again. At least five migrants have died from the harsh conditions along the border, according the Polish officials. Kalina Czwarnog, who works for the Polish humanitarian organization Ocalenie Foundation, says Belarus is orchestrating this migration crisis. She has worked along the border to deliver food and water to migrants trying to cross.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kalina Czwarnog, who works for the Polish humanitarian organization Ocalenie Foundation, says Belarus is orchestrating this migration crisis. She has worked along the border to deliver food and water to migrants trying to cross. Czwarnog fears more will perish as the weather gets colder. She says in recent days she found a group of migrants from Iraq with three young children suffering from hypothermia. \"They were very, very cold,\" she says. \"The youngest child \u2014 we didn't really see if she was breathing. We had to get her warm, so she started to breathe normally. We couldn't communicate with the younger children because they were so weak,\" she says. Czwarnog called an ambulance, and Poland's border patrol took two children and two adults, but sent a 6-year-old child with five adults back to Belarus. But not everyone is sent back. A Syrian family who wouldn't give their names for fear of being identified by Polish authorities spoke to NPR at a homeless shelter in Bialystok. The father, a psychologist whose family fled war, says he paid a travel agency $16,000 to secure visas to Belarus and to be escorted to the Polish border. Belarusian soldiers helped him, his wife and their two young children cross a river along the border and then they hiked through dense forest for 12 hours before being caught by Polish border guards. He says his son's spirit kept him going. \"He was just saying to me: 'Daddy, don't lose my hand. Catch my hand and I will keep walking.' He's my hero,\" he says. He thinks Poland didn't send his family back because they were suffering from hypothermia, they had young children and they have a good chance of being granted asylum in the EU. The EU has hit Belarus with several rounds of economic sanctions since last year, accusing Lukashenko of stealing his country's election as well as ordering violent crackdowns and other rights abuses of citizens, including a forced plane landing in May to arrest a Belarusian journalist. Poland says that Lukashenko, backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched a hybrid attack to destabilize the EU in response. \"This phenomenon that we've been witnessing there recently is a kind of weaponization of migration,\" says Marcin Przydacz, the deputy foreign minister of Poland. Lukashenko has denied all these accusations. Poland has also come under criticism from rights advocates for sending people back to Belarus without processing their asylum requests in violation of EU law and United Nations conventions on refugees. Polish border guards stand near a group of migrants believed to be from Afghanistan in the small village of Usnarz Gorny near Bialystok, northeastern Poland, located close to the border with Belarus, in August.\n                \n                    \n                    Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Polish border guards stand near a group of migrants believed to be from Afghanistan in the small village of Usnarz Gorny near Bialystok, northeastern Poland, located close to the border with Belarus, in August. When pressed on this point, Przydacz defends the country's policy:\"If we allow more and more people to cross the border, then Mr. Lukashenko, who's also doing business on this, will invite even more of those people. So what should we do?\" he says. Polish journalist Patryk Michalski with the online news outlet Wirtualna Polska says his reporting could support the claim that Belarus' government profits from human trafficking. Michalski discovered a trove of documents left behind by a group of migrants in the forest along the border and shared them with NPR. Among the tattered and ripped up papers are lists of travelers from Iraq, passport numbers and receipts of payments made to Belarusian travel agencies for flights to Belarus on the state's Belavia airline. There are invoices of stays at five-star hotels run by the Belarusian government, as well as documents signed by Belarusian officials who helped facilitate the trips. Belarus has helped build the infrastructure to accommodate these travelers, too. At the beginning of the year, there was only a single flight from Iraq to Minsk, the Belarusian capital. Now there are several flights a week from multiple Iraqi cities. Iraqi Airways says their flights from Iraq to Belarus are sold out through November. \"Suddenly there are thousands of migrants from the Middle East or African countries in Belarus and suddenly, somehow, it is a very popular holiday destination for these people,\" says Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Przydacz. \"As we all know, Belarus has never been a popular destination where you spend a nice weekend, especially in the autumn or winter.\" Belarus' leader has himself acknowledged the country is not a final destination. \"If someone thinks that we will close the border with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine and become a filtration camp for fugitives from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, they are mistaken at least. We will not hold anyone. We are not their final destination after all. They are headed to the enlightened, warm, cozy Europe,\" he said in July. As for the Cuban migrant, Machado Pujol, his family says after his latest arrest along the border he was sent back a third time to Belarus. According to his family, Belarusian soldiers beat him and his companion Aparicio Bringa so badly that they fractured the latter's skull. The two men are still along the border, injured, scared and hoping to make it to the European Union. Grzegorz Sokol contributed to this report from Sokolka and Warsaw.",

            "article_content": "Although about a third of Germans vote by mail, millions of voters go to polling places today to choose a new government, and a successor to Angela Merkel, who is stepping down as Chancellor.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: It's voting day in Germany. And it's looking to be a closely divided election. At stake is who will succeed longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel. Polls closed at 6 p.m., noon Eastern. The official tally is expected later today. Germany has a multiparty system, meaning the parties with the most votes today will enter coalition talks. Those negotiations could take months. NPR's Rob Schmitz is in Berlin, watching the results come in. We spoke earlier this morning as he was out with voters heading to the polls. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Yeah, this is actually a youth community center, and it's one of hundreds in the city where Germans can vote. And, Lulu, this is a pretty low-tech affair. You enter your voting booth. You tick the boxes of the candidate of the party and the candidate you want in pen. You for the paper, and then you just put it in a ballot box. I've been outside this polling site for a few hours, and there has been a steady line of people since it opened at 8 this morning. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are people telling you? SCHMITZ: Well, let me introduce you to Vescela Krestova (ph). She came to vote with her whole family. They are naturalized Germans, originally from Bulgaria. And she's voting in her first election as a German citizen. This is your first election that you're voting in. VESCELA KRESTOVA: Yes, that's right. SCHMITZ: Is it exciting? KRESTOVA: Very exciting. SCHMITZ: And you brought your two children. KRESTOVA: Yeah, he's very curious. He was very disappointed because he just understood he would not be able to vote until he's 18. SCHMITZ: And Krestova says even though she's in line to vote, she's still undecided about which party she wants to lead Germany. She's stuck between the Social Democrats and their candidate, Olaf Scholz, and the Green Party. KRESTOVA: I'm very torn (laughter). SCHMITZ: Why? KRESTOVA: Well, I like Scholz because of his initiative on taxes for the international minimum tax level, but I'm not so sure how strong they will be on climate. SCHMITZ: And, Lulu, just to add some context here, Scholz and the Social Democrats are calling for a global minimum corporate tax rate of more than 20%. And even though he has campaigned on tackling climate change, many voters I've spoken to here say they prefer to vote for the Green Party in this election because they believe it's the only party that offers a real change from the path that Germany's been on for years with Angela Merkel. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, speaking of Angela Merkel, she is stepping down after 16 years, which is such a long time in politics. She's been called the most powerful woman in the world. What are voters telling you about her and her legacy? SCHMITZ: Well, here in Berlin, for the most part, voters I'm speaking to are saying they will not really miss her that much. You know, it's important to note here that this is Berlin. It's a very liberal German city where people typically vote for either the Greens or for Die Linke - a far-left party that has ties to the old Communist Party from East Germany. And Merkel's party is more of a conservative one, so it's not too surprising they feel this way. I spoke to voter Katja Louke (ph) about Merkel, and here's what she said. KATJA LOUKE: Maybe when we see what will be the result of this election - maybe we'll win this. (Laughter) Or I don't know. She's not my chancellor. She was not my chancellor. For me, her best action was 2015 and people that were refugees, refugees that were coming to Germany - I think that was the good point that she did. SCHMITZ: And, Lulu, she's talking here about Merkel's decision in 2015 to allow hundreds of thousands of migrants from war-torn parts of the Middle East and North Africa to resettle here in Germany. Of course, that decision also divided Germany, and it led to the rise of the far-right. But now, six years later, Germany's far-right party has less support. And instead, we're seeing several parties hovering in the double digits, all below 25% or so on polling. So it should be an interesting evening to see what happens when the polls close. And even when we do know the final results, then the party in the lead will have to embark on the hard work of finding a new government. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We'll leave it there.

            "article_content": "The pandemic, migration crisis, and Congressional gridlock continue to create stumbling blocks for the Biden administration.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Biden campaigned on wrestling the pandemic into submission and then, as he put it in his motto, building back better. Of course, that was on top of an ongoing surge in migration and then the events of January 6. We'll examine what the agenda might look like now with NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Let's hear - let's begin with booster shots. We've heard it was currently recommended to get them. But just over a month ago, the White House announced a plan developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other top health authorities to get extra doses into all Americans eight months after the second shot of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. In fact, that plan envisioned this week was to be launched. So what happened? ELVING: It's not just what happened but what keeps on happening, that is to say change and disagreement among scientists. You're going to have both in any crisis, including a pandemic. Scientists change their thinking, and they disagree. Public health scientists will acknowledge this and perhaps recalibrate their views from time to time and change the advice they give. That seems to be what's happening here, and that may be a skill, even a willingness that elected officials might emulate. SIMON: The Del Rio encampment of some 15,000 Haitian migrants has been cleared as we speak today. But that doesn't solve a migration crisis that spans decades and multiple presidencies, does it? ELVING: No, indeed. First, you have the excruciating plight of these thousands of refugees. Haiti has been poor for a long time. But lately, they have been enduring the trials of Job with the hurricane, the earthquake, political upheaval. So that political crisis caused these thousands of people to desperately leave the country and try to enter the United States. That then creates something of a political crisis here, especially with the visuals of mounted agents chasing them on horseback, seeming, at least in some cases, to whip them with their reins. This is like the pictures from Kabul airport last month, the refugees running on the tarmac. They capture human desperation and contrast it with the seeming indifference of Americans that even looks cruel. But let's take a little bit of an elevation on this. It is another instance of global realities coming to visit us here in our cocoon of privilege. We are only occasionally forced to confront what so much of the world's population confronts on a daily basis. We have to understand that climate change is going to make this kind of migration pressure a recurrent challenge from now on. SIMON: The committee investigating the January 6 attack on democracy subpoenaed four Trump administration officials this week. President Biden said he won't shield presidential records from that investigation. What might we learn from this inquiry? ELVING: We should reserve judgment for now to let this play out, but the expectation is that these inquiries could produce some new evidence of coordination or at least sympathy between certain Republican Congress members and the protesters and perhaps between the Trump White House and the protesters. That evidence would be meaningful to those trying to get to the bottom of what happened that day. But for those who still reject the outcome of the election, it may only mean more alienation and denial. SIMON: Speaker Pelosi says the $3.5 trillion package of social safety net and climate programs and the $1 trillion for highway, internet and other projects - both those bills will pass. The president says talks have hit a stalemate. Who's right? ELVING: It's possible they may both be right. These teams are still on the field. The game still afoot. It does appear that talks have hit a stalemate for the moment. At this point, we surely do not know that it will finally lead to enactment of the Democrats agenda, let alone the full wish list that adds up to $3.5 trillion. There are Democrats who will work to reduce the price tag so as to sell it better back home. They have a lot of tradition and precedent on their side. At the same time, you have progressive firebrands pressing their case, digging the trenches to defend their lines. They have to go back to their constituents, too, and those voters have an urgent set of priorities, as well. So these are real differences. And many Democrats sense their window of opportunity may be closing. SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gambled on an early election in a bid to win a majority of seats in Parliament, but now faces the threat of being knocked from power in Canada's election on Monday. Polls indicate Trudeau's Liberal Party is in a tight race with the rival Conservatives: It will likely win the most seats in Parliament, but still fail to get a majority, forcing it to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation. \"Trudeau made an incredibly stupid error in judgement,\" said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. Trudeau entered the election leading a stable minority government that wasn't under threat of being toppled. The opposition has been relentless in accusing Trudeau of calling the early vote \u2014 two years before the deadline \u2014 for his own personal ambition. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, the Liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, when he first won in 2015, but a combination of high expectations, scandal and calling the election last month during the pandemic have hurt his brand. Trudeau is betting that Canadians will reward him for navigating the coronavirus crisis better than most countries did. Canada is now one of the most vaccinated nations in the world and Trudeau's government spent hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up the economy amid lockdowns. Trudeau argues that the Conservatives' approach, which has been more skeptical of lockdowns and vaccine mandates, would be dangerous and says Canadians need a government that follows science. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole didn't require his party's candidates to be vaccinated and won't say how many are unvaccinated. O'Toole describes vaccination as a personal health decision, but a growing number of vaccinated Canadians are becoming increasingly upset with those who refuse to get vaccinated. \"He's more interested in standing up for the rights of anti-vaxxers within his own party than he is in standing up for people who have done the right things and want to get back to normal,\" Trudeau said at a campaign stop in Windsor, Ontario, on Friday. Trudeau supports making vaccines mandatory for Canadians to travel by air or rail, something the Conservatives oppose. And Trudeau has pointed out that Alberta, run by a Conservative provincial government, is in crisis. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, an ally of O'Toole, said the province might run out of beds and staff for intensive care units within days. Kenney has apologized for the dire situation and is now reluctantly introducing a vaccine passport and imposing a mandatory work-from-home order two months after lifting nearly all restrictions. A Conservative win would represent a rebuke of Trudeau, who now is at risk of losing office to a politician with a fraction of his own name recognition. O'Toole, 47, is a military veteran, former lawyer and a member of Parliament for nine years. O'Toole advertised himself a year ago as a \"true-blue conservative.\" He became Conservative Party leader with a pledge to \"take back Canada,\" but immediately started working to push the party toward the political center. O'Toole's new strategy, which has included disavowing positions held dear by his party's base on issues such as climate change, guns and balanced budgets, is designed to appeal to a broader cross section of voters in a country that tends to be far more liberal than its southern neighbor. The son of a long-time politician has faced criticism he will say and do anything to get elected. \"I'm not your dad's Conservative Party,\" O'Toole said. Whether moderate Canadians believe O'Toole is the progressive conservative he claims to be and whether he has alienated traditional conservatives have become central questions of the campaign. Jenni Byrne, who served as campaign manager and deputy chief of staff to former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said there is a lack of enthusiasm among Conservatives across the country. \"We will know on Tuesday morning whether the Erin O'Toole version of the Conservative Party is connecting with voters, but if there is any truth to the polls, it's something that I don't think is connecting in numbers that we have connected with in the past, including in the last election,\" Byrne said. The wild card could be a politician who narrowly lost the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2017 but who now leads a far-right party that opposes vaccines and lockdowns. Polls suggest as many as 5% to 10% support Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada \u2014 potentially bleeding support from O'Toole's Conservatives and helping the Liberals retain power. Trudeau's legacy includes embracing immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries closed their doors. He also legalized cannabis nationwide and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. And he preserved free trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by former U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap the agreement. Perhaps sensing Trudeau is in trouble, former U.S. President Barack Obama and ex-Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted support for Trudeau. There won't be a Trump endorsement of O'Toole. Conservative campaign co-chair Walied Soliman said there is no alignment whatsoever between O'Toole and Trumpism. But if O'Toole wins, he has promised to take a tougher stand against China, including banning Chinese technology giant Huawei from Canada's next generation of telecommunication networks. O'Toole has also said he'll move Canada's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem just as Trump moved the U.S. embassy, upending decades of policy.",

            "article_content": "Demonstrators gathered outside a largely empty Capitol today. Lawmakers return next week to a lengthy to-do list.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: I'm going to turn now to Washington, D.C., and NPR's Deirdre Walsh, who covers Congress. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us this week. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: We just heard about surging personnel and resources to the thousands and thousands of Haitian migrants camped near the border. There are some other steps this morning we're learning about, too. WALSH: We are. We're learning that the Biden administration is planning to send planeloads of these Haitian migrants back to their home country. That's according to reporting from The Associated Press and The Washington Post. We just heard about immigration officials being overwhelmed. And this deportation effort is really a strategy to discourage more from coming from Haiti. Haitian officials, according to reporting, are prepared to accept at least three flights a day. And we could see those start this weekend. SIMON: Certainly, there's vigilance about the demonstrations planned in the vicinity of the U.S. Capitol today, people marching in support of those people being prosecuted for attacking Congress and the vice president on January 6. Security situation at the Capitol looks very different than it did on January 6 today, doesn't it? WALSH: It really does. There's a new head of the Capitol Police. Federal and local law enforcement agencies have learned a lot from what happened on January 6. There are better information-sharing systems in place, better training in place. The Defense Department has authorized the National Guard troops to be at the ready. But I should stress we're not really expecting to see anything like what we saw on January 6. Congress is not in session today. Lawmakers were advised to stay away. There aren't any members of Congress planning to participate or speak at this rally. The activists that are in town are protesting the treatment of those detained related to the January 6 riot. But these were not peaceful protesters. I mean, the government has already brought criminal charges against more than 600 people, and those charges range from violent or illegal entry to assault, to even conspiracy. I think the thing that's notable is Republican leaders have largely been silent about this event, and that really shows how much the party is still really being led by former President Donald Trump. SIMON: And in line with this, a House Republican who has certainly been seen as a rising star in the Republican Party said this week he's not running for reelection and kind of cited Donald Trump as the reason. Tell us about Anthony Gonzalez. WALSH: He did. Ohio Republican Congressman Anthony Gonzalez was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump after the insurrection. He announced he's not running for reelection. That's actually surprising. I mean, we're in a year when Republicans really feel like they're on track to retake control of Congress in the midterm elections. So it's rare that someone decides not to run. But Trump had backed his primary - one of his primary opponents. I mean, this was a member who was held up by his leadership as a top recruit when he first entered Congress. He's a former NFL player. He's Cuban American. But he said his decision really hinged on the sort of family and security concerns he's received since his vote to impeach Trump. He told The New York Times he thought the former president was, quote, \"a cancer on the country.\" And he just didn't want to be part of a House Republican conference that's going to be led by Trump loyalists. SIMON: Deirdre, lots for Congress to do this week. Please take us through the list. WALSH: Yeah, it's a long list, and it's really not a lot of time to get stuff done. They are racing to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month, so we expect Congress to vote on a stopgap funding bill. They also need to raise the debt limit probably by mid-October. This is the authority that Congress gives the Treasury Department to borrow money and keep federal agencies going. But the big-ticket item that they're still struggling with - Democratic leaders, I should say - is this massive $3.5 trillion spending bill that represents President Biden's agenda. This is health care, expanded pre-K, free community college. And immigration is part of that debate, too. Democrats want to include a path to citizenship as part of that debate. But it's unclear under the rules they're using to avoid a Republican filibuster if they're going to be able to do that. And obviously, the situation on the border means that debate is going to be even more contentious. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, good to have you along with us this weekend. Thank you.

            "article_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom will remain in office after a Republican-led recall effort failed. The special election cost the state nearly $300 million in taxpayers' money.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: California voters have said a resounding no to recalling Governor Gavin Newsom. He will now finish out his four-year term, which ends in January 2023. Those pushing for the recall had criticized the Democratic governor for how he's been handling the pandemic, but in the end, California's success in containing COVID-19 helped save Newsom's job. Joining us now to talk about the recall election results is Scott Shafer from member station KQED in San Francisco. Hey, Scott. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So now that the election is over, how would you characterize the message that voters overall sent? SHAFER: Well, this recall was rejected by a nearly 2 to 1 margin, more than 60% no vote. And No. 1, I'd say it's clearly a solid endorsement of Newsom's approach managing the pandemic. And it's also, at the same time, a rejection of what his opponents, especially replacement candidates like Larry Elder, were offering in place of what Newsom was doing. Last night, Newsom also emphasized what voters were saying yes to. He mentioned, in particular, the progressive policies around voting, immigration and the pandemic that California has enacted over the last few years. And what this is not, Ailsa, is an endorsement of how the state is handling issues like homelessness. As you know, in Los Angeles, it remains a huge problem for the state. And Newsom is likely to continue addressing that in the coming months as he looks toward his second term. CHANG: OK. Well, among the counties that voted against the recall - although, again, there are still ballots left to be counted - but among those that did reject the recall are San Diego County and Orange County. And both of them used to be reliably Republican, right? So... SHAFER: Yeah. CHANG: ...What do you think that says about the changing political landscape here in California? SHAFER: Yeah. Remember, former Republican Governor Pete Wilson was first mayor of San Diego in the '70s. Today, San Diego is - it's reliably Democratic in local and especially in statewide elections. This week, San Diego County rejected the recall with about a 60% no vote. That's really a remarkable transition. And regarding Orange County just to the north, Ronald Reagan used to say that O.C. was the place good Republicans went to die. Back in 2003, the O.C. voted overwhelmingly for the recall of Gray Davis. Today, Orange County is more closely divided on the recall and politically in general. But, you know, still a pretty dramatic shift from the recent past. And the reason is simple - demographics; fewer white people, more Latinos and Asians, and they tend to vote more Democratic, especially younger voters. CHANG: All right. Well, let's talk about costs. Because taxpayers were the ones who footed the bill for this recall election, which cost something like $300 million. What would you say voters got for all of that money? SHAFER: Yeah. Well, that certainly could have been used for other things, like getting homeless people off the streets and helping to fight and prevent wildfires. That said, this is happening at a time when California has a huge budget surplus - $80 billion thanks to money from the federal government and taxes here on the wealthy. You know, and Newsom also raised another $70 million from private donors. So, you know, I think a lot of people would say spending all that money and time was just really a big distraction. CHANG: OK. Well, looking ahead to 2022 real quick, what lessons might there be for Democrats and Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections you think? SHAFER: Yeah. Well, for one thing, the importance of political infrastructure the Democrats put into place to defeat this - getting out the vote, communicating with voters and so on - that'll come in handy in the 2022 midterms. Another thing is the strategic importance of direct voter contact, like, you know, knocking on doors. That didn't happen in 2020 due to the pandemic. And then finally, this is just a sound rejection by California voters of Donald Trump and candidates like Larry Elder who support him. CHANG: That is KQED's Scott Shafer. Thank you, Scott. SHAFER: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF HOOPS SONG, \"SUN'S OUT\") Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But political shifts along the state's southern border offer some warning signs for Democrats that could spell trouble for Gov. Gavin Newsom in next week's recall election. Last summer, Ra\u00fal Ure\u00f1a signed up to run for City Council in Calexico \u2014 a border town in California's Imperial County \u2014 just days before the filing deadline. His opponent, the incumbent candidate, looked likely to keep the seat, but Ure\u00f1a, who had just graduated from college in Santa Cruz, Calif., wanted to give voters a more progressive choice. Ure\u00f1a knew that a winning campaign would have to speak to Latino voters whom the pandemic had hit worse than any other group in California. \"Just the content of the message: that people are suffering,\" Ure\u00f1a says, \"it really spoke to the fact that they did want a change in leadership.\" Months later, Ure\u00f1a beat the incumbent, winning 70% of the vote. That desire for change pulsed through the Imperial County electorate in 2020. While President Biden won the historically blue county with 61% of the vote, former President Donald Trump cut his margin of defeat by 17 points from 2016, the largest swing of any county in California. The political shifts along the southern border offer some warning signs for the state's ruling party that could spell trouble for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, in the recall election next Tuesday. In California's most Latino county, demographics alone may not deliver the gains Democrats have come to rely on from Latino voters. And the county's one constant \u2014 low voter participation \u2014 points to a fossilized method of outreach to a largely Spanish-speaking community also grappling with both health and economic crises. \"The Democratic Party doesn't really exist here in Imperial County,\" Ure\u00f1a says. Right now in Imperial County, Ure\u00f1a says, \"most people don't even know what the recall is about.\" For Rosalba Jepson, economic anxieties are carrying over into the recall election against Newsom. \"Get rid of him,\" says Jepson, a voter and teacher in Imperial County. \"We work hard, he gets paid,\" she adds. \"I had to switch from teaching in class to doing something online I had never, ever done before. You think that wasn't stressful? Nobody paid me that extra time.\" Political polling on the vote released in recent weeks paints a mixed picture of where Latino voters stand, though the momentum is trending in Newsom's favor. An August CBS News poll found likely Latino voters split 50% to 50% on keeping Newsom in office, while more recent surveys from the Public Policy Institute of California and the Institute of Government Studies at the University of California, Berkeley found two-thirds of Latino voters oppose the recall. So far in the recall election, Latino voters across the state have returned mail ballots at lower rates than any ethnic group, according to Political Data Inc., which tracks turnout in California. Imperial County stretches from the canyons east of San Diego to the Arizona border. The economy is dominated by agriculture; the valley's priority claim to Colorado River water transformed the region into a winter vegetable powerhouse, sending lettuce and salad mix to supermarkets across the country. Everyday issues can make civic participation a low priority for residents, says Raul Navarro, a political science instructor at Imperial Valley College. Job opportunities are few and far between: The county's unemployment rate is 18.9%, far higher than anywhere else in the state. Rates of diabetes, heart disease and asthma are exacerbated by local pollutants, such as the chemical-laden dust blowing from the exposed bed of the Salton Sea and the exhaust of cars idling at the border port of entry. COVID-19 has ripped through the county, resulting in the state's highest number of deaths per 100,000 residents. \"We're No. 1 in all the bad things,\" Navarro says. No issue resonates for voters in Imperial County more than immigration. For many living along it, Trump's constant emphasis on the border struck a chord. In Imperial County, investments in U.S. Border Patrol agents and infrastructure mean jobs and the potential for easier cross-border commutes. \"I think a lot of people just really were not engaged,\" says Sayrs Morris, the chair of the county's Republican Party. But that changed with Trump, she says. \"His policies were helping make our area secure and prosperous, [and] they really wanted to come out and support him.\" Trump also showed up: In 2019, he visited two cities in the county, El Centro and Calexico, touting a newly installed section of the border wall. Local organizers says the visit allowed them to build a network of Trump voters in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The result was Trump winning 36% of the vote after carrying just 26% of the county in 2016. Calexico's Danny Ramirez says on social issues, local Democrats \"are more Republican than they think.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Guy Marzorati/KQED\n                    \n                \nhide caption Danny Ramirez, a Democrat living in Calexico, says his socially conservative views have made him a reliable voter for Republican candidates. And he thinks Catholic and evangelical fellow Latino Democrats in the region are ripe for a similar political conversion. \"I believe that the majority of the Imperial County is also pro-life and pro-family, but they don't vote that way because they don't know,\" he says. \"Those Democrats are more Republican than they think.\" Ramirez isn't shy about his beliefs: At his used bus dealership along a popular highway, he displays large signs denouncing state and national Democrats for their positions on abortion rights. Ure\u00f1a, the Calexico council member, says a focus on the roots of the recall campaign could be an effective message to convince Latino constituents to support Newsom. The petition to remove Newsom from office, written in early 2020, charges the governor with hurting residents in myriad ways, but the first is this: \"Laws he endorsed favor foreign nationals, in our country illegally, over that of our own citizens.\" \"It's not about COVID; it's not about stealing money,\" Ure\u00f1a says. \"The proponents of this measure think that Gov. Newsom is helping [undocumented] immigrants too much, and all of this racist rhetoric ... is coming out.\" And the delivery of the message is important, too, Ure\u00f1a says. A progressive vision can win in Imperial County in the recall election and beyond, he says, \"but the cultural representation just needs to be there. Things need to be bilingual.\" \"Gov. Newsom has been attentive to the needs of Latinos and low-income people across the state: protecting us, sending us the stimulus checks and things of that nature,\" he says. \"It's just a matter of, again, communication, getting into our homes and genuinely visiting our communities.\"",

            "article_content": "By the time of the Afghan government's collapse, Germany had the second-largest contingent of NATO troops in the country. It is grappling with its role in the return of the Taliban.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to begin today by looking at the ongoing effort to evacuate civilians from Afghanistan. Today, the Pentagon acknowledged the dangerous conditions around the airport in Kabul, calling it a fluid and dynamic situation. Still, the U.S. military says it's already evacuated some 17,000 people from Afghanistan since last week. Now, the main focus in Afghanistan has been on the U.S., but America is not the only nation rushing to get people out of that country. After the U.S., Germany had the largest military presence there, and it, too, is conducting its own evacuation. Earlier today, Germany's defense minister told reporters that their military has airlifted almost 2,000 people out of Kabul. But with Germany already having taken in more than half a million Afghan refugees in the last few years, far more than the U.S., now the question is whether more refugees will be welcome. And that is becoming a campaign issue ahead of an election there in September. Esme Nicholson has this report from Berlin. ESME NICHOLSON, BYLINE: As German soldiers in Kabul scramble to evacuate Afghans who've assisted them over the past two decades, politicians in Berlin who are gearing up for the election are playing the blame game over why evacuations didn't start earlier. Meanwhile, Afghans in Germany have been protesting outside the foreign ministry to get their relatives out of Afghanistan. Thirty-two-year-old Ahmad (ph) - who wouldn't give his surname out of fear for his family back home - worked for nine years with German troops. He came to Germany in 2015, but his family is still in Afghanistan. AHMAD: (Through interpreter) I think of my family day and night. I can't see a way to get them to safety, and I can't go back. Because I worked for the military, my family is now in danger. On my first day working with the army, I asked them what would happen if my family or I got into trouble. And I was told the German army has my back. Now that day has come, and we've been forgotten. NICHOLSON: His concerns are justified. German broadcaster Deutsche Welle confirmed Thursday that the Taliban shot dead a relative of a reporter who works for its Pashto service and has made it to Germany. The German government vows to help those it employed directly, but it's unclear for those who worked for other organizations or as subcontractors and freelancers. While there is widespread concern in Germany about the plight of Afghans left to endure Taliban rule, the mission itself has never been popular. THOMAS WIEGOLD: Public opinion is that these 20 years were in vain. NICHOLSON: Thomas Wiegold reports on Germany's military. WIEGOLD: And it's even worse when it comes to one of the main tasks of the German military that is training and advising the Afghan National Army because this army in most cases didn't fire a single shot, handed over their bases to the Taliban. And so soldiers are asking themselves - why did we train those people? NICHOLSON: Security expert Jana Puglierin, who heads up the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, says politicians here are nervous about the issue of refugees because of the September election. Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 policy allowing refugees in from Syria fueled a rise in far-right populism. But Puglierin says Germany and Europe have since restricted immigration. JANA PUGLIERIN: If you look at how hard it has become to reach Europe, it's the phantom debate because we are discussing something which is not very likely to happen the same way as in 2015. NICHOLSON: And for the Afghans who make it to Germany, many of them still face uncertainty. Ahmad arrived six years ago, but he hasn't been granted asylum. AHMAD: (Through interpreter) I have temporary permission to be here, which I have to renew every three months. This means I'm not allowed to work, and I can't sleep for worry. NICHOLSON: This precarious status is known officially as geduldet, which means tolerated. Not only does Ahmad live in fear of being deported, he says that after 20 years of Western intervention in his country, he'd hoped for more than just tolerance.

They are part of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group calling for an end to Title 42 so their family members can seek asylum. Immigration advocates who had been negotiating with the Biden administration to end a Trump-era rule that blocks most migrants from entering the United States have given up waiting. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are going back to court. They plan to file a preliminary injunction to stop the continued use of the Title 42 public health law that has allowed border agents to swiftly remove tens of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border. \"The Biden administration has left us no choice but to go back to court. It's been seven months, and Title 42 is still in place,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the ACLU, told NPR. \"We believe this is our only option.\" The Biden administration has kept the policy in place, citing concerns about the pandemic, including the explosion of cases of the contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The new wave of cases also led the administration to extend restrictions on international tourists from many countries and impose new vaccine requirements for federal workers. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that the administration is deferring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on whether the policy is necessary. \"The president views it as a public health measure where the CDC is going to continue to provide guidance on how long it needs to be in place,\" Psaki said in Monday's briefing. \"We have not given a timeline of when ... they will lift Title 42, but we will look for them to provide us that guidance.\" The CDC issued a statement a few hours later saying it would keep the order in place for now and review it every 60 days. It cited the variants and risks of COVID-19 spreading in places such as border stations. \"Introduction of such non-citizens, regardless of their country of origin, migrating through Canada and Mexico into the United States creates a serious danger of the introduction of COVID-19 into the United States,\" the CDC statement said. \"The danger is so increased by the introduction of such non-citizens that a temporary suspension is necessary to protect the public health.\" But the advocates for migrants \u2014 including the Texas Civil Rights Project, RAICES, the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies and Oxfam \u2014 argue the rule is being misused to illegally block vulnerable people from seeking humanitarian protection in the United States. Spokespersons for the Justice and Homeland Security departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Groups that have pushed to end the program have long argued the administration is using Title 42 less as a way to control the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 and more to curb migration and mitigate political pressure from Republicans. A not-so-friendly reminder that the Biden Administration is STILL expelling asylum seekers into harm's way under a Trump administration policy called #Title42. We were promised 'build back better'. Instead, we got 'do not come.' pic.twitter.com/zaovedT45u The Trump administration first invoked Title 42, a section of the Public Health Safety Act, early in the pandemic, arguing it was justified to block entry of certain groups \"in the interest of public health.\" The groups sued the Trump administration over its use of the measure last year but put the case on hold when Biden took office, pending negotiations. Those talks are at an impasse. Gelernt said the groups now plan to seek an immediate preliminary injunction to stop the practice. \"The Biden administration asked for some time to fix what it said were problems created by the prior administration. We gave them more than sufficient time,\" he said. Migrants seeking asylum gather last month at a makeshift camp on the Mexican side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Tijuana. Title 42 has stopped most asylum cases during the pandemic.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Migrants seeking asylum gather last month at a makeshift camp on the Mexican side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Tijuana. Title 42 has stopped most asylum cases during the pandemic. When Biden took office, he quickly reversed several of Trump's harshest immigration policies, pledging a more \"humane\" system. But the new administration kept using Title 42 to shut out most people seeking asylum, to the consternation of advocates who had sued the U.S. government to stop it. The administration made exceptions for unaccompanied children and some families. The use of Title 42 gave the Biden administration additional time to grapple with the largest surge of migrants to the border in recent history. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, border officials encountered migrants 188,829 times in June, the highest single month total in years. The Biden administration has pushed back on criticism that it would use Title 42 for any reason other than to protect the public health of Americans and U.S. residents. In March, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said: \"We are using it as the Title 42 authority was intended and not as a bludgeoning tool under immigration law that the prior president used.\" Some advocates had expected the Biden administration to begin phasing out the program as early as last month, but the administration has since begun taking more aggressive steps against the delta variant. Gelernt said that's not a good enough reason to keep the practice. \"We do not believe that the delta variant is a basis for expelling people without a hearing,\" he said. \"The country is in a much better position than when we filed the lawsuit, given the availability of vaccines and testing.\" Clearly, now is NOT the time to end Title 42. https://t.co/Ifc7NBSwcC Political opponents have used the surge in migration to attack Biden, and many Republicans see the issue as a potent weapon to use for the midterm elections next year. While Biden has high approval ratings for the way he has handled the pandemic, polls show concern about immigration. Biden has repeatedly defended himself against criticism of the border surge by explaining that the vast number of migrants were being returned \u2014 a defense made possible largely because of Title 42. \"Thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home,\" Biden said during a March 25 news conference. Out of the more than 900,000 encounters border officials have had with migrants between January and June, the public health measure has been used more than 575,000 times to return migrants back across the border. The Biden administration has made an exception for children traveling without their parents and some families. Advocates for migrants have charged that the Biden administration's use of Title 42 was an extension of the Trump administration's efforts to deny asylum rights unfairly. \"There was a lot of damage done during the Trump administration,\" said Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute. \"We have to climb back from that. That means things like making sure that we are rebuilding our refugee system to receive refugees from around the world, that we are taking positive steps to receive asylum-seekers and restore the process of asylum at the border. But we've seen that politics can interfere with it.\"",

President Biden is in a tough place on immigration. On one side, he faces growing pressure from supporters who want his administration to stop turning away asylum-seekers \u2014 and to invest more political capital on creating a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. On the other side, critics want him to do more to stop what has turned into the largest wave of migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border in recent history, with border agents averaging 6,300 encounters with migrants every day last month. It's against this backdrop that Biden spoke Monday to the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS. In prerecorded remarks, Biden promised to continue to fight for undocumented Americans. \"My administration will always have your back,\" he declared. Some of Biden's supporters, like Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum, hoped his speech would be directed at not just his base, but more broadly to the American people \u2014 particularly to swing voters who are concerned about migration yet recognize the value of immigrants in their communities. \"This has to be a speech to suburban families, to rural families, who are asking questions of, 'OK, as a nation, are we going to be safe and secure under the Biden administration?\" Noorani said. \"'And are we going to be able to treat the immigrants who I've come to know and love through church, through work, through school \u2014 are we going to treat them compassionately?' \" Noorani said Biden needs the backing of a much broader swath of Americans if he wants to build the support he needs to address immigration issues. In his less-than-two-minute remarks, Biden did not address border security. He instead spoke about protecting vulnerable immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, as well as fighting for a pathway to citizenship for much of the larger community of 11 million undocumented immigrants. He also thanked advocates affiliated with UnidosUS as well as the broader Latino community for stepping up during their pandemic to help Americans get through the health crisis. \"Six months ago, our nation was reeling from a once-in-a-century health crisis, a once-in-a-generation economic crisis, both of which brought disproportionate heartache to Latino families,\" Biden said. Since taking office, Biden has followed through on several campaign promises, including stopping construction on the southern border wall. He ended a Trump administration program that required asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico as they waited for their cases to be heard. And he created a task force to reunite immigrant children and parents who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. But legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants has gone almost nowhere. Smaller legislative packages that would protect farm workers and younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children have also stalled. Finding a way to protect those younger immigrants has become even more important to Biden's supporters after a federal judge in Texas ruled this month that the program created to protect them was unconstitutional. The administration has vowed to appeal the decision and also supports efforts by Democratic lawmakers to try fold the issue into a massive budget reconciliation package this summer. In the past week, however, Biden has twice questioned whether the Senate rules would allow such a move. Just finished meeting w/ @VP alongside my sisters and brothers in the movement. @VP Harris affirmed her commitment to passing citizenship through reconciliation this year. It's been 35 years since the last major citizenship bill. Our time is now. #WeAreHome pic.twitter.com/C1RZBvoiUM In Monday's remarks, Biden did not address the fate of a Trump-era pandemic rule that has been kept in place, allowing his administration to quickly turn away tens of thousands of people seeking asylum. That rule, known as Title 42, has angered some supporters who see it less as a public health measure and more of a convenient way to deter migration and keep political opponents at bay. \"One of the most damaging legacies from the Trump administration is the goalposts were moved in such a way that we further limited the rights of asylum-seekers and migrants at the border,\" said Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute. \"And if we don't have the political courage to at least restore the modicum of rights that asylum-seekers have at the border, the moving of those goalposts and the eroding of those rights will be the new normal,\" he said. Those attending the virtual conference were, of course, also interested in what Biden had to say about pandemic relief. The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Latino families, said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, deputy vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS. \"While immigration packs a powerful punch and it is incredibly important for Latinos, we care deeply about the economy and jobs,\" Martinez said. \"We care deeply about how we're going to recover from the pandemic and about health care, particularly the cost of health care, and all of those things are interconnected and they also intersect with the most vulnerable among us who are immigrants and the undocumented.\" There are obvious political reasons to address the fastest-growing population in the country. Matt Barreto, a Democratic pollster who advised the Biden campaign, said political parties need to engage with the community well ahead of elections, noting the large number of first-time voters who are Latino. \"Because of that churn of new citizens and young people, you can't take the Latino vote for granted,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabrielius Landsbergis about the increase in the number of migrants crossing the border into Lithuania from Belarus.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Let's zoom in now on a border 400-plus miles long snaking between Belarus and neighboring Lithuania. This border has been busy recently. Migrants, many originally from Middle Eastern or African countries, have been crossing in recent weeks for the Belarus side to the Lithuanian side. Lithuania says it needs to stop and has started building a razor wire fence along that border. To talk about this, we have the foreign minister of Lithuania on the line from Vilnius, Gabrielius Landsbergis. Welcome. GABRIELIUS LANDSBERGIS: Hello. KELLY: Describe the status of this fence and what you hope that it will do. LANDSBERGIS: Well, currently, as of today, we have more than 2,400 people that crossed illegally during the last two months the border between Belarus and Lithuania. And it's increasingly worrying since to our knowledge, there are still a lot of people on the other side. So the barrier that we're building - well, at least it should discourage the people that the border is not open, that it's not a legal way to cross it. And part of it is actually a story about how criminal organizations or even a criminal regime of Belarus is actually using these people as a sort of a weapon against my country, against the European Union. KELLY: Hang on. I just want to understand. Belarus, which is landlocked, which is in northern Europe - why would people go to Belarus if what they wanted to do was to come next door to you, to Lithuania? LANDSBERGIS: Well, that's a very good question because this is actually what they are being sold - a safe trip that starts somewhere, let's say, in northern Iraq, in Irbil. Then they fly to Baghdad. Then from there they fly to Minsk. They spend several days in Minsk. And then they are taken on a minivan, on a bus to a border with Lithuania. And then they actually are shown the way through the border where it's easiest to cross. Obviously, nobody's saying that it's an illegal trip. And people are paying enormous money for that - somewhere from 1,500 up to 20,000 euros. They would like to go to Germany, to Sweden, to Austria. But since - as any member of a European country, we are obliged to keep people in as a first-accepting country. KELLY: You've just mentioned a key part of the context here for Americans following along. Your country, Lithuania, is in the European Union. Belarus is not. LANDSBERGIS: Yes, exactly. KELLY: You said you believe these people are being used as weapons. What do you mean? LANDSBERGIS: Well, because the goal of the Belarusian government is not to help the people of Iraq. It's actually to change a policy of a European country that was outspoken about the abuses that were happening in Belarus. And they don't like it, and therefore, they know, you know, which buttons they can press. And obviously, one of the most sensitive subjects in any European country or even Western country is the problem of migration. KELLY: I don't want to lose sight of the fact that these are people at stake, human beings whose lives are on the line here. For the migrants coming to your country, for those already in your country, you're housing them. What happens to them? Will they have an opportunity to apply for asylum? LANDSBERGIS: They are applying, but unfortunately, I don't think that this is working the way they expect it since it's very difficult for them to prove that they are actually people seeking political asylum. KELLY: Have any received asylum in your country? LANDSBERGIS: Not a single one. And there might be some cases. I know that they are under review, but this is not what they've probably been expecting. KELLY: While I've got you, I want to ask about someone who fled to your country under very different circumstances - Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of the pro-democracy movement there in Belarus. She has been living in exile in your country. What kind of support is your government providing either to her personally or to the broader pro-democracy movement next door? LANDSBERGIS: On a practical terms, I have to say that Lithuania has issued more than 2,000 visas for political refugees from Belarus and Russia. I think that alone is a strong message to the regimes next door that Lithuania is serious about defense of democracy and liberty in the region, well, to say the least. We are using our - you know, the political influence that we have so that we can gather support for the democratic movement so that we can build on pressure up until the point where these countries can expect actual democratic elections. KELLY: Gabrielius Landsbergis is the foreign minister of Lithuania, and he joined us from Vilnius. Thank you. LANDSBERGIS: Thank you so much. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We know that President Biden won the 2020 election (regardless of what former President Donald Trump and his allies say). We just haven't had a great picture of how Biden won. That is until Wednesday, when we got the clearest data yet on how different groups voted, and crucially, how those votes shifted from 2016. The Pew Research Center just released its validated voters' report, considered a more accurate measure of the electorate than exit polls, which have the potential for significant inaccuracies. The new Pew data shows that shifts among suburban voters, white men and independents helped Biden win in November, even while white women and Hispanics swung toward Trump from 2016 to 2020. To compile the data, Pew matches up survey respondents with state voter records. Those voter files do not say how a person voted, but they do allow researchers to be sure that a person voted, period. That helps with accuracy, eliminating the possibility of survey respondents overreporting their voting activity. In addition, the Pew study uses large samples of Americans \u2014 more than 11,000 people in 2020. It's a numbers-packed report, but there are some big takeaways about what happened in 2020 (and what it might tell us about 2022 and beyond): Suburban voters appear to have been a major factor helping Biden win. While Pew found Trump winning the suburbs by 2 points in 2016, Biden won them by 11 points in 2020, a 13-point overall swing. Considering that the suburbs accounted for just over half of all voters, it was a big demographic win for Biden. That said, Trump gained in both rural and urban areas. He won 65% of rural voters, a 6-point jump from 2016. And while cities were still majority-Democratic, his support there jumped by 9 points, to 33%. In 2020, men were nearly evenly split, with 48% choosing Biden to Trump's 50%. That gap shrank considerably from 2016, when Trump won men by 11 points. In addition, this group that swung away from Trump grew as a share of the electorate from 2016 \u2014 signaling that in a year with high turnout, men's turnout grew more. White men were a big part of the swing toward Biden. In 2016, Trump won white men by 30 points. In 2020, he won them again, but by a substantially slimmer 17 points. In addition, Biden made significant gains among married men and college-educated men. All of these groups overlap, but they help paint a more detailed portrait of the type of men who might have shifted or newly participated in 2020. However, we can't know from this data what exactly was behind these shifts among men \u2014 for example, exactly what share of men might have sat on the sidelines in 2016, as opposed to 2020. The idea that a majority of white women voted for Trump quickly became one of the 2016 election's most-cited statistics, as many Hillary Clinton supporters \u2014 particularly women \u2014 were outraged to see other women support Trump. While that statistic was repeated over and over, Pew's data ultimately said this wasn't true \u2014 they found that in 2016, white women were split 47% to 45%, slightly in Trump's favor but not a majority. This year, however, it appears that Trump did win a majority of white women. Pew found that 53% of white women chose Trump this year, up by 6 points from 2016. This support contributed to an overall shift in women's numbers \u2014 while Clinton won women of all races by 15 points in 2016, Biden won them by 11 points in 2020. Combined with men's shifts described above, it shrank 2016's historic gender gap. Notably, the swing in white women's margin (5 points altogether) was significantly smaller than white men's swing toward Biden (13 points altogether). Trump won 38% of Hispanic voters in 2020, according to Pew, up from 28% in 2016. That 38% would put Trump near George W. Bush's 40% from 2004 \u2014 a recent high-water mark for Republicans with Hispanic voters. That share fell off substantially after 2004, leading some Republican pollsters and strategists to wonder how the party could regain that ground. Trump in 2016 intensified those fears, with his nativist rhetoric and hard-line immigration policies. There are some important nuances to these Hispanic numbers. Perhaps most notably, there is a sizable education gap. Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters by 39 points, but the Democrat won those with some college education or less by 14 points. That gap mirrors the education gap regularly seen in the broader voting population. Unfortunately, Pew's sample sizes from 2016 weren't big enough to break down Hispanic voters by gender that year, so it's impossible to see if this group's gender gap widened. Unlike white and Hispanic voters, Black voters didn't shift significantly from 2016. They remained Democratic stalwarts, with 92% choosing Biden \u2014 barely changed from four years earlier. Nearly three-quarters of Asian voters also voted for Biden, along with 6 in 10 Hispanic voters and 56% of voters who chose \"other\" as their race. (Those groups' sample sizes also weren't big enough in 2016 to draw a comparison over time.) In many of these cases where there were substantial shifts in how different groups voted, they weren't surprising, given how voters in the last midterms voted. For example, white men voted more for Democrats in 2018 than they did in 2016, as did suburban voters. In 2016, Clinton won 28% of this group that is a key part of Trump's base (and that makes up more than 40% of the electorate). Biden improved slightly upon Clinton's performance here, winning 33% of this group. However, Trump did not lose ground with this group, holding steady with roughly two-thirds of these voters. That's because the share of this group that may have voted third party appears to have shrunk. Pew's data shows that Trump won a majority of this group, as he did in 2016. However, Biden \u2014 himself a Catholic \u2014 gained considerably among them, compared with Clinton's 2016 performance. In 2016, she won 31% of this group, according to Pew. Biden, meanwhile, won 42% of white Catholics in 2020. Meanwhile, white evangelicals \u2014 a cornerstone of the GOP's base for decades \u2014 seem to have voted even more strongly Republican. Pew's data shows 84% of this group voting for Trump in 2020, up from 77% in 2016. The basic pattern of older voters tending more Republican and younger voters tending more Democratic held in 2020. In addition, the silent generation, boomers and Generation X all had roughly the same partisan voting patterns as they did in 2016. However, millennials showed a slightly bigger lean toward Trump than they did in 2016, with his share among that generation moving from 31% to 39%. Also notably, for the first time, the silent and boomer generations together constituted a minority of voters, with Gen X, millennials and Generation Z accounting for a majority. The data signals that Democrats' strength with Hispanic voters has eroded, but that the party succeeded in making further inroads in the suburbs, including among suburban whites. It suggests that these groups, already major focuses for both parties, will continue to be so in 2022, with Republicans trying to cement their gains among Hispanics (and regain suburban voters), while Democrats do Hispanic outreach and try to hold onto the suburbs. However, it's hard to project much into the future about what voters will do based on the past two elections because of their unique turnout numbers. \"It's hard to interpret here, because 2018 was such a high turnout midterm election, and then our last data point, 2014, was a historically low turnout midterm election,\" said Ruth Igielnik, senior researcher at Pew Research Center.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with New York Times reporter Anatoly Kurmanaev on the recent crackdown of press in Nicaragua as the government jails opposition leaders ahead of the November election.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The crackdown on opponents of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega continues. Yesterday, a reporter was arrested and charged with aiding foreign intervention in the country. These are similar accusations that have led to the arrest of nearly 20 opposition figures, including former government officials and key business leaders. This crackdown, which began late last month, has virtually wiped out opposition to President Ortega, who's set to run for a fourth consecutive term in November. New York Times reporter Anatoly Kurmanaev was recently denied entry into Nicaragua to cover all of this. He covers Mexico and South America for The Times and joins us now from Mexico City. Welcome. ANATOLY KURMANAEV: Thank you for having me. CHANG: So I understand the airline actually canceled your ticket to Managua shortly before you were even boarding. What happened exactly? KURMANAEV: Nicaraguan authorities didn't approve my entry into the country. I asked them if there was anything wrong. They said no, it's - you've been blacklisted and... CHANG: Wow. KURMANAEV: ...You're off a plane. CHANG: And did they tell you the grounds for, quote, unquote, \"blacklisting\" you at that point? KURMANAEV: I have tried contacting the vice president of the country, and I only received a one-sentence reply - thank you for your interest. CHANG: Well, it's not just you who's gotten targeted. Journalists in Nicaragua have also been targeted as well. Yesterday, there was a raid on a prominent journalist's home, I understand. And another journalist was arrested yesterday as well. Do you have a sense of how widespread this targeting of journalists is? KURMANAEV: This was always quite a restrictive environment for journalists to operate. And this latest wave of repression that we're seeing this month - it just went into the overdrive. CHANG: And why? Why is this wave happening now in particular? What's behind this? KURMANAEV: It's very hard to speculate. There has been some hopes that the government will use all the advantages it has as an incumbent to divide the oppositions and, you know, to use the advantage to basically win the election. CHANG: I saw one of your tweets earlier where you write, every day, someone you spoke with is arrested. You start writing someone and realize they've just been charged. I mean, we're talking not just about journalists. We're talking about prominent opposition figures, some of them past allies of Ortega. What are they being charged with exactly? KURMANAEV: In the last few months, the government has passed several laws, and two of them are being used to basically eliminate their opponents. One is the so-called sovereignty law, which allows to call anyone a traitor and jail them for that. And the other one is cybercrimes law, which allows the government to arrest any journalist and charge them with publishing, you know, false news. And of course, it's the government itself that decides what is false news. So these are two very broad laws that basically eliminate the last modicum of, you know, legal and civil rights in the country. CHANG: Well, what options are available for the U.S. to address this? I mean, the U.S. has already sanctioned members high up in the Ortega government. What else can the U.S. and the rest of the international community do to respond to what's happening? KURMANAEV: So far, sanctions have been focused on provisionals (ph), but the U.S. can still roll out economic sanctions against Nicaragua. Whether it wants to do it, of course, is another question because, of course, the Biden administration is very worried about rising flow of migrants from Central America. And we are beginning to see some interesting signs. So Argentina and Mexico, two left-wing governments in Latin America who have been quite cautious about criticizing Nicaragua up to now, had recalled their ambassadors recently, just in the last couple of days, for consultations as a response to the crackdown. This is something quite unprecedented because they - you know, these countries have voted against resumption (ph) recently, international resolution to condemn the government for repression. Even for the standards of Latin America, I think what's happening in Nicaragua is beginning to shock some governments. CHANG: Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Mexico and South America for The New York Times.

The far right appears to be gaining.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: French voters head to the polls this weekend for the first round of elections in the country's 13 regions. Like U.S. midterms, it's seen as a bellwether ahead of next year's presidential race. And for the first time, the far right is poised to win control of one of the country's regions. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports. (SOUNDBITE OF BELLS RINGING) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: On this warm spring evening, a crowd gathers near a church on a palm tree-lined plaza facing the Mediterranean Sea. People in the working-class town of Bandol are here for a rally in support of a far-right candidate who's running for president of their region on the French Riviera. In the crowd is 70-year-old Damienne Lequien, who says President Emmanuel Macron has brought France low. DAMIENNE LEQUIEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Imagine what Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks when he sees the French president get slapped in the face, says Lequien. She's talking about an incident that happened last week when Macron was shaking hands in a crowd. She goes on. LEQUIEN: (Through interpreter) Macron speaks poorly about France when he's abroad. He's giving the country away. And why does he speak English all the time? General de Gaulle only spoke French. Macron's a globalist. We need someone to restore French grandeur and sovereignty. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THIERRY MARIANI: (Speaking French). (APPLAUSE) BEARDSLEY: Lequien plans to vote for candidate Thierry Mariani, who has just taken the stage. Mariani is running on the ticket of Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Rally. He promises to make the streets safer and tighten the nearby border with Italy against illegal migrants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARIANI: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: He disparages the record of the current regional president, who hails from the mainstream conservative party that Mariani used to belong to. But that party was devastated by Macron's victory with his brand-new party in 2017. Analyst Jean-Yves Camus says the French political landscape has completely changed from five years ago. JEAN-YVES CAMUS: The political landscape in France is just so scattered. And the formerly mainstream parties are so small, and their voters are so disillusioned with them. BEARDSLEY: Polls show Le Pen is again poised to be Macron's chief opponent in next year's presidential race. But this second time around, her numbers are higher, and it's Macron who's moving to the right in a play to capture her electorate. Candidate Mariani says Le Pen's party is seizing the moment. MARIANI: I think the most important question now for French people is immigration and violence. And in fact, we want to have an occasion to prove that we can change the country because we are able to change a region. BEARDSLEY: Mariani's region is a prize. It's prominent, says Camus, and its French Riviera location would showcase the far-right to the world. CAMUS: Between Marseilles and Nice was a lot of tourists, a lot of activity for foreign companies. So that would also mean something in terms of, oh, France is seen abroad. BEARDSLEY: People crowd around Mariani for selfies. They say fighting radical Islam should be a top priority after several terrorist attacks in the last year. That feeling is also being stoked by social media and television news channels that increasingly push identity politics. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Speaking French). JOAQUIM BISMUTH: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Joaquim Bismuth is watching his three little daughters run around the plaza. He describes the situation in France as tense and very complex. BISMUTH: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: There's a confrontation between two opposing sides, he says, nationalists who can sometimes be racist and those for globalization. The climate in France today, he says, reminds him of the U.S. five years ago on the eve of Donald Trump's election. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Bandol, France.

L\u00f3pez Obrador's Morena party will have to rely on votes from its allies in the Workers Party and Green Party, but together they were expected to capture between 265 and 292 seats in the 500-seat chamber. Morena alone was expected to win 190 to 203 seats. That would signal a significant decline for the president's party. In the current congress, Morena has a simple majority, holding 253 seats on its own. It would also deprive the president of a qualified majority of two-thirds required to approve constitutional reforms. L\u00f3pez Obrador appeared to acknowledge that new reality Monday. He praised the election as \"free, clean\" and said Mexicans had shown a degree of political maturity \"never seen.\" \"You voted for two different and opposed plans, above all in the federal election,\" he said. \"Those of the transformation plan are going to have the majority in the Chamber of Deputies and this means guaranteeing the sufficient budget for the most in need.\" The results give the president sufficient budgetary control to continue his train and refinery-building plans and cash handout programs, but may deny him congressional backing to escalate his ongoing spats with the courts and regulatory agencies. \"The voters have given a mandate that says 'I am not writing a blank check for any of the movements in Mexico',\" said Luis Miguel P\u00e9rez Ju\u00e1rez, a political science expert at the Monterrey Technological university. The opposition alliance made up of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, National Action Party and Party of the Democratic Revolution were estimated to win between 181 and 213 seats. Those would be gains for those parties, which have often appeared rudderless in the face of L\u00f3pez Obrador's popularity. Even without L\u00f3pez Obrador on the ballot, the mid-term elections were seen by many as a referendum on his administration and his ability to continue what he calls the \"Fourth Transformation\" of Mexico. Turnout was high for mid-term elections, edging above 51% of eligible voters. L\u00f3pez Obrador's party did better than expected in state governors' races, and appeared headed for wins in at least ten of the 15 states up for grabs. But the president's party was battered in Mexico City, long considered his stronghold and where he once served as mayor. The capital suffered more than many other areas during the coronavirus pandemic. L\u00f3pez Obrador's critics had depicted the elections as a chance to stop the still-popular president from concentrating more power and weakening checks and balances. The president said the opposition is dominated by conservatives who oppose his campaign against corruption and wasteful spending. L\u00f3pez Obrador has complained about courts and independent regulatory agencies that have blocked some of his tougher proposals to empower state-owned industries. Opponents warned that if he won a majority, he might try to subjugate courts and regulatory agencies created during Mexico's decades-long transition to full democracy. After polls closed, Lorenzo C\u00f3rdova, president of the National Electoral Institute, declared the election a success. He said only 30 of more than 130,000 polling places across the country were not able to open due to a variety of circumstances. Half of those unopened polling places were in the southern state of Oaxaca where voting materials were stolen or damaged, institute Executive Secretary Edmundo Jacobo said Sunday night. Representatives of the major parties speaking at the electoral institute's general council meeting applauded the conduct of Sunday's vote amid the pandemic, despite noting that the run-up to voting was one of the most violent in recent times. As for much of the campaign, violence marked the days leading up to the vote. On Saturday, an employee of the state prosecutors' office in Chiapas who was not authorized to be quoted said five people who were carrying voting material to polling places were ambushed and killed on a rural highway. Those killed appeared to be volunteers, not government employees. And on Sunday, prosecutors said another four people were shot to death in another remote Chiapas mountain town in what appeared to be a politically motivated attack. Nationwide, three dozen candidates were killed during the campaigns; almost all of the victims were running for one of the 20,000 local posts including mayors and town council up for grabs in 30 states. In Guanajuato state, Mexico's most violent, a woman who stepped in as mayoral candidate after her mother was murdered won an overwhelming victory in the town of Morole\u00f3n. L\u00f3pez Obrador praised the otherwise peaceful elections, and even sent a message of recognition to the drug cartels that fuel much of the country's violence. \"People who belong to organized crime behaved very well, in general, there were few acts of violence by these groups,\" the president said. \"I think the white-collar criminals acted worse.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador has raised minimum wages and strengthened government aid programs like supplementary payments to the elderly, students and training programs for youths. He has also created a quasi-military National Guard and given the army a huge role in building his pet projects, which include trains, an oil refinery and airports. But he has not hewed to a traditional leftist line. He has maintained friendly if sometimes tension-fraught relations with the United States and willingly helped keep tens of thousands of Central American migrants from reaching the U.S. border. He abhors government debt or waste. Opponents depict him as intolerant of criticism and obsessed with a nostalgic 1960s vision of Mexico, when oil was king and state-owned companies dominated many sectors of the economy. Socially conservative and a professed Christian \"in the broadest sense,\" he has angered feminists with his policies, but has pleased many Mexicans by living austerely. The elections represent the first mass public events since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country over a year ago, though case numbers have fallen and Mexico has vaccinated about a quarter of adults. The estimated 350,000 fatalities in the pandemic \u2014 about 230,000 of them test-confirmed \u2014 do not appear to have played a major role in the campaigns, but weighed on voters' minds.",

At the time, he was Israel's Economy Minister.\n                \n                    \n                    Kristy Sparow/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Naftali Bennett, seen here paying his respects in Paris following the terrorist attacks on Jan. 11, 2015. At the time, he was Israel's Economy Minister. He's the son of American immigrants who became a self-made tech millionaire before entering the rough-and-tumble world of Israeli politics. Now, Naftali Bennett could soon lead Israel after his right-wing Yamina party reached an agreement with several other opposition parties to form a new government \u2014 and end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12 uninterrupted years in office. There are still several steps left before a new government can be sworn in, and more opportunities ahead for the effort to fail. But if all goes according to his plan, Israel's new prime minister will be 49-year-old Bennett, a religious Jewish nationalist who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state yet has agreed to partner with a religious Muslim party to topple Netanyahu. Below are excerpts from a conversation between All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly with NPR International Correspondent Daniel Estrin, conducted Monday. KELLY: OK. So tell us more about this guy. Who is Naftali Bennett? ESTRIN: He is a hardline conservative. He has a religious Jewish nationalist base, and he has long had ambitions to be prime minister. He's also a long-time Netanyahu ally. But yesterday [May 30], for the very first time, he publicly broke with Netanyahu in an effort to try to unseat him. And to do that, he will need to partner with a very diverse group of parties from the left, the right, the center, even an Arab Islamist party, potentially. And the proposal is that he would serve for about two years as prime minister and then let a centrist politician, Yair Lapid, take over. KELLY: And this is so fascinating that it potentially could be a long-time Netanyahu ally who finally takes the reins from Netanyahu. How did he get here? ESTRIN: Right. Well, he was born to immigrants from San Francisco. He's a religious Jew. He wears a yarmulke. He then made millions as a tech entrepreneur in the U.S. He moved back to Israel to get into politics. He was the former chief of staff to Netanyahu about 15 years ago. He then led a West Bank settler organization, served as education minister, after that, defense minister. Bennett at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in New York City in May 2017 when he was Israel's Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister.\n                \n                    \n                    SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bennett at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in New York City in May 2017 when he was Israel's Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister. And he has this kind of bro persona. He's about 49 years old and younger than many other politicians in this country and served in an elite commando unit of the Israeli military, so he appeals to younger Israelis who have served in the army. He rose to prominence with this message. [H]ere's how he put it on Israeli i24 News this year. \"We believe in strengthening the Jewish identity of Israel. I'm Jewish. I believe that we have to embrace our heritage, our history, our - you know, our roots. I'm not ashamed of that. I'm right-wing, and I'm proud of that.\" -- Naftali Bennett KELLY: Daniel, I want to stay there - him calling himself right-wing. I think you called him a hardline conservative. What does that actually mean in terms of what his policies would look like as prime minister? ESTRIN: Well, for instance, on the question of a Palestinian state, he is firmly opposed to the Palestinian demand for an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He says Israel has already given Gaza to the Palestinians. Hamas took it over. Israel and the U.S. consider them a terror group. He says Israel shouldn't do that again and let Palestinians have a state with the West Bank. He refers to that land by its biblical name, Judea and Samaria. Let's listen to him on CNN in 2016. Bennett, head of the national-religious Yamina party, and his wife Gilat Bennett arrive at a polling station to cast their ballots in Ra'anana, Israel, in March.\n                \n                    \n                    NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bennett, head of the national-religious Yamina party, and his wife Gilat Bennett arrive at a polling station to cast their ballots in Ra'anana, Israel, in March. \"I oppose forming a second Palestinian state in what you call the West Bank. Judea and Samaria has been a Jewish state for roughly 3,300 years, well before, you know, the first Americans reached the new continent of America. And we're going to stay here forever.\" -- Naftali Bennett ESTRIN: Now, despite this stance, this government that he's aiming to form will not be able to push any kinds of controversial issues, like the question of a Palestinian state. He's partnering with leftist, centrists, et cetera. And so the idea is they're just going to focus on mostly getting rid of Netanyahu and not much else. KELLY: And how likely is that actually to happen, Daniel? Netanyahu, as we noted, has a talent for holding on to power. ESTRIN: There are many reasons that this could fail because Bennett is facing a lot of pushback from right-wing politicians, even from Netanyahu himself, who's framing this as dangerous to the security of Israel - for him to partner with leftists, centrists, even Arab politicians. The coalition - this diverse coalition - does have an interest to be in power. They want to unseat Netanyahu. That could keep them together despite their ideological differences. But still, lots of opportunities for Netanyahu to drive a wedge and make them collapse, and then Netanyahu could run again.",

Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Oakland, Calif., on Monday where he announced a new round of $600 stimulus checks residents making up to $75,000 a year. Newsom also announced a projected $75.7 billion budget surplus compared to last year's projected $54.3 billion shortfall. A year after slashing spending to fill a record-breaking deficit spurred by the pandemic, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is eyeing a massive surplus and hopes to send out a second, larger round of stimulus checks to residents. \"It's a remarkable, remarkable turnaround,\" Newsom said in an interview with All Things Considered Monday. California's progressive tax structure means the state budget suffered early in the pandemic but quickly rebounded, bolstered by capital gains taxes and high-income earners who've seen their wealth grow over the past year. Newsom, who will likely face a recall election later this year, announced a plan to send billions of dollars back to taxpayers. If approved, the state would give $600 checks to workers who earn up to $75,000 annually, with $500 bonuses for tax filers with dependents and undocumented families. Newsom said 80% of the state's workers and two-thirds of all residents would benefit from the plan. State law requires that taxpayers get a rebate when a budget surplus hits a certain size, which has only happened once in California in more than 40 years. A spokesperson for the California Department of Finance said the numbers for this year's state budget won't be finalized until 2023. Newsom said his stimulus proposal, which totals just under $12 billion in relief, goes \"well above and beyond what is projected to be required\" by the law. He claimed it is \"the largest tax relief year-over-year in U.S. history as well, not just California history.\" Several Republican lawmakers called Newsom's proposal the \"recall refund,\" noting the governor announced the plan weeks after state officials confirmed the petition to recall him has enough valid signatures to go before voters. Who is gonna tell @GavinNewsom that this is what Republicans have said for years?#RecallRebate https://t.co/FfawZ7YgJk State Sen. Scott Wilk used the hashtag #RecallRebate in a tweet calling out the governor's plan. Newsom has denied the timing of the stimulus plan is tied to his political future and painted the recall effort as one funded and pushed by Republicans. \"It is a Republican-backed recall period, full stop,\" he said. \"To the extent that people rightfully and understandably were stressed and anxious over the last year because of this pandemic-induced recession and all the struggle, I completely respect and understand why some may have filled out a petition. But at the end of the day, this is what it is, a Republican-backed recall.\" Lawmakers need to sign off on the stimulus plan but leaders of the budget committee attended the announcement in support, signaling it will pass.",

            "article_content": "French President Emmanuel Macron is moving politically rightward as he eyes a challenge by the populist leader Marine Le Pen.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Facing no threat from the left in next year's election, French President Emmanuel Macron is moving sharply to the right. His principal opponent is likely to be the far-right populist Marine Le Pen. When they faced off in 2017, voters rallied to Macron to keep Le Pen out of office. But as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, that may not happen in next year's vote. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Parliamentarians from France's mainstream Conservative Party have been proposing a flurry of controversial amendments aimed at restricting the Muslim veil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VALERIE BOYER: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"We can't let Islamist totalitarianism impose its symbols on minors,\" said Senator Valerie Boyer as she introduced a measure to ban girls under 18 from wearing the hijab. The amendments have no chance of becoming law, but they show how desperate the Conservative Party is to win back voters it lost to the far right, says Rim-Sarah Alouane, who studies religious freedom and civil liberties at the University of Toulouse Capitole. RIM-SARAH ALOUANE: With the election coming, of course, it's who is going to pander the most to the far right. I mean, all political parties are adopting the rhetoric of the far right. It's like a dream come true. They are running a campaign for them. Marine Le Pen doesn't have anything to do, to be honest. BEARDSLEY: The amendments were to a larger bill to fight extremism proposed by Macron's centrist government. It will give broad powers to shut down religious and other organizations seen as promoting ideas incompatible with French values. In an interview this month with the Anglo-American Press Association, Marine Le Pen called the bill discriminatory. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Through interpreter) In our fight against radical Islam, we need national unity and all religions with us. And the president is accusing them. I would never mix up Islam the religion and Islamism, which is an ideology like Nazism or racism. BEARDSLEY: Le Pen says her policies are not far right. They're just good sense, and the rest of the political class is now espousing them. Political scientist Jean-Yves Camus says the bill represents a hard shift to the right for Macron, but it's doomed to fail. JEAN-YVES CAMUS: Because every time the conservative right have tried to outdo the far right on issues of immigration, national identity and Islam, it has failed. It's really a big mistake. BEARDSLEY: Macron's bill has raised concerns among religious leaders of all denominations. Alouane says France has plenty of laws on the books to fight terrorism. This bill is about something else. ALOUANE: It is a bill that is aimed to reshape the relation between state and religion and particularly concerning Muslims and the visibility of Islam. And this law affects many civil liberties that we have taken for granted for so long. BEARDSLEY: Macron's tack to the right has unnerved many of his supporters. He's accused of becoming more authoritarian. Critics cite police violence, crackdowns on protesters and a proposed law banning people from taking pictures of the police. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADIYA LAZZOUNI: (Non-English language spoken). BEARDSLEY: Journalist Nadiya Lazzouni has an interview talk show on YouTube. She's also Muslim and wears a hijab. Lazzouni says she's sure there'll be a rematch of Le Pen Macron next year in the second round of the presidential vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAZZOUNI: (Non-English language spoken). BEARDSLEY: \"And he'll call on Muslims and humanists and freedom lovers to come out and support him to block her,\" she says. \"But this time we may not show up.\" Lazzouni says people like her won't vote for Le Pen. They just won't vote at all. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The two were picked up by U.S. agents and given medical attention. Esto es una gran verg\u00fcenza para los gobiernos de #Guatemala #Honduras #ElSalvador sus compatriotas merecen gobiernos que realmente est\u00e1n comprometidos a combatir la corrupci\u00f3n y el narco! https://t.co/kvbulArY7d Along with a link to the video, Torres tweeted \u2014 in Spanish \u2014 that the incident is \"a great shame for the governments of #Guatemala #Honduras #ElSalvador their compatriots deserve governments that are truly committed to fighting corruption and narco[trafficking]!\" The two girls, ages 3 and 5, are from Ecuador, not any of the three countries Torres mentioned. The majority of the unaccompanied minors currently coming across the U.S. border are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, collectively known as the Northern Triangle of Central America, according to CBP. El Salvador's Bukele, an avid Twitter user, hit back fast with his own Spanish-language tweet. \"Look ma'am, did you read that the children are from ECUADOR and not from EL SALVADOR? Also, this happened on the border of Mexico with the United States. What does El Salvador have to do with this?\" The  Salvadoran president then told Torres that she should buy some glasses with a portion of her \"financier's checks.\" Mire se\u00f1ora, \u00bfley\u00f3 que los ni\u00f1os son de ECUADOR y no de EL SALVADOR?Adem\u00e1s, esto ocurri\u00f3 en la frontera de M\u00e9xico con Estados Unidos.\u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene que ver El Salvador en esto?Deber\u00eda de usar una parte del cheque de sus financistas para comprar anteojos. https://t.co/BGTKJAfFE6 That appeared to be a reference to billionaire financier George Soros. Bukele has often blasted U.S. lawmakers critical of his administration for taking donations from Soros' Open Society Foundations, which says it works on multiple projects throughout Central America to build \"just, inclusive democracies\" and has been at odds with Bukele. U.S. lawmakers, human rights advocates and anti-corruption activists have increasingly warned of the Salvadoran leader's autocratic style since he swept into office in 2019. Bukele condemns critics, including the country's high court and the media, and even sent troops into the Legislative Assembly after lawmakers rejected one of his budgets. But Bukele, at 39 the youngest president in Latin America, is extremely popular. He is often seen wearing a backward baseball cap and sports clothes, and his Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) party won big in last month's legislative elections, taking control of the national legislature. Torres, one of Bukele's leading critics, kept up the tweet for tweet \u2014 this time in English \u2014 calling the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border the result of \"narcissistic dictators like you interested in being 'cool' while people flee by the 1000s & die by the 100s.\" Pres.@nayibbukele\u2014I'll make it clearer. This is a result of narcissistic dictators like you interested in being \u201ccool\u201d while people flee by the 1000s & die by the 100s.Send me a pair of glasses so I may see the suffering of your people through your eyes.https://t.co/eBCahxNzmM pic.twitter.com/F4O173fYcZ She countered Bukele's suggestion that she buy some glasses: \"Send me a pair of glasses so I may see the suffering of your people through your eyes.\" And Torres attached a picture that went viral in 2019 during a previous surge of Central American migrants at the border under the Trump administration. The image was of the lifeless bodies of a Salvadoran father and his daughter on the banks of the Rio Grande in Texas. In response, Bukele pointed out that he wasn't president at the time, and in another tweet urged all Salvadorans and others from Latin America living in Torres' congressional district in Southern California not to vote for her. Espero que todos mis hermanos salvadore\u00f1os, mexicanos, hondure\u00f1os, guatemaltecos, dominicanos, venezolanos y todos los latinoamericanos del Distrito 35 de California NO VOTEN por @NormaJTorres.No trabaja para ustedes, sino para mantener a nuestros pa\u00edses en el subdesarrollo. The four-term Torres is not up for reelection until 2022. She defeated her Republican rival last year in the heavily Democratic 35th Congressional District with 70% of the vote. A spokesperson for Bukele told NPR, seeking comment, that the president's tweets speak for themselves. And a spokesperson for Torres said the congresswoman was traveling Friday and unavailable for an interview.",

Leaders from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras were meeting with Biden for two days of talks about child migrants entering the United States. Editor's update: On Feb. 16, former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez appeared in court in Tegucigalpa, having been arrested the day before following an extradition request from the United States, where he faces drug traffic-related charges. The news analysis that follows was published in March 2021. MEXICO CITY \u2014 The case made in the U.S. Senate's Honduras bill sounds straightforward: Washington should cut security aid to Honduras and sanction its president over \"deeply alarming corruption\" and human rights abuses, its authors say. And in the U.S. House, members recently reintroduced the Berta C\u00e1ceres Human Rights in Honduras Act, named for the Indigenous environmental activist murdered in 2016, which also calls for withholding U.S. funds from Honduras' military and police over corruption. Accusations have piled up against President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, other Honduran officials and security forces, ranging from organized crime collusion to civil society repression. U.S. prosecutors even accuse Hern\u00e1ndez of taking bribes to help an alleged drug trafficker move tons of cocaine into the United States, which he denies. For Hern\u00e1ndez's critics in the Central American country, the sanctions would be welcome punishment at the highest level of government. \"Not even the arrival of a gifted shipment of [COVID-19] vaccines causes as much joy as the introduction of [the Senate bill],\" columnist Gabriela Castellanos wrote in El Heraldo, a leading Honduran newspaper that largely supports the president. But breaking from Hern\u00e1ndez won't be easy for the Biden administration. The rising pressure from Democratic lawmakers to punish Honduras' government comes as President Biden seeks $4 billion in aid from Congress to address the root causes of migration in Central America. It also follows years of U.S. training and partnering with the country's security forces. The FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. armed forces in Latin America and the Caribbean, all work closely with their Honduran counterparts to bust drug-smuggling networks. Three people arrested for the C\u00e1ceres killing were U.S.-trained Honduran special forces. A U.S.-friendly regime Looking back, the 2009 coup against Honduras' then-President Manuel Zelaya marked a turning point in U.S relations with the country. Zelaya had been critical of U.S. intervention and was friendly with Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez when the Honduran military decided he was abusing his power. \"When that coup happened, the U.S. did everything it could to stabilize the coup regime,\" says Dana Frank, a history professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of The Long Honduran Night: Resistance Terror, and the United States in the Aftermath of the Coup. \"Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton at State and Joe Biden as vice president were all central in recognizing the outcome and stabilizing the government.\" In the early Obama years, Southern Command was documenting a major increase in small planes and boats suspected of trafficking cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia onto the Caribbean shores of Honduras. Something had to be done, they said. \"Without thinking enough about corruption, they were using defense money to build new bases all along the coasts, they're training up all these specialized [Honduran] units,\" explains Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America. As SOUTHCOM and the DEA built up their presence in Honduras, President Hern\u00e1ndez and his predecessor Porfirio Lobo \u2014 also accused of working with drug traffickers \u2014 welcomed the U.S. forces. \"[U.S. authorities] were delighted to not have a government pushing back,\" against military presence, says Isacson. A migration ally But it wasn't just stopping drugs: In 2014, a sharp rise in Central American child migrants reached the U.S. border, the largest number of them from Honduras. The Obama administration said it needed to collaborate with Central American countries to stop so many vulnerable people from fleeing. Then-Vice President Biden led the efforts. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez speaks to his supporters in Tegucigalpa, on Oct. 20, 2019. He spoke after opposition parties in Honduras accused him of running a drug and corruption network and called for street protests to demand the president step down.\n                \n                    \n                    Orlando Sierra/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez speaks to his supporters in Tegucigalpa, on Oct. 20, 2019. He spoke after opposition parties in Honduras accused him of running a drug and corruption network and called for street protests to demand the president step down. This came at a key moment for Hern\u00e1ndez, who took office in January of that year. An investigation revealed his party had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the national health service to finance his 2013 presidential campaign. The public was outraged and protests were ramping up. In July 2014, Obama and Biden invited Hern\u00e1ndez and other Central American leaders to the White House. Months later, they began pushing the Alliance for Prosperity, a $1 billion investment in the region's economic development and security assistance. \"This is the clearest marker of Biden and Obama saying we are going to pour money in and support this regime,\" says Frank. She claims the administration overlooked evidence of corruption in Central America while pushing this development plan. Indeed, the Guatemalan leader at the time, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, resigned from the presidency in 2015 for leading a customs bribery scheme and is still in prison today. U.S. support for Hern\u00e1ndez continued under President Donald Trump. Hern\u00e1ndez ran for reelection in 2017 \u2014 a controversial move in Honduras. It was Zelaya's intention to seek a second term that coup leaders cited as justification for ousting him. International observers warned of significant inconsistencies and fraud in the vote count, but the Trump administration, after briefly acknowledging those concerns, quickly recognized Hern\u00e1ndez as the winner anyway and he was confirmed a second term. U.S. support remained strong even as Honduran police and military used excessive and lethal force against post-election protesters, according to a United Nations report. In 2019, Trump slashed Central American aid after a rise in Central American migration to the U.S. But he reestablished the assistance once Central American governments agreed to allow asylum-seekers to be sent back to the countries they were fleeing. Working alongside the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Honduran military began stopping citizens from leaving the country, despite that being a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \"Everything during the Trump administration flowed from how [Honduras] can help stop immigration,\" says Frank. At the same time, Hern\u00e1ndez was dismantling internationally backed efforts to tackle corruption in Honduras, and stifling free speech and political opposition. A leaked indictment says he has been bribing journalists for favorable coverage. Hondurans' anger at American backing peaked in 2019 when protesters set fire to the gate to the U.S. Embassy. \"Hern\u00e1ndez has held onto power because he has support from Southern Command, the State Department and the White House,\" says Ismael Moreno Coto, a Jesuit priest, who goes by Padre Melo, and an outspoken critic of Hern\u00e1ndez. Bilateral cooperation continued to deepen. In December 2020, Reuters reported that a government memo said the U.S. could begin sharing sensitive intelligence on drug flights with Honduras. Narco trials This month, pressure on Hern\u00e1ndez \u2014 and by association, on Biden \u2014 is intensifying with the trial of Geovanny Fuentes Ram\u00edrez, a suspected top Honduran drug trafficker, in federal court in Manhattan. Prosecutors are calling the president of Honduras a co-conspirator. And it's not the first time. Despite years of working with U.S. forces to stop drug flows, the president's brother Tony Hern\u00e1ndez was convicted of drug trafficking in a federal court in 2019. In that trial and others involving Honduran traffickers, witnesses have claimed President Hern\u00e1ndez has taken bribes in exchange for letting cocaine pass freely. DEA filings indicate they have been investigating the president's potential ties to traffickers since 2013. Several high-level officials, including police chiefs working directly with U.S. counterparts, have also been charged or accused of similar activities. This week, New York prosecutors alleged the president has spent years enabling a \"violent state sponsored drug trafficking conspiracy,\" although he has not been charged. The prosecutors are seeking life in prison for the president's brother, a former congressman, with a sentencing hearing scheduled Tuesday. Hern\u00e1ndez denies the multiple accusations of working with traffickers, saying drug shipments through Honduras have dropped during his presidency. \"What will the future be like if narcos get benefits in the United States for false testimony with obvious lies? With this magic key, the narcos would kill cooperation [between Honduras and the U.S.],\" he wrote on Twitter. The president's office did not respond to NPR questions. Aid for Honduras The Biden administration \"has to do something now, the cat is out of the bag about who Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is,\" says Frank. The Biden administration has not specifically denounced the Honduran president but is gently suggesting that the $4 billion in aid it wants for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador needs to shift priorities so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. \"The funds we're asking for from Congress don't go to government leaders, they go to communities, to training, to climate mitigation, to violence prevention, to anti-gang programs; in other words, they go to people who migrate in search of hope,\" said Roberta Jacobson, Biden's Southern border ambassador. She said the funds would also address corruption. But the history professor Frank has doubts about where the funds actually end up. \"To think that this aid can evade the central government is quite implausible,\" Frank says. The plan also fails to \"address U.S. security cooperation and intelligence sharing with deeply corrupt police and military,\" she says. Hern\u00e1ndez's term ends in 2022 but some Hondurans are hopeful the bills in U.S. Congress can hasten his departure. \"It's important that the U.S. government denounce and sanction Hern\u00e1ndez,\" says Padre Melo. \"But what's important will not happen in the U.S. It must happen inside Honduras.\" The priest says U.S.-Honduras relations need a profound reset, enabling more political participation for marginalized groups, ensuring free and fair elections and ending support to repressive police and military forces in his country. \"This is like the U.S. paying the debt it owes to Honduras,\" Padre Melo says. \"It must restore what it has been helping destroy in Honduras for decades.\"",

Now that Democrats have passed President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, all eyes turn to what's next. But what that is isn't exactly clear. \"I would expect the president's agenda, moving forward, will reflect the Build Back Better agenda that he talked about on the campaign trail,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. \"But the order, the size, the timeline has not yet been determined.\" In other words, no one quite knows yet. There are indications that infrastructure could be the next big push, but there's also voting rights, the minimum wage (which was nixed from the COVID-19 relief bill and is important to progressives) and immigration. And none of it will be easy to pass \u2014 and may not pass at all. Getting the COVID-19 bill passed had to be done through a maneuver that only required a majority vote because the legislation got zero Republican support. Most legislation requires 60 votes to advance to a floor vote because of the increased use of the filibuster over the past two decades. Republicans under party leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have used it at a high rate, and they show no signs of letting up on its use during the Biden presidency. Biden is still holding out hope that he can get Republicans on board for other legislation, but the track record for bipartisan compromise on big-ticket items isn't very good in Congress. Americans ostensibly value compromise \u2014 this week's NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found, for example, that two-thirds said it is more important for Biden to compromise with Congress to find solutions than to stick to his position on issues even if doing so means gridlock. Of course, people say they want compromise, but they often mean they want others to come around to their position. Biden began his presidency with a flurry of executive actions on a range of issues, from racial justice to climate change to immigration. But there's only so far those executive actions can go. For more meaningful change, any president needs Congress. But if Republicans voted en masse against the COVID-19 relief bill, which was broadly popular with the American public, it's hard to see them coming around on much else. And if Republicans \u2014 who only have a 28% approval rating on how they're handling their job in Congress in the NPR poll \u2014 refuse to compromise on any of Biden's other priorities, almost nothing else will get done. After all, Democrats will only get so many chances to use budget reconciliation, the process they used to do an end run around the filibuster for the COVID-19 relief bill. That maneuver can only be used on bills tied to the budget. Here's where the politics meets the policy for some of the possible next areas of focus for Biden and Congress: Infrastructure Construction crews work on a section of Highway 1, which collapsed into the Pacific Ocean near Big Sur, Calif., in late January.\n                \n                    \n                    Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Construction crews work on a section of Highway 1, which collapsed into the Pacific Ocean near Big Sur, Calif., in late January. Infrastructure should be the one of the most ideologically possible places that both parties agree. Democrats are preparing multitrillion-dollar legislation that would pay for bridges, roads, public transit and water projects. It will also be climate-oriented. \"I have called upon the Chairs of the Committees of Jurisdiction to work with their Republican counterparts to craft a big, bold and transformational infrastructure package,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Friday. \"Building our transportation system has long been bipartisan. It is our hope that spirit will prevail as we address other critical needs in energy and broadband, education and housing, water systems and other priorities. As we engage in these job-creating initiatives, we must discuss their impact on the federal budget, on creating economic growth and on preserving our planet.\" But how many Republicans will really be on board? That's unclear. While both sides agree U.S. infrastructure is a problem, the question, for years, has been how to pay for it. President Barack Obama and then-House Speaker John Boehner came close to some agreement but could never overcome that obstacle. During the Trump years, it became something of a joke inside Washington every time the Trump administration would declare one week or another \"Infrastructure Week\" because real movement on infrastructure issues never came to pass. Voting rights The 2020 presidential election prompted a Count Every Vote Rally in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and across the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for MoveOn\n                    \n                \nhide caption The 2020 presidential election prompted a Count Every Vote Rally in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and across the country. A major Democratic priority is new voting rights legislation. Voting rights bills were passed overwhelmingly in 1965, 1993 and 2002, but since a Supreme Court ruling vacated key parts of the Voting Rights Act, Republicans have mostly abandoned wanting to be part of any new legislation. Earlier this month, the House passed a large bill narrowly, 220-210. It is designed to protect marginalized groups' ability and access to vote, and it limits gerrymandering. But it is already coming under fire from Republicans in the Senate. Ted Cruz of Texas called it a \"universal fraud law\" and continued to spread conspiracies about the 2020 election and false allegations of widespread fraud. Mike Lee of Utah went so far as to say, \"This is a bill as if written in hell by the devil himself.\" So it doesn't appear Republicans are open to this piece of legislation. Minimum wage A minimum wage increase, which is a progressive priority, was stripped out of the COVID-19 relief bill because the Senate parliamentarian ruled it could not be included in a budget reconciliation bill. Democrats want it gradually raised to $15 an hour, something Biden (as well as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) campaigned on. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas have proposed legislation that would gradually raise the wage to $10 an hour over the next four years and, importantly, index it to inflation. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would require businesses with $1 billion in annual revenue to pay employees $15 an hour. But it's unclear what, if any of these, McConnell would support \u2014 or whether Democrats are open to lowering their thresholds. Immigration A mother holds her daughter while awaiting COVID-19 test results last month after being released by U.S. immigration authorities in Brownsville, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A mother holds her daughter while awaiting COVID-19 test results last month after being released by U.S. immigration authorities in Brownsville, Texas. Immigration is another thorny area. Despite bipartisan recognition of the continued problem of more than 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally and an increase in unaccompanied minors coming to the Southern U.S. border in the last two months, there appears to be little desire, particularly among Republicans, to find a middle ground. Biden has already introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill, but Democrats acknowledge it doesn't have the support even within the party to move ahead. Instead, House Democrats have decided to move piecemeal immigration bills starting next week, which are not expected to get any traction in the Senate. It's an animating issue for the GOP base, and there is tremendous incentive for Republicans to stick to a hard line, especially after the Trump years. President Donald Trump used immigration to stir up the culture war and intense emotions. It was quite the switch from just after the 2012 election when Romney lost badly with Latinos, and the GOP was doing soul-searching on how to appeal to the largest-growing demographic group in the country. A lot of members of Congress, especially senators, are wary of committing to anything comprehensive, especially after the 2013 legislation, which garnered 68 votes in the Senate, fell apart in the House. Fourteen GOP senators crossed the aisle back then, just four of them remain. McConnell was not one of them and spoke out against the legislation back then. And after Trump, immigration very well may be the third rail of American politics.",

Updated at 6:20 p.m. The United States will offer temporary protected status to people from Myanmar who fear returning home, the Biden administration said Friday, as it tries to ratchet up pressure on military coup leaders in the Southeast Asian country, and provide protection to some of those criticizing it. \"Due to the military coup and security forces' brutal violence against civilians, the people of Burma are suffering a complex and deteriorating humanitarian crisis in many parts of the country,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement, using another name for Myanmar. \"After a thorough review of this dire situation, I have designated Burma for Temporary Protected Status so that Burmese nationals and habitual residents may remain temporarily in the United States.\" Senior Biden administration officials told NPR ahead of the announcement that they estimate the new protection will likely cover about 1,600 people who are already in the U.S., allowing them to continue to live and work in the country legally for the next 18 months. The move comes in response to the Feb. 1 coup and the ensuing crackdown on protesters. A United Nations human rights investigator said, as of Thursday, security forces killed at least 70 people. \"Due to the military coup and security forces' brutal violence against civilians, the people of Burma are suffering a complex and deteriorating humanitarian crisis in many parts of the country,\" \"After a thorough review of this dire situation, I have designated Burma for Temporary Protected Status so that Burmese nationals and habitual residents may remain temporarily in the United States,\" \"The coup has worsened humanitarian conditions by limiting access to life-saving assistance. It's disrupting flights carrying humanitarian medical aid and spurring an economic crisis, so such conditions prevent Burmese nationals and residents from returning safely,\" one senior administration official said. \"We want to ensure that all Burmese nationals feel like they can safely speak up for democracy,\" another U.S. official said. They pointed out that the temporary protected status could apply to diplomats from Myanmar, who have publicly broken ranks with the coup leaders and stated their support for detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Only people from Myanmar who already reside in the U.S. are eligible for the temporary protection, the Department of Homeland Security said. But the department added that coronavirus pandemic-related border restrictions remain in place and citizens inside Myanmar \"should not believe smugglers or others claiming the border is now open.\" Myanmar's military rulers announced last month that they fired the country's U.N. Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, after he made an emotional plea to the U.N. General Assembly to \"to use any means necessary to take action against the Myanmar military and to provide safety and security for the people of Myanmar.\" Myanmar's U.N. envoy Kyaw Moe Tun made an emotional appeal at the United Nations for action to stop the military coup, including ending his speech with a three-fingered salute used by protesters https://t.co/n3VTj5KkIH pic.twitter.com/SuP2ZFq94R U.S. officials say they still consider him as Myanmar's permanent representative to the global body. The U.N. still recognizes him too, though spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric called it a \"unique situation,\" saying \"we are trying to sort through all the legal protocol and other implications.\" The Biden administration has not had any contacts with the deposed State Counsellor Suu Ky, whom the military junta this week accused of corruption on top of other more minor charges. The U.S. has been in contact with military leaders \"both through public messaging and targeted diplomatic outreach\" to urge them to \"release all those detained, avoid violence against the Burmese public, restore and maintain telecommunications services, and respect the outcome of the 2020 elections, which were credible and largely representative of the will of the people,\" said one senior administration official. It is also continuing to impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for the coup and for violence against protesters, as well as sanctioning two adult children of the military commander in chief and companies run by them. China has considerable influence in Myanmar but has tread carefully. Biden administration officials point out that China did agree on a U.N. Security Council presidential statement condemning the violence against peaceful protesters and calling for the release of Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.",

This year, Trump is out of office but is still headlining the event.\n                \n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-President Donald Trump waves at the crowd during the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference. This year, Trump is out of office but is still headlining the event. When the annual Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 CPAC for short \u2014 kicks off Thursday in Orlando, Fla., it might as well be called TPAC. That's because this year, it is all about Trump. The former president will headline the event with a Sunday afternoon keynote address, his first speech since leaving office last month. It comes as the Republican Party is struggling with its identity after Donald Trump's presidency. And yet CPAC, the largest gathering of conservative activists in the U.S., will still very much be a pro-Trump event. The conference, organized and sponsored by the American Conservative Union, will even keep alive Trump's false claims of election fraud with several panels on the topic with names like \"Other Culprits: Why Judges & Media Refused to Look at the Evidence,\" \"The Left Pulled the Strings, Covered It Up, and Even Admits It\" and \"Failed States (PA, GA, NV, oh my!).\" \"We're going to spend a lot of time looking at what happened in these states,\" Matt Schlapp, chairman of the ACU, said on CNN this week. Schlapp claimed to have \"proof\" of \"widespread voter fraud in the last election,\" yet presented none on air. He went on to say that \"Joe Biden is my president\" and that \"he won the election,\" but then pivoted, raising suspicion: \"That doesn't mean that there wasn't voter fraud and voter irregularity in the last election.\" Schlapp \u2014 a lobbyist and husband of Mercedes Schlapp, who worked in the Trump White House \u2014 is walking the same line other Republicans have been, between the truth and conspiracies that are popular with Trump and his base. CPAC didn't used to be so MAGA. In fact, Trump snubbed the conference in 2016 after a dispute over speech ground rules and wanting him to answer questions at the event. Very disappointed @realDonaldTrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of #CPAC -- his choice sends a clear message to conservatives. Five years later, though, the political world \u2014 as well as the grassroots conservative movement \u2014 has changed substantially. And, now, at this annual cattle call, there's no penning Trump in. Trump put the 2024 field on ice \u2014 and he likes it that way In his speech, Trump is expected to draw distinctions with President Biden, particularly when it comes to immigration, which was an animating issue for the GOP base during Trump's political tenure. He is also expected to speak about the future of the Republican Party, and he very much wants to be seen as not just a player but the player \u2014 the \"presumptive 2024 nominee,\" in fact, as Axios reports. Trump's dangling of running again has effectively frozen the GOP field. CPAC has, for decades, been a place where presidential hopefuls have tested out their messages and possible depth of support. A handful of would-be presidential hopefuls will be on hand this year, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, as well as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. They are in an awkward holding pattern, but while ambitious potential candidates might want Trump out of the way, they want his voters even more. That's why people like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, tried to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, to make sure they're still on good terms. But after Haley was critical of the former president in a recent profile, Trump reportedly turned down the meeting. As of Wednesday evening, Haley is not on the CPAC speakers list. Former Vice President Mike Pence, seen here after arriving back in his hometown of Columbus, Ind., on Jan. 20, has declined an invitation to speak at CPAC.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Conroy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Mike Pence, who also very much has presidential ambitions, was targeted by the mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. \"Hang Mike Pence!\" some chanted, as he presided over a usually ceremonial counting of the electoral votes. Pence had to be escorted out of the Capitol for his safety, but even as the riot was unfolding, Trump lashed out at Pence on Twitter (where Trump is now banned). He said Pence \"didn't have the courage to do what should have been done\" to overturn the election results \u2014 something Pence had no real power to do. Still, despite reported tension between the two following Jan. 6, Pence told former congressional colleagues this week that he and Trump maintain a good relationship. He told them he's forming a political organization that will defend the work of their administration. But Pence declined an invitation to speak at CPAC. Trump's lofty status and an event that has changed \u2014 a lot CPAC has taken on many different forms over the years. To show just how much it has changed recently, consider that in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was the crowd favorite, winning the conference's straw poll each of those four years. But the now-Utah senator \u2014 who has been a vocal Trump critic and voted for Trump's conviction on impeachment charges twice \u2014 is persona non grata at this Trumpy variation of CPAC. There was also a strong libertarian strain, particularly among young attendees. Either former Texas Rep. Ron Paul or his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, were the picks of the CPAC crowd in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015. But that is all but gone. Rand Paul declined an invitation to this year's conference, as he has in recent years. That Trump retains in this lofty perch within the Republican Party is somewhat remarkable. When he came into office, the party controlled all the levers of power in Washington \u2014 the House, the Senate and, with his election, the White House. Now, it controls none. Part of how Trump has retained his hold on the rank and file is by convincing tens of millions of them that the election was stolen from him. Trump went on a months-long disinformation campaign discrediting Biden's victory. His inaccurate fraud claims and conspiracy theories were disproved by dozens of courts, but the depth of support for his false grievance was made plain by the thousands of his flag-waving supporters who participated in the Jan. 6 violence. There was no peaceful transfer of power, and Trump has yet to acknowledge that he lost fair and square. For months, Trump was also enabled by elected Republican leaders who knew better and later acknowledged that Biden won legitimately. That includes Republican leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. They seemed to be hoping that if they gave Trump room to protest the election results through the courts, then he would come around once there were rulings. That never happened. Instead, Trump dug in, abetted by conservative media, which amplified and gave traction to his false claims. After Jan. 6, McConnell publicly rebuked Trump, blaming him for the riot. That landed McConnell in a very public feud with the most popular person in his party. McCarthy \u2014 who has done head-snapping reversals over the years when it comes to Trump \u2014 first went McConnell's path, saying Trump \"bears responsibility\" for the Capitol violence. But he quickly reversed course, making up with Trump in a fence-mending trip to Mar-a-Lago. Q: Do you believe former President Trump should speaking at CPAC?@GOPLeader: \"Yes he should.\"@RepLizCheney: \"That's up to CPAC....I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.\" McCarthy: \"On that high note, thank you very much.\" pic.twitter.com/ZOkTUbpQCP On Wednesday, McCarthy was asked if he believes Trump should be speaking at CPAC. \"Yes, he should,\" McCarthy said during a news conference on Capitol Hill. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2014 who is in House GOP leadership but voted for Trump's impeachment \u2014 was then asked for her view. \"That's up to CPAC,\" Cheney said. \"I've been clear in my views about President Trump and the extent to which, following Jan. 6, I don't think he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.\" \"On that high note, thank you all very much,\" McCarthy said to laughs, as he walked off. McCarthy participates in a panel Saturday afternoon at CPAC on \"Winning Back America.\" Neither McConnell nor Cheney will be appearing. CPAC has also shown a willingness to exclude not just those who don't line up with Trump but also some with odious and controversial views. It's ironic, considering this year's CPAC theme is \"America Uncanceled,\" but after a left-leaning watchdog group found that one listed speaker had made anti-Semitic comments, he was disinvited. We have just learned that someone we invited to CPAC has expressed reprehensible views that have no home with our conference or our organization.  The individual will not be participating at our conference. The speaker was offended and accused CPAC of the same thing conservatives often say of Big Tech companies and universities. \"I feel like I'm being silenced,\" he said. \"I feel like my rights are being violated. Basically I'm being censored.\" Conservatives have complained that social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, are biased because they have banned or removed content. Posts have been removed because the sites determined they were false or misleading or promoted conspiracies that could lead to violence \u2014 the kind of conspiracies that went mainstream during Trump's presidency and led to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.",

The House could pass a version of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief legislation this week.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden speaks Friday at a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing site in Portage, Mich. The House could pass a version of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief legislation this week. Joe Biden has now been president for one month. So far, he has signed a record number of executive orders, brought the United States back into the Paris climate accord, introduced a comprehensive immigration bill and begun the groundwork for his major COVID-19 relief legislation. He has also taken his lumps when it comes to messaging about reopening schools. The Trump impeachment trial took up much of the political oxygen in Washington, D.C., but with that in the rearview mirror, this week may mark a real turning point to the Biden agenda \u2014 although Donald Trump will reemerge with his first post-presidency speech Sunday. Biden's Cabinet is also still being filled out, while outside Washington, the big thaw in Texas begins after a dangerous \u2014 and revealing \u2014 several days of a rare deep freeze. Here are six things we're watching this week: 1. COVID-19 relief bill movement The country is surpassing 500,000 deaths from COVID-19. \"It's stunning,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, a Biden medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. He called it \"horrible,\" \"devastating\" and \"historic.\" \"People will be talking about this decades and decades and decades from now,\" he noted somberly. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan, which would send another round of direct payments to qualifying Americans and disburse billions of dollars to state and local governments, could see a vote in the House by the end of the week. Also remember: The bill still has to go through hurdles in the Senate to see if its provisions qualify under budget reconciliation, since Republicans are not on board and think it's too costly. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vows that the bill is \"on track\" to be on Biden's desk by March 14, the date that enhanced unemployment insurance benefits expire. \"We will meet this deadline,\" he said in a letter to colleagues Friday. 2. Schools \u2014 to reopen or not to reopen isn't really the question Americans have sharply different views about reopening schools. About two-thirds of U.S. students are already offered some in-person options, but the Biden administration has struggled to lay out clearly and consistently when and how all schools should open. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines say schools can reopen without all teachers being vaccinated. Biden's White House has said teachers should be a priority for vaccines, as it tries to walk a tightrope between science and teachers unions, a key Democratic constituency. But this is a bit of a false debate. The heads of the largest teachers unions say they are on board with the CDC's guidelines. And while vaccinations are important to teachers, they actually rate access to personal protective equipment, limited class sizes and regular cleanings as more necessary. But those things cost money. And the same Republicans criticizing Biden for not advocating more strongly for reopening schools full time are not on board with his COVID-19 relief plan \u2014 which allocates $130 billion for schools \u2014 because, they say, it's too expensive and because there's money left over from past relief measures. 3. Texas thaws out as political spotlight heats up Thousands line up Sunday to receive food and water at a mass distribution site at NRG Stadium for Houston residents who are still without running water and electricity following last week's winter storm.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands line up Sunday to receive food and water at a mass distribution site at NRG Stadium for Houston residents who are still without running water and electricity following last week's winter storm. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic and school reopenings, the biggest story outside Washington has been the Texas deep freeze. Texans will finally have more seasonable weather this week, but the fallout is far from over, in both the short and the long term. People are still waiting in long lines for water; pipes are busted and need repair; and the loss of electricity and heat for millions led to the deaths of more than two dozen in the state. There are heartbreaking stories, including those of an 11-year-old boy who died of hypothermia in a mobile home, a 75-year-old man who died grabbing oxygen from his truck and another who is said to have frozen to death in his recliner next to his wife. Texas energy companies' almost-century-old decision not to be part of the U.S. power grid, to avoid federal regulation, is now coming under scrutiny, as are Republican state officials' more recent decision not to regulate and mandate winterization of energy facilities. Congressional Democrats say it may be time to connect Texas to the national grid, but Republicans think that's the wrong move. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the lack of preparation \"outrageous,\" but some are pointing the finger at Abbott and his predecessor, Rick Perry, for allegedly putting profit ahead of preparedness. Abbott also walked back initial comments that renewable energy sources were to blame \u2014 when natural gas was the main problem. Abbott stands for reelection in 2022, and while he's still the odds-on favorite to win, how he handles this crisis will likely shape his fate. And Sen. Ted Cruz, back from Mexico, is lucky he's not up for reelection until 2024. #TexasStrong pic.twitter.com/gK4DHtsvLU Cruz got absolutely roasted by late-night comedians for his overnight jaunt. Stepping back, though, it is remarkable that the governors of the nation's four most populous states \u2014 run by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 have struggled with handling natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year. 4. Merrick Garland finally gets a hearing Almost five years after former President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, Garland will get a confirmation hearing Monday and Tuesday to be Biden's attorney general. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, back in 2016, refused to even hold a hearing for Garland, a judge with the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C., when he was Obama's pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. McConnell said he blocked Garland's nomination because Scalia's death happened during a presidential election year. Four years later, though, McConnell did an about-face and pushed through Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death \u2014 in a shorter timetable and in another election year. 5. What about the rest of the Cabinet? Filling out Biden's Cabinet has been a slow-go. Just seven of his Cabinet-level posts requiring Senate confirmation have been put in place. Xavier Becerra, Biden's pick for health secretary, testifies Tuesday, but his nomination has become controversial. Republicans don't like that as California attorney general he filed more than 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration. He also does not have a medical background, and Republicans see him as too liberal. Interior secretary nominee Deb Haaland's confirmation hearing is also Tuesday. She would be the first Native American to lead the department but is expected to face tough questioning from Republicans. That's because she's opposed to new oil and gas drilling leases on federal land, something that lines up with Biden's views. We're also watching to see what happens with Neera Tanden, Biden's pick to be budget director. Conservative Democrat Joe Manchin said he would oppose her nomination because of \"overtly partisan\" statements and tweets she has made. And while the Biden administration says it is sticking with her, hoping that at least one Republican will vote for her, there are reportedly behind-the-scenes preparations to replace her. Democrats hope to fill out more of Biden's Cabinet in short order. Schumer said he expects Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be confirmed as ambassador to the U.N. this week, for example. And several other nominees have now been reported out of their respective committees and are ready for a full Senate vote, the majority leader added. 6. Trump returns Just when you thought he was out, Trump jumps right back in. The former president will make his first major speech since leaving the White House at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday. These events are usually an opportunity to see who a party's emerging stars are going to be \u2014 and to whom the party will turn to lead it in the next presidential election cycle. But all eyes will be on Trump. He has dangled the possibility that he will run again, which very much puts a freeze on the rest of the potential Republican field. Will Trump look to settle scores with Republican establishment figures and those who voted for his impeachment, or will his speech be about how to beat Democrats and draw distinctions with Biden? Look in particular to immigration as a potential area of emphasis. It has always been an animating issue for Trump and his base, and Biden's new legislative plan offers Trump some fresh fodder.",

In the last 28 months, the Republican Party has lost the White House and lost control of both chambers of Congress. With the shock of those setbacks still sinking in, the party has been rocked and riven by former President Donald Trump's refusal to concede, a pro-Trump riot in the U.S. Capitol and an impeachment effort that even some Republicans backed. As happens at such moments, some editorialists and on-air voices are saying the Grand Old Party is over. But premature obituaries of this kind are neither new nor convincing. The latest batch of them might just set the stage for the next remarkable Republican comeback. Where will the party turn in its hour of crisis? If the past is any guide, it will turn in two directions: to the right, and to the South. These have been the wellsprings of strength and support that have brought the party back from the brink in recent decades. That was the strategy that led to Richard Nixon's elections as president in 1968 and 1972, and it was still working for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Solidifying the South and energizing conservatives were also crucial factors in the Republican tsunami of 1994, when the GOP surged to majorities in Congress and in statehouses. That hamstrung the remainder of Bill Clinton's presidency and presaged the election of Republican George W. Bush in 2000. It was a lesson not lost on Trump. While not even a Republican until late in life, he started his primary campaign billboarding the party's most conservative positions on taxes, trade, immigration and abortion. And the first of his rallies to draw a crowd in the tens of thousands was in a football stadium in Mobile, Ala., two months after he declared his candidacy in the summer of 2015. Whether the next standard-bearer for the GOP is Trump himself or someone else, there is little doubt the playbook will be the same. Low points, then turnarounds Before the present moment, Republican electoral fortunes had hit three particularly low points in the previous 70 years. The first came after the Lyndon Johnson landslide election in 1964, the second after the Watergate scandals a decade later and the third after the election of Clinton with a big Democratic majority in the Senate in 1992. Perhaps the most discouraging of these for the GOP was Johnson's tidal wave, which carried in the biggest majorities Democrats in Congress had enjoyed since the heyday of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. Johnson, a Texas Democrat, had assumed the presidency a year earlier when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Despite his own Southern roots, he pushed through the landmark Civil Rights Act outlawing segregation in public facilities. But as he signed it, he was reported to have said he feared his party had \"lost the South for a generation.\" The first sign that he was right came that fall. Even as Johnson got 60% of the nationwide popular vote and carried 44 states, he lost five in the \"Deep South\" (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina). This bloc voted for Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater, an Arizonan who had opposed the Civil Rights Act as an affront to state's rights. When this fistful of five states defected, it was a stunner. They had resisted Republicans even when the Democrats nominated Northern liberals like Illinois' Adlai Stevenson (1952 and 1956) and Kennedy (1960), who was not only a New Englander but a Catholic. Before that they had stuck with the Democrats even in the party's worst drubbings of the century, although some had left the fold for third-party attractions such as segregationist Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who left the Democrats for a time to form the States Rights Party in 1948. This shift in Southern sensibilities in the 1960s was linked to the national Democrats' embrace of the civil rights movement, the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts and then to the creation of Medicare and other \"Great Society\" programs in 1965. To be sure, there were other factors buoying what had been the \"party of Lincoln\" in Dixie, including the arrival of affluent Northern retirees and of industries lured by the lower cost of (non-unionized) labor. But the salient issue was race. As Republican strategist Kevin Phillips expressed it to New York Times reporter James Boyd in 1970: \"The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are.\" \"The Southern Strategy\" Working for Republican candidate Nixon in 1968, Phillips popularized the label of \"Southern Strategy\" for the overall approach his candidate took to the electorate that year. But Nixon tapped into Republican local organizations already growing in the South, largely by emphasizing states' rights and the \"law and order\" theme. The latter gained popular traction nationwide as riots ravaged many major cities in 1967 and 1968 (especially after the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that year). That strategy proved crucial for Nixon. He carried South Carolina (where Thurmond, still a senator, was now a Republican and a Nixon man), plus Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. It turned out to be enough, even though five other Southern states' electoral votes went to George Wallace, the segregationist former governor of Alabama who ran that year as the nominee of the American Independent Party. Nixon worried about another Wallace bid costing him Southern states again in 1972, and he worked hard to maneuver Wallace in another direction. In the end, Wallace sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1972 (a campaign cut short when he was paralyzed by an assassination attempt). Nixon swept the South that year en route to winning 49 states overall. The wilderness after Watergate After such a resounding reelection, it seemed unimaginable that Nixon or his party could be in political trouble so soon after his second inauguration. But a 1972 burglary at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (in the Watergate hotel), was traced to Nixon's campaign. His efforts to cover up that connection were then exposed, leading to impeachment proceedings. When audio tapes of his conspiratorial meetings with aides were made public, he resigned and was pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford. Republicans once again found themselves in the wilderness. Midterm elections arrived right after the resignation and pardon. Republicans nationwide paid the price, with the party losing seats in Congress it had held for generations. Two years later, Democrat Jimmy Carter was elected president, largely because as a former governor of Georgia he could call his home region back to its Democratic roots. Indeed, in 1976 he carried every Southern state but Virginia. But even in that year, the Southern tilt of the new GOP was apparent in the primaries. Ford, seeking a term of his own, was cruising through the early party events up until North Carolina in late March. There he was ambushed by the conservative, onetime Goldwater spokesman who was challenging him for the party's nomination, Reagan. Reagan also won primaries in Texas, Georgia and Arkansas and virtually tied Ford in Tennessee and Kentucky. Combined with his wins in the West, these late breakthroughs almost brought him the nomination. Another Southern-bred comeback Four years later, with Carter vulnerable, Reagan and the South were both front and center. Reagan backers had created a new early primary in South Carolina, which he won easily. That sent a signal across the region, and the following week Reagan won Florida, Georgia and Alabama. He went on to win every Southern primary, including the knockout in Texas over that state's favorite son George H.W. Bush, whom he later made his running mate. How had a son of the Midwest by way of California (and Hollywood) come to be such a champion of the South? One answer was suggested by the eager support of Thurmond, still a powerbroker in his eighth decade. Another answer was manifest in the campaign's first big rally after Reagan was nominated in the summer of 1980. That kickoff for the fall campaign was held in Neshoba County, Miss., near the site of a notorious 1964 murder of three civil rights workers. Reagan's campaign chose that location for him to proclaim his belief in states' rights, his opposition to the \"welfare state\" and his devotion to \"law and order.\" In that November, Reagan beat Carter everywhere in the old Confederacy but in the incumbent president's own home state. In 1984, storming to reelection, Reagan swept the region with landslide margins. The Southern Strategy kept rolling in 1988, when the GOP nominated Bush, Reagan's loyal vice president, who had forsaken his New England roots to go all-in as a transplanted Texan. He was Southern enough, and conservative enough, to win every state the Census Bureau defines as Southern with the lone exception of West Virginia. Clinton-Gore could compete Bush's term in office featured a short and highly successful war in the Persian Gulf and a budget deal with Democrats that would eventually reduce the federal deficit and slow the growth of the national debt. But a brief recession cost him in the polls, and a rebellion broke out on the party's right. Bush got a primary challenge from Pat Buchanan, a media personality who served as an adviser to Reagan and Nixon. Buchanan assailed the budget deal because it raised taxes. He conjured the spirits of Reagan and Goldwater and questioned Bush's conservative bona fides. So did Ross Perot, an eccentric billionaire Texan who was running as a self-financing independent. On top of that, Bush was confronted with the Democrats' choice of an all-Southern ticket in Clinton of Arkansas and Al Gore of Tennessee. The young Democrats who could talk Southern carried their home states plus Louisiana and Georgia and all the Civil War \"border states\" (Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland). The region was back in play. Clinton and Gore threw a chill into Republicans. What if Clinton served two terms and gave way to a still-vital, still-Southern Gore who could serve two more? That would be a roadblock in the White House equivalent to Roosevelt's four wins. If that seems far-fetched now, consider that Clinton did win the popular vote twice and Gore won it in 2000 (losing by the barest of margins in the Electoral College). They initiated the current stretch in which Democrats have won the popular vote seven times in the last eight presidential elections. Democrats in 1992 were also able to hold on to seven of the nine Senate seats they had won in Southern and border states in 1986. That kept their overall Democratic majority at 57-43, providing the muscle to take on the health care reform issue in 1993. For a time, the momentum behind that issue seemed so strong that more than a few Republicans were looking for ways to be part of it. They did not want to be left out of what appeared then to be the national direction. It was not the last time Republicans contemplated a move toward the center in the wake of a daunting defeat. GOP goes South again But as it turned out, the road to redemption would be quite different. Republicans decided to close ranks and oppose the Clinton health proposals, and they succeeded in blocking them. In the midterm campaign of 1994, Republicans in the House united behind their party's No. 2 leader, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, and his \"Contract with America\" \u2014 a list of popular, often populist ideas such as a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget. Democrats in the House were also dealing with new maps dividing the electoral districts within each state. The creation of more minority-friendly districts in the metropolitan areas had siphoned off likely Democratic voters from adjacent suburban and exurban districts. That weakened Democratic incumbents in the latter districts, especially in the South, where the remapping was most dramatic. All these factors combined to produce a windfall for Republicans all over the country in the midterms of 1994, but it was a watershed election in the South. For more than a century after Reconstruction, Democrats had held a majority of the governorships and of the Senate and House seats in the South. Even as the region became accustomed to voting Republican for president, this pattern had held at the statewide and congressional levels. But in November 1994, in a single day, the majority of Southern governorships, Senate seats and House seats shifted to the Republicans. That majority has held ever since, with more legislative seats and local offices shifting to the GOP as well. The South is now the home base of the Republican Party. The 2020 aftermath No wonder that in contesting the results in six swing states he lost, Trump seems to have worked hardest on Georgia. If he had won there, he still would have lost the Electoral College decisively. But as the third most populous Southern state, and the only Southern state to change its choice from 2016, it clearly held special significance. It's worth noting that, even without Georgia, Trump won 13 states where slavery had once been legal (including Oklahoma, which was still a territory during the Civil War, and West Virginia, which was then a part of Virginia) and these states provided nearly 70% of his Electoral College votes. The move to the right, and the focus on the South, have been the route to renewed success for Republicans again and again. It was there Trump began his big rally strategy nearly six years ago. It was there he would emerge as the clear front-runner for the nomination in 2016 by winning South Carolina's primary, dominating among the staunchest conservatives in that legendary bastion of Southern independence. So it seemed more than appropriate that South Carolina's Lindsey Graham would be the first Republican senator summoned to confer with Trump about the party's plans after the impeachment trial ended. And appropriate that the meeting took place at Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, where Trump has relocated his legal residence and political operation. If Trump is to rise again, it will once again be as a born-again conservative and an adopted son of the South. And if the next Republican is not Trump, nearly all the top contenders to succeed him are from states with at least one college football team in the Southeastern Conference.",

From a failed bid for a citizenship question to a presidential memo about unauthorized immigrants that was fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, its moves over the past four years followed a playbook first drawn up more than four decades ago by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. In 1979, the hard-line group that became the most influential advocate for extreme restrictions on immigration launched a campaign that has held onto one consistent goal \u2014 obtaining an official count of unauthorized immigrants through the census to radically reshape Congress, the Electoral College and public policy. Starting with a lawsuit filed weeks before the official start of the 1980 census, FAIR documented its strategy in a paper trail that NPR has reviewed in the organization's archives at the George Washington University, as well as those of FAIR's founder at the University of Michigan. \"It's always been on the agenda,\" Dan Stein, FAIR's president, tells NPR, noting that it's \"very possible\" that, as early as November 2016, the group discussed with Trump officials the possibility of excluding unauthorized immigrants from a key set of 2020 census results. To some, it may seem curious that part of Trump's agenda zeroed in on an often overlooked government tally of every person living in the U.S. But census numbers hold what Trump has always wanted \u2014 power. That power comes in the form of 435 votes in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College. Once a decade, those votes are up for grabs among the states based on new census numbers. The more residents included in a state's population count, the more of a say it has for the next 10 years in how federal laws are made and how the next occupant of the White House is chosen. The Constitution has spelled out specific instructions for the census. Not just citizens or voters, but \"persons\" who reside in the states are supposed to be counted. Congress eventually codified the 14th Amendment's language into federal law that calls for the \"whole number of persons\" living in each state and the \"tabulation of total population\" to be used when reapportioning House seats and electoral votes. Census counting does have a thorny history. Before the Civil War, the fifth sentence of the country's founding document required an enslaved person to be counted as \"three fifths\" of a free person. And it was just before the 1940 census that the Census Bureau determined the phrase \"excluding Indians not taxed\" could no longer omit some American Indians from the apportionment counts. But since the first U.S. head count in 1790, this has been an unwavering truth: No resident has ever been left out because of immigration status. Trump officials attempted to break with that 230-year precedent. The administration, like FAIR, wanted to subtract unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment counts, taking power away from those residents and the communities where they live. One of President Biden's first executive orders officially quashed the Trump memo that called for that extraordinary change. But during the Trump years, FAIR came closer to getting that count of unauthorized immigrants than it has ever before. A page out of an old playbook The start of the Trump administration's four-year census saga centered around a hotly contested question: Is this person a citizen of the United States? Trump officials wanted to use the census to directly ask for the citizenship status of every person living in every household in the country for the first time in U.S. history. That proposal has long been considered anathema to best practices for a complete and accurate head count, and the administration was not up front about exactly why it wanted to add the question to the 2020 census. Many opponents of that citizenship question argued it was originally intended to depress census participation. Under federal law, no government agency or court can use personal information collected by the Census Bureau against anyone. But a long history of distrust of the census has made many noncitizens, Latinos, Asian Americans, and other historically undercounted groups wary of telling the government their household's citizenship status. Some of the question's critics also pointed to a scheme concocted by a GOP redistricting mastermind, Thomas Hofeller, to use the neighborhood block-level citizenship data the question would generate to politically benefit Republicans and \"Non-Hispanic Whites\" in state and local elections for years to come. Demonstrators against the Trump administration's push for a census citizenship question rally outside the Supreme Court in 2019 as the justices hear arguments over Trump's plan.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators against the Trump administration's push for a census citizenship question rally outside the Supreme Court in 2019 as the justices hear arguments over Trump's plan. To Roger Conner, who led FAIR until 1988 as the group's first executive director, it was clear that the Trump administration had another goal in mind \u2014 to change how congressional seats and electoral votes are reapportioned in order to curtail the political representation of areas where unauthorized immigrants live. \"I was saying to myself, 'This is perfectly obvious. Why can't someone figure out what's going on?' \" Conner says, recalling the Trump administration's push for a citizenship question. \"I assume that's because they thought it was not in their interest to let everybody know what their strategy was.\" That strategy (which the administration never directly connected to apportionment until Trump's memo was released years later) began percolating through Trump's world even before he took office. During the 2016 campaign, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 an immigration hard-liner who has worked as a counsel to FAIR's legal arm and was described by FAIR's president as an \"invaluable asset\" to Trump's immigration team \u2014 discussed a census citizenship question with campaign officials. Shortly after the inauguration in 2017, Kobach talked about the question with Trump, then-chief strategist Steve Bannon and then-chief of staff Reince Priebus, according to Kobach's testimony to congressional investigators. Kobach later urged Wilbur Ross, the Trump-appointed commerce secretary overseeing the bureau, to add a specially-worded citizenship question to the census. It should also ask about immigration status, Kobach suggested in an email, so that the responses could address \"the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional apportionment purposes.\" Other internal emails released for the lawsuits over the question show that the reapportionment of congressional seats was top of mind for Ross shortly after taking over the Commerce Department. In a March 2017 message from fellow Trump appointee Earl Comstock with the subject line \"Your Question on the Census,\" Ross received a link to a Census Bureau webpage that answered: \"Are undocumented residents (aliens) in the 50 states included in the apportionment population counts?\" \"Yes,\" the bureau's official response said. But when Ross officially announced a citizenship question in 2018 as a late addition to the 2020 census form, it didn't come with Kobach's apportionment reasoning or checkboxes about immigration status. Instead, Ross used the Voting Rights Act to publicly justify the question, claiming the responses would help the Justice Department better enforce the civil rights era-law and protect \"minority population voting rights.\" More than a year later, the Supreme Court rejected that justification for appearing to be \"contrived\" and blocked the question from appearing on the 2020 census. By that point, career civil servants at the Census Bureau had repeatedly warned Trump officials that adding the question would not only likely lower response rates in some areas, but also produce citizenship data less accurate and more expensive than what could be generated from government records. After threatening to delay the census in the wake of his Supreme Court loss, Trump issued an executive order in July 2019 that directed other federal agencies to share their citizenship records with the Census Bureau, which was already under orders from Ross to use records to produce anonymized, block-level data about the U.S. citizenship status of every adult living in the U.S. that states could use for redistricting. Buried within Trump's order about citizenship data was a new policy of developing \"complete and accurate\" data on \"illegal aliens in the country\" that did not attract much attention at the time. Existing estimates by the Department of Homeland Security and academic researchers, the order said, are not reliable enough to \"evaluate\" policy proposals about enforcing immigration laws and changing eligibility rules for public benefits. \"Data tabulating both the overall population and the citizen population could be combined with records of aliens lawfully present in the country to generate an estimate of the aggregate number of aliens unlawfully present in each State,\" said Trump's order, which Biden reversed last month. At the White House Rose Garden announcement for Trump's directive, the then-head of the Justice Department, William Barr, made no direct mention of how the DOJ could use the data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Instead, Barr made sure to highlight how the data \"may be relevant\" to a lawsuit filed in 2018 by the state of Alabama \"over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes.\" At the 2019 White House Rose Garden announcement of an executive order for citizenship data, then-President Donald Trump was joined by then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (left) and then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr (right), who said the data \"may be relevant\" to a lawsuit \"over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At the 2019 White House Rose Garden announcement of an executive order for citizenship data, then-President Donald Trump was joined by then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (left) and then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr (right), who said the data \"may be relevant\" to a lawsuit \"over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes.\" FAIR's underground beginnings These signals from the Trump administration echoed arguments FAIR first made more than 40 years ago. Toward the end of the 1970s, FAIR was a fledgling advocacy group desperate to emerge from a windowless basement office in Washington, D.C., as a national voice. The U.S. was more than a decade into major demographic shifts: A greater and greater share of people living inside the U.S. were born elsewhere, and a predominantly white population was becoming less so. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 had ended an earlier quota system that favored people from Northern and Western Europe, while also imposing the first caps on the number of people allowed to enter from Mexico and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The landmark law, along with the end of a legal program for temporary farmworkers from Mexico, helped usher in a rise in immigration, both legal and illegal, from Latin America, Asia and other parts of the world. That led John Tanton \u2014 an eye doctor from a mostly white resort town along Lake Michigan who held a particular interest in population control as a form of environmentalism \u2014 to start FAIR. The group's calls for an end to illegal immigration and fewer legal pathways for newcomers were not met with fanfare. \"We were obviously very small fish in a very big pond, and so got little attention,\" Tanton later recalled in an oral history interview that touched on FAIR's early days working underground with less than a handful of staffers. To try to make a splash, FAIR went to court in December 1979. Its federal lawsuit against former President Jimmy Carter's administration called for a citizenship question to be included on both the long and short versions of the 1980 census form. The responses, FAIR argued, would generate a count of noncitizens that could eventually produce a state-by-state tally of unauthorized immigrants by matching noncitizens with green cards to government records. Concerned about persistent undercounts, some census advocates at the time focused their energy on encouraging unauthorized immigrants to participate in the count. Conner, FAIR's first executive director, recalls reading a 1979 newspaper article about that effort and says FAIR sued partly out of concern that including unauthorized immigrants in the apportionment counts would increase the political power of \"institutions that would favor the perpetuation, the expansion of immigration.\" Roger Conner, shown here in 1981, led the Federation for American Immigration Reform as its first executive director until 1988. Now a woodworker in Nashville, Tenn., Conner condemns Trump officials' efforts to alter census apportionment counts. \"I can only understand it as a pure expression of racism and evil,\" Conner says. \"And yet I have to own I took this same position 40 years ago.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Jack Owens/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roger Conner, shown here in 1981, led the Federation for American Immigration Reform as its first executive director until 1988. Now a woodworker in Nashville, Tenn., Conner condemns Trump officials' efforts to alter census apportionment counts. \"I can only understand it as a pure expression of racism and evil,\" Conner says. \"And yet I have to own I took this same position 40 years ago.\" Still, in a 1980 statement to the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, Conner wrote that while FAIR wants unauthorized immigrants excluded from apportionment, it also \"supports and encourages a full and accurate counting of illegal immigrants in the 1980 Census.\" \"This is a difficult and perhaps impossible undertaking,\" Conner added, \"but it should nevertheless be worthwhile to attempt to gather more accurate information than we now possess about the number and characteristics of illegal immigrants within the United States.\" Finding lawyers in Washington willing to make FAIR's arguments in court, though, was not easy. \"I had to explain to them why limiting immigration was the right thing, and FAIR wasn't a racist group,\" Conner explained in a 1989 oral history interview documented in the organization's archives. \"It was a lost cause.\" \"The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous\" FAIR's last-minute lawsuit eventually paid off in terms of media attention. It garnered a radio segment on NPR's Morning Edition and a front-page, below-the-fold story in The New York Times, among other news coverage. But the case was tossed out of a lower court, and the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal. FAIR and the other plaintiffs did not have a right to sue, the three-judge panel of the lower court in D.C. ruled. And their case, the panel noted, appeared \"very weak on the merits.\" \"The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous,\" the judges wrote in their opinion. \"It requires the counting of the 'whole number of persons' for apportionment purposes, and while illegal aliens were not a component of the population at the time the Constitution was adopted, they are clearly 'persons.' \" Going back to the 1920s, the judges pointed out, there have been multiple attempts to leave unauthorized immigrants and other noncitizens out of the apportionment counts. But with no change to the country's founding document, they have all failed. Their opinion quotes the remarks of Rep. Emanuel Celler, a Democrat from New York, during a 1940 House debate over whether unauthorized immigrants could be omitted: \"The Constitution says that all persons shall be counted. I cannot quarrel with the founding fathers. They said that all should be counted. We count the convicts who are just as dangerous and just as bad as the Communists or as the Nazis, as those aliens here illegally, and I would not come here and have the temerity to say that the convicts shall be excluded, if the founding fathers say they shall be included. The only way we can exclude them would be to pass a constitutional amendment.\" Sen. David Reed, a Republican from Pennsylvania, came to the same conclusion more than a decade earlier in the 1920s. After the 1920 census, reapportioning House seats was so heated, in fact, that for the first time in U.S. history the process didn't happen at all that decade. The Republican majority of a mostly rural Congress stalled on the constitutional mandate, refusing to use numbers that confirmed the U.S. had become a predominantly urban nation. Weeks before lawmakers passed the 1929 law that turned reapportionment into an automatic process after the 1930 count, Reed took part in a Senate debate over whether \"aliens,\" including unauthorized immigrants, could be excluded from the counts. Reed was a namesake and architect of the Johnson-Reed Act, also known as the Immigration Act of 1924 that was designed to suppress people from Eastern and Southern Europe, and completely stop people from Asia, from immigrating to the U.S. \"I disagree to the bottom of my heart,\" Reed emphasized on the Senate floor, with the Constitution's original framers and the 14th Amendment's drafters choosing to use the term \"persons\" in their apportionment instructions instead of \"citizens\" or \"voters who actually have cast their votes at the last general election.\" But Reed could not support a bill amendment for excluding unauthorized immigrants and other noncitizens because, the senator said, \"the oath which we take to support the Constitution includes the obligation to support it when we dislike its provisions as well as when we are in sympathy with them.\" \"It is literally now or never\" Despite losing in the courts, FAIR tried to muster support for more legal action after its 1979 lawsuit. Tanton, FAIR's founder, looked for donors to stand up a $50,000 a year litigation program. In a 1980 letter written to a potential funder before FAIR's appeal ended, Tanton said that if their census lawsuit failed, \"illegals will have Representatives beholden to them, effectively foreclosing any chance of stemming their influx. It is literally now or never: the decision rests on those of us who understand the problem.\" The census lawsuit was a tool for getting \"middle America\" to support FAIR's work, Tanton later explained in a 1981 letter to an attorney who helped start the group's litigation program, by showing them that immigration was a \"problem\" not just for states like Texas, California and Florida. In the same letter, Tanton floated the possibility of also pushing for the exclusion of green card holders, who are authorized to permanently stay in the U.S., and carrying out \"citizen-only reapportionment,\" which \"would further sweeten FAIR's prospects by shifting seats away from areas where politicians are compromised by an immigrant constituency.\" According to records in FAIR's archives, though, the group stayed focused on the exclusion of unauthorized immigrants. One of FAIR's attorneys tried to persuade the states of Indiana and Missouri, which each lost a vote in the House and Electoral College after the 1980 census, as well as Alabama and Georgia, to sue over the apportionment results, and Conner, FAIR's first executive director, worked on selling the idea to the organization's board of directors. \"This lawsuit, with a potential for altering the 1984 Presidential election, will garner an inordinate amount of publicity,\" Conner wrote in an internal memo that year, suggesting the attention would be \"extremely useful as a device to shift the news media focus\" toward \"the problems caused by illegal migration\" and away from criticism of a FAIR-backed proposal for sanctions against employers who hire unauthorized immigrants. Even so, it would take four more years before FAIR filed its second lawsuit over census apportionment counts. In 1988, it challenged the administration of former President Ronald Reagan over its plans for the 1990 census. This time, FAIR was joined by the states of Alabama, Kansas and Pennsylvania, as well as a more high-profile lead plaintiff \u2014 U.S. Rep. Tom Ridge, the Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who later became the state's governor and the country's first homeland security secretary. In an attempt to recruit lawmakers to their cause, FAIR targeted delegations from states that were projected to lose House seats if the apportionment counts were altered to leave out unauthorized immigrants. FAIR emphasized that if successful, the lawsuit would not hurt states' bottom lines. Unauthorized immigrants would still be counted in the census numbers used to guide the distribution of federal grants to states, just not in the counts for dividing up House seats and electoral votes. But the outcome in court turned out the same: The case was dismissed without a trial. Still, Tanton was not ready to give up. Months after that loss in 1989, Tanton wrote a letter to the head of FAIR's legal arm, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, about a news report on the likelihood of Michigan losing two House seats after the 1990 census. \"This stirs the pot,\" Tanton said, \"and again makes me wonder about refiling the census suit[,] say from Michigan, after the results are announced and before apportionment takes place when the actual shift of seats will be known. How complex would this be?\" They knew they were not going to get it right away. They knew eventually that the tide would change. Arnoldo Torres, a former executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, on FAIR's campaign to exclude unauthorized immigrants from census apportionment counts \"Trying to stop\" the \"browning of America\" The year before FAIR lost its second attempt to exclude unauthorized immigrants through the courts, Tanton came under public scrutiny. A 1988 article in The Arizona Republic revealed that he had denigrated Latinos and warned of a \"Latin onslaught\" in a memo written for an immigration conference. \"How will we make the transition from a dominant non-Hispanic society with a Spanish influence to a dominant Spanish society with non-Hispanic influence?\" asked Tanton, who, until he died in July 2019, was listed on FAIR's website as a member of its national board of advisers. \"As Whites see their power and control over their lives declining, will they simply go quietly into the night? Or will there be an explosion?\" \"What they were trying to stop was the browning of America,\" says Arnoldo Torres, who was a vocal critic of FAIR's policies as the executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens until 1985. Among FAIR's policy positions \u2014 which over the years have included opposing pathways to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants and ending the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship \u2014 altering the census apportionment counts was \"not the issue that they led off with,\" but was \"always an undercurrent,\" Torres recalls. \"This was not a passing fancy.\" \"They were in for the long haul. They knew they were not going to get it right away,\" Torres says. \"They knew eventually that the tide would change.\" In the meantime, FAIR developed plans to change the apportionment process and get a count of unauthorized immigrants through the two other branches of government, having so far failed in the courts. An internal report prepared for FAIR's board of directors in October 1987 called it a \"three-pronged approach.\" One strategy included lobbying Congress to require the Census Bureau to \"differentiate illegal aliens from citizens and legal residents on its questionnaire\" for the head count, Simin Yazdgerdi, FAIR's then-director of government relations, wrote in the report. During an August 1987 strategy session, FAIR determined its legislative strategy \"should be conducted quietly so that the courts would not be tempted to a) delay making a decision until Congress had acted; or b) use any negative legislative history (i.e., floor statements, testimony) against us,\" according to an internal memo by Yazdgerdi. \"Emphasize how Republicans will be hurt most by inclusion of illegal aliens,\" the memo specified about how to persuade the Reagan administration's Justice Department and Office of Management and Budget to \"influence\" the Census Bureau. While FAIR may have expected a more receptive audience among GOP members, support for omitting unauthorized immigrants from apportionment did not fall neatly along party lines in the 1980s. In fact, among the plaintiffs joining Rep. Ridge in FAIR's lawsuit before the 1990 census were House Democrats from Alabama, Connecticut, Kansas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Before the suit was filed, Ridge and Democratic Rep. Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut spearheaded a 1987 House bill that called for excluding unauthorized immigrants and including U.S. military and civilian Defense Department employees stationed abroad, who at the time were not expected to be counted for apportionment. In 1988, the Justice Department told lawmakers that it opposed the bill because excluding unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment counts, it concluded, is unconstitutional. \"If it were passed, we would recommend that the President veto it,\" wrote then-Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas Boyd, a Reagan appointee. The House bill stayed stuck in committee, but it had bipartisan support, including from Democratic cosponsors from Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. \"It's hard to explain to people. The Democrats were aligned with organized labor [and] didn't want immigrants,\" says Antonia Hern\u00e1ndez, who opposed FAIR on immigration policy as president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund for close to two decades beginning in 1985. MALDEF tried to intervene in FAIR's 1988 lawsuit to defend the inclusion of unauthorized immigrants in apportionment counts. As for the third prong of FAIR's strategy, the group mapped out the possibility of a \"favorable White House decision\" that would instruct the Census Bureau to collect information on people's immigration status, according to the group's 1987 board report. But that path did not open until Trump became president 30 years later. Dan Stein, FAIR's president, shown here in 2018, says subtracting unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment counts was \"certainly part of our legislative plan for the new administration back in November of 2016.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Thomas McKinless/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dan Stein, FAIR's president, shown here in 2018, says subtracting unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment counts was \"certainly part of our legislative plan for the new administration back in November of 2016.\" \"The efforts have been clumsy\" After the 1990 census, FAIR shifted its focus toward Congress given its lack of headway in the courts and with presidential administrations. \"You don't want to involve yourself in quixotic efforts that are doomed to fail,\" says Stein, the group's president who first joined FAIR in 1982. But FAIR's calculations changed after Trump won. After entering office, the Trump administration put in place many hard-line immigration proposals long championed by FAIR and the network of organizations that grew from it \u2014 including cutting the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S. down to historic lows. Former FAIR staffers, including Julie Kirchner, who became the ombudsman at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after running FAIR for nearly a decade as its executive director, also joined the administration's ranks. And they've been in such a hurry to do something, the efforts have been clumsy. Antonia Hern\u00e1ndez, a former president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, on the Trump administration's attempt to exclude unauthorized immigrants from apportionment counts Though Trump's White House press office did not respond to NPR's questions about whether the administration consulted with FAIR on its push to exclude unauthorized immigrants from apportionment counts, Stein says: \"It was certainly part of our legislative plan for the new administration back in November of 2016.\" Hern\u00e1ndez, MALDEF's former president, says that the lack of comprehensive immigration reform helped thrust the apportionment issue front and center during the Trump administration. \"It's just gained steam and gained steam,\" Hern\u00e1ndez says. In the decades since its basement beginnings, FAIR has expanded into a suite of offices near the U.S. Capitol, across the street from the office of the USCIS director. FAIR's staff, including its legal arm, now totals 36, according to spokesperson Matthew Tragesser. With the Trump administration in power, FAIR gained an invaluable advantage \u2014 a ready and willing partner inside the federal government during the final 2020 census planning stages. \"What they haven't been yet able to do through the courts, they've been able to do through the executive branch,\" Hern\u00e1ndez says. \"And they've been in such a hurry to do something, the efforts have been clumsy.\" The administration's inconsistency was on full display during the citizenship question lawsuits. Public statements about Voting Rights Act enforcement fronted behind-the-scenes discussions about altering census numbers for House seat reapportionment. A redacted August 2017 email appeared to foreshadow what became the administration's ultimate strategy \u2014 citing a 1992 Supreme Court ruling to argue that the president has the discretion to decide whether to include unauthorized immigrants in the apportionment counts. \"Ultimately, we do not make decisions on how the data should be used for apportionment, that is for Congress (or possibly the President) to decide,\" wrote then-Commerce Department attorney James Uthmeier. \"I think that's our hook here.\" Then, while testifying under oath about the citizenship question in 2018, Trump officials could not avoid bringing up apportionment. John Gore \u2014 a Justice Department appointee at the time who testified that adding the citizenship question to census forms was not necessary for enforcing the Voting Rights Act \u2014 confirmed that when Jeff Sessions was U.S. attorney general, there was discussion at the highest levels of the DOJ about reapportioning House seats using \"some other measure\" than the total number of residents in each state. Trump himself tied the push for a citizenship question to apportionment the same day the White House released the July 2020 presidential memo about excluding unauthorized immigrants. In a written statement, Trump said: \"Last summer in the Rose Garden, I told the American people that I would not back down in my effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population. Today, I am following through on that commitment by directing the Secretary of Commerce to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment base following the 2020 census.\" Some career Census Bureau officials suspected that Trump's memo helped drive the administration to suddenly direct the bureau to rush counting last summer and cut back on quality checks for the 2020 census results, a report by the Commerce inspector general's office revealed. The administration appeared desperate to get a hold of census results before the end of Trump's term in case Biden won the election. Practical challenges Despite posing serious threats to the count's accuracy and the bureau's credibility as a statistical agency, Trump's memo, like the administration's other census efforts, largely flew under the radar, frequently sidelined by other controversies. At a press conference in July, hours after the release of a memo calling for the unprecedented exclusion of unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment counts, not a single reporter asked Trump a question about the directive. Weeks later, federal courts began declaring the memo unlawful and in some of the cases, unconstitutional as well. After the Supreme Court agreed to squeeze in a hearing for the Trump administration's appeal last fall, though, the high court's conservative majority ruled it was too early to weigh in. In the end, timing and bureaucracy thwarted Trump's plans to alter the latest state population counts. The administration tried to pressure the Census Bureau to prematurely end quality checks, which were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. But career civil servants postponed releasing the first set of census results after unearthing incomplete and duplicate responses. To encourage participation in the 2020 census, the Census Bureau developed a marketing campaign tailored to historically undercounted groups, including Latinos. Some ads emphasized the confidentiality of census responses to try to assuage lingering concerns over the Trump administration's push for a citizenship question.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption To encourage participation in the 2020 census, the Census Bureau developed a marketing campaign tailored to historically undercounted groups, including Latinos. Some ads emphasized the confidentiality of census responses to try to assuage lingering concerns over the Trump administration's push for a citizenship question. As the inauguration of President Biden drew closer, another reality was setting in that made Trump's apportionment plan practically impossible. The Census Bureau could only come up with reliable numbers for a fraction of the unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. Still, even during its final days in office, the administration did not give up on trying to get state-by-state figures of unauthorized immigrants and other noncitizens. A last-minute push by the Trump-appointed Census Bureau director, Steven Dillingham \u2014 as well as two controversial appointees, Nathaniel Cogley and Benjamin Overholt \u2014 sparked whistleblower complaints about demands to produce \"statistically indefensible\" data, and Dillingham ultimately resigned. Without a citizenship or immigration status question on the 2020 census forms, government records the Trump administration directed the bureau to use could only generate a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants in detention centers. For the rest of the population, the bureau could produce estimates. But the methods it would have to use are saddled with \"difficult-to-verify assumptions\" and could \"introduce substantial imprecision\" to the census results, top career officials warned in a March 2020 memo. \"It is our professional judgement that these methods produce estimates of the undocumented foreign-born population at the state level that could inform policy makers,\" but they may not be usable when reapportioning House seats because they require the use of statistical sampling, which is not allowed, wrote John Abowd, the bureau's chief scientist, and Victoria Velkoff, associate director of the bureau's demographic programs. The bureau has also warned, for decades, that using the national head count to identify unauthorized immigrants could undermine public trust in the federal statistical agency. That, in turn, could exacerbate historical undercounts of immigrants and people of color and reduce their areas' share of census-guided federal funding. \"We realize that our job would be made still harder ... if we had an image of being an investigative unit,\" Leo Estrada, who was serving as a special assistant to the bureau's deputy director, told NPR in 1980 in response to FAIR's first apportionment lawsuit. Producing figures of unauthorized immigrants should be a \"job for some other agency,\" Estrada said. The bureau has shelved the Trump administration's project for creating unauthorized immigrant counts. But that work could play a role in the ongoing lawsuit by the state of Alabama and U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from that state who voted against certifying Biden's victory in the 2020 election and told crowds at a rally before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that it was the day for \"taking down names and kicking ass.\" Biden's executive order has restored the longstanding policy of including all residents regardless of immigration status in apportionment counts. But Brooks and the office of Alabama State Attorney General Steve Marshall are still trying to convince U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor to order unauthorized immigrants to be left out. The future of \"we the people\" For Conner, FAIR's first executive director, it's long past time to end this fight. More than four decades after helping to launch FAIR's campaign, Conner says he has since come to recognize the long ties many unauthorized immigrants have to the U.S. \"When you say 'we the people of the United States,' you have to include them,\" Conner says. Now a woodworker based in Nashville, Tenn., Conner condemns the Trump administration's immigration enforcement for not focusing on deterring employers from hiring unauthorized workers. \"For this administration to take up the census lawsuit after they have subverted any effort to recognize the implicit invitation for immigrants to come undocumented to this country to work, to live,\" Conner says, \"I can only understand it as a pure expression of racism and evil. And yet I have to own I took this same position 40 years ago.\" FAIR, however, remains committed to changing who is counted in apportionment and obtaining numbers of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. \"You want to have as much data as possible about the fiscal, environmental and societal impacts of immigration,\" says Stein, FAIR's president. Stein acknowledges the stakes of bringing this issue before the highest court in the land. If the justices declared that reapportioning House seats and electoral votes without unauthorized immigrants is unconstitutional, FAIR would have to resort to advocating for a constitutional amendment, which Stein calls a \"very heavy lift.\" But the Trump administration left office with no definitive Supreme Court ruling on its plan to alter counts that, according to the Constitution, must include the \"whole number of persons in each state.\" That leaves the door open for Alabama's lawsuit and any future legal challenges to test their limits in the courts. And as planning ramps up for the 2030 census, it leaves behind a lingering question: How much further could FAIR's campaign go if another president in line with its ambitions enters the White House?",

The Hispanic Federation is a non-partisan organization. The voting advocacy organization Voto Latino is calling on elected lawmakers to make a year-round effort to engage with Latino constituents. They're also calling out those who make feeble attempts to speak to voters in Spanish. \"We want elected leaders to continue communicating with our community in the language that they speak and understand, but also with real frequency,\" said Danny Friedman, the managing director of Voto Latino. \"Our community is not simply a group to check off the list at campaign time.\" More than 40 million people who live in the U.S. speak Spanish at home, making it the second most spoken language in this country. Voto Latino, which is focused on engaging younger Latino voters, is working with the language learning app Duolingo and sending letters to the House and Senate campaign committees for both parties expressing the need for more consistent communication with Latino voters, in Spanish as well as English. They also plan to drive a wrapped bus near the U.S. Capitol with a targeted message for lawmakers. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?With over 41 million native speakers in the US, Spanish is the 2nd most common language in the country. Most of us have heard politicians speak a few words of Spanish while campaigning, but then stop or slow down once in office. pic.twitter.com/zYwQcArt2y The group put together a video montage of some of the ways in which politicians from both parties have tried to speak Spanish to appeal to voters, with varying degrees of success. But polling suggests that an ability to speak Spanish was not a priority for Latinos in this country when considering whom to support in the most recent presidential race. A poll from the Latino advocacy group UnidosUS found that a candidate's ability to speak Spanish ranked at the bottom of a list of important qualities for a candidate to have. Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, an assistant dean for civic engagement at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, noted that a candidate's language ability isn't as important to Latino voters as their stances on issues or their presence in communities. She also pointed out that the history of Spanish language in this country is complex, noting that the notion of who speaks Spanish and who doesn't can be deeply personal. Soto used herself as an example. \"I desperately wanted my children to be bilingual. I've tried and I'll keep trying, but it's something that is very painful for me,\" she said. \"The knowledge of language is sometimes seen as a metric of cultural identification, and it shouldn't be.\" Soto said that more important than language is the ability to make consistent, culturally competent outreach to Latinos, something that can happen regardless of language. \"If you don't have the substance of the message, be it health care or education or immigration, then you can have as much mariachi music or reggaet\u00f3n as you want and it's not going to be impactful,\" she said. Latinos are one of the largest, most diverse segments of the American electorate, which has shown stronger turnout in recent elections. In 2020, former President Donald Trump performed better than four years earlier in some predominantly Latino areas, and President Biden's campaign was criticized for not making a serious commitment to reaching those communities. One key exception was the state of Arizona, which voted Democratic in both the presidential and Senate races. Democrats were credited there with having a more fulsome and consistent effort to connect with Latino voters, including months of Spanish-language messaging from the Biden campaign.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Protesters in Myanmar are back on the streets for a fifth consecutive day after the military coup last week. Security forces have responded to the demonstrations by declaring martial law in cities across the country. There have been reports of police firing water cannons and rubber bullets into the crowds. As NPR's Ashley Westerman reports, members of the Myanmar immigrant community here in the U.S. are watching and worrying. ASHLEY WESTERMAN, BYLINE: Over the weekend, the crowd of about a hundred people, mostly immigrants from Myanmar - also known as Burma - lined the sidewalk in front of the Myanmar military attache's office in Washington, D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) Free, free, free Burma. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Free, free, free Burma. WESTERMAN: There's been a rally here nearly every day since February 1 to condemn the military's coup. It cited fraud in Myanmar's November general elections as the reason for doing so. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: We demand the immediate release of all elected Burmese political leaders, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was unlawfully detained by the military. WESTERMAN: And while worry for the wildly popular democracy icon may be on the minds of these protesters, so was the well-being of their friends and family back in Myanmar. Among the chants and sign-waving that day, demonstrator Ei Aye fretted. EI AYE: This morning, I tried to calm my mother, but it doesn't work. WESTERMAN: The military had shut down most of the Internet and telecommunications for 24 hours starting Saturday. AYE: Our overseas, all the Myanmar community, we cannot sleep, no? We are so worried about our people. WESTERMAN: Khine Sann said the tensions between demonstrators and security forces are keeping her up at night. KHINE SANN: So I'm very frustrated. I feel very sorry for our country, especially for the future generation, because we don't want our future generation to suffer what we've been through. WESTERMAN: There are just over 100,000 people from Myanmar here in the U.S. Aung Min Naing is with the Network of Myanmar American Association in California. He says many of them are in the U.S. because of past military coups. AUNG MIN NAING: Half - half of the population, yes. WESTERMAN: Naing himself left after the 1988 student uprising and subsequent military coup. While the official number will likely never be known, thousands of protesters and soldiers are thought to have lost their lives that year. Naing hopes history doesn't repeat itself this year. NAING: Back in 1988, they removed all the army, the police, from the city, and they brought the army from the border area. Those people had never been to the big city, so they have no sympathy. They just shoot, right? So right now we see it. The police are cooperating. But if they're going to start using the playbook, like back in 1988, it's going to be bad. WESTERMAN: But for now, Naing says, all he and others in the U.S. can do is continue to bring awareness to the situation on the ground in Myanmar. Ashley Westerman, NPR News.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators continue to take to the streets across Myanmar to protest the military coup of the government there last week \u2014 despite the military declaring martial law in cities across the country and banning public gatherings larger than five people at once. But as the aftermath continues to unfold, people in the U.S. with deep ties to the Southeast Asian country can only watch and wait. Tensions have escalated between demonstrators and security forces following the Myanmar military's take over of the civilian government on Feb. 1, citing fraud in the country's November general elections. Since taking power and detaining ruling party leaders, including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has cut off the Internet twice and blocked various social media platforms for four days. Those moves effectively eliminated communication between the Myanmar diaspora and their friends and family. \"Our overseas Myanmar community, we cannot sleep, no?\" says Ei Aye, a demonstrator at an anti-coup rally held over the weekend at the Myanmar military attache's office in Washington, D.C. While there has been a gathering at the office in Northwest D.C. nearly every day to condemn the coup since it happened, Myanmar immigrants have been speaking out across the U.S. in places such as New York City, Indianapolis and Ownesboro, Ky. \"We're so worried about our people,\" she said. Ei Aye, who drove from Rockville, Md., was particularly worried because she couldn't reach her mother when the military blocked most telecommunications over the weekend. She said she tried multiple work-arounds to try and get in touch, but hadn't been able to connect with anyone in Myanmar for 24 hours. Another demonstrator, Khine Sann, also of Rockville, Md., told NPR she couldn't sleep at night because of the worry over the well-being of her extended family.

Myanmar has experienced multiple military coups since the country became independent from the British in 1948. Aung Min Naing, with the California-based Network of Myanmar American Association, estimates \"half of the population\" of immigrants from Myanmar is in the U.S. because of military coups. While the 2010 Census puts the number of Americans of Burmese descent at some 100,000, more recent surveys put the number higher. The largest communities can be found in and around Minneapolis-St. Paul, Dallas-Fort Worth and New York City.

Aung Min Naing, who wrote a report for the U.S. Census on his community, sees the migration of Myanmar immigrants into the U.S. in three phases. The first wave came after the 1968 military coup, which ushered in one-party rule and more than a decade of martial law. The second wave, he says, arrived after the 1988 student uprising and subsequent military coup, during which thousands of protesters and soldiers are thought to have perished though official numbers will likely never be known. A flood of refugees entering the U.S. from Myanmar starting about a decade ago makes up the third wave. Refugees fled to refugee camps near the border Myanmar-Thailand border to escape the unrest in 1988, Aung Min Naing says. A demonstrator holds up the \"three-finger salute\" during a recent anti-coup demonstration in front of the Myanmar military attach\u00e9's office in Washington, D.C.

When Kayhan Kalhor first left Iran, at age 17, he walked \u2014  more than 2,500 miles, to Italy. He carried only two items with him: a small backpack and his main musical instrument, the kamancheh. This was during the Iranian Revolution. Kalhor was the only one of his family \u2014 who are of Kurdish descent \u2014 to leave the country. His parents, fearing the worst for him, decided there was no other choice. They stayed behind, along with Kalhor's beloved brother. \"Imagine being a teenager,\" Kalhor says. \"You have school, you have your friends, you have your nice things to do.\" He had two pastimes he adored. \"I was riding horses and playing music \u2014 you know, a very normal life. And then, suddenly, you can't go on the street. You know people will shoot you if you do. It was very, very confusing and not at all normal.\" (Interviews with him and others for this story took place over more than three years, conducted in person in both the U.S. and the Netherlands, as well as by phone, email and in messages.) Even before he departed, the stirrings of the revolution were affecting his family. \"It carried many different manifestations that we, at least in my family, weren't used to,\" he says. \"How to be more religious, how to be more political, how to be more, you know, whatever you're not.\" For Kalhor, the chaos of the revolution was only the beginning of the personal calamities he was to endure. On his long journey, Kalhor worked his way across two continents, Iran to Turkey to Romania to what was then Yugoslavia to Italy, picking up menial farm work as he went along. He was already a very promising young musician \u2014 a child prodigy. At age 13, he was invited to join his country's national radio and television orchestra. And because he started learning his craft so early, he had a chance to learn from older virtuosos \u2014 before the revolution, before music was entirely banned. Once he reached Rome, he studied Western classical music; later, he moved to Canada and earned a music degree at Ottawa's Carleton University. But back then, walking from Tehran to Rome, Kalhor was a kid fleeing mayhem, intensely aware of what he had left behind. \"When you live with your parents, you know everything you want is there \u2014 food, comfort, love, what you get from your family usually,\" he remembers. \"And then, suddenly, you live in a different country, you have to speak the language, you have to start working. My family wasn't rich, so we had limited resources. I was just thinking about what is the next meal I'm going to have.\" Four years after Kalhor left Iran, his parents and brother were killed in a missile strike that hit their home during the devastating Iran-Iraq war that followed the Iranian revolution. (In September 1980, Saddam Hussein ordered his forces to invade Iran. The war lasted eight years, and killed an estimated million and a half people, the majority of them in Iran.) For many years, Kalhor didn't speak publicly about his personal life, or what he had endured. He let his heart-wrenching and beautiful music speak for him: music that is rooted in rigorous erudition, a tradition so distinctive and so precious that it's been named to the United Nations' list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. His instrument, the kamancheh, is a small, dusky-toned, four-stringed, bowed upright fiddle, with a delicate sound that belies its emotional intensity. He composes, sings and plays several other instruments as well. Kalhor plays the kamancheh in 2017. When he left Iran at age 17, he carried only two items with him: a small backpack and his main musical instrument, the kamancheh.\n                \n                    \n                    Julia Gunther for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kalhor is now one of the most famous performers and composers in Iran, with a global reputation. He is an integral part of the Grammy-winning Silkroad Ensemble, the artistic collective founded by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who has become a close friend. He's written music for filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and has collaborated with a range of vaunted artists, from Kronos Quartet, Brooklyn Rider and the New York Philharmonic to Malian kora master Toumani Diabat\u00e9 and Dutch jazz pianist Rembrandt Frerichs. Within Iran, he is among the foremost nurturers and champions of Persian classical music; he founded two important ensembles, Dastan and Masters of Persian Music, as well as composing for, and performing with, revered vocalists including the late Mohammed Reza Shajarian and Shahram Nazeri. Kalhor cuts a regal, dashing figure onstage, always clad in an elegant jewel-toned shirt, with thick hair and a mustache that have both turned silver. Although music has been central to Persian culture for many centuries, just like its poetry, Ayatollah Khomeini initially banned all music in Iran. Since the revolution, however, Persian classical artists have ridden cross-current cycles of official condemnation, grudging tolerance, censorship and encouragement \u2014 even attempts at co-option \u2014 by the Iranian government. Even today, female singers are banned from solo performances for mixed-gender audiences; rock and hip-hop artists remain underground. In August, a male musician, Mehdi Rajabian, was arrested for recording with female singers, on the grounds of \"encouraging prostitution.\" It was the third time Rajabian has been held for musical offenses against the regime. Between those political pressures and the rigors of tradition, it takes a very particular kind of intensity and devotion to be a classical musician in Iran. And with its soulful beauty, Kalhor's music had the potential, he knew, to go to a much wider world. In 1991, after he had graduated from Carleton and obtained a Canadian passport, Kalhor knew it was time to explore wider vistas again. \"I thought maybe there is a better environment for me, to present myself and my music,\" he says. So he moved to Brooklyn, where he was based for many years, and began to build an international career. By the late 1990s, he was recording solo albums that grew into collaborations with other artists and tastemaker labels like ECM Records. In 2000, he was invited to travel to Massachusetts for a workshop collaboration with the renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and dozens of international musicians. That project grew into the Silkroad ensemble. The year of that workshop, Kalhor wrote a perfumed, deeply evocative piece Blue as the Turquoise Night of Neyshabur for the Silkroad group. \"It's one of the most beautiful pieces I've ever heard,\" Ma said in an interview in the late summer of 2017. \"I think he's one of the greatest musicians I've ever had the privilege to know and to work with.\" Ma says that his fellowship with Kalhor rests in something deeper than just  their shared virtuosity. \"He's like a spiritual brother to me,\" Ma said. \"We often call each other brothers because there's an incredible link \u2014 if you believe in the soul, then we're linked in that way. And we have a very deep bond that somehow comes through in the music making.\" Back then, as his international career blossomed, Kalhor's global career seemed unbound by the strictures of what passport he was carrying. \"To tell you the truth, I never thought of becoming a permanent U.S. citizen back then,\" Kalhor says. \"I was a Canadian citizen and an Iranian citizen, so I had a Canadian passport. I used to travel very comfortably back and forth.\" He had a series of O visas for the U.S., a work visa that the U.S. grants to \"aliens of extraordinary ability in the arts. \"I renewed it every two years, I paid my [American] taxes,\" he continues. \"So I never thought an American green card would be necessary until 9/11 happened. And things got...a little more difficult.\" In 2001, fees for visas increased substantially \u2014 as did the average wait time for paperwork processing, which multiplied from weeks to up to six months. And after Sept. 11, there was vastly increased security attention paid towards Iranian nationals in the U.S. After the Patriot Act was passed in September 2002, President George W. Bush's administration created a controversial program called the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS). It mandated increased screening of travelers from 25 countries \u2014 24 of them predominantly Muslim, including Iran. Visa holders from those countries were required to register upon arrival in the U.S. (which meant being fingerprinted, photographed and questioned), as well as check in regularly with immigration officials while they were in the U.S. NSEERS was suspended by the Obama administration in 2011, and ended completely in 2016. Over the course of NSEERS' existence, however, some 80,000 people were required to participate; according to news reports at the program's cancellation, not one of those individuals was found to have any links to terrorism. Kalhor found the anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. so difficult that in 2002, he decided to return to Iran, despite his native country's strictures. Along with continuing to perform and write there, he dedicated part of his time to teaching. In the years since the revolution, when so many prominent Iranian musicians had left the country, he felt a responsibility to cultivate a new generation of talent. It was then that Kalhor met Zohreh Soltanabadi, his great love. She shares Kalhor's other passion: horses. That's what brought them together; not long after his return to Tehran, a friend invited Kalhor to go horseback riding. As it happens, the friend took him to Soltanabadi's place \u2014 her business is breeding horses, primarily race horses. They soon fell in love, and began building a life together in Tehran. Being with Soltanabadi gave Kalhor a new personal contentment and peace. That era of their romance was beautifully depicted in the documentary The Music of Strangers: Yo-Yo Ma & the Silk Road Ensemble, a 2016 film made by the Academy Award-winning director Morgan Neville. It includes footage of the beaming couple, shot in Iran in May 2009. In the film, Soltanabadi says confidently on camera, \"Our future plans are all for here.\" Kalhor agrees: \"I can't imagine living abroad anymore.\" It was a time of hope for them, and for their country. Then, just one month later, the ground was yanked from beneath them. After the government's violent response to the Green Movement, which challenged Iran's presidential election results, Kalhor felt that he could not stay in Iran. It was time to leave \u2014 again. Remembering those days in a 2017 conversation, Kalhor observed, \"I think we were facing the same thing that you're facing in the U.S. right now. We had a bad administration, a president who was ignorant and uneducated. The country was unlivable after he got to office. The situation, especially for artists and intellectuals, became very difficult. I couldn't convince myself to go back, because the administration that was in office was not cultured. And this is what I have to offer \u2014 culture.\" Kalhor found a property in rural Cherry Valley, Calif., where they could breed horses; as he proudly points out, some of their horses have won major awards. The couple married in the U.S., and they both tried to apply for a green card \u2014 permanent resident status in the U.S. Initially, Soltanabadi and Kalhor both told NPR, they received bad guidance from an immigration lawyer, and wasted seven years on that initial attempt. In 2016, they applied again with a new attorney. (With the couple's permission, NPR repeatedly requested interviews with that attorney, who declined to respond.) Not long after the couple got married, Soltanabadi's father died. Soltanabadi's mother back in Iran needed her, she says, and as an Iranian daughter, it was her duty and desire to care for her mother. With Kalhor gone so frequently on tour in any case, Soltanabadi returned to Iran. She stayed for three years. For the next several years, Kalhor and Soltanabadi saw each other mostly by Skype and, occasionally meeting abroad. The Music of Strangers shows one of those transient reunions, in a hotel lobby in Istanbul. The couple embrace repeatedly, exuberant smiles on both of their faces. (\"I love you so much. How long have we not seen each other?\" he asks her in Farsi, the Persian language. \"A long time,\" she replies softly. It had been five months since they were last together.) Yo-Yo Ma says that he understands how strange Kalhor and Soltanabadi's relationship might look to outsiders. \"Just from the point of view of a musician, I can say that we have very odd travel profiles,\" he observes. \"Kayhan and Zohreh \u2014 they're separated for months at a time, all the time. And that's very unusual for married couples, you know? If you look at the profile of those two people, it's incredibly odd. It looks insane.\" Soltanabadi says that despite their frequent separations, her hopes for living in the United States were simple. \"I dreamed of being with Kayhan, and having our horses there, our business there. That was the dream, you know?\" she says, speaking to me from Tehran through an interpreter. \"But mostly, I just wanted to be with Kayhan, and live with him.\" Life in Iran has become even more difficult than it once was,  Soltanabadi says. U.S. sanctions against Iran, and the American government's retreat from the 2015 nuclear deal, have resulted in a severe economic crisis in her native country. Not only has she not been able to build the breeding business in the U.S. that she had hoped, but her work at home has suffered as well. \"Due to the embargo,\" she observes, \"there are not a lot of shows happening in Iran that have an international influence or an international component, with horses coming in and out of the country. And modern veterinary medicine is not available now in Iran.\" (The same is true for medicines for humans.) Meanwhile, the political climate in Iran continued to wreak havoc on Kalhor's artistic life. In June 2015, he was scheduled to play his first concert in Iran in six years. It was to be a performance with some longtime friends and collaborators, the American string quartet Brooklyn Rider. Less than a week before the concert, however, authorities canceled the show, citing unspecified \"security concerns.\" After that incident, Kalhor vowed not to play in Iran again \"as long as art and culture are held hostage.\" It was a difficult chapter for one of Iran's most visible and widely beloved cultural ambassadors. In the spring of 2017 \u2014 just months after President Trump's initial ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, went into effect \u2014 Soltanabadi finally had her an appointment at the U.S. embassy in Ankara, Turkey for her green card interview. Kalhor had already had his application for U.S. permanent residency granted. Because the U.S. hasn't had a diplomatic presence in Iran since 1979, Iranians who are seeking entrance to the United States must go to a third country for their visa interviews. Turkey is a common destination. The applicants bear the costs of those trips, along with all of their other immigration expenses. (By June 2017, the Supreme Court had ruled that the travel ban could not be applied to people with a \"bona fide\" relationship with a person or entity in the U.S.) \"The interview was very uncomfortable,\" Soltanabadi tells NPR in a FaceTime call from Iran, speaking through a translator. \"The lady who was interviewing me \u2014 she seemed not to like anybody at all, not just me, but any human being.\" She says that she understands that it's a consular interviewer's job to be clinical and dispassionate, and that the process should be arduous and lengthy, but she feels strongly that this interviewer, whose name she does not have, went far beyond that point. Soltanabadi says that although she knew that the interviewer would ask all sorts of questions that might strike the couple as strange or intrusive, she was still taken aback by what she says the interviewer said to her. \"She persisted in asking us why we'd gotten married in the U.S., and not in Iran. And she said to me that the reason must be that your family probably doesn't even like him,\" Soltanabadi remembers. \"I said, 'Well, you're wrong. In Iran, everybody likes Kayhan, and my family loves him.'\" Her return to Iran to care for her mother after her father's death also appeared to be a major issue, Zoltanabadi says. \"The lady kept asking me, 'Why did you separate from your husband and go back to Iran?'\" she recounts. \"She had no concept that in our culture, when the parent dies, the rest of the family has to take care of each other.\" The interviewer, Soltanabadi says, also asked to see pictures of the two of them together, and of Kalhor with her family, as a way of proving that they were a real couple. (This is a quite common technique among immigration officials, in order to establish that there's an actual romantic relationship at stake.) Soltanabadi says that she tried to explain that because of her husband's fame, and because they had already been together for 14 years, that there were plenty of photographs available \u2014 as well as the documentary film, which had premiered two years earlier and had been screened across the U.S. Soltanabadi thought that those photos, and the film, would bolster their application and help explain their lengthy separations. But, according to Soltanabadi, the official in Ankara dismissed her suggestion, saying: \"'That's nice, but I'm not interested in those.'\" Soltanbadi thought the official's response was nonsensical. How many couples have had a major American filmmaker chronicle their romance? She says that she knew that the green card interview had gone badly. \"Afterwards, I was really upset,\" Soltanabadi says. \"I was very unhappy when I left the embassy \u2014 I despaired. I even told Kayhan that maybe we shouldn't even pursue this anymore.\" Despite his status as a legal resident, Kalhor has been unable to live in the U.S. with his wife, Zohreh Soltanabadi, during the Trump administration. She has a valid work permit, but can't get into the country to use it because of the former administration's travel ban.\n                \n                    \n                    Julia Gunther for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Despite his status as a legal resident, Kalhor has been unable to live in the U.S. with his wife, Zohreh Soltanabadi, during the Trump administration. She has a valid work permit, but can't get into the country to use it because of the former administration's travel ban. Just as Soltanabadi had feared, her green card application was denied. But shortly afterwards, in May 2017, came even more bad news from Turkey \u2014 a message that further shattered the couple's assumptions about how the U.S. government worked. Kalhor received an email, which NPR has viewed, from the Immigrant Visa Unit of the U.S. embassy in Ankara. It read, almost in its entirety: \"This office regrets to inform you that a consular officer has returned your petition to USCIS for further review, with a recommendation for revocation.\" It was signed: \"Sincerely, Immigration Visa Unit, U.S. Embassy Ankara.\" It meant that the U.S. was perhaps thinking of taking back Kalhor's legal status as a U.S. resident. NPR reached out to the State Department and to USCIS; neither entity would comment on a specific case. Speaking anonymously, however, an experienced official within USCIS told NPR that the language and content of the email Kalhor received was so bizarrely worded, confusing and out of the ordinary that, this official speculated, it might have been some kind of phishing attempt. It was not. A revocation of a green card is supposed to be an exceedingly serious matter that goes through lengthy official channels, New Jersey-based immigration lawyer Leena Khandwala explains. People lose their green cards for reasons like criminal convictions and committing fraud. \"For a permanent resident to be stripped of their status,\" Khandwala says, \"they have to be put in formal removal proceedings. An immigration court makes that decision, but then that can be appealed, and then beyond that it can be appealed to a circuit court of appeals. The process takes several years.\" In other words, revoking a green card isn't something to be threatened via a terse email. That one email threw much of the next two years of the couple's life into disarray, both professionally and personally. Kalhor had concerts scheduled in the U.S.; he constantly worried that he would be prevented from entering the country, or that he would be detained by immigration officials once he landed in the States. And the life that Kalhor and Soltanabadi had been so lovingly and carefully building in California \u2014 a place for them and their horses, a place where they could finally build a real, joint life for themselves \u2014 suddenly seemed a mirage. Eventually \u2014 and after NPR made inquiries about his case and immigration status \u2014 Kalhor received confirmation that his green card was secure, and that he can come and go as a permanent resident of the U.S. But Soltanabadi cannot be here with him. After her green card request was denied, she has stayed in Iran. Kalhor still travels frequently to the U.S. to perform, but he has decided he cannot live apart from his wife, even though he still spends most of his time on the road. \"It just makes you question yourself,\" he says. \"I have basically been living in North America for over 30 years. I always thought of the U.S. as a different place \u2014 as a second country for me. And a place where everything is done differently, according to people's merit, not the color of their skin, or their race, or anything else.\" Once again \u2014 so many years after walking out of Iran \u2014 Kalhor found himself separated from the country he called home. Isabel Soffer has been presenting global music in New York City and across the U.S. for over 25 years. She has known Kalhor for much of that time, and has helped him book shows and tours. \"On so many levels \u2014 emotionally, economically, politically \u2014 it's been really difficult,\" Soffer says. \"Whenever, wherever he puts down roots, it seems they kind of get yanked out from under him. And for him to continue to go through this, it's just twisted. It's really cruel.\" \"I think this man is about as safe an individual as anybody that I've encountered,\" Yo-Yo Ma observed to NPR in 2017, not long after Kalhor received that portentous email from the U.S. embassy. \"Imagine becoming an orphan so young, and then you kind of recapture your life through music. And finally, you find a loved one, you want to settle down \u2014 but you're still separated by all these circumstances, your life is once again in shambles, because you're deemed someone not worthy, when in fact your very essence is to spread the poetry of love, for understanding, for creating trust, for bringing people together. It's just a very sad contradiction of the content of someone's life, and his intentions.\" Kalhor's case for his kamancheh. His life's work is trying to ensure that his beloved Iranian classical music reaches as many people as possible.\n                \n                    \n                    Julia Gunther for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kalhor's case for his kamancheh. His life's work is trying to ensure that his beloved Iranian classical music reaches as many people as possible. Because of her husband's work, Soltanabadi says, everything is still very complicated. Just like before, she usually has to travel to see him, or content herself with Skype calls. The tenuous, transitory existence captured in The Music of Strangers is, once again, their status quo. \"He lives out of his suitcases, in hotels,\" she says. \"So when we plan our lives, we have to plan a year or two out, to figure where we can be together. If we're together for two weeks at a time, that's very unusual. And it's a big source of happiness for him.\" Meanwhile, Kalhor is still trying to make sure that his beloved Iranian classical music reaches as many people as possible. In 2017, he traveled across the length and breadth of Iran, giving 70 concerts \u2014 many of them free \u2014 in remote and particularly impoverished areas of the country. Kalhor used to make a point of not offering political commentary in public, but times have changed. In 2018, he wrote an op-ed, by turns bitter and tender, for the Dallas Morning News about what he called the \"isolation, extremism and revolutionary kabuki\" of the Iranian regime, and the despair he and other Iranians felt after the nuclear deal fell apart. In another political era, this chapter in Kalhor and Soltanabadi's story might have ended differently. But Kalhor has always had to lead his life \u2014 and make his music \u2014 under the looming shadow of geopolitics, of big power plays and small bureaucrats who wield enormous control. In mid-2019, I meet Kalhor backstage before a concert in New York City. As always, the dressing room is crowded with well-wishers, the well-connected, friends and admirers. He's gracious with them all \u2014 he's a naturally generous person, but being famous for the better part of 30 years has trained him in the art of seemingly endless patience. When it's finally just the two of us talking, Kalhor tells me that that Soltanabadi has a U.S. work permit valid for three years, but she can't get into the country to use it. \"It's just the same as it was before,\" Kalhor says glumly, \"because Zohreh is not allowed to come to this country, due to the travel ban. Right now we have this house in California with no occupants. And my wife hasn't been able to come back for the past two years. So we're waiting to see if the situation changes.\" In another political era, this chapter in Kalhor and Soltanabadi's story might have ended differently.\n                \n                    \n                    Julia Gunther for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In another political era, this chapter in Kalhor and Soltanabadi's story might have ended differently. \"Waiting to see if the situation changes\" \u2014 it's a recurring phrase that has dictated so much of Kalhor's life. But now, instead of referring to his life in Iran, before and through the revolution, before and through the devastating war, before and through all the permutations of what was and is and might or might not be permissible for a musician in the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 he means in the United States. Reflecting back on what happened to him and Soltanabadi, Kalhor remains perplexed. \"What happened in between, why I received that email about possibly revoking my green card, what changed, I don't know anything about it,\" he says. We are talking in the midst of the crisis at the U.S.'s southern border; Kalhor has been closely watching and reading the stories of parents and children who have been separated from each other. \"I'm sure many families have the same problems,\" he says, \"and they're fighting the same situation. Maybe they have to leave their children in another country, or maybe they have to leave another loved one. I'm sure there are many, many scenarios that are the same as what we have.\" Kalhor says he thinks that even after all that's transpired, he's still in a privileged position. \"I do have a green card,\" he notes. \"I'm allowed to live in the U.S. and be a permanent resident, though my wife cannot enter this country. So it's just a very awkward situation.\" Since that 2019 conversation, the pandemic has of course circumscribed Kalhor's touring life. In January of this year, shortly before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, Kalhor tells me that nothing has changed in their circumstances, and that they believe that under the immigration code, there is no chance to successfully appeal or have Soltanabadi's application reconsidered. One of President Joe Biden's first actions in office on Jan. 20 was to issue an executive order rolling back the travel ban, which includes a proposal to reconsider applications made by people who were affected by the Trump-era policies. It remains to be seen whether or not Soltanabadi and Kayhan can try again. In the meantime, they are back where they started life together: in Tehran. Tehran's city scape at night.

Gone were the conservative evangelical leaders who had been invited in the past. No Catholic bishops or priests took part. This year's National Prayer Service, a longstanding inauguration tradition to welcome an incoming presidential administration, instead featured two transgender faith leaders, the president of the Navajo Nation, and a host of speakers with urgent calls for national transformation. Previous inauguration prayer services have been largely non-political affairs, with faith leaders asking for divine blessing of the nation's new leaders. But this year's service, following four years of Donald Trump's divisive leadership and his incitement of a mob insurrection, had an unusually sharp tone. \"Help us today to imagine a new America,\" said Rabbi Sharon Brous from the IKAR Jewish congregation in Los Angeles, \"A new America that abolishes the heresy of white supremacy and enlists all of us in dismantling racism and lifting up a theology of radical equality.\" In his homily, the Rev. William Barber II cited Isaiah 58, where the prophet calls on his people to \"loose the bands of wickedness, ... let the oppressed go free,\" and become \"the repairer of the breach.\" Barber is a national co-chair of the Poor Peoples Campaign. \"The breach is when we say, 'One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,' with our lips while we see the rich and the poor living in two different Americas,\" Barber said, speaking thunderously from his pulpit at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C.. He challenged those who argue that this is a time to avoid hard truths and put aside the issues that divide the nation. \"The only way to establish domestic tranquility is to establish justice,\" Barber said. \"Pretending that we can address the nation's wounds with simplistic calls for unity, that is not how we can close the breach. The breach is telling lies when we need truth, greed when we need compassion.\" The speakers were chosen jointly by the Biden-Harris inaugural committee and the clergy at the National Cathedral, which has traditionally hosted these prayer services. This year it was an online production. President Biden and first lady Jill Biden watched the service on television from the White House, joined by Vice President Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff. The lineup of speakers was especially inclusive. For the first time, two transgender faith leaders took part, along with other clergy supportive of LGBTQ rights. Two Muslims offered prayers, along with Hindu and Sikh leaders. The president of the Navajo Nation, Jonathan Nez, said a prayer partly in his own Navajo language. The only Catholic speakers at the service were two nuns, both known for their progressive views. Sister Norma Pimentel, an advocate for undocumented immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border, recited the peace prayer by St. Francis of Assisi. Sister Carol Keehan, who lobbied tirelessly for the Affordable Care Act despite official opposition from the Catholic Church, also spoke. While Pope Francis welcomed Biden's inauguration, saying he prayed that Biden \"will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom,\" the U.S. Catholic hierarchy has been less welcoming. Shortly after Biden's election, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops raised concerns about his support of abortion rights and same sex marriage and appointed a task force to consider what it means to have the second Catholic president in U.S. history holding positions that depart from official Catholic teaching.",

President Biden. That's going to take some getting used to after these past four years. The new president was sworn in Wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. Biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing Americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the U.S. faces, as he sees it. Here are six takeaways from Biden's inauguration: 1. A starkly different tone was set. If there's one thing that stood out most, it was the tone that Biden struck. Gone was the tension, defiance and grievance of Donald Trump. Instead, America saw a staid and humble President Biden. Instead of igniting flames of division, he was trying to take the temperature down. \"We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue,\" Biden said. \"Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment stand in their shoes.\" For a significant portion of the country, Biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the Trump presidency. Some Republicans even praised his speech. For another large group of Americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take. Overall, as unusual as the day was because of the heavy security presence and the lack of crowds due to COVID-19 and threats, it seemed like Washington was headed for something of a return to normal. For a day at least, the four years of whiplash had come to an end, which was summed up well in three very different scenes at the U.S. Capitol on the first three Wednesdays of this January: one of the Jan. 6 violence, one of Trump's impeachment and then one of Biden's inauguration. Three Wednesdays in January pic.twitter.com/9dQgG0R0A8 2. Real unity will be tough to come by. Trying to bridge the gap of hard feelings, Biden did something Trump rarely did \u2014 reach out to those who didn't vote for him. And he wasn't so naive as to talk about it in a way that showed he thinks it would be easy or happen at all. \"To all those who did not support us,\" Biden said, \"let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\" Certainly, this was no Trump \"American carnage\" speech. But tone is one thing, and policy is another. A return to \"normal\" may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but only very narrowly. Biden will likely need Republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else. And it won't solve the problem of the tens of millions of Trump supporters who are fed and believe a daily diet of false information \u2014 and who make up the base of the Republican Party. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell looks on as President Biden delivers his inaugural address outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell looks on as President Biden delivers his inaugural address outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. 3. Biden laid out his priorities. Speaking of those priorities, Biden listed the policy approaches that he believes would lead to healing in America. They include addressing COVID-19, racial justice, climate change and domestic extremism, including white supremacy. He is the first president to address white supremacy in an inaugural address. Biden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. But you can bet that Republicans will find plenty to disagree with Democrats about in how to solve those issues. And what of unity then? More importantly, what of solving those issues when Biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of Republican opposition? Biden is already wasting no time, signing lots of executive orders on COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, immigration and more. But there's only so far those executive orders can go. 4. Truth matters again. When hearing of Trump's falsehoods, exaggerations and lies, cynics and many Trump supporters dismissed the criticism that Trump faced with a version of an all-too-familiar retort: \"Oh, come on. All politicians lie.\" Well, not like what was seen these past four years. Trump made more than 30,000 misleading claims in four years, according to The Washington Post. That's an average of 20 per day. What usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. Then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. But Trump could not be shamed. The news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. And Biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. But there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than \"alternative\" ones that never existed. 5. Inaugurations may have changed permanently. Biden got out of the presidential limo and walked hand in hand with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, to the White House. For a brief moment, in a tight shot on television, it could have all looked like any other inauguration. But it was not. The walk was drastically curtailed and more heavily guarded compared with past presidential inaugurations. And while there were some people on the street during the walk, there weren't throngs of people lining the streets. It's very likely that inaugurations as we knew them have changed permanently. There may be a return of people to the National Mall and even a parade when the coronavirus pandemic finally clears. But from here on out, these will likely be heavily fortified events. 6. The presidency is overwhelming \u2014 for anyone. Despite his decades serving as a senator in Washington and even his eight years as vice president, Biden was clearly moved by the reality of his new position. Trump even appeared cowed Wednesday by leaving it. On Trump's exit from the White House, he stopped to talk to reporters. He looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind \u2014 and even thanked the media. After walking up to the White House, Biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. He then hugged his wife and held the embrace. They took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.",

Updated 5:01 p.m. ET If you haven't heard, Joe Biden would like to unite America. It was a focus of the Democrat's campaign. It's even the theme of Biden's inauguration \u2014 \"America United.\" He made lots of appeals to unity in his inaugural address. \"We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature.  For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.\" But even he knows it won't be so easy. \"I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days,\" Biden said. \"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.\" The country is as divided as it's ever been, as pessimistic as it's been in three decades and facing health, economic and racial crises. American division did not begin with Donald Trump and won't end with him leaving the White House. A very different inauguration Biden's inauguration as the 46th president was different than any seen before in U.S. history. Four years ago, Trump was arguing over his crowd size compared with Barack Obama's record-setting turnout of supporters on the National Mall. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the Mall is shut down \u2014 as is much of downtown Washington, D.C. After the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of pro-Trump supporters, the entire Capitol complex, a place that is generally open to the public, has been locked down. There is now 7-foot high, \"non-scalable\" steel fencing topped with razor wire surrounding the Capitol. Razor wire is seen last week after being installed on the fence surrounding the grounds of the U.S. Capitol due to security threats.\n                \n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Razor wire is seen last week after being installed on the fence surrounding the grounds of the U.S. Capitol due to security threats. With threats looming, armed troops are stationed every few feet. Some 25,000 troops were in Washington Wednesday to fortify the inauguration. It's like a scene from a war zone in another country. But in fact that's more troops than the U.S. currently has deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and all of Africa combined. Biden tried to show a semblance of normalcy, walking out of the presidential limo to the White House, but it was heavily curtailed. There were some people along the walk, but not the throngs of crowds lining the streets from past inaugurations. Setting a new tone, but deep fissures remain Getting through Wednesday is the first part. Biden's speech was a 180-degree turn from Trump's \"American carnage\" address four years ago. It stressed unity, and set a tone of decency, but there was a glaring, yet invisible sign of just how difficult true unity will be. In a fit of protest, Trump did not attend. Former Vice President Mike Pence was there instead and did not attend Trump's farewell at Joint Base Andrews. It was the first time in 150 years that a sitting president did not attend the inauguration of his successor. The Trumps have cast aside other traditional signs of the peaceful transfer of power. When Biden's daughter Ashley was asked Tuesday on NBC's Today by Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of a former Republican president, whether soon-to-be first lady Jill Biden had heard from Melania Trump, she said, \"No, I don't think they're doing the traditional protocol, which is unfortunate, but I think we're all OK with it.\" Jenna Bush: \"Has your mom heard from Melania Trump about doing the traditional protocols?\"Ashley Biden: \"No ... but I think we're all okay with it.\" pic.twitter.com/ft6zjG51ra President Trump convinced tens of millions of his followers of false claims about a stolen election and widespread fraud, none of which is true. Key members of his own administration called it the most secure election in history. Much of the mob that stormed the Capitol echoed Trump's talking points, which were only amplified by conservative media in the runup to the Jan. 6 violence. The misinformation consumed by many on the right has been fed for decades through prime-time cable dressed up as straight news. Facebook memes and outfits even further on the fringe than Fox News are growing in popularity. Conspiracies are being mainstreamed. There is no good answer for unraveling that. So the country will remain sharply divided. Trump leaves office with a 38% approval rating in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, and Biden gets more positive reviews than Trump so far. A majority approve of how he handled the transition, think he'll do more to unify than divide and more people like him than don't, but not by much. But strikingly, 8 in 10 Republicans approve of the job Trump was doing, and 7 in 10 of them don't accept the results of the presidential election. So Republicans have little political incentive to work with Biden. And Biden has an ambitious agenda \u2014 a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, requiring a $15 federal minimum wage, an immigration overhaul addressing the millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, not to mention trying to lead a dialogue on race in America. As with all presidents, Biden doesn't have a magic wand. He can't heal families torn apart by views of Trump in one swoop. And he certainly can't get his agenda implemented without the help of Congress. The president, after all, controls the sword, but the Congress controls the purse. And Biden is going to need an awful lot of what's in that bag. While Democrats will control both the House and Senate, it will only be just narrowly. The Senate will be tied 50-50. On tied votes, soon-to-be Vice President Kamala Harris will break them. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell in recent days has spoken out against Trump and laid blame at his feet for the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., arrives at the U.S. Capitol and walks to his office Jan. 6.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., arrives at the U.S. Capitol and walks to his office Jan. 6. \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.\" McConnell showed all the perfunctory signs of a degree of unity. He attended Mass with Biden Wednesday morning. He was present at Biden's inauguration and was cracking wise at the Capitol in congratulating Biden and Vice President Harris, the first woman, African American and person of Indian descent to be vice president. \"Not only did we swear in a former son and daughter of the Senate as the president and vice president, but both these former senators skipped the House altogether,\" McConnell joked with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi present. Senators, of course, are the subject of the joke that each of them wakes up in the morning and looks in the mirror they see a president. But for most big legislative items the new president wants, it will require 60 votes from those senators to overcome a filibuster. And McConnell used the filibuster more than any minority leader in history during the Obama years. Will he really be turning over a new leaf of bipartisan camaraderie and goodwill? McConnell is undoubtedly eyeing taking back the Senate in two or more years, and he will need the support of his Republican members to be majority leader again. What's more, Republicans, who turned a blind eye to Trump's deficit spending and ballooning of the debt, are already becoming fiscal hawks once again. \"What I'm concerned about is we seem to have no concern now about borrowing money in the short term,\" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday during the confirmation hearing for Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary. He went on to lay out the traditional Republican argument about how the parties aim to balance the budget \u2014 Republicans want to cut spending, while Democrats seek more revenue, which means increasing taxes. But that didn't apply to Trump. The national debt increased by $8 trillion under the outgoing president to almost $28 trillion. Trump's tax cuts alone cost $2.3 trillion. The stage at the U.S. Capitol is prepared for Biden's inauguration. There will be no crowd allowed on the National Mall this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The stage at the U.S. Capitol is prepared for Biden's inauguration. There will be no crowd allowed on the National Mall this year. But it's not just money, it's also familiar cultural fights. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has faced criticism for his role in objecting to Biden's win ahead of the violence at the Capitol, said Tuesday that he was putting a hold on Biden's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas. \"Mr. Mayorkas has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden's promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures,\" Hawley said, going on to cite Trump's border wall. And all of this is to say nothing of the pressures Biden is facing from the progressive left, which wanted nothing more than to beat Trump. Now that they have, progressives are eager to make sweeping change. But the numbers in Congress aren't there. If Biden, progressives and even many Republicans on Capitol Hill were looking to move on from Trump, it's going to take a little while. That's because much of what Biden wants to do \u2014 whether it's dealing with COVID-19 or just confirming Cabinet secretaries \u2014 is going to have to share time with Trump's impeachment trial. The House is expected to send the article of impeachment to the Senate soon, and when it does, the Senate has to take it up immediately. And there is only so much time in the day. Biden is aiming to at least bring down the temperature and bring back a degree of traditional Washington comity. That was evident not just in his inaugural address, but Tuesday night in the somber ceremony in front of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, remembering the 400,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19. It's notable that this was the first time in this year of the coronavirus that there was a national moment focused on remembering the dead, as many Americans couldn't even be with loved ones who died in hospitals across the country and never had proper funerals. The congressional leaders are aiming to continue the show of staidness Wednesday morning, with all planning to attend Mass with Biden ahead of his inauguration. But soon it will be back to partisan bickering, and it's going to take one hell of a prayer to get everyone to work together in earnest and unite the country.",

Guillermo D\u00edaz, Guatemala's top immigration official, says that since Friday 7,000-8,000 Hondurans have crossed in to Guatemala in an \"irregular\" manner. \"We are very concerned about this situation,\" D\u00edaz says in a video on his department's Facebook page. \"These people who've formed this caravan or are forming into a caravan...is a very difficult situation to manage.\" Guatemala has set up checkpoints on main roads leading to and from the Honduran border. However, D\u00edaz says many of the migrants have left the main roads and are now arriving in towns in the middle of the country. Officials are very worried, he adds, because another group of roughly the same size is on its way. \"We hope this situation stops,\" he says. \"And this flow of migrants ends.\" Mexican authorities praised the Guatemalan government's forceful response to the migrants. Mexico has beefed up security on its own southern border with Guatemala in anticipation of the caravan. Mexico also sent six buses south to help transport Hondurans back to their home country. The Mexican Secretary for Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling on Honduran officials to do more to stop the \"irregular flow\" of citizens through the region. But migrants in the caravan say they have little choice but to march north. \"We don't want to live in Honduras anymore,\" Ana Murillo told the French news agency Agence France-Presse. Standing with a group of migrants beside a busy road in southern Guatemala, she says Hondurans have been badly affected by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which slammed into the country in November. Honduras also suffers from incredibly high rates of violent crime and the pandemic has crippled the economy. \"There isn't any work. There are no opportunities,\" she says. A light blue cloth face mask hangs from her chin, several bags and children are at her feet. \"We are leaving because we don't want to suffer further.\" Honduran migrants clash with Guatemalan soldiers in Vado Hondo, Guatemala, on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Sandra Sebastian/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Another migrant, Miguel Angel, tells AFP he's heading north now because he believes U.S. immigration policy will change once Joe Biden takes office as president. \"I have hope and faith in God, and in the good person that the United States has chosen,\" he says. \"Biden is a good person and isn't the same as the administration that's just ended.\" But his chances of making it to the U.S./Mexico border are far less than they were a few years ago. In October 2020, another caravan of Hondurans dispersed before it got across Guatemala, and Guatemalan officials said they sent more than 3,000 Hondurans home from that group. In 2019, Mexico deployed National Guard troops to its southern border to deter Central Americans from trying to cross. Ariel Ruiz Soto, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., says he doesn't think it's likely that many of the Hondurans in this current caravan will make it all the way to the U.S. frontier. \"I suspect that if this caravan actually made it to the Guatemalan/Mexico border that there would be even the heavier presence of (Mexican) National Guard to try to detain the migrants,\" he says. \"We saw this again in October. That caravan really stopped in Guatemala at that time. So I don't foresee them getting to the U.S./Mexico border in large numbers.\" Before the pandemic, nationals from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua were able to travel freely across each other's borders. Officials now are requiring a negative coronavirus test to cross. Some migrant advocates say this requirement is being used to block some refugees from seeking asylum abroad.

Despite that, he says the incoming Biden team can't ignore immigration and the immigration policies of the outgoing Trump administration for long. \"A number of the steps that were taken by the last administration to try to deter people from coming to the country where not only illegal, but unconscionable,\" he says. Humans have been migrating since prehistoric times. Migration isn't going to stop. Even if this caravan doesn't make it to the U.S. border, other migrants are already there waiting. Some other potential migrants may view the change in administration in Washington as an opportunity to try to enter. \"Even if that were the case, to what ends would you go in order to head that off?\" Jawetz asks. \"Would you have them violate U.S. law, international law, and prevent people from requesting asylum at the border? Would you have them take their children away in order to send fear into the hearts of families throughout the region?\" Soon after he takes office, Biden is going to have to face the big questions around what Jawetz calls the U.S.'s \"broken\" immigration system.",

TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: President Trump made a trip yesterday to the southern border. He went to highlight his immigration agenda, which he calls one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency. But the turmoil surrounding his defeat and the attack at the U.S. Capitol followed him. NPR's John Burnett reports from McAllen. (SOUNDBITE OF HORNS HONKING) JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: They lined South 10th Street, adoring throngs festooned with MAGA hats and Trump 2020 flags, as though their candidate still had a chance. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Stolen election. It's a stolen election. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Trump all the way. Four more years, Trump. BURNETT: The president flew into the Rio Grande Valley on Tuesday for a ceremony marking the completion of 450 miles of border wall. He signed a plaque on the steel and concrete edifice and addressed an audience of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents, who'd been his stalwart supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've worked long and hard to get this done. They said it couldn't be done. And we got it done, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. BURNETT: With Joe Biden ready to take office in eight days and vowing to dismantle most of Trump's immigration policies, the outgoing president had a warning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: If our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration, a wave like you've never seen before. And I can tell you that already. BURNETT: In his speech, Trump recited a litany of untruths about the border on his watch, that no administration had built border walls before him. Actually, President George W. Bush did. That his policy of forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico ended a humanitarian crisis - in fact, it caused one. And that he won Texas border towns in November - Trump did better than past Republicans, but the border stayed blue. Yet it was impossible on this chilly, overcast day for him to ignore the drama unfolding in Washington, where the House of Representatives prepared to impeach him again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country. And it's causing tremendous anger and division and pain. BURNETT: That anger and division was evident among the folks who joined the Trump train in McAllen. Duane Olson (ph), a 60-year-old farmer from Iowa who winters in south Texas, says he watched the insurrection at the Capitol with dismay. DUANE OLSON: I thought that was wrong. And they shouldn't have never done that. But it's the people themselves that got out of control. He did not himself entice them to do that. And for him to be impeached because of that is wrong. BURNETT: Though they were mightily outnumbered, a cluster of young anti-Trump activists held a corner amid the MAGA crowd. Zack Borha (ph) is a 22-year-old college student who says they often scuffle with the Trump trains that roar through town almost every weekend. ZACK BORHA: We're here, essentially, to go ahead and let Donald Trump know that not only is he not welcome here in the Valley, but his white supremacist values and neo-fascist ideas are never welcome here in the Rio Grande Valley. BURNETT: Just then, a jeep zooms past with a flag that reads Jesus is my savior, Trump is my president. BORHA: That's my favorite flag. I love that flag. It is so - I swear to God, that is a flag straight out of \"Parks And Rec.\" BURNETT: Fearing a repeat of the violence that broke out in Washington last week, a larger anti-Trump rally was held miles from the president's motorcade route. The featured speaker was Julian Castro, former San Antonio mayor and HUD secretary under President Obama. JULIAN CASTRO: But the most significant thing about the Trump presidency is not the wall that he's built around us, it's the wall that he has built between us. And what we're here to say today is that we've had enough of that division and hate and bigotry. We have had enough. (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Non-English language spoken). BURNETT: A couple of hours later, the president's helicopter squadron passed overhead to an airport where Air Force One would carry Donald Trump back to the White House, and this crowd hopes, marking the end of the Trump saga and not another mile of border wall.

Updated at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday President Trump went to Texas on Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to show off one of his signature election promises \u2014 the border wall \u2014 as Democratic lawmakers appear ready to move forward with impeaching him for a second time. He has about a week left in office, but angry lawmakers are calling on him to resign after a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday as a joint session of Congress met inside to certify the results of the election. The aftermath of the riot overshadowed Trump's efforts to change the subject. Even as he signed a plaque on the border wall and praised his own work curbing immigration, the FBI provided an update on its efforts to arrest the violent Trump supporters. Trump brushed aside the moves in Congress to hold him accountable, saying \"the 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me\" and casting the push for impeachment as part of a political effort by his political opponents to hurt him. During the visit to Alamo \u2014 a small town in the Rio Grande Valley \u2014 Trump talked about his efforts to curb immigration, including the hundreds of miles of border wall constructed during his time in office, and measures to stop asylum-seekers. It was the first public appearance for Trump \u2014 beyond video statements \u2014 since Wednesday morning, when he urged his supporters to head to the Capitol as Congress formalized President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Political analysts said it was an obvious attempt to try to rehabilitate his image when his legacy is at stake. \"Every president tries to burnish his legacy by highlighting perceived successes in the final days,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \"Trump's problem among many is that this trip will be completely overshadowed by the fallout from last week.\" Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigration. The clearest example of that was his promise to build a \"big, beautiful wall\" along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a core issue for his base. Most mainstream Republicans would prefer if Trump just faded away quietly, said Sean Walsh, a Republican strategist who worked in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush White Houses. But Walsh said this trip makes clear that Trump does not plan to do so. And Walsh is concerned that Trump could make things worse by picking such a hot-button issue. \"I could see if he did not temper his remarks, whipping some activists up,\" Walsh said. \"So I think we have to keep our eyes and ears very closely peeled on President Trump.\" The latest Quinnipiac University survey taken after the attack finds Trump's job approval has plunged 11 points since December, falling to 33% \u2013 the lowest it has been since August 2017. Conant said the political backlash from the Capitol riot is likely too great for Trump to overcome. He said the president's refusal to concede the election and willingness to stoke conspiracy theories all but ensured he will be remembered for the bitter end to his time in office instead of his policy accomplishments, such as tax cuts and the naming of three Supreme Court justices. \"I think until Donald Trump properly concedes the election and recognizes Joe Biden as the president-elect, he's not going to be able to talk about anything else,\" Conant said. \"And his legacy is losing potency by the hour.\"",

To drum up enthusiasm, Democrats have brought in some of their biggest names. In politics, it's often said that demography is destiny. But the Virginia governor's race on Nov. 2 \u2014 the first big electoral test of the Biden presidency \u2014 is the latest warning of the potential peril in assuming which way key demographic groups will vote, or if they will vote at all. \"I don't believe that demographics are destiny,\" said Luis Aguilar, Virginia director for CASA in Action, the political arm of immigrant advocacy group CASA. \"It's about a culture of civic engagement.\" Virginia, a state President Biden won by 10 points in the 2020 election, has trended Democratic in recent years. But the race for governor this year between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin is close, according to Democrats and Republicans involved in the election. That's in large measure because Democrats are fighting apathy among their base. The party's agenda in Washington, D.C., is stalled, Biden's poll numbers are sagging, and Democrats are sounding the alarm. To try and drum up enthusiasm, the party has recently brought in some of its biggest names, including Biden, Vice President Harris and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams. Former President Barack Obama will hold a rally in Richmond Saturday. Engagement is crucial in retaining support, especially for those in underserved communities, advocates say. Aguilar said CASA in Action has knocked on some 50,000 doors in Latino communities in the state. And while he is optimistic about a McAuliffe win, he has run into a degree of \"political cynicism.\" \"People are so tired,\" Aguilar noted. Latinos are often underrepresented at the polls. In the 2020 presidential election in Virginia, Latinos were 7% of the electorate despite being 10% of the population. It's been worse in state elections. When McAuliffe, a former governor, won the race in 2013, Latinos were 8% of Virginia's population, but just 4% of the electorate. During those door-knock conversations, Aguilar said his team is reminding voters of policy wins since Democrats have taken over the Virginia legislature. He pointed specifically to access to driver privilege cards and prenatal care for undocumented immigrants, as well as an increase in the minimum wage. The Latino voting bloc \"needs that constant engagement, that constant communication about why this election is so important,\" Aguilar said. Geoffrey Guns, senior pastor at Second Calvary Baptist Church in Norfolk, where Abrams spoke, said he has seen a similar apathy among potential Black voters. \"The energy is starting to pick up,\" he said, but added, \"There are people who feel that the election doesn't matter.\" That's particularly true, he said, of younger Black Americans, who feel \"it doesn't matter who gets elected, because nothing changes for them.\" Democratic politicians have come to the Black community and made really glorious promises that they haven't kept. Geoffrey Guns He pointed out that Norfolk, for example, is 40% Black and nearly a quarter of African Americans in the city live at or below the poverty line. \"So the question people ask is, what is a governor going to do for them?\" Guns noted. Guns said he put a version of the question to McAuliffe when he spoke at Second Calvary. \"I asked Terry McAuliffe what he was going to do with our public schools,\" which Guns called \"dilapidated.\" \" 'We're going to rebuild all of these schools,' \" Guns said of McAuliffe's response. \"I said, 'We'll see. We'll see.' Democratic politicians have come to the Black community and made really glorious promises that they haven't kept.\" Black voters have put white Democrats over the top in Virginia elections before. Consider that in 2013, McAuliffe lost the white vote by 20 points, according to exit polling. But he won more than 90% of Black voters. They made up 20% of the electorate and it was enough to help McAuliffe to a 3-point victory. For its part, the McAuliffe campaign says it is acutely aware of the importance of the Black, Latino and Asian American and Pacific Islander communities and has been focused on outreach to them from the outset of the campaign, both on the ground and over the airwaves. With early voting available on Sundays for the first time, McAuliffe has been in majority Black churches for most Sundays encouraging people to vote. He was in seven churches this past Sunday, his campaign said. \"This past weekend, we've been seeing a lot of enthusiasm,\" campaign spokesman Renzo Olivari said. \"As we're getting closer [to Election Day], we're seeing more and more voters realizing what's on the line in this election.\" Democratic state Delegate Mark Keam, the first Asian-born immigrant elected to a state-level office in Virginia, has been campaigning for McAuliffe \u2014 and for his own reelection. \"There's no secret here,\" Keam said, \"there is a little bit of an enthusiasm gap between our party and the other party.\" The AAPI community in Virginia is growing. Like Latinos, the Asian American population in the state has doubled in the last 20 years. But AAPI Virginians have also often been underrepresented at the polls. In the 2020 presidential election, for example, AAPI voters made up just 4% of Virginia voters despite being 7% of the state. And it's been far lower in statewide races. In 2013, they were just 1% of the electorate in the governor's race, and in 2017, just 3%. But like Aguilar, Keam is optimistic McAuliffe will win, in part because he sees engagement with the AAPI community as \"way higher\" than it was eight years ago when McAuliffe first ran. He noted that younger Asian Americans are becoming more involved and are far more progressive than their parents and grandparents. Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin speaks during a rally Tuesday in Stafford, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin speaks during a rally Tuesday in Stafford, Va. But he said he does see the Youngkin campaign's messaging on education and police working to an extent with older, non-native, English-speaking Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. \"Critical race theory for them [some older Asian Americans] is a dog whistle that Democrats only care about Blacks, not Asians,\" Keam said of the Youngkin campaign's focus on education, which seeks to capitalize on conservative energy around not allowing anti-racist curricula in schools. Keam believes the strategy \"goes hand in glove\" with the GOP's anti-affirmative action argument, which resonates with some Asian Americans, he said. The message, he said, is: \" 'Why line up with Blacks and Latinos? You are more independent, the 'model minority,' more like whites.' \" Democrats have had a lot of success in Virginia over the past two decades. They have won the state in four consecutive presidential elections and in four of the last five gubernatorial elections, won every single statewide race since 2009 and, in 2019, wrested control of the state legislature after decades of Republican rule. That political shift has, in part, been as a result of sweeping demographic change. Virginia, home to the onetime capital of the Confederacy, has gone from a white-dominated, culturally Southern state to a more diverse place that is now one of the most educated states in the country \u2014 and taking down Confederate statues. Loading... But there is no guarantee Democrats can keep their diverse coalition stitched together in a potentially low-turnout, off-year election in a gubernatorial race in which voters have historically sided with the party that doesn't control the White House. Because the Virginia governor's race comes a year after the presidential election, it's one of the first opportunities for supporters of the party out of power to register their frustration. That's a big reason why just once since 1977 has the president's party won this election. It just so happens McAuliffe is the man who broke that streak and is on the ballot again. But he won a narrow victory in 2013 against an unpopular culturally hard-line Republican in Ken Cuccinelli. His opponent this time, Youngkin, a wealthy former private equity executive, has been trying to present a softer side as a suburban dad and businessman. Democrats are trying hard to tie him to former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed Youngkin, though Youngkin has declined to campaign with him. Trump is the one selling point that seems to resonate across the Democratic base. Keam said that \"the world has changed since November 2016,\" arguing that Trump's rhetoric and policies were largely responsible for shifting many Asian Americans toward Democrats. For Latinos, \"An element of a ghost of Trump is still a big element of this race,\" Aguilar said. \"For the immigrant community, they do not forget the four years of the Trump administration and an administration that was hostile to the immigrant community.\" Geoffrey Guns, the pastor, noted that while Black voters aren't always thrilled with Democrats, \"the problem we have with Republicans is Republicans don't hide their anti-Blackness. More Blacks would be Republican if Republicans were really sincere and honest and weren't anti-Black. But they don't want Blacks to vote, they don't want Blacks to have a decent quality of life.\" He added, \"You should know this is going to be a very close race, and if Terry McAuliffe wins, it's going to be because a lot of Blacks really went out and voted.\"",

House Democratic leaders are pressing forward with President Biden's smaller plan for a domestic policy bill that sweeps up some of his top priorities. After months of infighting, and a stinging loss in Virginia's gubernatorial race, there is a new sense of urgency to show the party can deliver. But the revised bill faces hurdles in the Senate, where several Democrats say they have issues with the new version, and the process to get to a final deal is expected to drag out through the fall. Biden announced a $1.75 trillion framework last week \u2014 a scaled-back version of his initial $3.5 trillion \"Build Back Better\" plan. Democrats are using a budget process known as reconciliation to get around a GOP filibuster in the Senate, so they need all 50 senators who caucus with the Democrats on board with the framework.

Instead, Pelosi decided to add items that her members viewed as top priorities \u2014 even though it's unclear some of them will pass muster with Senate rules limiting what can be included in a budget measure and which Manchin has already said he opposes, including paid leave. Here's a snapshot of Biden's latest plan, with more details on the fate of major policy proposals below: Education and child care Climate Health care Prescription drugs Child care gets squeezed The expanded child tax credit that was enacted as part of this spring's coronavirus relief package has been credited with dropping child poverty rates. Democrats view it as a key policy achievement. Biden had hoped to extend it for four more years. The president's framework extends the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit for one year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier she preferred a permanent extension, but said \"it is called the Biden child tax credit. So if it's acceptable to him, in light of the bill, it's acceptable to me.\" Many Democrats believe the popularity of the policy and the immediate impact will make it tough for Republicans to roll it back if they take control of one or more chambers in the 2022 midterm elections. Universal pre-K programs are expected to remain in the proposal, and Pelosi linked them to the child care and family leave proposals as a comprehensive effort to support working parents, and as critical \"human infrastructure.\" Paid family leave was dropped from the president's framework because of opposition from Manchin. But Pelosi told reporters, \"We can afford it. It's universal. It's a compromise\" from the original 12 weeks many Democrats wanted. Other Democrats acknowledged it would likely be stripped out in the Senate, but because the provision was popular, many House Democrats wanted the opportunity to vote for it. Climate change provisions are scaled back The president had touted the Clean Energy Performance Program (CEPP), which provides incentives for utility companies to switch to greener technologies and fines those who don't, as the centerpiece of his climate agenda. He saw it as a tool that could achieve his goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. But the program has been dropped because Manchin, who represents a state heavily reliant on coal production, doesn't support it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed that concession, and insisted there are other ways to get to that goal. \"It isn't about a particular plan. It's about reaching our goals and how we do it. I feel very satisfied the path we're on to do that,\" she said recently. Biden, Pelosi and other congressional Democrats traveled to the COP26 climate change conference in Scotland around the time the framework was unveiled, so negotiators had to find various other proposals that Manchin can back \u2014 a mix of tax credits and other programs \u2014 and that can show world leaders the U.S. is making good on its climate goals. The White House is also discussing some administrative actions they can take that wouldn't require congressional approval. Some health care programs stay, but not all There are three main health care programs that Democrats say they intend to keep in a final deal: the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid. But as the number for the overall for the package shrank, the challenge became how to structure these plans. Pelosi, who steered the Affordable Care Act through the House and views it as a legacy issue for her, has pushed to make subsidies for the program permanent. But the scaled-back plan included an extension of these tax credits only through 2025. Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., proposed to expand Medicare to cover vision, hearing and dental procedures. The costs for all three could prove too expensive in this smaller package. Biden said it would be a \"reach\" to get all three. The president's framework includes coverage for hearing care, but not for dental or vision \u2014 something Sanders said was still concerning to him. The bill also expands Medicaid coverage, funds home care programs for those seniors who want to live independently. A slimmed down prescription drug proposal The White House and Democratic leaders announced a deal that will lower the cost of some prescription drugs for seniors. The plan would allow Medicare Part B and Part D programs to negotiate prices for specific medications directly with drug companies. It would also cap the out-of-pocket costs for seniors to $2,000 per year \u2014 significantly less than the current cap of $6,500 per year. The proposal penalizes drug companies that increase their prices at rates higher than inflation. This compromise was negotiated with a small group of Democrats opposed to a broader plan for Medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on the prices for prescription drugs. Immigration Democrats initially planned to include a pathway to citizenship for 8 million immigrants  in the reconciliation package, but the Senate parliamentarian, who determines what policies are permitted under the rules for the budget process, determined would not be allowed. Sen. Dick Durbin., D-Ill., also tried to craft a plan to expand an existing registry for immigrants to allow them to reside in the U.S., but that plan was also ruled out of order by the parliamentarian. House Democrats added provisions to their bill that gives work permits for those undocumented workers who have been in the U.S. since 2011. Their revised bill also includes making available work and family visas that have not been used yet. It also has resources to reduce the immigration backlog. But it is possible that these provisions will be stripped out in the Senate. Brings back the state and local tax deduction The 2017 Trump tax bill limited the deduction homeowners could deduct on their tax returns. House Democrats want to repeal the cap. The new maximum deduction on the so-called SALT limit would be $80,000 a year through 2030. The cap would return to $10,000 in 2031. Many progressives preferred this provision wasn't included and say it will end up helping the same wealthy Americans they campaigned were already not paying their fair share in taxes. But many House Democrats from New York and New Jersey, which has high housing costs, argued the elimination of the credit amounted to an unfair targeted tax that hit many families. This change was designed to secure the votes from lawmakers from states affected by the elimination of the deduction, but it is also likely to be changed in the Senate, where Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants to limit the deduction to those making below a certain income. Free community college gets cut The Democrats' original bill included a plan for two years of free community college, but it is one item that both progressives and moderates said was not going to make it into a final deal. The president noted to lawmakers that the proposal was a personal priority for the first lady, who still teaches at a community college in northern Virginia. But the idea was not able to get broad support in his meetings. Democrats do plan to include some funding for Pell grants and vocational programs in their reconciliation package. Corporate tax increases and tax on super rich offset costs Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., has expressed opposition to increases in corporate tax rates, one of the key ways Democrats want to pay for their domestic policy bill. Democrats are looking at alternatives.\n                \n                    \n                    Rod Lamkey/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., has expressed opposition to increases in corporate tax rates, one of the key ways Democrats want to pay for their domestic policy bill. Democrats are looking at alternatives. Democrats campaigned on rolling back the 2017 Trump tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy and planned to use the significant revenue from those tax changes to pay for this package, but Sinema opposed changes to rates and instead negotiated some new tax provisions that would still target new taxes on some ultra rich Americans and companies that have avoided paying large tax bills. The revised bill includes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a surtax on the ultra wealthy, and changes to international tax provisions. It also calls for stepped up efforts by the IRS to go after non-compliance b individuals and companies. Pelosi touted a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that shows that these tax increases raise almost $1.5 trillion over 10 years and argued that the prescription drug plan and plans to toughen IRS enforcement will cover the remaining cost of the bill. Leaders do not expect a final cost analysis from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office until later this month. Pelosi has little room to maneuver in the House with only a three-seat vote margin. After months of saying she wanted a deal with the White House and Senate Democrats, she reversed course and agreed to include some provisions that already are opposed by Manchin and potentially others. This means that even if the House reconciliation package is approved, it is all but certain to change in the Senate, and the House will have to vote on another version later this fall. President Biden urged Congress to move quickly to approve his agenda and the window for passing major legislation is traditionally the end of the year. Once 2022 begins and the focus intensifies on the midterm elections, it is tougher to pass any significant bills \u2014 and this proposal would be the largest domestic spending bill Congress has passed in decades. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters recently about the challenge in an evenly divided Senate, \"It's hard to keep 50 people together with different constituencies.\" Right now Brown is focused on another issue for the package: investments in public housing and help for first-time home buyers. \"It will greater supply of housing and more affordable housing.\" He said  the package will be \"the biggest investment\" n housing that will span urban, suburban and rural areas. Still, it's an example of why getting to an agreement on a final framework may be difficult. There are many issues Democrats want to see in this bill, while staying under $2 trillion.",

            "article_content": "World leaders gather in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. The president's immigration issues are multiplying at the border and in Washington. A new book is a speed tour of election year 2020.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Suppose you were a U.S. diplomat attending this week's session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. You'd have no shortage of things to do. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Do you focus on the U.S. role in the crisis in Afghanistan? Do you try to repair relations with France? The country recalled its ambassador after the U.S. cut France out of a submarine sale to Australia. Or do you just try to avoid getting COVID? U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield wants to make sure the meeting is not a superspreader event. LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD: I will get my COVID test at the COVID testing and vaccination van that will be set up outside the U.N. before I engage in meetings at U.N. headquarters. INSKEEP: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen will be covering this week's meeting. Michele, good morning. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: It sounds like this dispute with France is really just about money. They were cut out of an arms sale. But what more is at stake here? KELEMEN: I think more is at stake. You know, the Biden administration likes to say that America is back, that it cares about alliances, unlike the previous administration. But this dispute really undercuts that whole message, Steve. You know, the U.S. announced a partnership with the U.K. and Australia and left France totally in the dark. France lost out on a multibillion-dollar submarine deal with Australia, which is now purchasing nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. And I spoke over the weekend to a former French ambassador to the U.S., Gerard Araud, and he says it's not just about losing an arms deal. It raises a lot of questions about U.S. attitudes toward Europe. Take a listen. GERARD ARAUD: Basically, the U.S. - and it's not Biden. It's not Trump. But the U.S. basically don't care about Europe. KELEMEN: What the U.S. does care about is countering China. It wants partners in that effort. So I think the Biden administration really has some cleanup to do here. INSKEEP: How is President Biden himself likely to address such matters when he speaks on Tuesday? KELEMEN: Yeah. Well, you know, he will probably talk about China in his speech. Or at least he'll talk about upholding the rules-based international order. That's kind of diplomatic speak for countering China because the U.S. wants China to uphold the rules that others do. He'll also talk about, you know, a return to multilateralism. He's going to chair a meeting on COVID-19 on Wednesday. That summit's going to be virtual. And that's going to be an issue that really resonates more with the people attending the U.N. General Assembly because, you know, some countries in Africa have less than 2% vaccination rates. So a big topic of that summit is going to be this uneven global distribution of vaccines. INSKEEP: I guess it's appropriate that a meeting on COVID would be virtual. And we heard about the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. saying she's going to be getting her COVID tests. How else is the U.N. managing this gathering? KELEMEN: Well, you know, a lot of it is going to be in this weird hybrid mode. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going to stay longer. He is going to have some meetings in person, and he has a lot to discuss. There's going to be things like meetings about Afghanistan, though no talks with Afghanistan's new rulers 'cause the Taliban aren't coming. There are going to be talks on Iran because Iran's new foreign minister is making his U.N. debut. So there's going to be a lot of discussions on the sidelines but maybe a little bit more online. INSKEEP: Michele, thanks so much. KELEMEN: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Michele Kelemen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Apparently, President Biden cannot cram quite so much of his agenda into a single bill in Congress. MARTIN: The president has been trying to do just that. Senators have one shot this fall, one bill they can pass without Republican support. It's a budget measure exempt from normal filibuster rules, and that's why Democrats have been trying to cram in provisions addressing everything from climate to taxes to immigration. Last night, though, the Senate parliamentarian, who is a referee of Senate rules, said immigration changes do not belong in there. INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration and is on the line. Joel, good morning. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: What does this ruling say? ROSE: Well, so Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian - you know, it's her job to interpret the Senate's own rules and to decide what can be part of budget reconciliation. And in this case, she said, no. Immigration amounts to a major policy shift. These changes that congressional Democrats wanted to see - she decided that they're a major policy change, one that has relatively little to do with the budget and therefore cannot be included in budget reconciliation. INSKEEP: So what does that mean? ROSE: Well, it's a serious blow to Democrats' hopes of getting an immigration overhaul done. They were hoping to create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, including so-called DREAMers but also farm workers and other essential workers. And reconciliation would have allowed Democrats to pass that without any Republican votes in the Senate. Without budget reconciliation, the Democrats can't get around a Republican filibuster. The Democrats and their allies say they're disappointed, but they were not really surprised. Senators including Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin say they have alternative proposals that they will try to present to the parliamentarian to change her mind. INSKEEP: Well, we'll see where that goes. Of course, that's all about long-term policy changes, efforts to change what the immigration system looks like in two years or 10 years or even 20 years. But at the same time, we've got another immediate crisis at the border, certainly one that looks like a crisis - images that I've been seeing on social media of a giant crowd of people at the border in Del Rio, Texas. What's going on? ROSE: You're right. There are still more than 10,000 migrants, many of them originally from Haiti, camped out in squalid conditions under the International Bridge in Del Rio, Texas. They crossed the Rio Grande into Texas and had been waiting on the U.S. side, hoping for a chance to ask for asylum. Yesterday, the Biden administration began putting some of them on planes and flying them out of the U.S. Here is Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz speaking to reporters yesterday in Del Rio. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAUL ORTIZ: We are working around the clock to expeditiously move migrants out of the heat, elements and from underneath this bridge in order to quickly process and remove individuals from the United States, consistent with our laws and our policies. ROSE: Ortiz said immigration authorities have removed about 3,000 people from this makeshift camp already. The Department of Homeland Security says just over 300 have already been expelled on removal flights to Haiti. And Ortiz laid out a pretty aggressive timeline, hoping to get all of the remaining migrants out of Del Rio within a week. INSKEEP: You just said migrants from Haiti. How did they end up there? ROSE: This is a great question. Many are originally from Haiti but had been living in South America. Some say they're trying to cross in Del Rio because that area is safer than other parts of the border. And they're hoping to start a better life in the U.S. The Biden administration is responding by publicly trying to deter these migrants from crossing the border. The message to would-be migrants is we will quickly expel you under Title 42. That is a public health order that was put in place by the Trump administration that gives immigration authorities a lot of power to expel migrants. But Title 42 infuriates immigrant rights advocates. They say it's illegal and particularly cruel to invoke it against these migrants in Del Rio, when Haiti is still reeling from a major earthquake and a recent assassination of its president. INSKEEP: Joel, thanks so much. ROSE: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The latest book about the Trump presidency, co-authored by Bob Woodward, is a speed tour of the election year 2020. MARTIN: It's called \"Peril.\" And it examines the transition period between presidencies when Trump refused to concede and mounted challenge after challenge to try and overturn the election results. The book also digs into President Biden's first months in office and how his decades in politics and his personal experiences inform his leadership. INSKEEP: Woodward co-authored this book with Robert Costa, a colleague in The Washington Post. NPR's Ron Elving has been reading the book, called \"Peril.\" Ron, good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Steve. INSKEEP: What do you learn? ELVING: One big theme is the contrast between the personalities. Trump is the sun in his own solar system, the most compelling figure in national politics and unforgiving of all who fail to please him. Biden is largely his antithesis in this book - collegial, eager to accommodate, a natural negotiator. Trump seems to be entirely free of empathy. Biden, it seems at times, may have too much. INSKEEP: And you're emphasizing for us this is about the transition. So it becomes about both presidents, one who's on his way out, the other who's on his way in. What do you learn about these moments that were so tense at the time? ELVING: The heart-stopping drama of January 6 is what really sticks out, the day of the riot that breached the Capitol and threatened the members of Congress. The authors here take us through that day both within the White House and among the terrified office holders evacuating the Capitol, including Vice President Mike Pence, who did what a constellation of conservative legal stars told him he had to do, certifying the results, and then heard the rioters chanting, hang Mike Pence. INSKEEP: And, of course, Pence was one of the officials who appeared to be trying to preserve the constitutional order. There's been a lot of news made in the past week. We've already discussed on NPR the news about General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was making phone calls to China and elsewhere, trying to reassure everyone that the U.S. was stable. But there's another set of people to ask about, and those are Republicans around President Trump, whether they were pushing back against him or, in some ways, enabling or accommodating him. And a lot of those Republicans are still on the scene. What is suggested in this book about the future of the Republican Party, which rests with a lot of those Republicans, Ron? ELVING: Clearly, it means that every Republican official or candidate has to reckon with Trump and the grip that he has on so many Republican voters and donors. That will be a threshold issue in the 2022 midterm elections, when Trump will not be on the ballot but will almost certainly be on everyone's mind. INSKEEP: Huh. One other thing I want to ask about - I believe I saw the other day that Bob Woodward marked his 50th year at The Washington Post. He's got a co-author who's a good deal younger but very well-sourced himself. Is he passing the torch? ELVING: Right now, it's just great teamwork and a remarkable access team, but all torches must eventually be passed. And the brighter the torch, the more important the passing. We may be seeing the start of that process here. INSKEEP: Ron, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

            "article_content": "Dr. Leana Wen is in favor of COVID-19 vaccine mandates. \"I don't think that people should have the choice to infect others with a potentially fatal and extremely contagious virus,\" she says. Wen is pictured above in the emergency department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on Aug. 14, 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Steven Senne/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Leana Wen is in favor of COVID-19 vaccine mandates. \"I don't think that people should have the choice to infect others with a potentially fatal and extremely contagious virus,\" she says. Wen is pictured above in the emergency department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on Aug. 14, 2012. Dr. Leana Wen advises that you should think of your COVID-19 vaccine like a very good raincoat: If it's drizzling or you're in a rainstorm? You're well-protected. \"But if you're going in and out of thunderstorms every single day and now there's a hurricane \u2014 at some point you're going to get wet,\" she says. That's one of the reasons why Wen, an emergency medical doctor and former health commissioner of Baltimore, believes the CDC ended masking requirements too abruptly and prematurely in May \u2013 especially now that the highly transmissible delta variant is so prevalent in the U.S. She and other public health experts have urged the CDC to revisit their guidance \u2014 which the agency is expected to do on Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, we're in a situation now where the vaccinated are having to pay the price for the actions of the unvaccinated ... \" she says. Though it's very, very rare for vaccinated people to get seriously ill with COVID-19, breakthrough infections are occurring, she says, \"not because the vaccines aren't effective, but rather because of the high levels of unvaccinated and infected people who are surrounding us.\" Wen serves as a medical analyst for CNN and a contributing columnist for The Washington Post. In her new memoir, Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health, she describes the remarkable path that led to her current career. Wen spent the first few years of her life in Shanghai. During the Cultural Revolution, her father spent time in prison for his work as a dissident. When she was nearly eight, she and her father came to the U.S. to join her mother, who had moved to Utah on a visa to attend grad school. Her father was able to obtain political asylum in the U.S., but the family had little money and Wen had bad asthma. The family's reliance on Medicaid and the public health care system inspired her to pursue a career in emergency medicine and public health. Today, she has voiced concerns about the way the CDC and the Biden administration have handled coronavirus communications with the public. \"Public health depends on public trust, \"she says. \"Public health depends on winning over hearts and minds. It's not enough to just have a good policy, you have to convince people to actually follow it.\" Wen believes that most people who have not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine are not completely opposed to vaccines \u2014 they are just people who are more concerned about the vaccine than the virus. But vaccine mandates have worked in the past, she says \u2014 just look at childhood immunizations and mandatory flu shots for health care workers \u2014 and the same approach can work for COVID. \"We really need to be talking about the COVID vaccine the same way that we talk about other vaccinations \u2014 which is that it's safe, effective, life-saving and essential for the public's health.\" On the CDC lifting the mask mandate in May The CDC was relying on an honor system at a time when many people, unfortunately, were not behaving in the most honorable way. It was a mistake for them to lift their guidance in May. ... Many of us in public health were very concerned because the CDC was relying on an honor system at a time when many people, unfortunately, were not behaving in the most honorable way. ... When that guidance was first issued, only 36% of the country was fully vaccinated. And we're actually now seeing the consequence, which is that the unvaccinated began behaving as if they were vaccinated, and we are now seeing massive surges again across the country... On her hope that the Biden administration will implement vaccine mandates I don't think that people should have the choice to infect others with a potentially fatal and extremely contagious virus. I hope that the Biden administration at this point really gets behind vaccine mandates, because we need to acknowledge that what we're doing thus far just isn't working. I don't think that people should have the choice to infect others with a potentially fatal and extremely contagious virus. And I think we, as a society, need to figure out, what are our values? [Does] the value of freedom of choice for some really override the public's health for the most vulnerable?  ... The Biden administration can do a lot when it comes to signaling. For example, they just said yesterday that employees of the V.A. now need to be vaccinated within the next eight weeks. That's a really important signal for all health care institutions and nursing homes. I think the administration can go even further and say all federal employees will need to be vaccinated. And also that if you go on planes, trains in federal buildings, that you either have to show proof of vaccination or you have to have a recent negative test, something like that will also pave the way for private institutions, including businesses and many more schools and universities, to implement that type of health screening as well. On how safe you are in an environment where everyone is vaccinated If everyone around you is fully vaccinated, the chance of them carrying enough virus to infect you is very low. If you're also then fully vaccinated, your chance of contracting COVID from one of these individuals is very low. ... If everyone around you is fully vaccinated, then you do not need masks or distancing in that circumstance. But I also think that there is this narrative that is not true \u2014 and actually quite harmful \u2014 that once you are vaccinated, who cares if others around you are vaccinated, too? That's just not true. We know that these vaccines are not 100%. We don't know exactly how well they protect against symptomatic illness ... but let's say that it's 90%, which again, is very good, but it's still not 100%. The more risk you're exposed to, the higher likelihood you have of contracting COVID-19. ... It really matters whether others around you are also vaccinated. On children returning to school in the fall Schools can be some of the safest places for children from a COVID-19 transmission standpoint if mitigation measures are followed. ... Indoor masking is absolutely critical, improving ventilation as much as possible, and also having regular testing \u2014 I do think that it's possible for schools to come back safely in person. But these measures have to be in place. ... There are at least eight states and counting that have actually forbidden schools from mandating masks. That's a really substantial problem. And I hope that parents in those circumstances will still choose to ask for their children to be masked as much as possible to protect them and others around them. On the anti-Asian hate and discrimination she's experienced Every time I am on air, I will receive actually quite a few messages that specifically tie me to the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 which is ludicrous because my family left on political asylum from China \u2014 or that will blame me and \"my people\" for the coronavirus. And of course, there are many, many messages telling me to go back to my own country. ... There are so many Asian American people who have suffered during this pandemic. There are shop owners who have had their shops burned down or graffitied ... by people directly attributing the coronavirus to them. There are people who have been assaulted \u2014 nurses, physicians who have been spat upon and assaulted, leaving the hospital by individuals who are, again, attributing the coronavirus to them. On a formative medical emergency experience when she was young There was a neighbor child who was just a couple of years younger than me who also had asthma, and he had a very bad asthma attack, and I remember rushing to help him because his grandmother was screaming for help and I knew what to do for asthma. ... His grandmother was too afraid to call for help, and actually, because we didn't get help for him in time, he died. He died in front of me due to this entirely preventable cause. ... This image is seared on my mind because I kept on thinking: This did not have to happen. His grandmother was just too afraid to call for help because they were undocumented immigrants and she was afraid of the authorities coming in, their family being deported. And I thought at that time \u2014 and I remember having a discussion with my mother about this afterwards \u2014 that we're in a society where people's lives are valued differently, depending on where they come from and whether they have the money to pay for care. On how caring for her mother, who had cancer, informs her approach to medicine One of my longtime mentors is the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, who used to say ... that your pain is what fuels your passion, that then becomes your purpose. And for me, in dealing with my mother's illness ... I was her caregiver for eight years ... I was a medical student when she was diagnosed and a resident when she died. And having gone through that, I also saw so much of the disconnect that's happening in our medical system. ... So I entered this field, of patient and family advocacy from the perspective of being a clinician, but also being a patient and a family member as well.

            "article_content": "\"Smart.\" \"Hard-working.\" \"Nice.\" Those were among the adjectives that respondents offered up in a recent poll when asked to describe Asian Americans. The poll, conducted by the nonprofit Leading Asian Americans to Unite for Change (LAAUNCH), was another all-too-familiar reminder that Asian Americans are still perceived as the \"model minority.\" Since the end of World War II, this myth about Asian Americans and their perceived collective success has been used as a racial wedge \u2014 to minimize the role racism plays in the struggles of other minority groups, such as Black Americans. Characterizing Asian Americans as a model minority flattens the diverse experiences of Asian Americans into a singular, narrow narrative. And it paints a misleading picture about the community that doesn't align with current statistics. Here's a look at some common misconceptions driven by the model minority myth. Currently, more than 22 million people of Asian descent live in the U.S., making up approximately 7% of the nation's population. They trace their heritage to different regions around the world, with people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent making up the largest shares, though no group makes up a majority. More than 1.5 million Pacific Islanders, who descend from Micronesia, Melanesia or Polynesia, live in the U.S. as well. Loading... Academics and activists trace the term \"Asian American\" to 1968, when students at the University of California, Berkeley, founded the Asian American Political Alliance. At the time, the group sought to unite students of Japanese, Chinese and Filipino descent to fight for political and social recognition. \"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\" (AAPI) is a term that has its roots in the 1980s and '90s, when the U.S. Census Bureau used the \"Asian Pacific American\" classification to group Asians, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders together. In 1997, the bureau disaggregated the categories into \"Asian\" and \"Pacific Islander.\" Scholars and activists have critiqued both terms for masking differences in histories and needs among communities, as well as supporting the myth that Asian Americans are a monolithic group. Within these regional groups, a huge variety of ethnicities exist within the Asian American community. People who identify their heritage as Chinese, Indian or Filipino make up the largest share. Loading... These numbers have risen rapidly in recent years. The Asian American population is the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the U.S., growing by 81% from 2000 to 2019. The Hispanic population saw the second-fastest growth, at 70%, followed by Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, at 60%. The white population grew by only 1% in that time. Asian Americans have a median household income of around $78,000 a year, which is higher than the national median of about $66,000. However, that overall statistic obscures large differences among different Asian-origin groups. These economic disparities are partially driven by similar disparities in education levels among Asian Americans. The highest-earning groups \u2014 Indian American and Taiwanese American households \u2014 also have the highest levels of education, while the lowest-earning groups have comparatively lower levels of education. Loading... Indian American households are the highest-earning group, with a median household income of $127,000 a year. On the other end of the scale, Burmese American households are the lowest-earning group, with a median household income of $46,000 a year. In fact, a 2018 Pew Research Center study found that Asian Americans were the most economically divided racial or ethnic group in the U.S., with Asian Americans in the top 10th of the income distribution making 10.7 times more than those in the bottom 10th. More than half of those who identify as Asian American and at least 17% of Pacific Islanders were born outside the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Asian American community has the highest proportion of immigrants of any ethnic or racial group in the United States. Yet, Asian Americans are often overlooked in debates about immigration reform. Asians have a wide range of reasons for immigrating to the U.S., including those coming as refugees or asylum-seekers. Out of the almost 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants in the U.S., around 1.5 million (14%) are from Asia, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Loading... Heightened immigration enforcement has also impacted Asian Americans. From 2015 to 2018, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested about 15,000 immigrants from Asia, according to a report by the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice. The report also found that Southeast Asian immigrants were three to four times more likely to be deported for old criminal convictions compared with other immigrant groups. Out of the approximately 16,000 Southeast Asians with final removal orders in that period, more than 13,000 had removal orders that were based on old criminal convictions. Since the coronavirus pandemic started, hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans have increased. In an April survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 32% of Asian American adults \u2014 a greater percentage than any other racial or ethnic group \u2014 said that they feared someone might threaten or physically attack them. Loading... In response, the House of Representatives passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act on May 18. The bill would have the Justice Department appoint a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19. It would also direct resources toward making the reporting of hate crimes more accessible. Despite increased news coverage of various attacks against Asian Americans and the upcoming legislation, the LAAUNCH survey, which was conducted between March 29 to April 14, found that 37% of white Americans were not aware of increased incidents of hate crimes. But anti-Asian bias and discrimination are not new to the pandemic. To understand the current climate, it's important to look at historical context. In past periods of national tension, especially during times when the U.S. has been at war with Asian countries, anti-Asian racism has similarly risen. The recent LAAUNCH survey also found that almost half of Americans incorrectly believe that Asian Americans are overrepresented or fairly represented in senior positions within American companies, politics, media or other realms. In reality, Asian Americans are underrepresented in these positions of power, holding about 3% of these positions in comparison with composing 7% of the U.S. population, a report from The New York Times found last year. More specifically, Asian Americans have the lowest degree of representation in political office compared with any other racial or ethnic group. Loading... Asian Americans are even underrepresented in states with a high concentration of Asian American residents, like New York and California, according to a report by the Reflective Democracy Campaign. Especially since the start of collective activism among Asian Americans in the 1960s, Asian Americans have had a rich history of political activism and involvement. But that history has not always translated to greater representation in political leadership. One finding in the LAAUNCH survey may point to answers: 92% of Americans polled said they were comfortable with Asian Americans as doctors or friends, but only 85% said they were comfortable with an Asian American as a boss and 73% as a president of the United States. Despite these perceptions, Asian Americans are pushing forward. Asian Americans increased their voter turnout rate by more than any other racial or ethnic group in the 2020 election and in part helped Joe Biden win Georgia. In that same year, 158 Asian Americans ran for state legislatures, the highest number since the 2018 midterms.",

To mark this milestone, we're reflecting on and renewing our commitment to Hear Every Voice.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Gabor\n                    \n                \nhide caption On May 3, 2021, NPR turns 50 years old. To mark this milestone, we're reflecting on and renewing our commitment to Hear Every Voice. It's been a turbulent time, with a deadly pandemic and a chaotic \u2014 sometimes violent \u2014 political climate. In the midst of all this, NPR is marking a milestone; on May 3, 2021, the network turns 50 years old. On the same day, in 1971, we started holding up our microphone to America. Just outside our doors, on the streets of Washington, DC, one of the biggest antiwar protests in American history was taking place. NPR's story is that of a ragtag network \u2014 born in the era of the Vietnam War and Watergate \u2014 one that came of age during the explosion of the 24/7 news cycle. In the 50 years that NPR has been around, the news and journalism have changed. The network has been shaped by its talented reporters, producers and hosts. NPR has also had to reckon with the ways it has not lived up to its mission of diversity and inclusion, a mission it continues to strive for today. But, as stories go, NPR's is quite a memorable one. NPR's beginning was improbable. The network barely made it on air. Linda Wertheimer, who directed the first broadcast of All Things Considered, thought they would never survive another week. Given the chaotic nature of that first day, her sense of NPR's future was grim. \"[It] was just going to be beyond awful,\" Wertheimer says. But from the start, NPR's blueprint was infused with the chance to do something different, something extraordinary. \"We were creating it from scratch. There was no template for it,\" says Susan Stamberg, NPR's Founding Mother. Susan Stamberg\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Susan Stamberg To understand the media world from which NPR sprang, you need to look at what was going on \u2014 not in radio, but on television, in the late 1960s. At the time, concern that public television was not adequately serving the public was growing. In a now famous speech before the National Association of Broadcasters, FCC Chair Newt Minow challenged broadcasters to do better: \"I invite you to sit down at your television set when your station goes on the air, and stay there for a day,\" he says. \"Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that what you will observe is a vast wasteland.\" Minow and others felt that the public was not receiving the benefits that the airways owned. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson articulated the mission of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit corporation funded by American taxpayers. Originally named the Public Television Act, the bill's purpose was to fix TV's problems. Radio wasn't even on the docket; in fact, the words \"And radio\" were taped on \u2014 literally \u2014 at the last minute. According to On the Media host Brooke Gladstone, there wasn't much, if any, news happening in radio. \"NPR was able to walk into an open field and start playing,\" she said. \"That was one of the reasons it was able to set the rules of the game, the sound of the air.\" NPR's sound was an open question: What would it be? Who would they sound like? Bill Siemering, NPR's first director of programming, recognized the lack of structure as something exciting. \"I remember, maybe at the first staff program \u2014 staff meeting \u2014 I said 'We have a blank canvas here, and there'll be thousands of brush strokes on this,' \" Siemering recalls. \" 'But the very first brush strokes that we put on this are very important because that will set a tone and value.' \" Siemering remembers being aspirational, offering a few core values for the network to follow, as he wrote the first paragraph of what would become NPR's mission statement: National Public Radio will serve the individual. It will promote personal growth. It will regard individual differences with respect and joy rather than derision and hate. It will celebrate the human experience as infinitely varied rather than vacuous and banal. It will encourage a sense of active, constructive participation, rather than apathetic helplessness. NPR's mission statement has worked its way into the network's DNA. Even today, many staff members can recite parts of it, and a newer version is displayed in large letters on the wall of NPR's lobby. Few things represent NPR's growth more than our headquarters in Washington, DC. It stands seven stories high, almost a city block long. The day's headlines scroll across the building on a giant, black news ticker; you can see them from across town. When you walk in, the lobby is a sleek, cavernous space. You'll notice right away that there's a timeline of our history, how the network grew from a staff of just 65 people, to what is now a thriving news network with over 1,000 employees around the country and the world. Radio is the medium that launched us, and to this day, our success still comes back to the singular, human voice in your ear. So, it's fitting that when you visit the newsroom, Susan Stamberg's voice escorts you upstairs. Stamberg helped shape the sound of NPR as the first woman to anchor a national nightly news program. \"When I went on, there were no role models. There were no women doing this. All there were \u2014 were men,\" Stamberg recalls. \"So, I started lowering my voice and talking like this. And that really wasn't washing very well, and I couldn't keep it up for an hour and a half which was as long as the program was.\" Bill Siemering, who hired Stamberg, had a conversation with her that changed the way she spoke on air. \"He said, 'Be yourself.' And that was like, such a gift. I didn't have to be ... that man-sounding voice,\" Stamberg recalls. \"I could just speak as I spoke in real life, just like this ... It was what he heard. It was the voice he heard in his head, and he found it in me.\" Renee Chaney, visitor Louisa Parker, Linda Wertheimer and Kris Mortensen, in the first All Things Considered studio, 1972.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Not everyone embraced Stamberg's voice right away. Jack Mitchell remembers that certain board members in the midwest felt that she was \"too New York.\" What it came down to was Siemering, who heard the sound he wanted for NPR in Stamberg's voice. Her voice was \" ... curious, authentic, [and had a] rich tone color, and just this insatiable curiosity that kind of bubbles over.\" Hers wasn't the only voice to define the NPR sound \u2014 Cokie Roberts would become a legendary congressional and political reporter; Linda Wertheimer, a longtime host of All Things Considered. Finally, Nina Totenberg, who defines our Supreme Court coverage. Nina, Linda, Cokie, and Susan: a roster of female talent affectionately referred to as \"The Founding Mothers.\" NPR was still nascent when Ira Glass \u2014 a young intern who had never heard of NPR \u2014 arrived in 1978. \"And I'm going to say this, and it doesn't sound like it's true, but it's totally true,\" Glass says. \"NPR didn't get a satellite till 1980.\" Glass explains that if you were listening to NPR in Los Angeles, what it sounded like was if \"somebody in Washington was listening to All Things Considered on the radio, and they were holding their phone up to the radio.\" The arrival of the satellite coincided with the launch of Morning Edition, which debuted in 1979. The show was almost cancelled before it even started. \"It was absolutely a disaster,\" former Morning Edition host Bob Edwards said. Jay Kernis, a former producer who helped get the program off the ground, agrees: \"There were many pilots. They were all pretty bad.\" Edwards took leave from All Things Considered and a week later, Morning Edition went on air. NPR continued to expand. In 1979, the network opened its first foreign bureau, sending Robert Siegel to London. Slowly, the network was able to hire new correspondents and freelancers stationed around the globe. Now, NPR has 17 official foreign bureaus and numerous stringers providing coverage around the world. \"I mean, when I first came [to NPR],\" Siegel says. \"We were a little spice in the public radio system.\" Decades on, NPR has become an institution \u2014 in some regards, a cliche \u2014 the subject of jokes, Siegel suggests. By the time Michele Norris arrived in 2002 to host All Things Considered, which she did for nearly a decade, she remembers \"NPR ... as the gold standard in journalism [due to] their, their foreign coverage, political coverage, their depth, and the pristine sound.\" Yet NPR has had to reckon with many of the ways it still needs to change. \"I will admit that for a time as a journalist, I did not want to cover the race beat.\" Norris said. \"As a person of color. I always covered matters of race, perhaps more than my white colleagues did, because that's what happens in a newsroom.\" Norris says that her views changed when she became a host. Part of the issue comes down to who NPR thinks its audience is. \"I think there was a false perception that NPR had a Chardonnay-drinking, Volvo-driving, fuzzy sweater wearing, Birkenstock-walking audience. Our audience was much more diverse than that,\" Norris says. \"I knew that when I went out in the world. I knew that from the listeners that I heard from. Our job is to hold a mirror up to the world.\" 50 years later, we fill a digital space that goes beyond the wildest dreams of our founders. \"I've never thought of it as something that was exclusively radio,\" NPR's Vice President of Programming, Anya Grundmann, says. \"It's about creating experiences that will enhance people's lives.\" NPR serves on every platform imaginable. Every week, 60 million people consume some form of NPR across a full range of experiences, including radio, smart speakers, NPR.org, video streaming, live events, mobile apps \u2014 and of course, podcasts. NPR has been one of the top publishers in the US since podcasting began. In fact, in January of 2000, NPR created an online show that didn't exist on the radio at all: All Songs Considered \u2014 our first podcast before the term even existed. Today, NPR publishes more than a dozen of them every week and partners with stations and independent producers as well. In fact, one-third of all daily podcast listening is attributed to NPR and our public radio partners. NPR continues adding podcasts at a fast clip, thinking about whose stories matter. Code Switch, one about race and identity, is a good example of this. Shereen Marisol Meraji, one of the show's co-hosts, shares the story she's most proud of telling \u2014 one that got listeners to think more deeply about a statistic: \"16 million people live in a household where one or more of the people in [their] household is undocumented.\" For this story, Meraji reported on a family of three siblings: one who was was a citizen, one who was completely undocumented, and one who had DACA \u2014 which granted her temporary relief from deportation. Meraji asked the siblings what it was like to live together, knowing that their futures looked very different. \"And I think that that's what we do so well at Code Switch,\" Meraji says. \"... We will take a faceless statistic, and we will make it real and human for our listeners.\" Last year, Code Switch was named Apple Podcasts' first-ever \"Show of the Year\" in the US. Another NPR innovation that surprised even the people who invented it was the Tiny Desk Concert. It started with NPR Music's Bob Boilen and Stephen Thompson taking an annual trip to music festival South by Southwest, where they often come across emerging musical talent. As Boilen tells it, he and Thompson went to see the artist Laura Gibson perform at a noisy bar. \"We introduced ourselves to Laura, and Stephen jokingly said to her, 'We couldn't hear you. You ought to just come play a private concert in our office,' \" he recalls. \"All three of us laughed. And before we knew it, three weeks later, she came to NPR ... And I put her behind my desk with a microphone and a couple of cameras and took it home and edited it, put it up online.\" Lizzo plays a Tiny Desk Concert on May 21, 2019 (Claire Harbage/NPR).\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lizzo plays a Tiny Desk Concert on May 21, 2019 (Claire Harbage/NPR). No one at NPR music imagined that this chance meeting would, in time, produce the phenomenon known as the Tiny Desk, a video series that features musicians performing short 15-minute concerts. It would eventually become NPR's biggest digital program. Another turning point was rapper T-Pain's performance who played, for the first time in public, without autotune. The concert went viral; within a few days, 7 million people had watched it. Soon, the Tiny Desk series was featuring a wide range of musical genres on a regular basis. Just last year, the Tiny Desk series had nearly a half a billion views on youtube. Across the audio landscape, there's been an explosion in creativity, especially in storytelling \u2014 much of it sharing our DNA. Take Ira Glass, for instance, who started his career as an intern at NPR. 17 years later, after learning the ropes as a producer, reporter and sometimes host, Glass came up with the idea for a show that would feature a new kind of storytelling. Naturally, he turned to NPR to see if they would distribute it. \"NPR just did not want to pick up the show,\" Glass recalls. \"The management, they just didn't like it. They didn't get ... even, that it was journalism.\" But Glass doesn't necessarily see NPR's rejection of what would become This American Life as a missed opportunity: \"In the end, I feel like that's one of those things that just doesn't matter at all. We were on all the same stations. We reached all the same audience, you know what I mean?\" This American Life took off in spectacular fashion and remains one of the most popular shows today. It has what could be described as a kind of \"public radio style\" \u2014 conversational, low-key, intimate. The creativity of the show rippled out and helped shape some of the podcasts that would come to define NPR, like Planet Money and Invisibilia. This American Life made more than a splash even though NPR didn't see anything in it at first. Glass attributes this to the unique public radio format in the United States. \"There's no big boss at the top who decides what all the stations should run, and there's a radical decentralization in public broadcasting,\" he says. \"And that has made for a lot of creativity and openness than would otherwise happen.\" The decentralized network has been there from the beginning; it exists as NPR's member stations. \"I think one of the best parts of public radio, its secret sauce, if you will, is its member station network,\" Emily Kwong says. \"They are the eyes and the ears of their community.\" Kwong, who works at NPR's Science Desk, says no other station embodies that better than where she got her start \u2014 KCAW, known by locals in Sitka, Alaska, as Raven radio. \"Working in a tiny town, I didn't know if a big story would ever come our way, one that would necessarily result in the airing on NPR,\" Kwong says. \"Until January 2018. A 7.9 [magnitude] earthquake had struck off the coast of Alaska in the middle of the night, and it prompted a tsunami warning for the entire state of Alaska and parts of Canada.\" Kwong remembers crawling out of her bed, bleary eyed, thinking, \"I have to start doing my job, which is to report the local news.\" As part of her job, Kwong spoke to Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. The wave thankfully never came, but the conversation helped her appreciate the relationship between NPR and its member stations. \"The level of caring and concern in [Martin's] voice \u2014 knowing that there were eyes on Sitka, that people outside of Sitka were paying attention to us and that kind of connection is something I won't forget,\" she says. \"And it made NPR real to me. It made it a place I knew I can call up and share the news of what was happening in my area and share that with the country because that's how it's structured to be.\" Kwong now works at headquarters in Washington, DC as a reporter for NPR's Science Podcast, Short Wave. \"What it really is, is a show that's looking at science from a lens of equity,\" she explains. Kwong believes that NPR is in a unique position to help listeners have a deeper understanding of America \"because we have [the platform, the power, the ability] and the time to research all of this, and interview people who understand it.\" Having power and a platform means we can experiment with new shows and ask the kind of questions that give us a deeper understanding of America. NPR Music's Louder Than a Riot looks at the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. \"With Louder than a Riot, we really wanted to tell the story that we've lived,\" co-host Rodney Carmichael says. \"You know, as two people from the hip-hop culture, of the hip-hop culture, who've been fans of it, you know, from day one. And we knew that there was a story there, that there were voices there, that you have never heard on NPR.\" Co-host Sidney Madden agrees, noting that \"it is very serendipitous that the rollout of this show came on the [dovetails] of the summer we just lived through in 2020\" \u2014 referring to the protests for racial justice, after the death of George Floyd. \"But at the same time, the whole point of the show is that hip-hop has been saying it for 40 years,\" Madden says. \"And so many people didn't listen and they just casually consume it, but don't consider the deeper meaning ... between the lines and between the lyrics.\" Carmichael says that he would love to see NPR get to the point where it's not just creating specialty shows to go after a certain kind of audience. \"We need to be, in all of our main broadcast shows, telling the kind of stories that we feel like aren't being heard or told enough on the [other] bigger outlets.\" Madden agrees. \"It's like, don't wait to play, catch up on something you know you can be a leader in. [NPR has] the talent, the resources and the drive and the vision to do it,\" she says. Carmichael suggests that we shouldn't have to wait another 40 years to tell the story of what's happening this year. \"Let's start telling those stories right now.\" Right now and for the years to come, we'll continue to ask ourselves what we can do better, where we can improve and how we can innovate. NPR has worked for 50 years to get it right: to Hear Every Voice and to connect with you \u2014 and we're grateful for the chance to do it all again. In the words of Susan Stamberg: \"Hang on to that sense of mission and the idealism with which we began. We're hurtling towards the next phase. We have passed through it and there's gonna be something beyond that, too.\"",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined by Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., left, has argued that President Biden is not governing like the moderate he campaigned as in 2020. Congressional Republicans are painting President Biden as captive to the progressive wing of his party despite the popularity of his major initiatives in his first 100 days in office. GOP leaders, and those thinking about running to replace Biden in 2024, are seizing on the crisis at the border and policies they deem \"far left\" included in the president's massive infrastructure proposal as pivoting the country down a dangerous path. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday described the president's first 100 days as the \"Biden bait and switch,\" saying as a candidate Biden ran as a moderate, \"but I'm hard-pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation.\" The response to the coronavirus pandemic has defined Biden's early months in office, and no GOP lawmaker voted for the $1.9 trillion rescue package that stands as his major legislative accomplishment to date. While many Republicans backed elements of the relief bill, they opposed the size and scope of the effort. And they maintain his subsequent multitrillion-dollar jobs and infrastructure proposals will harm the economy, and they've shown little sign of finding any middle ground on the issue. Democrats say Biden is just following through on his campaign promises. He's set to detail another key plank of his agenda \u2014 the American Families Plan \u2014 on Wednesday night in his first joint address to Congress. Some GOP lawmakers acknowledge Biden is popular now \u2014 with polls showing more than half of Americans approve of his performance in office so far \u2014 but they say that as more voters learn the details of how billions in federal aid is being spent on things that don't qualify as pandemic relief, they will be less likely to support trillions more in a federal response. Republicans point out that Biden ran on reaching out and working with Republican lawmakers, but so far he has shut them out of major policy decisions. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House GOP leader, told reporters covering a party retreat in Florida that Biden was pursuing a \"go-it-alone strategy\" and noted that the president hasn't asked to meet with the top House Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, or him. Biden may not be courting top GOP leaders with Oval Office visits in front of television cameras, but he already has a long relationship with McConnell and many others from his more than three decades in the Senate and his time as vice president. In recent weeks he has invited groups of Republican lawmakers to the White House to discuss a range of issues \u2014 picking those who have offered their own proposals on COVID-19 aid, or have worked in the past on bipartisan infrastructure legislation or policies to boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies. Rather than focus on Biden personally, because he isn't viewed as a polarizing president, Republicans instead are training their focus on other Democratic figures who cut more controversial profiles \u2014 such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the author of the sweeping Green New Deal proposal to remake the economy and dramatically cut carbon emissions. Infrastructure, traditionally a bipartisan issue, could be a party-line vote A day ahead of Biden's address to Congress, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, McConnell's deputy in leadership, told reporters he expected it to outline \"the big government agenda.\" Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana \u2014 who was part of a nearly two-hour bipartisan meeting at the White House this month about how to craft a major infrastructure plan \u2014 told NPR he was open to expanding what could be included, saying things such as broadband may fit. But he said some of the items Biden wants, such as child care support or new health care programs, amounted to \"infra-socialism\" and said \"that's very different\" from previous bipartisan packages that passed with overwhelming majorities. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who was part of a bipartisan group that met with Biden early on to discuss COVID-19 proposals, is also part of a GOP group pushing an alternate infrastructure plan. He told reporters he and others agree roads, bridges and water projects qualify, but that some of the types of programs that Democrats are branding as infrastructure \"by any definition is dishonest.\" Hill Republicans have also indicated that Biden's proposal to pay for the jobs plan \u2014 rolling back tax cuts enacted by the GOP in 2017 \u2014 is a nonstarter. That impasse and differences about the scope of the proposal are major hurdles to any hope for GOP support for Biden's chief domestic initiative. Democrats on the Hill have adopted the White House justification that the president's policies could be bipartisan, even if zero Republicans in Congress back them. \"If it's popular with Republicans. If Republican stakeholders, mayors and governors, [the] U.S. Chamber of Commerce like it, then yeah, I think it is bipartisan,\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said earlier this week. Senate Republicans produced their own version of a proposal \u2014 a $568 billion infrastructure plan \u2013 but the gulf between the parties appears even greater than it was when Congress debated coronavirus relief legislation and Democrats decided to use budget rules to approve it without GOP votes. Border as wedge issue, again Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, addresses the media last month in Mission, Texas, as part of a Senate delegation visiting the U.S.-Mexican border.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, addresses the media last month in Mission, Texas, as part of a Senate delegation visiting the U.S.-Mexican border. Republicans, both in Congress and around the country, continue to believe that Biden is weakest on immigration, and the issue represents the administration's biggest political vulnerability. The number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border last month was the largest in at least 15 years. A spike in unaccompanied minors has been a challenge for the administration to manage as federal agencies work to house them amid the pandemic and new facilities brought online continue to be overwhelmed. Led by former President Donald Trump, the GOP has doubled down on hard-line immigration policies. Republican campaigns are already targeting vulnerable Democrats in swing House districts and competitive Senate races, indicating that support of Biden's policies amounts to an \"open borders\" policy, a sign the GOP believes the issue will resonate in the 2022 midterm elections. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who may be a possible 2024 candidate for president, led a delegation of 18 senators to the border and penned an editorial in Newsweek arguing the situation at the border is a direct result of Biden reversing Trump's policies. He and others say Biden's stopping construction on Trump's border wall and reinstating Obama-era policies allowing some undocumented to be released have contributed to the influx of migrants. They also say ending another Trump policy, in which Central American migrants who entered Mexico on the way to apply for asylum in the U.S. had to stay in Mexico until their cases were heard, has incentivized a massive wave of new undocumented people to flood across the border. Bipartisan talks have been revived on some type of immigration reforms as the situation intensifies at the Southwest border. But even Republicans who once backed a path to citizenship for undocumented workers as part of a comprehensive bill are saying the most likely proposal to gain any traction would be a more targeted bill directed at so-called DREAMers, those brought to the country as children. McConnell insisted Tuesday any effort would have to address the current border security crisis. The window for Republican willingness to cut any significant deals could be closing soon. Leaders are confident that midterm history is on their side, and that the party in power will lose enough seats in the narrowly divided House, and potentially in the 50-50 Senate, to flip control of one or both chambers of Congress back to the GOP.",

            "article_content": "Before being elected president, Joe Biden promised he could accomplish a lot of things in his first 100 days in office. We gathered a number of those priorities here, two days after he was declared the winner of the 2020 election. As we approach the 100-day mark of his presidency, and ahead of his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Biden has made a lot of progress on COVID-19, and Americans largely approve of the job he's doing handling the coronavirus pandemic and the economy. It's a different story, however, when it comes to immigration, which polls show is the president's biggest vulnerability at this point. H has also made efforts on racial justice, the environment and switching back to a more multilateral approach to foreign policy. But so far he has not been able to get everything done that he set out to do. Here's where Biden stands on much of what he promised (jump down to the details on each topic from the graphic): Loading... President Biden marks hitting a goal of 200 million shots in arms by his 100th day in office during remarks at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on April 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden marks hitting a goal of 200 million shots in arms by his 100th day in office during remarks at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on April 21. Assemble a coronavirus task force: DONEThis was accomplished, and the task force continues with regular briefings, usually three times a week, that do not involve the president. His task force has had a focus on equity in a way that was never done under the Trump administration. Push for immediate coronavirus legislation: DONEThis is Biden's signature accomplishment so far, as he signed a $1.9 trillion relief bill that passed along party lines. It contained money for direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits and rental assistance, but did not include everything Biden wanted, particularly a raise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The wage hike was deemed ineligible under the Senate's rules for using reconciliation, a process that Democrats used as an end run around Republican opposition. The legislation also did not include $10,000 per person in student loan forgiveness (other options are still being talked about on that front). Release a vaccine distribution plan: DONEThis was released during the transition. To date, more than 40% of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and more than 27% is fully vaccinated. Biden has received high marks in polls for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are still inequities in who has been able to access the vaccines. Rejoin World Health Organization and keep Dr. Anthony Fauci as a close adviser: DONEThese steps were taken very early on. Fauci was the one to announce that the U.S. would be remaining in the WHO but noted that the U.S. would work \"to strengthen and reform\" the organization. The WHO was the subject of intense criticism from the Trump administration for what it saw as failures to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

Reverse Trump's corporate tax cut: NOT YET ACHIEVEDBiden has not been able to accomplish this yet, but he wants to roll back much of what Trump did by enacting tax increases on corporations to pay for his approximately $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The upcoming American Families Plan would reportedly be paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals. President Biden speaks to world leaders during a virtual summit on climate change on April 22.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden speaks to world leaders during a virtual summit on climate change on April 22. Organize a \"climate world summit\": DONEBiden held a virtual international climate summit last week, urging countries to follow the United States' lead in reducing their contributions to global warming. Make the U.S. an international leader on climate change: IT'S COMPLICATEDThis is one of Biden's murkier \u2014 and more challenging \u2014 promises. The rest of the world, Europe in particular, has seen the U.S. drop out of and rejoin multiple international climate agreements and is wary of whether any climate commitments started by Biden would last in the country's current political environment. Still, the administration has released an aggressive plan to cut emissions over the coming decade, and its infrastructure proposal, if approved, would provide unprecedented boosts to clean energy efforts. \u2014 Scott Detrow, NPR White House correspondent President Biden addresses the nation on April 20 after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden addresses the nation on April 20 after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Extend the Voting Rights Act: NOT YET ACHIEVEDA comprehensive voting bill passed the House, but Republicans have universally opposed it, leaving its fate in limbo in the U.S. Senate \u2014 and leading to renewed discussions among Democrats about scrapping the legislative filibuster. Republicans argue that the federal government should leave voting rights issues and election administration to the states. But following the 2020 presidential election and former President Donald Trump's false allegations of widespread fraud, multiple GOP-led states are taking steps to restrict voting rights. Georgia's recently passed law, for example, has been the subject of corporate boycotts and the reason for Major League Baseball moving its All-Star Game out of Atlanta. Institute a national police oversight commission: DROPPEDThis month, the White House announced it was shelving the commission, saying it \"would not be the most effective way to deliver on our top priority in this area, which is to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law.\" The bill, which has passed the House but not the Senate, would overhaul certain police practices and ban chokeholds. The day after the Derek Chauvin guilty verdict for the murder of George Floyd, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department would be launching an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department for possible patterns of discrimination and excessive use of force. It's the first investigation of its kind during the Biden presidency. Push Congress to pass the SAFE Justice Act: NOT YET ACHIEVEDThe Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective Justice Act (or SAFE Justice Act) was a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia and now-former Republican Rep. Jason Lewis of Minnesota. It would take steps toward changing sentencing and probation, including reducing the use of mandatory-minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenses and instituting policies geared at lowering recidivism. It was first introduced in 2017 but never received a vote. There has been no action to this point in Congress on the legislation, but congressional aides with knowledge of the legislative push say they are expecting it will be introduced as soon as next month and believe it will have bipartisan and bicameral support. They see it as a complement to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which does not deal with sentencing and probation or what happens to people after they serve their time. President Biden talks with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas before signing several executive orders on immigration on Feb. 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden talks with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas before signing several executive orders on immigration on Feb. 2. Introduce legislation that would give a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally and especially for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children: DONEOne of Biden's first acts as president was to introduce the legislation. But the prospects for a comprehensive overhaul passing Congress are dim. Democrats on Capitol Hill formally introduced Biden's wide-reaching plan in the House in February, but nothing has come of a potential comprehensive overhaul to this point because of solid Republican opposition. That continues to leave millions in the country illegally and others looking to come in limbo. Make the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program permanent: IT'S COMPLICATEDBiden signed an executive order on his first day in office that strengthened DACA, but the program remains under threat. A federal judge in Texas, who previously indicated that he thought DACA was unlawful, is expected to rule on the legality of the program soon. But there are also several efforts on Capitol Hill to pass legislation to secure and/or expand DACA-like protections for people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Stop family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border: IT'S COMPLICATEDTrump's widely criticized family separation policies were largely stopped during his own administration, and Biden signed an executive order condemning the policy. The current administration is making efforts to reunite families separated under the Trump administration, but in practice, families continue to separate themselves on the Mexican side of the border, where parents send children alone from tent encampments. This has led to an increase of unaccompanied minors coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, and the administration has struggled to deal with the post-Trump surge. Sign an executive order establishing a task force focused on reuniting children and parents separated at the border: DONEThis was done Feb. 2. The executive order created a task force to help identify children separated from their parents and reunite the families. As of the beginning of April, however, no family members had been reunited. End Trump's executive order banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries: DONEOne of the first actions Biden took after assuming office was signing a proclamation ending the ban on travelers from several majority-Muslim countries. Stop the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols as well as the policy of \"metering\" asylum cases: IT'S COMPLICATEDOn his first day in office, Biden had the Department of Homeland Security suspend new enrollments in a program that has pushed tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico for asylum hearings in U.S. courts. A few weeks later, the administration started to allow asylum-seekers in the program into the United States. Biden has promised to end \"metering,\" the practice of instituting a daily restriction on how many migrants can seek asylum. But so far the administration has continued to restrict asylum-seekers through two other measures: a ban on \"nonessential\" travel and a Trump-era finding under \"Title 42 of the U.S. Code that anyone 'who would otherwise be introduced into a congregate setting in a land Port of Entry (POE)' posed a public health risk,\" David Bier of the Cato Institute reported. It's unclear how or if the Biden administration will address or end the efforts in the future. Take away funding for continued construction of a wall along the southern U.S. border: IT'S COMPLICATEDThe wall was another of the first issues Biden promised to address. The president issued a proclamation to this effect on his first day, revoking Trump's emergency declaration that had helped fund the construction of a border wall. Biden's $1.5 trillion budget proposal also did not call for funding for the construction of the border wall. Biden's order included a 60-day review. But his plans now don't appear as concrete. It has been more than a month since that two-month review period, yet the White House says the review is ongoing. The Biden government has even been involved in winning eminent domain cases held over from the Trump administration. And Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas reportedly told employees that some border wall construction might begin again to plug \"gaps\" left from the construction halted when Biden took office. It's another example \u2014 in addition to waffling on lifting the Trump-imposed refugee cap \u2014 of Biden struggling to figure out a clear and cogent approach to immigration. Increase government supervision over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, calling for the need to hold personnel \"accountable for inhumane treatment\": DONEWhile his $1.5 trillion budget outline did not provide funding for the wall, it did call for an increase of funding for an investigation of immigration agents accused of \"white supremacy.\" As part of a more \"humane\" policy, ICE and CBP were told last week to drop the terms \"illegal,\" \"alien\" and \"assimilation.\" \"Illegal\" will become \"undocumented\"; \"noncitizen\" or \"migrant\" should be used instead of \"alien\"; and \"assimilation\" should be replaced by \"integration.\" In February, the administration issued new guidance for agents to prioritize arrests of immigrants who are national security and public safety threats. \u2014 NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez contributed reporting President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken participate in a virtual meeting with world leaders on March 12 at White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken participate in a virtual meeting with world leaders on March 12 at White House. Pledge to \"pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy\": IT'S COMPLICATEDUnder Trump, views of the U.S. plummeted among the country's strongest allies. Biden has switched U.S. foreign policy back to a more multilateral stance and has shifted power back to diplomacy and the State Department as well. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Biden declared, \"America is back.\" That was met mostly positively by America's allies in Europe, but France and Germany pushed back, notably pointing out that they had to put some distance between themselves and the United States, that the U.S. could not always be relied on and that \"interests will not always converge.\" Biden also set a date for removing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan: Sept. 11, 2021, which happens to be the 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \"We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago,\" Biden said this month. \"That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. We were attacked; we went to war with clear goals. ... We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead and al-Qaida is degraded in Afghanistan, and it's time to end this forever war.'' Trump also wanted to get U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, and his administration had negotiated a deal to remove troops by May 1 of this year, something Biden said would be \"tough\" to achieve. There has been mixed reaction to Biden's decision, particularly because the withdrawal comes without conditions \u2014 it's America's longest war, but there are concerns over tracking militants in Afghanistan. International summit: NOT YET ACHIEVEDBeyond 100 days, Biden wants to \"host a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World.\" The idea is to gather democratic countries to find ways to combat corruption, authoritarianism and human rights abuses. Biden plans to hold the summit in the coming months, and he has already done an about-face from Trump in calling out corruption and authoritarianism in Russia as well as focusing on human rights abuses in China. That, however, caused a flare-up in tensions last month during the first major talks between the U.S. and China during Biden's presidency.",

Mayorkas has tried to discourage migrants from coming north and blamed the Trump administration for dismantling the system that processes and cares for them.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas addresses a press briefing this month. Mayorkas has tried to discourage migrants from coming north and blamed the Trump administration for dismantling the system that processes and cares for them. President Biden's administration is scrambling to deal with an increasingly difficult challenge on the Southwest border that's become one of the first big political firestorms of his nascent presidency. A growing number of migrants are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, many to seek asylum, and the government wasn't prepared for a huge influx of children who are coming alone without their parents. \"Right now, what we're seeing is just a volume that the federal government was unprepared to address despite ample warning that it was coming their way,\" said Jennifer Nagda, policy director at the nonprofit Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights. Over the weekend, the Biden administration announced a new shelter for migrant children in West Texas, part of the broader shelter system overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services that's designed to care for young new arrivals. And Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas capped a weeklong media blitz with appearances on four Sunday talk shows in which he tried to discourage migrants from coming north and blamed the Trump administration for dismantling the system that processes and cares for them. \"The message is quite clear: Do not come,\" Mayorkas said in an interview on ABC's This Week. While the Biden administration still refuses to call the situation a crisis, Republican critics said that's exactly what it is and that the president created it. Critics say Biden has encouraged migrants to cross the border illegally by reversing a number of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies: halting border wall construction, introducing ambitious immigration bills to expand pathways to citizenship, and ending the Remain in Mexico policy, which forced migrants to wait outside the United States for their asylum hearings. \"They have created this crisis of children coming in,\" GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said in an interview Sunday on ABC. \"The traffickers are smart, cartels are smart. They know our laws, policies. And this started right after the election. In the last two months, we've seen a real surge.\" Immigration authorities encountered more than 100,000 migrants attempting to cross the Southwest U.S. border in February. More than 14,000 migrant teens and children are now in U.S. custody, and more are likely on the way \u2014 overwhelming facilities at the border that were designed to hold adults. \"Kids are overcrowded. They're in situations you would never want your kids to be in. It's irresponsible,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in an interview on CBS' Face the Nation. Portman was part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who toured a Border Patrol facility last week in El Paso, Texas. By law, the young migrants are supposed to be turned over to HHS within three days. But in many cases, that's not happening. Hundreds have been held in those jail-like facilities at the border for more than 10 days, according to a Department of Homeland Security document obtained by NPR. Trump closed the border to most migrants because of the pandemic, and Mayorkas emphasizes that many migrants are still turned back under that policy. But now there are some exceptions: Migrant children are being allowed into the U.S., as are some asylum-seekers who had been enrolled in Remain in Mexico. Biden administration officials contend they've inherited a difficult situation with no easy answers. \"It is taking time, and it is difficult,\" Mayorkas said Sunday in an interview on CNN's State of the Union. \"There was a system in place, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, that was torn down during the Trump administration. And that is why the challenge is more acute than it ever has been before.\" This is not the first surge of migrant children arriving at the southern border. The same thing happened under Trump and former President Barack Obama, too. And in many ways, the current bottleneck was predictable. The Trump administration dramatically reduced the size of the HHS shelter system, and immigrant advocates say the administration scared away relatives and parents in the U.S. \u2014 many of whom are undocumented \u2014 from coming forward to care for the children. Contrary to longstanding practice, the Trump administration began to share information about potential sponsors for migrant children with immigration authorities. The Biden administration only recently reversed that policy. And when Trump lost the election, Nagda from the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights said his administration left the incoming Biden team in a lurch. \"There was no preparing in November, December and January; those were three critical lost months,\" she told NPR in an interview. Nagda said it's been clear that more migrant children were coming since two hurricanes devastated Central America late last year. Meanwhile, thousands of migrant children had amassed in dangerous border towns in Mexico where the Trump administration had expelled them, and were desperate to get out. \"They are at risk in Mexico,\" said Olivia Pe\u00f1a, a child advocate at the Young Center's office in the Rio Grande Valley, where she works with migrant children after they're released to HHS custody. \"They're waiting there hoping to come in as soon as possible.\" Advocates say the real tragedy was sending these kids and families who fled crime and poverty at home back to danger in Mexico. Pe\u00f1a relays the story of one 9-year-old Honduran girl at a shelter in Texas. Her mother was stuck on the other side of the border under Trump's Remain in Mexico policy. They were separated for months \u2014 until recently, when Biden ended the policy. \"Within a couple of days, she was released into her mother's care. And that to us was a success,\" Pe\u00f1a said. \"We were so happy to know there's change, and that there's hope.\" But the administration's critics fear that hope will spur even more migrant children to make the dangerous trip to the U.S. border. \"What they're hearing is that you can now come into the United States, which you can as a kid,\" Portman said on CBS. \"And so they're going to keep coming.\" Even some of Biden's allies have questioned whether it's wise for the U.S. to allow migrant children to enter if the country doesn't have systems in place to care for them properly. Asked several times in media interviews if the Biden administration moved too quickly to lift Trump's restrictions, Mayorkas on Sunday framed the issue as a moral imperative. \"We will not abandon our values and our principles,\" Mayorkas said on CNN. \"We will not abandon the needs of vulnerable children. That is what this is all about.\"",

California's agricultural growers square off against the farmworkers union at the Supreme Court on Monday over a nearly half-century-old law stemming from the work of famed union organizer Cesar Chavez. The law, enacted in 1975, allows union organizers limited access to farms so they can seek support from workers in forming a union. The growers challenging the law contend that California, by giving union organizers a limited right of access to farms, is authorizing a mass trespass on the growers' private property. And that, they argue, is an unconstitutional taking of their property. Property owners, they argue, have the right to exclude whomever they want. Either organizers should be barred from their land, they contend, or the state should pay the growers \"just compensation.\" The case before the court began in 2015 at Cedar Point Nursery near the Oregon border. Strawberry grower Mike Fahner calls what happened \"an ambush.\" In a widely circulated video, he said union organizers, without giving the required notice, showed up with bullhorns, harassing his workers. \"If this were to happen in any other industry, in any other state, the people would would be expecting to be arrested and and taken away in handcuffs,\" Fahner said. United Farm Workers general counsel Mario Martinez says that account is \"absolutely false.\" He says people seen on the video circulated by Fahner and his lawyers are not union organizers but Cedar Point workers \"going out on strike.\" The California Agricultural Labor Relations Board investigated the events at the Cedar Point Nursery, concluded the UFW had not violated the law, and dismissed the grower's complaint. After that Cedar Point went to court, appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court. For the union, the case is an existential threat. Farmworkers in California are seasonal, typically working for several employers during the course of the year. They arrive in town in time for the local harvest, live in motels, labor camps or with friends or relatives, then move on when the crop is picked. In practice that means organizers can gather signatures for a union election only during the relatively short harvest time at a particular site. Because of these and other farm-specific conditions, under California's labor regulations, union organizers are permitted to meet with workers an hour before and after work and at lunchtime \u2014 all on the grower's property \u2014 for limited periods during the year. Specifically, organizers are permitted on site during those specified hours, for 30 days four times a year. Fahner contends that California's agricultural labor law is a relic of the past. \"This law, in today's world, is no longer necessary. With social media --Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp \u2014 you can communicate with people around the world, effectively without having to have access to a person's private property and place of business,\" he says. The union's Martinez calls that argument \"nonsense,\" noting that most in the migrant workforce are undocumented, indigenous people who don't speak English, have little education, and don't have modern smartphones with access to the internet or WiFi. \"Most importantly, he asserts, \"most of these workers do not know of the existence of their rights to organize and form a union. So in the UFW's experience, it's critically important to have face-to-face communications with these workers.\" This is not the first time California's labor law has reached the Supreme Court. In 1976 the California Supreme Court ruled against a similar challenge from the growers, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. But now, with a far more conservative high court in place, the growers are trying again, and it is significant that the justices agreed this time to hear the case. Also significant is the fact that the Trump administration sided with the growers in asking the high court to take on the case. Last month, however, the Biden administration informed the justices that the government was withdrawing the previous administration's brief. \"It is therefore the position of the United States, in line with this Court's cases, that the California regulation \u2014 like the authorization of temporary entry by government officials for law enforcement, inspection, and similar purposes --does not constitute a per se taking\" of private property. \"That position,\" wrote acting Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, \"accords with the United States' view \u2014 which the government has repeatedly articulated in this Court and lower courts\" over the years. It was a dignified version of a blunt message. If the newly energized conservative Supreme Court majority agrees with the growers, the decision could have profound consequences for other laws \u2014 laws allowing health and safety inspectors at every level of government to enter  businesses to examine how meat is butchered, whether mines are safe, how toxic chemicals are stored, whether businesses are in compliance with fire and building codes, nursing homes and hospitals are taking proper care of their patients, and on and on. In short, a decision in favor of the the growers, arguably, could undermine many of those laws aimed at protecting not just farmworkers, but the American public. A decision in the case is expected by summer.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had sought an alternate proposal to include an increase in the federal minimum wage in President Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. The Senate takes up President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package this week, following a largely party-line House vote early Saturday morning. Democrats are using a process to avoid a Republican filibuster in the Senate that leaves them no room for error in the divided 50-50 chamber. Pushing Biden's plan through budget reconciliation allows Democrats to approve it more quickly and without Republican support. But it also means there are limits regarding what can be in the package, because of rules dictating how policies affecting spending, taxes and the debt are considered. Democratic leaders need to keep their caucus unified and will count on Vice President Harris to break a tie, since no GOP lawmakers in the House voted for the bill, and none are expected to back it in the Senate. Potential efforts to try to push businesses to boost the minimum wage, or any changes to tax credits or other elements, mean the bill may pingpong back to the House, since any changes to the package would require another vote. The complicated legislative maneuvers come with the clock ticking. Democratic leaders and the White House want the final bill to be enacted by the president by March 14, which is when current enhanced unemployment benefits expire. The bill includes $1,400 direct payments to millions of qualifying Americans, funds for vaccine distribution, money for state and local governments, an expanded child tax credit, rental assistance, food aid and more help for small businesses. Many liberal Democrats say abandoning the push for a minimum wage hike as part of this package would be a mistake, so the White House is working to highlight the other major components it says are essential to put into place now, as the country continues to struggle with the economic fallout of the pandemic. 1. Uncertainty over effort to raise the minimum wage continues The Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday that the $15 an hour federal minimum wage increase could not be included in the Senate bill because of the limits that are part of budget reconciliation. House Democrats kept the provision in their bill despite that development, but it's expected to be stripped out as the Senate debates the bill this week. The ruling by the parliamentarian was not released publicly, and progressives immediately blasted it. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said members told constituents they would push to pass a bill to increase wages, and \"we can't tell them this didn't get one because of an unelected parliamentarian.\" She and other liberal Democrats vowed to mount a fight, or even try to oust the parliamentarian. Senate Democratic leaders and the White House indicated they would respect the ruling but continue to look to get the increase through another legislative route. The budget reconciliation process limits items that can be included to policies impacting the federal ledger. A minimum wage hike likely ran afoul of the rules because it directly influences the bottom line for businesses and the economy, but not the federal budget. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., initially said he was reviewing a plan to add a new provision to the package that penalizes large corporations what don't pay their workers at least a $15 per hour minimum wage, but a senior Democratic aide told NPR that Democrats are abandoning that effort. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., immediately pressed for that strategy \u2014 a sign that Democrats were readying a backup plan. Now that they have decided not to press for it, it's unclear whether another proposal will emerge, or if Democrats will have to press for the wage hike in stand-alone legislation. But even if Democrats in the House pass such a bill, it does not have enough support to overcome a GOP filibuster in the Senate. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas are pushing a proposal to increase the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but they include a requirement that businesses use an E-Verify program that reviews workers to make sure they are not undocumented. It is not expected to get any traction, but is a sign that some elements of the GOP view the need to address the issue of the wide wage gap in the country. 2. Centrists remain key players The move forcing Democrats to remove the federal minimum wage hike from the package actually helps Schumer keep his caucus united. Moderates like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona could feel more comfortable backing the bill without the hurdle of the minimum wage issue. Some centrists from both parties have voiced concerns about the size of the package and suggested some items like direct payments should be more targeted, but there is no sign yet that those issues were deal-breakers for the Democrats in terms of getting to a yes vote. In an evenly divided chamber, any one senator can wield influence and press for a pet issue or program that specifically has an impact in their state. As the package moves to the floor and senators from both parties press for amendments, potentially to how the tax credits are structured, that could change those items that many House Democrats insist should stay as is. The parliamentarian can also rule that some items aren't within the scope of the reconciliation process. There is already tension from progressives who complain that moderates shouldn't be given an outsized role in shaping policies that Biden campaigned and won on in 2020. 3. The package is likely to pass Congress entirely with Democratic votes Democrats are convinced that Republicans are making a risky bet putting up a wall of opposition to the relief bill. Several recent polls indicate that 7 in 10 Americans support the $1.9 trillion plan, and in some cases a majority of Republican voters back the legislation. White House officials point to GOP mayors and other state officials who say the economic devastation from the pandemic demands a bold federal response. \"We're moving ahead with a bill that probably will get no Republican votes in the Senate, but will have broad Republican support in the country,\" Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said on CNN on Sunday. Many congressional Republicans see an opening politically to tag the package as \"corrupt\" or stuffed with \"pet projects.\" They think pointing out hundreds of millions of dollars on items they argue aren't directly related to the pandemic, such as improvements to the transit system in Northern California, or tax credits that wouldn't go into effect until next year, could cause Democrats in swing states or purple House districts heartburn heading into the 2022 midterm elections. They have focused mainly on the issue of schools in many districts that are still closed, and the need to make that the focus of any bill. There are resources for state and local governments in the Democrats' package to support schools to get back to in-person learning in areas that are still struggling. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said the bill should be far smaller in size, targeted to get kids in classrooms full time and get mental health resources to those children suffering from learning largely virtually over the last year. Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman, one of 10 Republicans who met with Biden about crafting a relief bill, acknowledged that direct payments are popular but argued in an interview on Sunday on ABC's This Week, that more than half of the $1.9 trillion proposal won't be spent in 2021, citing a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \"So how could it be about COVID relief? No one expects a year from now that we'll be in the COVID crisis that we're in now, so, it just doesn't make any sense,\" Portman said. 4. The fight over getting rid of the filibuster is likely to crank up, fueled by frustrated progressives The limitations that budget reconciliation put on the COVID-19 relief bill reignited the push from those on the left to eliminate the legislative filibuster. Getting 10 Republicans to consider backing a relief bill proved too high a hurdle, so the notion that Democrats could attract support from enough to reach the 60-vote threshold on things like a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure package, climate change legislation, gun control bills or other major priorities would likely be much tougher, if not impossible. Leading progressives like Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted their frustrations shortly after the ruling on the minimum wage, and maintained the Senate rules need to change. Understand this: The filibuster gives veto power to Mitch McConnell. And to the gun industry. And to the oil industry. For generations, racist senators used the filibuster to block anti-lynching laws and civil rights bills. It\u2019s still blocking progress today. It\u2019s got to go. pic.twitter.com/9JreV5i029 Sens. Manchin and Sinema remain opposed to ending the filibuster, and there could be other Democrats who would vote against a rules change, so leaders don't have the votes now to make the move, and Biden is largely staying out of the debate. But if the president's legislative agenda continues to be stymied by a strict partisan split, the political pressure will mount on Democratic leaders to reconsider whether they can convince the caucus that the only way to get policy priorities through is to change how the chamber works.

            "article_content": "Is the summer ending on a politically damaging down note for President Biden?  SUSAN DAVIS, HOST: Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election with promises to return a sense of normalcy to the country. Seven months into his administration, little seems under his control right now. The exit from Afghanistan is chaotic. The delta variant is fueling a surge in coronavirus infections, and illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are reaching historic highs. To try to make sense of it all is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who joins us now. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Sue. DAVIS: So the Pentagon is now looking to commercial carriers to help evacuate Kabul. How much damage has the handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal done to Biden right now, especially as a president who prides himself on his foreign policy skills and reputation around the world? LIASSON: Well, it's hurt him. We don't know how much it's going to hurt him over time. His approval ratings have slid below 50, although that slide started pre-Afghanistan, mostly with the delta variant. But there's no doubt that when a president's image of competence and credibility, two things that Biden ran on, is hurt, that's really bad. Jimmy Carter saw it with the hostage crisis. George W. Bush saw it with Katrina, and Trump saw it with COVID. DAVIS: Republicans in the past few days, including one-time Biden friend Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have gone so far as to suggest that Biden could be warranting an impeachment inquiry, depending on how the withdrawal of Afghanistan goes in the end. Obviously we know impeachment politics are tricky. We've dealt with them a lot in the past couple of years. But how serious of a threat should the Biden administration be taking that as? LIASSON: I think that they should take the threat of impeachment seriously. The big question is, what about the impact of impeachment? Impeachment has almost become something that an opposition Congress just does. DAVIS: Yeah. LIASSON: And they - it's almost like a slap on the wrist. The president doesn't get removed. I think what the White House is hoping is that over time, Afghanistan fades from the headlines - which it already has started to do, except for on cable - that the economy stays up and COVID stays down and that the public who is supportive of the basic decision in Afghanistan to get out - they don't like the execution - that that helps him over time. Right now, it seems like the loss of credibility of the U.S. with our allies and our enemies as - the U.S. image as the indispensable superpower that's going to defend democracy in the face of advancing authoritarianism - that's taken more of a hit than domestic politics would hurt Biden. DAVIS: When it comes to the pandemic, it obviously played a big role in Biden's victory over Donald Trump. There were promises earlier this year that life would be back to normal by the Fourth of July. We're seeing a very different - heading into a very different fall. What's the Biden administration strategy for where we go from here, in terms of the pandemic strategy? LIASSON: He just tries to get everyone boosters if he can and get people who are vaccine-hesitant their first and second vaccine shots where he needs to. I don't think we're going back to lockdowns, but you're right. You can't have a feeling that you're returning to normalcy if your business isn't open. And that's still job one for the Biden administration. DAVIS: All of this happens as we were seeing the surge at the border. Democrats are right now actively considering putting immigration reform legislation into a budget bill. Do you see that as a politically risky attempt for Democrats, or could it be a political advantageous moment, considering no president has been able to get much done on immigration for a generation or more? LIASSON: Well, I think that it's risky if Democrats tried to pass something big and comprehensive on reconciliation with Democratic votes only. But remember, the DREAMers bill - that's legalizing people who were brought here as young, young infants, sometimes, undocumented - that used to have bipartisan support. Lindsey Graham was a co-sponsor of the DREAMers bill, so maybe they could put that on without tremendous blowback. But remember, immigration now fits into this Republican attack on Biden as being incompetent. Why couldn't he handle the surge at the border? Why didn't he anticipate it? Why didn't he have a plan? DAVIS: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much for your time. LIASSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ilhan Omar (from left), Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, seen here at a news conference last month outside the U.S. Capitol, are among those calling on the Biden administration to lift the cap on refugees. The White House has walked back its announcement that it will keep this year's historically low refugee ceiling of 15,000 set by the Trump administration, saying its earlier statement Friday, which was panned by fellow Democrats, was meant only to ease restrictions from countries from which refugees are currently banned. The White House said President Biden would raise the cap by May 15. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the earlier announcement was made because Biden \"was urged to take immediate action to reverse the Trump policy that banned refugees from many key regions, to enable flights from those regions within days; today's order does that.\" She said Biden would \"set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15.\" The fiscal year ends Sept. 30. The White House has been under increasing pressure from refugee advocates and congressional Democrats to make good on a campaign promise to raise the number to 125,000. A February State Department report to Congress proposed a figure of 62,500 for the fiscal year. The about-face on Friday came after the initial White House decision was panned by Democrats, refugee advocates and human rights groups. \"We are reaching out to the White House to understand why this figure is a fraction of what the administration committed to in congressional consultations,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of the agencies involved in refugee resettlement in the United States, said after the initial announcement. Biden's fellow Democrats also blasted the move, with Sen. Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, calling the Trump-era level \"unacceptable.\" \"Say it ain't so, President Joe,\" he said in a statement. Julian Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, called it \"a bad decision,\" and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said it was \"simply unacceptable and unconscionable.\" The White House denied accusations that the initial move was motivated by political pressure due to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 which in March saw the largest number of migrant encounters in at least 15 years. The White House said the U.S. refugee admissions program was \"decimated\" under the Trump administration and pledged to increase the admission level in the future as it works to rebuild the system. The White House also pledged to work with Congress if it's needed to increase it sooner due to emergencies. \"America needs to rebuild our refugee resettlement program,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a tweet explaining the initial response. \"We will use all 15,000 slots under the new Determination and work with Congress on increasing admissions and building back to the numbers to which we've committed.\" Those remarks were reiterated by Psaki, the White House press secretary, who said on Twitter: \"This is just the beginning.\" The administration said it intended to use all 15,000 slots available, allocating 7,000 for Africa, 1,000 for East Asia, 1,500 for Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean, 1,500 for the Near East and South Asia. Another 1,000 slots were unallocated. Friday's announcement came as progressive lawmakers, including Jayapal, called on the president to fulfill his campaign pledge. \"Having fought for four years against the Trump Administration's full-scale assault on refugee resettlement in the United States, we were relieved to see you commit to increasing our refugee resettlement numbers so early in your Administration,\" Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Jayapal, and Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., wrote in a letter. \"But until the Emergency Presidential Determination is finalized, our refugee policy remains unacceptably draconian and discriminatory.\" Refugee resettlement, a bipartisan issue since President Jimmy Carter signed the Refugee Act of 1980, became a political hot potato during the Trump years. Former President Donald Trump made deep cuts to the maximum number of refugees the U.S. accepts each year, characterizing refugees as a danger to national security. The current level, 15,000, is the lowest since Carter signed the law. In the year before Trump's election, the U.S. resettled 84,995 refugees against a cap of 85,000. The letter from Democratic lawmakers also referenced refugees who were cleared for resettlement but have been waiting in limbo until the White House formalizes the change in policy. \"We must keep our promises to people who have fled unthinkably brutal conditions in their home countries and live up to our ambition to provide them a safe haven to re-start their lives,\" the letter added. Omar, who was one of the first two Muslim American women elected to Congress in 2018, is also the first African refugee to become a member of Congress. The letter had 35 additional signatures as of Friday morning, including members of the so-called squad: Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. During the presidential campaign, Biden promised to set the yearly cap on refugee admissions to 125,000 and \"raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values and the unprecedented global need.\" \"The United States' moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when I first got here,\" he said at the State Department in February, pledging to approve an executive order to restore the admissions program to meet global demand. \"It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged, but that's precisely what we're going to do.\" That same month, the State Department issued a report to Congress proposing an increase in refugee admissions to 62,500 for the fiscal year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday the U.S. has to \"recognize [its] moral responsibility\" in taking in refugees. \"I think right now we have, well, it's a very few thousand, and we have to increase that number.\" Read the full letter below.

When Deqa Dhalac was writing her inaugural speech after being elected as mayor of South Portland, Maine, she went searching for an inspirational quote for the end. She considered Barack Obama, Desmond Tutu, Mother Teresa \u2013 and then her mom called from Mogadishu, Somalia. \"She reminded me of a poem or prayer that she recited for me when I entered high school,\" Dhalac said. Her mother asked God to surround her with prayer and blessings and to give her the gift of long life. \"In English, it says, 'My dear daughter ... I beg God for you to be the leader of many ethnicities ... and help those in need with the pride of your father.'\". In that moment, Dhalac found her conclusion. Dhalac fled Somalia some 30 years ago, as the country descended into civil war. Earlier this month, she became this country's first Somali-American mayor, chosen by the South Portland City Council to lead a city that's 90% white, according to Census data. Dhalac is the eleventh woman to hold the position, since the first female mayor was selected in 1985. Dhalac was elected to City Council in 2018. She has lived in South Portland for more than a decade, after making her way to Maine from Atlanta, Georgia, where she was resettled in the United States as a refugee. In the early 2000s, hundreds of Somali refugees, like Dhalac, left the cities where they had been relocated, drawn to Maine, in part by more affordable housing. Dhalac credits her election to a decade of hard work building relationships in her community. \"Getting to know people in all walks of life, so people know me and said [when I was elected], she's not mayor for me, she's my friend, which really makes me humbled,\" Dhalac said. Continuing to connect with people will guide her term as mayor, Dhalac said, even when people are not receptive. Dhalac, who is Muslim, recalled that when a wave of Islamophobia swept her state a few years ago, she helped bring the community together in conversation. \"One woman stood up, a white woman, and said all Muslims are terrorists. And instead of calling her out, we called her in and said, let's talk about it,\" she said. \"Because this person might never know that I am not a terrorist, that my kids are not terrorists, that my friends are not terrorists, but that we are part of this fabric of this country.\" Dhalac, who works for the Maine Department of Education, focusing on family engagement and cultural responsiveness, said she never dreamed of running for office, but through her volunteer work realized, \"if I don't do this, who's going to?\" \"So it's a long journey, but only in this country, only in this amazing country can you have the opportunity to become a mayor from a country that is still going through a civil war that I came from.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. Secretary of State Blinken testifies before a Senate panel about Afghanistan. Californians decide Tuesday whether to recall Gov. Newsom. Consumer Prices for August are expected to show a jump.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Californians have until 8 p.m. tonight local time to vote yes or no on recalling Governor Gavin Newsom. NOEL KING, HOST: President Biden was with his fellow Democrat last night, making the case to voters that this election is important. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The eyes of the nation - this is not hyperbole - the eyes of the nation are on California because the decision you're about to make isn't just going to have a huge impact on California; it's going to reverberate around the nation and, quite frankly and not a joke, around the world. MART\u00cdNEZ: With us now is Ben Christopher from CalMatters, a state news outlet that's part of a collaboration between California public radio stations and NPR. Ben, tell us some more about what President Biden's message was to California voters ahead of today's voting deadline. BEN CHRISTOPHER, BYLINE: Sure. Well, President Biden had plenty of nice things to say about Governor Newsom. He applauded the governor's aggressive handling of the pandemic, which he called courageous. He praised Newsom's progressive views on climate policy. But really, I think the thrust of the president's message was less about praising Newsom and more about warning what would happen if Newsom was replaced by a Republican. And in a way, the president was kind of making this recall into an extension of the 2020 presidential race. And that's very much in line with what the governor has been saying for months and months now, framing the recall, which is not officially partisan, as a strictly Republican effort, tying it specifically to the politics of former President Trump, who is obviously not super popular out here, broadly speaking, in California. So we've had this kind of narrative tug of war for months now, with supporters of the recall framing it as a referendum on the governor's job performance, on the pandemic, on the cost of living, on wildfire, on homelessness and so on, whereas Governor Newsom and the no campaign, it's kind of - it's really summed up in their campaign slogan, which is stop the Republican recall - emphasis on Republican. And given that Democrats do outnumber Republicans in California by almost 2 to 1, it's easy to see why they would pursue that strategy. And so, sure enough, President Biden in Long Beach yesterday very much hitting on that same theme. And in fact, he called the leading replacement candidate in this race, Larry Elder, the clone of Donald Trump. So there you go. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. And so - OK. So heading into the final day of voting, how is the governor polling? And his rivals, how are they polling? CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. So at this point, the governor is looking pretty secure in his job. Just to back up for a second because the recall process here is a little wonky. There are two questions on the ballot. The first is, do you support the recall? And polls put the no vote there leading by anywhere between 10 and as much as 20 percentage points. So it's looking pretty good for Governor Newsom. The second question is, if the recall is successful, who should replace Governor Newsom? And on that question, there's not much doubt Larry Elder is at least 10 points ahead of any other candidate in basically every poll. Larry Elder is a longtime conservative, sort of libertarian-leaning talk radio show host. He's kind of got a very confrontational style. He's kind of bombastic. And on labor protections and abortion rights and vaccine mandates and a whole host of issues, he's kind of outside the mainstream in California. It's not a coincidence that the president name-checked him last night. MART\u00cdNEZ: Ben, quickly - a lot of Democrats in the state are upset over how easy it is to trigger a recall in California. Any movement to change that? CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. It's definitely a conversation the Democrats in particular are having in the state. They've been having it all year, maybe making it a little bit harder to qualify a recall and also perhaps making it so that a replacement candidate would have to win a majority of the vote to become the governor. But that would require a ballot measure and another election. So... MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. All right. That's Ben Christopher with CalMatters. Ben, thanks a lot. CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: An unmitigated disaster and a disgrace - that's how some Republican lawmakers describe the end of the war in Afghanistan while questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing yesterday. KING: Blinken did push back. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONY BLINKEN: We inherited a deadline. We did not inherit a plan. KING: He will answer questions again today, this time before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen watched. Michele, things got pretty heated yesterday. So how did the secretary handle that? MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Yeah. Well, you know, he's kind of a very even-keeled kind of guy. But he bristled when some Republicans accused him and his administration of manipulating intelligence to downplay the threat of a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. He said no one was predicting the Afghan government and the Afghan armed forces would fall as quickly as they did. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLINKEN: The director of national intelligence has said that even in the days leading up to the Taliban takeover, intelligence agencies did not say collapse was imminent. This unfolded more quickly than we anticipated, including in the intelligence community. And I could go on. So what has been said and alleged is simply not true. KELEMEN: Now, some Republicans have been calling on him to resign. Others say his legacy has been tainted by this. He tried not to be drawn into a political fight, but Blinken did defend the decision to leave Afghanistan and carry out a deal that the Trump administration made with the Taliban. And he pointed out that the U.S. brought 124,000 people out of Kabul in very dangerous conditions last month. MART\u00cdNEZ: And obviously, still a lot of concern over those who were left behind. What is he doing about that? KELEMEN: Right. And he heard from both Republicans and Democrats about that because they've been very involved in trying to help those left behind, and they've been very frustrated with Blinken's State Department. The secretary says there are about 100 Americans and several thousand green card holders still trying to get out of Afghanistan. About 50 have made it out with U.S. help in recent days on a couple of flights from Kabul and some over land. But there are still hundreds, mostly Afghans who worked with the U.S., still waiting to get out on charter flights from Mazar-e-Sharif. And lawmakers have been pressing him about that and about the many, many others who just haven't gotten through a complicated visa process. MART\u00cdNEZ: Michele, what can you tell us about that vetting process of the thousands of Afghans who were evacuated? KELEMEN: Well, he says there are checks both in transit countries like Qatar and Germany, countries he visited last week, and here in the U.S., where refugees are going through processing centers for security and health checks before being cleared for resettlement. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about U.S. dealings with the Taliban - because many members of the new government face U.S. sanctions and are wanted by the FBI? So what has the secretary said about that? KELEMEN: Well, he described the interim government as very short of the mark that was set by the international community, he said, as members with very challenging records. You know, but - what Blinken's trying to do is work with other countries to make clear to the world - clear what the world expects of the Taliban. And that starts, he says, with allowing freedom of travel to anyone who wants to leave. He says the Taliban will also have to keep their counterterrorism commitments and respect basic rights if they want international legitimacy. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Michele Kelemen. Michele, thanks a lot. KELEMEN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. From the grocery aisles to the car lot, the stuff we need to buy just costs more and more these days. KING: That's right. Inflation in both June and July was 5.4%. That's the highest it's been in more than a dozen years. And when the consumer price index for August comes out later this morning, we could be looking at another jump. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Scott, what is driving these higher prices? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, there's still a lot of demand from consumers, and a lot of businesses are just having trouble keeping up. You know, some businesses say they don't have enough workers to make all the stuff that people are buying. We continue to see delays getting parts and products to market. All of that spells higher prices. A couple of things to watch for in today's report - first off is the overall rate of inflation. Is it going up, or is it leveling off? But we'll also be looking at what's getting more expensive and what, if anything, is getting cheaper. You know, lumber prices have come down from their peak in the spring. We expect to see falling prices for used cars as well. In addition, because of the delta variant, people aren't traveling or going out as much. So we could see a drop in the price of things like rental cars and concert tickets. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, both the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve have said repeatedly that they think this period of high inflation is a byproduct of the pandemic and that it's likely to be temporary. Are people buying that? HORSLEY: You know, financial markets are still betting that way, and most professional forecasters still see inflation moderating, although not right away. When it comes to regular folks, though, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York just put out a survey, and they generally do see prices staying higher for longer. On average, consumers now expect inflation to be 5.2% a year from now, so only a little bit lower than it was in June and July. And three years from now, consumers think inflation will still be 4%, which would be double the Federal Reserve's long-term target. The Fed does keep an eye on consumer expectations because if people think prices are going to keep climbing, there's a chance they might start to demand higher wages. And you can get into a sort of ugly feedback loop where wages and prices just keep ratcheting up. So the Fed is on guard for that, but it doesn't see that happening right now. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. Now for the politics of inflation, will these rising prices, Scott, be a political problem for President Biden? HORSLEY: You know, the White House is certainly sensitive to that. While the administration says it's not terribly worried about inflation, it has bent over backwards to show it's paying attention. Some prices pack more of a political punch than others - groceries, for example. People go shopping every week. And if there are big swings at the checkout aisle, they notice that. Just last week, the White House put out a report suggesting that concentration in the meatpacking industry is partly to blame for the rise in grocery prices. That's both a way to highlight the administration's efforts to promote competition and also maybe deflect a little anger over the rising cost of ground beef. Of course, gasoline is the most visible price in the country. We post that on great big signs outside every gas station. Gas prices have actually been pretty flat over the last month. It caught my eye over the weekend that the price here in D.C. has dropped below $3 a gallon now for the first time in a while. Of course, gas prices vary a lot around the country. $2.99 a gallon would seem pricey if you're living on the Gulf Coast, but it would seem dirt cheap where you are in California. MART\u00cdNEZ: Below $3 a gallon - Scott, it'd blow your brains out if you come to California and see those prices. That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks a lot. HORSLEY: Good to be with you.

Lithuania has faced a surge of mostly Iraqi asylum seekers crossing the border illegally from Belarus with the assistance of the government in Minsk.\n                \n                    \n                    Mindaugas Kulbis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Migrants rest at the newly built refugee camp near Rudninkai, Lithuania, earlier this month. Lithuania has faced a surge of mostly Iraqi asylum seekers crossing the border illegally from Belarus with the assistance of the government in Minsk. RUDNINKAI, Lithuania \u2014 The group of people walks tentatively forward, escorted by Belorussian guards dressed in riot gear. Then the guards yell \"Go!\" physically pushing those who seem reluctant to take further steps. This scene appears in one of several videos released by the governments of Latvia and Lithuania. They show thousands of people, most of them Iraqi, illegally entering the European Union in the last several weeks, with Belorussian officials appearing to shepherd them along. In Lithuania, more than 4,000 people have entered the country this way \u2014 more than 500 times the figure for all of last year. The three Baltic governments - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, all members of the European Union and NATO - call this a \"hybrid attack\" against them, the latest attempt by Belorussian leader Alexander Lukashenko to retaliate for EU sanctions. The bloc has imposed punitive measures against Lukashenko's regime for last year's fraudulent elections; for violence against pro-democracy activists protesting the outcome; and most recently for faking a bomb threat to force a flight between Athens and Vilnius to land in Minsk, the Belorussian capital, so that an opposition journalist on board could be arrested. \"Belarus is weaponizing international migration and making a special path for irregular migration to the border of the two Baltic states, Lithuania and Latvia,\" says Marija Golubeva, Latvia's interior minister. \"This is not any sort of spontaneous emergence of a migration trail to our countries; this is a specifically directed action by the government of Belarus as perhaps a way to have revenge on the European Union for the sanctions that were imposed after the plane was hijacked,\" she says. Iraqi asylum-seeker Salad Sadeq Ali says the stories he hears in the government reception center where he lives just outside Riga, the Latvian capital, bear out the Baltic governments' allegations. Though he arrived in Latvia using a human smuggler more than two months ago, Ali says most of the newer arrivals in the center confirm they booked flights from Baghdad to Minsk, got a tourist visa in their passports on arrival at the airport and then were helped by Belorussian officials to illegally cross the EU border. Ali says when he was looking for a route to get to the EU he considered traveling through Belarus far too dangerous. \"If they caught us, I thought we would get more than a year in prison,\" he said. But once Belarus began advertising such trips to Iraqis, according to Lithuanian officials, large numbers of people began crossing into the EU every night. Recently Lithuania reinforced its border with barbed wire and extra guards, some sent from the EU and other countries. Rudninkai Mayor Gennadi Baranovich stands in front of a banner demanding that asylum seekers not be allowed near the town.\n                \n                    \n                    Teri Schultz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rudninkai Mayor Gennadi Baranovich stands in front of a banner demanding that asylum seekers not be allowed near the town. Both Latvia and Lithuania also declared states of emergency on their Belorussian borders, which allows them to prevent people from entering and filing asylum claims. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte acknowledges Lukashenko's tactic has had some short-term success. \"This problem was imposed on us very wickedly, I would say, because it was a high number of people within a very short period of time,\" she explained. \"Definitely that was a very significant challenge and still is a very significant challenge for us to to find the places\" to lodge them. That challenge is playing out in the rural community of Rudninkai, about an hour from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. The migrant center, located at a nearby military training base, hosts more than 800 people and residents aren't happy about it. At an intersection on the main road into town, a small group of men are chatting in front of a sign that reads: \"Rudninkai says no to migrants.\" The men say they didn't put up the sign, but they readily admit to agreeing with it. One of the group is the town's mayor Gennadi Baranovich, who says even he wasn't notified about it in advance. \"The government has tricked us,\" he explained. \"They aren't telling people anything. If immigrants are coming here we should know what it means for our security.\" Authorities wouldn't grant access to the residents of the Rudninkai camp, who are held behind high metal fences, and they only allowed a photo of the outside of the facility at a distance. But journalists were previously allowed to interview inhabitants, many of whom complained about their treatment. Back at the Latvian holding center, Miks Celmi\u0146s, director of the NGO Make Room Latvia, is helping outnumbered staff distribute food and other essentials to the inhabitants, who are almost all in quarantine because of a coronavirus outbreak. Celmins says he understands his government feeling overwhelmed by the exponential increase in arrivals from Minsk, but he hopes Latvians have empathy for the migrants. \"They are just victims of the situation,\" he said. \"Obviously, this is somehow an organized criminal activity that is happening.\" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says this should not just be a concern for the Baltics or the EU, but for the \"whole democratic world,\" which he says \"needs to wake up.\" If Lithuania and Latvia hadn't blocked the Belorussian route, \"it could be scaled and it could be used against anybody, because it's extremely, extremely easy,\" Landsbergis explained. \"You just need a country or a rogue state that just stops the control of the border. To add to that, if it offers help for people to go to the border that it stops controlling, you have a hybrid attack.\" Minsk is allegedly also channeling people to Poland. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have called on the U.N. Security Council to take up the issue. If the situation isn't resolved, they have agreed to raise it as an \"Article 4\" security threat with NATO, one degree below summoning all allies to come to their mutual defense.",

The Biden administration says it will allow Hong Kong residents to remain and work in the U.S. for at least 18 months without fear of deportation. The White House is granting Hong Kong residents who are in the U.S. temporary \"safe haven,\" letting them remain and work in the country for at least 18 months without fear of deportation. The move, announced Thursday, comes in response to China's imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong that severely curbs free speech and the right to protest guaranteed by the agreement that handed back the city to Beijing in 1997 after a century of British rule. Under the rule change, the Department of Homeland Security will temporarily defer removal from the U.S. of Hong Kong residents who wish to remain. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in statement that it was meant to show \"strong support for people in Hong Kong in the face of ongoing repression by the People's Republic of China.\" \"Given the politically motivated arrests and trials, the silencing of the media, and the diminishing the space for elections and democratic opposition, we will continue to take steps in support of people in Hong Kong,\" she said. The action is certain to elicit an angry reception in Beijing, which has increasingly sought to quash Hong Kong's autonomy despite massive pro-democracy protests there starting in 2019. In a memo announcing the decision, the White House said that more than 10,000 people have been arrested in connection to the protests. Just days ago, the Chinese government imposed fresh sanctions on a handful of U.S. individuals in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the Biden administration on Chinese officials over Beijing's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong.",

Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., is weighing a run for the U.S. Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    House Television /AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., is weighing a run for the U.S. Senate. Democrats have struggled in Florida. Right now they hold just one statewide office \u2014 the agriculture commissioner \u2014 despite years of running candidates who come within narrow margins of a win. Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy from central Florida thinks she could be the one to change that trend in a potential run against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. \"I am thinking very seriously about whether or not to run,\" Murphy said in an interview with NPR. \"Florida deserves at least one senator who isn't focused on becoming president.\" Murphy has spent the past four years rising in the ranks of House Democrats and building a reputation as a moderate pragmatist with a history of working across the aisle. That should make her a natural leader in the House at a moment when \"bipartisan\" is the biggest buzzword in Washington. Florida's political scene is in flux: The state's Republican legislature is set to redraw congressional lines this year, putting Murphy's current district at risk of a dramatic shift to the right. That would put her political future in the House at risk. Murphy says she can replicate the success she has seen in her central Florida district, in part because her constituents look a lot like the rest of the state. \"I think about the way that I have served in the House as one of the most effective and bipartisan members,\" she said. \"I think about how I've been able to run in a difficult district that is a microcosm of the broader Florida dynamics of about a third D, a third R, a third independent, and win handily in these elections.\" Murphy hasn't officially announced her plans, but she's already facing a potential primary challenge from Rep. Val Demings, who has seen support from national Democrats. A national Democrat with knowledge of the party's strategy on Senate races told NPR's Claudia Grisales that Demings \"is strongly considering a Senate run.\" The official called Demings a \"formidable candidate,\" indicating national support even as Murphy considers her plan. Florida political consultant Fernand Amandi says Murphy, like most Democrats, faces other uphill battles within the state. \"Democrats have failed spectacularly here in Florida over the last 20 years,\" Amandi said. \"But the fact is, every single one of those races, for the most part, has been close, decided by less than 3 or 4 percentage points, and in most cases, even less than that. So the numbers continue to paint a tantalizing picture for Florida where it is competitive.\" Amandi says Florida Democrats are just less organized than Republicans. He says they need to win in the statewide races in 2022 to hobble GOP chances during the next presidential election. \"I think a lot of folks at the national level also see Florida as the front line for Trumpism,\" he said, \"and potentially the gateway toward the nomination for president in 2024.\" Murphy would bring a strong history of fundraising and a unique profile to a statewide campaign. She was elected in 2016, when Donald Trump won the state, and she won again in 2020, outperforming many other Democrats on the ticket. She attributes her success, in part, to a down-to-earth background that connects with voters personally and politically. She has experience in business and national security and is a fiscal moderate in a party that has shifted further left. Some of her moderate beliefs stem from her family's experience as refugees from communist Vietnam. \"I understand that I am fortunate to live in a country where we have a democratic governance system and a capitalist, free market economic system,\" Murphy said. \"We as Americans have the responsibility to make our systems more equitable, make sure that everybody has opportunities to vote and opportunities to get ahead in our economy.\" That's part of why she was able to avoid being branded a socialist in a state that is home to many voters who left communist countries like Cuba \u2014 even as Republicans claimed that all Democrats were left-wing ideologues. \"I think a lot of Democrats try to say, 'Oh well, it's apples to oranges,' \" Murphy said. \"But in the eyes of my constituents, it's all bad fruit when you're talking about socialism.\" Murphy is a consistent centrist. She chairs the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally moderate Democrats who often work with Republicans on legislation. But that history of bipartisanship has become harder to maintain following the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6. \"People lost their lives that day,\" she said. \"That's really hard to get over and forget, especially as we now have colleagues who are trying to tell a different story.\" During the riot, Murphy was in a room where she could hear police officers being crushed by rioters and doused in bear spray. She says it is challenging to work with Republicans who deny those events. Now she says she has a pragmatic approach to finding common ground. She says the coronavirus pandemic sharpened the focus for Democrats on getting aid to people in the country and following through on promises \u2014 even if that means Democrats have to work alone to pass priorities, like elements of President Biden's American Jobs Plan.\"My hope is that my Republican colleagues will be able to put their politics aside and their desire to 'own the libs' and do what's best for their communities and make investments in roads and bridges,\" she said, adding: \"Pragmatic does not necessarily mean bipartisan.\"",

Alaows came to Germany as an asylum-seeker from Syria in 2015. He launched a campaign to run in Germany's federal election in September for the Green Party but recently withdrew his candidacy. BERLIN \u2014 Tareq Alaows was hoping to become the first Syrian refugee to win a seat in Germany's parliament when the country goes to the polls in September. Speaking to NPR in February after announcing his candidacy with the Green Party, the 31-year-old lawyer and human rights activist from Damascus was full of ambition to help make Germany a better place. \"From my own experience as an asylum-seeker, I know that Germany needs to improve its integration policies, because they impact everyone, not just refugees,\" he said. \"I want to effect change for everyone in Germany.\" When Alaows fled the war in Syria in 2015, he thought he was leaving the threat of violence behind him. \"The whole reason I came to Europe was so that I could live in safety and with dignity,\" he said. That has not come to pass. Citing death threats and a racist offensive against him and people close to him, Alaows withdrew his candidacy to represent the constituency of Oberhausen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, in parliament on March 30. The intolerance and intimidation Alaows faces have been widely condemned but are nothing new for Muslim and nonwhite public figures, or for politicians who openly support refugees. His dramatic campaign ending follows a rise of ethnic discrimination and violence in Germany in recent years, according to the government's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency. \"We have a problem with racism\" Lamya Kaddor, at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2016, is running to represent a Duisburg district in September's election as a Green Party candidate.

Alaows is not currently talking to the press, although he has spoken to Green Party candidate Lamya Kaddor. \"I wasn't surprised by the threats and abuse pitted at Tareq, but I think he was,\" Kaddor said. \"We have a problem with racism in this country, and not just with far-right extremists. Racism is widespread, even in the middle of society.\" Kaddor, who is running to represent a Duisburg district in the September election, said she too faces racism daily. She was born in Germany to parents who came from Syria several decades ago. She vows she won't let intimidation stop her election campaign. \"I'm used to a certain level of hatred and hostility. It doesn't scare me anymore,\" Kaddor said. \"But it's frightening for Tareq, who's experiencing such vehement racist abuse for the first time.\" Like Kaddor, journalist Ferda Ataman was saddened but not surprised by Alaows' decision. \"Being the target of racist abuse and threats myself, I fully understand why Tareq Alaows has stepped down,\" said Ataman, who was born in Germany after her parents emigrated from Turkey. \"But it's very bitter news. Effectively, he's unable to take part in our democratic process, which is a damning verdict on our society.\" Ataman, who wrote the book Ich bin von hier. H\u00f6rt auf zu fragen! (I'm From Here. Stop Asking!), is the director of Neue deutsche Medienmacher, an organization that advocates for diversity in the media and politics and offers support to journalists facing racist threats. She said they have a long way to go.

Shrugging off blackface Two days after Alaows stepped aside, a public television station in the southern region of Bavaria aired an ostensibly satirical sketch about the election featuring a comedian in blackface. The comic was portraying a fictional Black dictator. The public media network, Bayerischer Rundfunk, told NPR that the comedian stands behind his decision to appear in blackface because \"as a satirist\" it's his \"job to present things in an exaggerated way.\" Ataman said the broadcaster's decision to air the sketch is indefensible. \"Unfortunately, blackfacing on television here is not that unusual, and it's only just starting to be questioned,\" she said. \"I think that says everything about where Germany is when it comes to tackling racism.\" Ataman said another glaring sign that racism is ingrained in society is the disproportionate representation of minorities in politics. She said between 92% and 96% of state and federal lawmakers are white, even though people with what's referred to here as a \"migration background\" make up 26% of Germany's population. Those are not the only issues. The latest annual report by the government's anti-discrimination agency indicated racist attacks were on the rise. Ataman said racism is wide-ranging, from everyday microaggressions to institutionalized discrimination and racial profiling in policing to de facto segregation in schools. Germany has also seen anti-Muslim and anti-refugee protests by a group called Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA. And it has witnessed far-right extremist attacks such as those the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi group, got away with for almost a decade until its only surviving leader was convicted in 2018. People hold balloons in the colors of the German national flag during a 2018 rally of a group called Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, in Dresden, Germany.\n                \n                    \n                    Jens Meyer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People hold balloons in the colors of the German national flag during a 2018 rally of a group called Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, in Dresden, Germany. In 2019, Walter L\u00fcbcke, a pro-refugee regional lawmaker in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party, was assassinated by a far-right extremist outside his home following a series of death threats. Journalists with minority backgrounds have also received threats. Die Zeit columnist Mely Kiyak \u2014 who was born in Germany to Kurdish parents \u2014 turned the hate mail she received into a theater show called Hate Poetry in which she and fellow journalists of color read the abuse in front an audience. Another withdrawn candidacy Another politician who has left the political arena because of racism is Sener Sahin. Last year, he dropped out of the race for mayor in the Bavarian town of Wallerstein. Sahin, who's Muslim, was intending to run for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to the CDU. \"When I announced my candidacy, there was a huge outcry from fellow CSU council members who said the C for CSU stands for Christian \u2014 not Muslim,\" Sahin said. \"So, I withdrew from the race before it really started. I didn't want to cause a rift in our town.\" Sahin, an engineer whose parents are from Turkey, was born in Germany but said he is still considered an outsider. \"They didn't like my name, my background or my faith,\" he said. \"That hurt, of course, because I knew that if I were named Thomas M\u00fcller, they'd have supported me.\" He said he's not one to bear grudges though. He magnanimously jokes that a year later his last name is now trending because of Ugur Sahin, the immunologist and founder of the German company BioNTech, which developed a COVID-19 vaccine with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer. (The two men are not related despite their shared surname, he added.) Filiz Kek\u00fcll\u00fcoglu, co-founder of a group working to empower minorities, women, trans and other marginalized people in the Green Party, said cases such as Sener Sahin's and Alaows' are typical and that political parties need to take a hard look at themselves. \"Every political party in Germany is far whiter than society, and this is a major deficit in our democracy,\" Kek\u00fcll\u00fcoglu said. \"We work with established politicians within the Green Party, people willing to question their own privileges who are open to power sharing.\" With polls suggesting the Greens could win enough seats in September to enter a coalition government with the CDU and CSU conservative alliance, Kek\u00fcll\u00fcoglu said their diversity initiative may end up working overtime. Markus S\u00f6der, the state governor of Bavaria and leader of the CSU who just backed out of the race to succeed Merkel as chancellor, attended a carnival event in 2015 dressed as Mahatma Gandhi in brownface. Similar incidents in countries such as the United States and Canada are considered offensive and spark public outcries. But Ataman said the fact that S\u00f6der's appearance in brownface was barely raised during his candidacy is symbolic of a wider lack of anti-racist awareness within German politics and society. As for Alaows, it was not just overt hate that prevented him from running in the election, he said, but also the racist structures the country has failed to question. In a statement announcing his withdrawal, he said, \"My candidacy showed that in all parties in politics and across society, strong structures are needed to confront racism and help those affected.\"",

Updated at 5 p.m. ET President Biden said on Thursday that he will work with allies and partners to sanction Myanmar, end the war in Yemen, admit more refugees, and protect the rights of LGBTQ people around the world, signaling his plans to chart a course away from former President Donald Trump's \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. Biden did not utter Trump's name in his first foreign policy speech as president, which he delivered at the State Department in Washington, D.C. But he said he has begun to try to repair the damage he said his predecessor did to America's reputation as a leader on democracy and human rights issues. \"Over the past two weeks, I've spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends \u2014 Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea and Australia \u2014 to begin reforming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscles of democratic alliances that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and, I would argue, abuse,\" Biden said. The president said the United States' democratic values had \"come under intense pressure in recent years\" and were \"pushed to the brink in the last few weeks\" \u2014 an allusion to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol as Congress gathered to tally election results, a riot that shocked Americans and the world. Russia and Myanmar Biden addressed two new crises that have emerged during his first two weeks in office: the detention of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and a military coup in Myanmar. On Myanmar, Biden said he had been in touch with Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell about a bipartisan response to try to urge the Southeast Asian nation's military to release detained activists and officials, and end the coup. His national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters that the White House is working with international partners on sanctions for individuals and entities controlled by the military. \"We believe we have plenty of space to be able to find the types of sanctions targets necessary to sharpen the choice for the Burmese military,\" Sullivan said. The White House is also considering an executive order on the issue, he said. On Russia, Biden said he had made clear to President Vladimir Putin \"in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens are over.\" War in Yemen Biden singled out the long-running civil war in Yemen as one area of focus. He said the U.S. would not support \"offensive operations\" in Yemen \u2014 though the details of that were not immediately clear \u2014 and would beef up humanitarian aid. Biden also named a special envoy at the State Department to work on ways to end the conflict. Sullivan told reporters that two arms sales made by the Trump administration \u2014 to the United Arab Emirates and to Saudi Arabia \u2014 would be halted, but that actions the U.S. takes against AQAP, an extremist group known as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, would not be affected by the decision. Biden said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will lead a review of where American forces are around the world, and put a hold on a Trump-era decision to move U.S. troops out of Germany during that review. Focus on refugees Biden announced a presidential memorandum on protecting the rights of LGBTQ people worldwide, \"including by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers,\" he said. Biden also vowed to increase the number of refugees allowed into the United States to 125,000 people during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and look for ways to make what he called a \"downpayment\" on his goal in the meantime. Trump had pushed to reduce refugee admission to 15,000 people, its lowest level in modern times. \"Raising the ceiling will literally be lifesaving for hundreds of thousands [of people] fleeing violence and persecution because of the color of their skin, how they worship or who they love,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the chief executive of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in an interview. \"In the last four years under Trump, the refugee resettlement program hit rock bottom. If you think of the program as a car, not only did the Trump administration slam on the brakes, it tried intentionally to dismantle the engine,\" she said. Kevin Appleby, a longtime immigration advocate who works on refugee issues, said it will take time for the Biden administration to lift the cap to reach its goal. \"The Trump administration tried to strangle the program to death, and they nearly succeeded,\" said Appleby, a board member of the Hope Border Institute.

            "article_content": "OSLO \u2014 This year's Nobel Peace Prize recipients \u2014 two investigative journalists from the Philippines and Russia \u2014 used their acceptance speeches today to criticize social media companies for spreading disinformation and to warn about the growing spread of authoritarianism. Maria Ressa, the CEO of Rappler, a Filipino news site, said social media companies have a responsibility to fight disinformation and its corrosive effects on public discourse and democracy. \"If you're working in tech, I'm talking to you,\" said Ressa, addressing dignitaries in Oslo's cavernous city hall. \" How can you have election integrity if you don't have integrity of facts?\" \"What happens on social media doesn't stay on social media,\" Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa said on Friday, as she accepted the award in Oslo's city hall.\n                \n                    \n                    Per Ole Hagen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"What happens on social media doesn't stay on social media,\" Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa said on Friday, as she accepted the award in Oslo's city hall. The other winner, Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, spoke of the growing dangers of practicing journalism in an authoritarian state. Since 2000, six journalists and contributors to the newspaper have been murdered. \"Journalism in Russia is going through a dark valley,\" Muratov told the audience, which had been reduced from a planned 1,000 to just 200 in recent days because of rising COVID-19 cases in Oslo. \"Over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as 'foreign agents.' In Russia, this means 'enemies of the people.'\" But Muratov said investigative journalists are crucial to helping people understand current affairs. He cited a recent example in which reporters discovered that the number of Belarusian flights from the Middle East to Minsk, the Belarusian capital, had quadrupled in the fall. Belarus was encouraging refugees to mass at the Belarus-Polish border to engineer a migration crisis that analysts say is designed to destabilize the European Union. Muratov added that, despite growing risks, reporters must continue to dig for facts. \"As the great war photographer Robert Capa said: 'If your picture isn't good enough, you aren't close enough,' \" Muratov said. Rappler's reporting has been too close for the Philippine government. When the website exposed the government's murderous war on drugs five years ago, supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte turned to social media to attack and spread false information about Ressa and the company. Since then, Ressa said, other countries, including the United States, have seen how the unchecked spread of disinformation can create alternative realities and threaten democracy. \"Silicon Valley's sins came home to roost in the United States on January 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill,\" she said. \"What happens on social media doesn't stay on social media.\" NPR London producer Jessica Beck contributed to this report",

Both men were anti-communists during the Soviet period and sought an opening to the West.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 When President Biden greets scores of nations at his virtual \"Summit for Democracy\" this coming week, one member of the Western alliance won't be there. Hungary, on the Eastern edge of the European Union, was not invited. Washington and EU leaders in Brussels have repeatedly accused the country's ultranationalist government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, of undermining democracy. Biden once name-checked Hungary when referring to the \"thugs of the world.\" But Laszlo Magas, a retired professor who helped bring an end to communism in Hungary, chalks up his country's political isolation to one thing: Western liberal bias. \"Hungary is not the West's colony,\" says Magas, an Orb\u00e1n supporter who echoes many of the prime minister's views. \"The whole world is being misled about us. The mainstream media is full of fake news about us. The liberals want you to think Hungary doesn't know what democracy is because we don't share their beliefs.\" Europe, he says, is ideologically divided between the conservative East and the more liberal West, something like red-and-blue America. \"And the border is the [former] Iron Curtain,\" Magas says. \"We in the East are the ones protecting traditional European values, Christian values, while the West has gone crazy.\" Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party have become the flag-bearers of this mindset during their decade in power. The Hungarian government has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over migration, multiculturalism, press freedom and, most recently, LGBTQ rights. Its target in this culture war has been liberal democracy, which Orb\u00e1n has tried to equate with leftist and \"unpatriotic\" beliefs. Orb\u00e1n is instead promoting \"illiberal democracy,\" a term coined by journalist Fareed Zakaria to describe countries where elected leaders undermine checks on power. Orb\u00e1n first used the term in a 2014 speech promoting governance in the national interest, citing China, Russia and Turkey as examples. Four years later, after his party won in a landslide election, he declared that \"we have replaced a shipwrecked liberal democracy with a 21st-century Christian democracy\" that supports tradition and security. \"He's trying to position himself to play the role that [Cuban leader] Fidel Castro played for the left in the 1970s,\" says political scientist Ivan Krastev, who with Stephen Holmes, co-wrote The Light That Failed: Why the West Is Losing the Fight for Democracy, an examination of Eastern Europe's disillusionment with liberal democracy. \"The leftists fell in love with Castro for standing up for things they believed in, for being a revolutionary. Orb\u00e1n and Hungary are playing the same role now, but for conservatives,\" Krastev says. Hungary has become a magnet for European far-right nationalists and American conservatives. Fox News host Tucker Carlson took his show to Hungary for a week this August, treating Orb\u00e1n to a glowing interview. Former Vice President Mike Pence followed with September visit at which he said he hoped the U.S. would overturn abortion rights. Pence also praised the Hungarian government's promotion of \"traditional family values\" at the Budapest Demographics Summit, an annual paean to increasing population through more childbirth instead of immigration. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n gives a press conference following a meeting of prime ministers of central Europe's informal body of cooperation, called the Visegrad Group (V4) in Budapest, Hungary, last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n gives a press conference following a meeting of prime ministers of central Europe's informal body of cooperation, called the Visegrad Group (V4) in Budapest, Hungary, last month. And next year, the American Conservative Union is planning to hold a version of its Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest. The two groups \u2014 nationalists from behind the former Iron Curtain, and U.S. conservatives aligned with former President Donald Trump \u2014 exploit the same fear, Krastev says, \"and this is the fear that there are not enough of us, that we're living in the world in which we are going to be replaced, in which our numbers are shrinking and in which we are going to lose our identity.\" Laszlo Magas did not have those fears when he and other democracy activists pushed in 1989 to bring down the communist system and its strict limits on freedom of speech, assembly, religion and movement. Magas, then a forestry engineering professor in the city of Sopron, helped organize a protest known as the Pan-European Picnic in a field near the border with Austria. After thousands of young Hungarians and East Germans gathered there, Hungary's government opened the border, months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was the first breach of the Iron Curtain. \"We thought we could be free as part of a unified Europe if only we could open that border,\" Magas says. But the initial elation of freedom gave way to culture shock, as Eastern European economies struggled and millions migrated west. Laszlo Nagy, another organizer of the picnic protest, says communism put Soviet bloc societies into \"the deep freezer\" after World War II. \"And when we emerged from this deep freezer in 1990, we went right into the microwave,\" he says. \"The changes came too fast.\" Krastev, who grew up in Bulgaria, another Iron Curtain country, says an existential crisis brewed in Eastern Europe. \"We wanted to be like the West, but the very moment you want to be like somebody else, it means that probably this somebody else is better than you,\" he says. \"And then you start to have the fear of what about our own identity? What is going to happen?\" These questions have lingered in Hungary, a country of 10 million that has long seen itself as a small nation fighting to survive a long list of occupiers, including the Soviet-backed communists. \"During communism, Hungarian people were basically told by the Soviets how to live,\" says Natalia Borza, a philosopher and linguist in Budapest. \"And OK, 30 years passed but still we have the memory of what it feels like being under someone else's rules.\" Orb\u00e1n has maintained his defiant message since he was a communist-fighting law student in the 1980s. In 2015, when more than a million asylum-seekers arrived in Europe, he presented them as invaders seeking to erase European demographics and culture. He rejected EU mandates to take in relocated refugees and to conform to Brussels' standards for rule of law. More recently, at the demographics summit, Orb\u00e1n accused the \"Western left wing\" of trying to \"relativize the notion of family.\" \"Its tools for doing so are gender ideology and the LGBTQ lobby, which are attacking our children,\" he said. Orb\u00e1n's government recently passed a controversial law restricting the teaching of LGBTQ issues in schools. It was prompted by the publication in 2020 of Wonderland Is For Everyone, a children's storybook featuring gay, nonbinary and transgender characters. Boldizsar Nagy, who edited the storybook, says he received death threats as the government attacked it. \"It became a tool for them, and they used it as the symbol of the 'Western enemy,' of Western decay,\" he says. Boldizsar Nagy is the editor of Wonderland Is for Everyone, a children's storybook featuring gay, nonbinary and transgender characters. The book's publication has led to an outcry on the right in Hungary.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The new law means books with LGBTQ themes are wrapped in plastic and forbidden to be sold within 650 feet of schools or churches. It also forbids high schools to invite educators like Eszter Ari, an evolutionary biologist and LGBTQ advocate, to speak about tolerance. Ari says the government wants Hungary's LGBTQ citizens \"to be quiet about who they are, or leave the country.\" \"The government has made us, their own citizens, the enemy,\" she says. \"They want to divide the people so they are afraid and don't think about things like government corruption.\" The law has angered Western European leaders like Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, which, in 2001, became the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage. Hungary \"has no business being in the EU anymore,\" Rutte said this summer. The European Union is threatening to cut funding to Hungary, which concerns even Hungarians who support Orb\u00e1n's stand in the culture wars. Eszter Ari is an educator, evolutionary biologist and LGBTQ activist who advocates tolerance.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Seventeen-year-old Annamaria Veszten considers herself a conservative and says she appreciates Orb\u00e1n fighting for traditional values. But she's lived her whole life in a Hungary that's part of the European Union. \"It's very good for our economy to be part of it,\" she says. I met Veszten this summer in Esztergom, a city north of Budapest, that hosted a conference organized by Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a private educational institution that recently received more than $1.7 billion from Orb\u00e1n's government. The conference headlined talks by American conservatives including Carlson, writer Rod Dreher and talk radio host Dennis Prager. Veszten came away troubled that some attendees ridiculed and booed speakers with liberal views. \"It is not just Europe divided but also this country,\" she said. \"I don't feel like we are part of one nation. It's more like two nations already.\" Congregants at the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship, a modest Methodist church on the outskirts of Budapest, feel the same way. On a recent Sunday morning, a woman offers a prayer for Western-funded nonprofits that the government has labeled foreign agents. Another offers thanks for the church's tall, white-bearded pastor, Gabor Ivanyi. \"I know what it feels like to be cast out,\" Ivanyi says. \"So I decided to become the kind of pastor who shows solidarity with those who are marginalized.\" Like Orb\u00e1n and Magas, who helped organize the 1989 protest to bring down the Iron Curtain, the clergyman fought the communist system. Hungary's Soviet-backed government evicted him from his church and boarded it up. For years, he was forced to preach on the streets. Pastor Gabor Ivanyi of the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship, a modest Methodist church on the outskirts of Budapest, worries about a growing left-right divide in Hungarian society.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ivanyi met Orb\u00e1n while fighting communism, and at first, they were allies. He baptized two of Orb\u00e1n's children and renewed the prime minister's wedding vows. But the pastor says he is angry that Orb\u00e1n uses Christianity to vilify migrants and political critics. \"The protection of Christian values should not be handled by politicians,\" Ivanyi says, \"because politicizing Christianity has steered European civilization to its utter demise twice.\" There are signs that culture wars have limits. Orb\u00e1n is wooing two Eastern powers \u2014 China and Russia \u2014 that both Hungarians and conservative culture warriors associate with communist suppression. \"Orb\u00e1n sees relations with these countries as pragmatic, especially financially, and also as strategy in his fight with Brussels,\" says Andras Kosa, an Orb\u00e1n biographer. \"But Hungarians do not trust Moscow and Beijing and do not want to get too close to them.\" Hungarians go to the polls next spring, and Orb\u00e1n will face a newly united opposition. Its candidate is P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, a Christian conservative who is the mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, a small city in rural Hungary. M\u00e1rki-Zay is running on an anti-corruption platform and promises to defend Hungary's identity, but not at the expense of democratic institutions. He also says he will repair relations with the EU and Washington. \"I still stand for Western values,\" M\u00e1rki-Zay told the AP last month. \"We cannot accept a corrupt thug ... who betrays Western values and who is now a servant of Communist China and Russia.\" A recent poll shows the opposition is giving Orb\u00e1n's government a run for its money. But Orb\u00e1n is sticking to his script. In a recent speech, he ridiculed the West as a place where \"they can give birth as a man.\" He also took a page out of Trump's playbook and suggested that Brussels and Washington are planning to meddle in the upcoming election. \"Even the entirety of the Left won't be able to stop us,\" he says.

But inside, the staircases are dark, the hallways quiet and the offices empty.\n                \n                    \n                    Laura Sullivan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption For more than 70 years, the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington, D.C., has held down the corner lot in a neighborhood of grand embassies. With its giant black, red and green flag, lush landscaping and stately brick and stone, it's hard to tell the republic has fallen. Inside though, it's clear Afghanistan is now a country broken. The staircases are dark, the hallways quiet and the offices empty this day. Except for one, on the top floor, where Abdul Hadi Nejrabi, the deputy ambassador, is working. A new ambassador was designated in July, but about three weeks later, Kabul fell to the Taliban. \"We continue to operate here at the embassy,\" Nejrabi explains from his office overlooking a large, manicured garden. \"We have to continue. We don't have any other options.\" Nejrabi has a shelf full of binders on Afghan election results and Afghan public opinion surveys \u2014 two things that hardly matter anymore. \"We choose to serve the people,\" he says. \"That's the reason we are here. We can't close the door of the embassy.\" They haven't closed the door yet, but they may not be able to keep it open much longer. The Afghan republic, the government before the Taliban, used to fund the embassy in quarterly installments. Now that money has almost run out. Abdul Hadi Nejrabi, the deputy ambassador, is one of the few employees left at the Afghan Embassy. \"We choose to serve the people,\" he says. \"That's the reason we are here.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Laura Sullivan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abdul Hadi Nejrabi, the deputy ambassador, is one of the few employees left at the Afghan Embassy. \"We choose to serve the people,\" he says. \"That's the reason we are here.\" Nejrabi has let most of the staff go. He and the other 11 diplomats here are working for free, racing to help thousands of Afghans who still want to escape the Taliban and also help refugees get the documents they need to start new lives. Nejrabi says they can keep working for a few more months. But eventually even he, the diplomats, and the few staffers left will have to find a way to pay their own rent and electric bills. The State Department told them they will be allowed to stay in the U.S. The embassy, once a powerful symbol of a new Afghanistan, was staffed to serve a republic that no longer exists. Nejrabi says none of them can see a world where they will serve the Taliban. But they can't go home either. \"Currently they captured [my] house in Kabul,\" he says, \"that was built by my father 35 years ago.\" The Taliban took all of his family's possessions. They are now in hiding, hoping to escape. Every week he talks on the phone with his former colleagues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They are also living in fear. They beg him to help them get out, and he's trying. He's only heard from the Taliban once. A few weeks ago the acting foreign minister sent all the ambassadors at embassies around the world a link to a Zoom meeting. \"The Taliban tried,\" he says. \"All of our embassies refused that and no one attended that Zoom call.\" A small smile crosses Nejrabi's face. He explains that he and the other ambassadors confirmed with each other that not a single one of them showed up. \"We refused because we don't recognize them,\" he says. \"We are not representing them and they are a terrorist group.\" Most of the embassies are too far away for the Taliban to reach, yet they cannot survive on their own. Embassies need countries \u2014 countries with governments their host countries recognize. You can see this played out in a long hallway outside Nejrabi's office, where a dozen portraits of former ambassadors line the walls. \"You can see it from there,\" he says, pointing to the first portrait at the end of the hallway, \"from the first time we opened the embassy [in] 1943.\" As he moves down the portraits, he stops at the year 1981. The portraits suddenly jump to 2002. \"The gap was here,\" he says, holding his hands up between the frames. \"The next ambassador was 2002 after the removal of the Taliban from power.\" The gap is just a few inches of beige wall, but it represents 20 years of chaos, civil war and brutal totalitarian control. During those 20 years, this building was closed and shuttered. State Department officials say the U.S. holds embassies in trust until new governments are recognized. Not too far from here, the Iranian Embassy has been frozen in such a state for more than 40 years now. In a long hallway at the Afghan Embassy, a dozen portraits of former ambassadors line the walls in order of the years they served. The portraits skip the years between 1981 and 2002, a gap that includes the previous time the Taliban were in power.\n                \n                    \n                    Laura Sullivan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption As Nejrabi makes his way down to the stately rooms on the first floor, he says he worries each day that the U.S. will eventually recognize the Taliban. Pressure is growing as Afghanistan descends into economic chaos and starvation, and terrorist groups ISIS-K and al-Qaida are threatening its stability. The Taliban have also made some inroads with Russia, China and Pakistan in recent weeks that could lend them credibility on the world stage. At the embassy, the reception room is still anchored by the republic's flag. Nejrabi says he can't imagine the Taliban here. \"This room is a symbol of Afghanistan,\" he says. \"When I come here every day it brings hope to me. That we have a country, a tricolor flag and one day we will free our country back, and we will take it from the Taliban.\" The room is still set up for a party. White tablecloths line the tables with candlesticks and gold Chiavari chairs, waiting for guests who are no longer coming. Nejrabi says he and the other diplomats will stay as long as they possibly can. Then they will turn out the lights and hope it won't be another 20 years before someone turns them back on.",

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with him about the closure of Australia's refugee processing center.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When the author Behrouz Boochani won Australia's biggest literary prize a few years ago for his book \"No Friend But The Mountains,\" he was imprisoned on a remote island of Papua New Guinea. Manus Island is where Australia held asylum-seekers like him indefinitely for years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BEHROUZ BOOCHANI: The Australian government called this place a camp or offshore processing center, but for us, it's a prison. SHAPIRO: Boochani had that conversation with NPR in 2018, and the next year, New Zealand gave him a way out. This week, Australia said that it will close its refugee processing center in Papua New Guinea, and so we've called Behrouz Boochani to hear his reaction. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. BOOCHANI: Hello. Thank you very much for having me. SHAPIRO: Australia is not abandoning this policy altogether. It will still hold refugees offshore, both on its territory Christmas Island and on the island nation of Nauru. So what is your reaction to this news of the Papua New Guinea facility closing? BOOCHANI: The biggest problem is that still the policy exists, and anyone who comes to Australia, they banish them to the Pacific islands. And still, 124 people are in Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea. They closed the Manus prison camp, like, three years ago, but they hold people in Port Moresby. So I think nothing big changed here. You know, what about those people who remain in Port Moresby? SHAPIRO: What do the people who are still there tell you about what their life is like these days? BOOCHANI: So, you know - so I was there, so I know how the situation is. So in that country, the problem is safety. Four months ago, some gangs, they attacked the refugees. They put gun on them and robbed them. And that is not the first time that something like this happened. SHAPIRO: These places that Australia calls offshore processing centers you have described as sites of despair and torture. You've called them prisons. Do you think Australia is trying to improve its public image by closing this site in Papua New Guinea without actually changing the policy or closing the other sites? BOOCHANI: No, I think Australia, they think about election. So we are getting close to the federal election in Australia. And that's why - always Australian government has a plan, you know, since 2001 that they introduced this policy. I don't know why, really, why this media are caring about what they say, you know? Always they say they closed this, they closed that, they closed that, you know, but still, the policy is there, people are there. Nothing happened here, you know? SHAPIRO: There has been so much international criticism of this policy. The U.N. has said Australia's asylum processing policies violate the Convention Against Torture. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court says it amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. And so why do you think it persists? BOOCHANI: Because that is how Australia is, you know? We are talking about a country with a long history of colonialism. That is Australian mentality. And unfortunately, Australia has become a model for other countries. That is a huge problem. Sometimes I think - I say that we are living in the age of camps, you know? SHAPIRO: Your book \"No Friend But The Mountains\" made you almost an international spokesperson for these refugees who are caught in limbo in hopes of entering Australia or finding some landing place. When you speak to them today - and they know that you talk to reporters all over the world - is there one thing that they want the public to know? BOOCHANI: You know, the refugees who are in Port Moresby, they don't care how people think about them. They don't care what history will judge about Australia. Hope - just they want to get freedom. You know, they want just - they want to start a new life, you know, somewhere in the country, that they be able to start a new life, you know? SHAPIRO: That is Kurdish Iranian journalist and author Behrouz Boochani speaking with us from New Zealand. Thank you very much. BOOCHANI: Thank you very much. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

            "article_content": "Colson Whitehead was awarded Pulitzer Prizes for his last two novels, The Underground Railroad and The Nickel Boys.\n\n                    \n                    Chris Close/Penguin Random House\n                    \n                \nhide caption Colson Whitehead was awarded Pulitzer Prizes for his last two novels, The Underground Railroad and The Nickel Boys. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead does extensive background research whenever he works on a book. For his latest novel, Harlem Shuffle, that meant learning how stolen items get \"fenced.\" \"There's not a lot of literature about fences,\" Whitehead says. \"But there is actually a book ... [that's] a sociological a study about these guys in the Midwest in the '60s, and one of the first things that struck me was their description of [the fences] being a wall between the straight world and the crooked world.\" In Whitehead's novel, the main character, Ray Carney, is that wall. Carney owns a furniture store on 125th Street in Harlem, but he has a sideline trafficking in stolen goods. Whitehead says inspiration for the story came to him a few years back, when he was deciding on a movie to watch. \"I was just thinking about how much I like heist movies and thinking [about] how much fun the directors and writers must have put it all together,\" he says. \"And asked myself ... can I do that?\" Whitehead's two most recent books were historical novels set in the South. The Underground Railroad and The Nickel Boys focused on the brutality of slavery and institutional racism. Writing them back-to-back exacted a heavy emotional toll. \"As I was finishing The Nickel Boys and bringing the boys closer to their tragic fate ... I felt very depressed and depleted,\" Whitehead says. \"I finished the book and then just played video games and barbecued for six weeks and that's how I came back into myself.\" Working on Harlem Shuffle was different: \"Having fun with this crime genre and some of the supporting cast who are kind of colorful was a relief,\" Whitehead says. \"From the first page of writing the book and getting back into writing a book set in New York, I felt I was on my home turf.\" On choosing to set his heist novel in Harlem between 1959 and 1964 The first thing I thought was [that] crooks might exploit some big New York event. So I tried to think of [ideas]: Should I use the blackout of '77 and then use that for cover for a heist? The riot of the early '40s, which happened when a cop abused a Black person in Harlem? And then I thought, Ralph Ellison kind of owns that because Invisible Man, so I can't really go there. [Then, I thought of] the riot of '64, after a young Black teenager was killed by a white policeman. And so once I had '64, it all flowed from there. And I split up into three sections, 1959, '61 and '64 and try to find different pegs for what's happening in New York that could serve the story. On learning about \"fences\" (the people who resell stolen goods) I decided to have a fence for a hero because I always find it appalling when I watch a heist movie and the criminals have stolen their $2 million in jewels and half the gang is dead and the cops [are] looking for them, and then they go to the fence and the fence says, \"I'll give you 10 cents on the dollar.\" And it's always so appalling and I'm so mad, and I figured that would be a good person to figure out for a book. ... Things come in stolen, slightly \"previously owned\" and then they go out into the world ready for the next owner cleaned up. And ... I immediately mapped [that divide] onto Carney's personality. He has this part of himself that wants to leave the life that he grew up in and have a business and go to college and have a nice family. But there is that call in his blood ... and that struggle going back and forth is paralleled by the fence's role and speaks to so much of how I think a lot of us live. I think there are a lot of us who have different parts of us, reconciled, unreconciled, and sometimes that's the drama of our lives. On how fencing stolen goods works When I was reading these sociological studies of fences, one thing that was made apparent very early was that they often have fronts, front stores. And so the main guy in this one study reupholstered furniture. In the front of the store, he has these used armchairs that he's refurbished and where does he get them? He goes to the swap meet, and at the swap meet, there's like a rare coin guy over there. And so a criminal has given the fence these jewels and coins and other things to watch, and he'll find other dealers at a swap meet. He'll sell them at his store. But you're connected in this shadowy underground of people who specialize in this or that particular thing. If you put your diamond necklace in the hands of your jewelry connection, that person who has connections to the legit broader marketplace, and so something that is stolen on Tuesday could re-enter the supply chain on Friday. And it's very fluid and the idea of a front, the front that you have out to the world with the sort of bad business in the back is applicable, definitely, to Carney's personality. On recognizing a front business when he sees one I still continue to be a failure to know what stores are fronts and what is not. When I lived in Brooklyn ... in the '90s, I would go to the store to buy a six pack of beer and the store is completely empty except for like S.O.S and Brillo pads, two Twinkies and a six-pack of Corona. And I go to pay for the beer and the guy is like, \"What are you doing in here? Like, don't you get it?\" And so then my friends would tell me, \"Oh, that's a weed spot.\" Like, it's not really legit. So I'm very oblivious. On tracing the migration of people in Harlem and in his fiction One hundred fifty years ago, Harlem [was] farmland, and then speculators put up buildings, and then the tenements and townhouses were filled with all these refugees from Europe. And it's Italians and Irish, Jews from all over Europe, and they come to make their way in this new country. They cross the water, they enter the middle class and move away to the suburbs, to downtown different neighborhoods in Manhattan. They're replaced by a wave of Black migration from the South, from the Caribbean. My grandmother came through Ellis Island in 1920, from Barbados. What I love in doing the research is walking through these different neighborhoods and seeing these old brownstones and townhouses and imagining that churn. I mentioned the churn of stolen goods and out of people's hands. And there is this churn inside these humble townhouses, all those different lives and those different rivers and oceans that they've crossed to come here, and they enter the middle class or they don't. In the same way there's all this the secret history behind the storefronts, the bakeries and crooked stationery stores, it's this whole secret history of these townhouses. On his 2011 novel Zone One about a plague that turns people into zombies and if COVID made him think about that book again I was always thinking about it in a very depressing way, just being locked down and remembering this or that passage from the book. But mostly I was angry about the things I didn't get right. The characters in the book are called \"sweepers,\" and they go door to door, retrieving dead bodies and taking out the last of the zombies so that they can restart civilization. So I didn't realize how much toilet paper they would find when they went into these different folks' apartments. So that was a failure of my imagination. And then secondly, I had no idea that people would say, \"Oh, the zombie virus is just like the flu. It doesn't really matter,\" or \"I'm not going to get the zombie vaccine,\" the depths of the denial and psychosis around vaccines I couldn't foresee. So if I did it over again, definitely there'll be people who would resist the zombie vaccine and suffer the consequences, which would be unfortunate.

Francis is opening his first foreign trip since undergoing major intestinal surgery in July, embarking on a four-day, two-nation trip to Hungary and Slovakia.\n                \n                    \n                    Vatican Media via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pope Francis exchanges gifts with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, at Budapest's Museum of Fine Arts on Sunday. Francis is opening his first foreign trip since undergoing major intestinal surgery in July, embarking on a four-day, two-nation trip to Hungary and Slovakia. BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Pope Francis urged Hungary on Sunday to \"extend its arms towards everyone,\" in a veiled critique of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-migrant policies as the pontiff opened a four-day visit to Central Europe, his first big international outing since undergoing intestinal surgery in July. Francis, 84, appeared in good form during his short visit to Budapest, presiding over a lengthy Mass for a crowd organizers said reached 100,000 people. The pope stood and waved to crowds during a jaunt in his open-sided popemobile and used a golf cart to avoid walking long distances indoors, confessing at one point that he had to sit because \"I'm not 15 anymore.\" But otherwise he kept up the typical grueling pace of a papal trip despite his ongoing recovery. Francis only spent seven hours in Budapest before moving on Sunday afternoon to a four-day tour of neighboring Slovakia. The lopsided itinerary suggested that Francis wanted to avoid giving Orban \u2014 the type of populist nationalist Francis frequently criticizes \u2014 the political boost that comes with hosting a pope for a proper state visit ahead of elections next spring. Francis did meet upon arrival with Orban, whose refugee policies clash with the pope's call for welcome and integration of those seeking better lives in Europe. While migration wasn't on the stated agenda, Orban wrote on Facebook: \"I asked Pope Francis not to let Christian Hungary perish.\" Orban has frequently depicted his government as a defender of Christian civilization in Europe and a bulwark against migration from Muslim-majority countries. Francis has expressed solidarity with migrants and refugees and criticized what he called \"national populism\" advanced by governments like Hungary's. He has urged governments to welcome and integrate as many migrants as they can. The Vatican said the meeting was held in a \"cordial atmosphere\" and lasted longer than expected \u2014 40 minutes. \"Among the various topics discussed were the role of the church in the country, the commitment to the protection of the environment, the protection and promotion of the family,\" said a Vatican statement. Vatican and Hungarian officials have insisted Francis wasn't snubbing Hungary by staying for such a short time, noting that the Hungarian church and state only invited him to close out an international conference on the Eucharist on Sunday. Pope Francis arrives to celebrate a mass for the closing of the International Eucharistic Congress at Budapest's Heroes Square on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Laszlo Balogh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pope Francis arrives to celebrate a mass for the closing of the International Eucharistic Congress at Budapest's Heroes Square on Sunday. It was at the end of that Mass that Francis urged Hungarians to remain steadfast in their religious roots, but not in a defensive way that closes them off from the rest of the world and the needs of others. \"Religious sentiment has been the lifeblood of this nation, so attached to its roots,\" he said. \"Yet the cross, planted in the ground, not only invites us to be well-rooted, it also raises and extends its arms toward everyone.\" He said Hungarians should stay firm in their roots while \"opening ourselves to the thirst of the men and women of our time.\" \"My wish is that you be like that: rounded and open, rooted and considerate,\" he said. Orban had a front-row seat during the Mass. During their private meeting, he gave Francis a copy of a letter from King Bela IV of Hungary to Pope Innocent IV, according to the prime minister's press chief. The letter, addressed in 1243, informed Innocent IV that Bela would strengthen fortifications along the Danube River in Hungary in preparation for a Mongol invasion. The congress, which concluded with a Mass in Heroes' Square, went ahead with few coronavirus restrictions even as Hungary, like the rest of Europe, is battling infections fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Few in the crowd wore masks and no tests or vaccination certificates were required to gain entrance. Some 65.4% of Hungarians over age 18 are vaccinated. Matyas Mezosi, a Hungarian Catholic who got to the Mass site early, was jubilant that the pope had come at all so soon after his surgery; The 84-year-old pope had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed in early July. \"It's great to see him recovered from that surgery,\" Mezosi said. \"Him being here in Hungary today means that he sacrifices himself to be with us, and that he feels good now.\" During the flight from Rome, Francis indeed seemed in good form: He stayed so long greeting journalists at the back of the plane that an aide had to tell him to get back to his seat because it was time to land. Francis said he was happy to be resuming foreign trips again after the coronavirus lull and then his own post-operative recovery. \"If I'm alive it's because bad weeds never die,\" he quipped about his health, quoting an Argentine dictum. But later in the morning he apologized to a gathering of Christian and Jewish leaders that he had to deliver his speech sitting down. In his remarks to them, Francis warned against a resurgence of antisemitism in Europe, saying it is a \"fuse which must not be allowed to burn.\" The Argentine pope called for Christians, Jews and people of other faiths to commit themselves to promoting greater fraternity \"so that outbursts of hatred that would destroy that fraternity will never prevail.\" Hungary's large Jewish population was devastated during the closing months of World War II, with more than 550,000 Jewish deaths. The vast majority were deported within a two-month period in 1944 with the assistance of Hungary's fascist Arrow Cross Party, and most were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland. More Hungarians died in Auschwitz than any other nationality, and more Hungarian Jews perished in the Holocaust than from any country other than Poland and the Soviet Union. Hungary's government under Orban has been accused of trafficking in veiled antisemitic stereotypes, largely aimed at Hungarian-born American financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom the government frequently accuses of meddling in the country's internal affairs. About 39% of Hungarians declared themselves to be Catholic in a 2011 census, while 13% declared themselves to be Protestant, either Lutheran or Calvinist, a Protestant branch with which Orban is affiliated. A tiny fraction of the population is Jewish. Registered churches have been major beneficiaries of state support under Orban since he returned to power in 2010. Additionally, around 3,000 places of worship have been built or restored using public funds since 2010, part of an effort by Orban's government to advance what he calls \"Christian democracy,\" an alternative to liberal governance of which he is a frequent critic.",

Afghans have lived through foreign invasions, civil war, insurgency and a previous period of oppressive Taliban rule. Here are some key events and dates from the past four decades. December 1979 Following upheaval after a 1978 Afghan coup, the Soviet military invades Afghanistan to prop up a pro-Soviet government. 1980 Babrak Karmal is installed as Afghanistan's Soviet-backed ruler. Groups of guerrilla fighters known as mujahideen or holy warriors mount opposition and a jihad against Soviet forces. The ensuing war leaves about 1 million Afghan civilians and some 15,000 Soviet soldiers dead. Millions of Afghans begin fleeing to neighboring Pakistan as refugees. The U.S., which had previously been aiding Afghan mujahideen groups, and Saudi Arabia covertly funnel arms to the mujahideen via Pakistan through the 1980s.

The Taliban flee south and their regime is overthrown. In December, Hamid Karzai is named interim president after Afghan groups sign the Bonn Agreement on an interim government. Under that agreement, some warlords are named provincial governors, military commanders and cabinet ministers, as are members of the Northern Alliance. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force is established under a U.N. mandate. 2003 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signals an end to \"major combat activity\" in Afghanistan, saying, \"We clearly have moved from major combat activity to a period of stability and stabilization and reconstruction and activities.\" 2004 Afghanistan holds a presidential election, won by Hamid Karzai. 2005 Afghanistan's parliament opens after elections bring in lawmakers including old warlords and faction leaders. 2006 The Taliban seize territory in southern Afghanistan. NATO's ISAF assumes command from the U.S. in the south, something the NATO secretary general calls \"one of the most challenging tasks NATO has ever taken on.\" 2009 Karzai is reelected president. The U.S. \"surge\" begins after President Barack Obama orders substantial troop increases in Afghanistan. Obama says that U.S. forces will leave by 2011. 2012 NATO announces it will withdraw foreign combat troops and transfer control of security operations to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. 2013 The Afghan army takes on security operations from NATO forces. The Obama administration announces plans to start formal peace talks with the Taliban. 2014 After a disputed election, Ashraf Ghani succeeds Karzai as Afghanistan's president. Ghani's rival, Abdullah Abdullah, is named chief executive.

Heavy violence continues as the Taliban step up their attacks on Afghan and U.S. forces and civilians, and take over more territory. At the same time, an Afghan ISIS branch also emerges. Taliban members and Afghan officials meet informally in Qatar and agree to continue peace talks. The Taliban make publicly known that Mullah Omar, the group's founder, died years earlier. Mullah Akhtar Mansour is named as the new leader. He is killed the following year in a U.S. drone attack in Pakistan. 2016 The Afghan government grants immunity to former mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, known in the civil war years as the \"butcher of Kabul.\" 2017 Fighting continues between government forces and the Taliban, and attacks attributed to the Taliban and ISIS convulse the country. 2018 President Donald Trump appoints former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad as his special representative to negotiate with the Taliban. 2020 After another disputed election in 2019, Ghani is declared president and Abdullah as head of the government's peace negotiating committee in early 2020. Violence increases in Kabul. ISIS claims responsibility for some attacks, while others are never claimed. Journalists and rights activists are assassinated. Other targets include a maternity hospital and a girls' school.

In Afghanistan the world is witnessing disastrous consequences associated with a rare area of agreement between President Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump. Both presidents saw the 20-year war in the remote and rugged country as an unwelcome inheritance and an albatross. For Trump it was the prime example of the \"forever wars\" he promised to end, a salient promise of his \"America First\" campaign.  Frustrated in his initial efforts to truncate the U.S. mission, Trump finally bypassed the Afghan government to negotiate directly with the Taliban. The deal with them that he signed on Feb. 29, 2020 promised to pull all U.S. troops out by May 1, 2021. Biden did not reverse this course when he took office, although he did push back the pull-out to September. He wanted more time to remove U.S. forces and, if necessary, evacuate U.S. civilians as well as Afghan interpreters and others who helped the U.S. war effort. He was advised he would have a period of weeks or months to do this after September. It turned out, the Taliban had a schedule of their own. It also turned out that the Afghan army the U.S. built, trained and equipped had been largely abandoned by its own government. Reportedly left without food and other supplies, much of the army simply ceded the battlefield to the Taliban, first in the hinterlands, then in the towns, then in the cities. There seemed to be little loyalty to the elected Afghan government, whose leader Ashraf Ghani fled the country before the Taliban entered the capital and took over his palace. So when we thought we had months to get out, we had weeks. When we thought we had weeks, we had days. When we thought we still had a few days, we had hours. The Taliban did not fight their way into Kabul; they drove in. There were commuters in American cities who found it harder driving in to work the next day. It seems no one foresaw all this happening this fast. But someone has to deal with the general failure. Someone has to cope with the hundreds of Americans and international workers still in Afghanistan who want to go their home countries \u2014 and untold thousands of Afghans who want to leave theirs. Taliban fighters stand guard at an entrance gate outside the Interior Ministry in Kabul on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Javed Tanveer/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Biden stood up on Monday and said \"the buck stops here.\" But he made clear he thought that buck had been passed to him by plenty of other people. He acknowledged that the U.S. footprint was now confined to the Hamid Karzai International Airport. He seemed stunned by the scenes of chaos there, the tarmac awash with would-be refugees, some so desperate they clung to an aircraft as it took off. Yet Biden remained adamant about getting out of Afghanistan, even given the catastrophe on view on screens the world over. Four presidents over two decades have found themselves mired in Afghanistan, wondering when they might get out. Biden grasped the nettle like no other. And he may well face the political consequences each of his predecessors managed to sidestep. President George W. Bush first sent troops to overthrow the Taliban then in power after they had harbored al-Qaida prior to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Thereafter, his attention turned to invading Iraq and a larger struggle there. But he kept enough troops in Afghanistan to keep the lid on and move toward building an indigenous army and democracy (while denying it was \"nation building\"). Elected in 2008, Barack Obama surged the U.S. fighting force to more than 90,000 in his first term, then drew it down aggressively after winning his second. Biden, his vice president, was opposed to the build-up and favored the drawdown. Neither Bush nor Obama wanted \"Who lost Afghanistan?\" questions to haunt their own reelection prospects. And indeed, they did not. Trump, by contrast, seemed more anxious about voters asking why the U.S. had not left Afghanistan. In his 2020 book The Room Where It Happened, John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser in 2018 and 2019, depicts Trump as determined to deal with the Taliban. He recalls Trump trying to bring Taliban leaders to Camp David for negotiations in September 2019, eventually dropping that plan, and then reviving its outline in what became the Feb. 29, 2020 agreement. \"This deal is entirely Trump's,\" Bolton wrote of that agreement. \"Time will tell who is right, and the full effects of the deal may not become apparent until after Trump leaves office. But there should be no mistaking this reality: Trump will be responsible for the consequences, politically and militarily.\" Bolton, long known as a hardliner in previous Republican administrations, has since expressed his scorn for Biden's policy and Trump's, in the wake of events in Kabul. H.R. McMaster, a retired Army general who preceded Bolton as national security adviser, has also linked the Trump and Biden approaches to Afghanistan. He told a Wilson Center interviewer on Aug. 12 that a \"sound strategy\" he helped devise for Afghanistan in 2017 had been \"abandoned\" in \"capitulation negotiations conducted under Ambassador [Zalmay] Khalilzad\" \u2014 Trump's special envoy to Afghanistan who was retained in that role by the Biden administration. So intense was Trump's intention to withdraw that he persisted even after the 2020 election. According to a report published by Axios in May, Trump signed a memo in November that would have withdrawn all U.S. troops by mid-January (just five days before his term was to end). His top national security team, civilian and military, persuaded him not to issue the order but to leave the withdrawal date at May 1. Trump has since said none of the current mayhem in Kabul would be happening if he were still president. Researchers will need to ascertain how many exit visas for Afghans had already been arranged before Trump left office, or what sort of procedures he might have had in place for Americans and Afghans wishing to leave. But lacking such evidence, and given Trump's timetable and concessions made to the Taliban, it is easier to imagine the current situation happening that much sooner. Trump in fact had complained at his June 26 rally in Ohio that the Biden administration was dragging its feet and ought to get out faster. There is a case to be made that Biden is less responsible for this fiasco than any of the previous three presidents. But he is the one who fumbled at the goal line, as it were, at the crucial moment of the game from the perspective of media and politics. While an Economist/YouGov poll this June found only 1 American in 5 opposed to the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan, a Morning Consult survey that followed the fall of Kabul found a plurality of 45% opposed to withdrawal if it meant a Taliban takeover. It can also be said that by the time Biden was carrying the ball, it was more like being left holding the bag. \"I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan \u2014 two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth,\" he said. \"It is time for American troops to come home.\" Biden made that statement on April 14, with Trump's May 1 deadline looming. He repeated the vow about passing the responsibility in his speech on Monday. There was in that \"time to come home\" phrase a faint, distant echo of \"come home, America\" \u2014 the campaign theme of presidential nominee George McGovern, who ran against the Vietnam War in 1972 and lost 49 states. It was not a good year for Democrats on the ballot, but one who won was a 29-year-old Senate candidate in Delaware who did not make a major issue of the war. The young Joe Biden had not been a campus activist in his years at the University of Delaware or at Syracuse Law School. \"I didn't march,\" he would recall later. \"I ran for office.\" Just two years later, still in his first Senate term, Biden watched with the nation as the long war in Vietnam ended in debacle. Helicopters plucked the last U.S. military and civilians from a rooftop in Saigon as the city fell, ending a civil war in which the U.S. had backed the South Vietnamese government against the communist regime of North Vietnam and its guerilla allies, the Viet Cong.

When left on its own, the South Vietnamese army was routed in a matter of months. Many thousands of Vietnamese who had helped the U.S. were left behind, with some escaping in desperately overloaded ships. Many of these \"boat people\" were picked up by U.S. Navy vessels; others made it to port in surrounding countries. Eventually, many came to the U.S. where they and their descendants now number well over a million. When Saigon fell, none of the U.S. presidents who had made commitments to Vietnam was on hand to bear the consequences. Dwight Eisenhower, who sided with the French colonialists against the Vietnamese in the 1950s, was long dead. So was John F. Kennedy, who inherited the war but felt he had to extend it and expand the U.S. commitment, and Lyndon B. Johnson, who had escalated the war far beyond his predecessors. Richard Nixon, still alive, had resigned on the brink of impeachment over the Watergate scandal. President Gerald Ford had been in office less than nine months when Saigon fell in April of 1975. He had been preoccupied with domestic matters and been assured the Saigon government could hold on a while longer. He was misinformed. But relatively few blamed him, even in the wake of a disastrous end to the long struggle and a humiliating exit for the U.S. His approval in the Gallup Poll did not seem to suffer, and a military rescue of U.S. seamen captured off Cambodia's coast two weeks later helped boost him to more than 50% approval at the end of May. The other factor that may have influenced Biden on Afghanistan is more personal. Some who heard Biden speak on Monday were surprised he did not mention his son, Beau Biden, who was deployed to the Iraq War in 2008. \"I don't want him going,\" his father said at the time, \"But I tell you what, I don't want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years, and so how we leave makes a big difference.\" Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015, and his father has speculated at times about the effects of toxic chemicals his son encountered while in the war theater. As vice president, Biden was reported to have told a colleague that he did not want his son going to Afghanistan if the mission was to make sure it was safe for girls to go to school. (The Taliban is notorious for denying women the most basic rights.) The president has often made mention of the impact his son's life and death have had on him. And while such things as personal loss \u2014 or the Vietnam era experience \u2014 cannot be measured precisely, neither can they be counted out.",

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u2014 The assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in his heavily guarded private residence on July 7 shocked the nation. But it happened at a time when violence is surging in the country. Many Haitians say that killings, kidnappings and random shootings are at levels they've never seen before. According to security officials, criminal gangs dramatically expanded their control over parts of Port-au-Prince during Mo\u00efse's time in office. Some of Mo\u00efse's critics say this was no accident. They charge that the former president not only allowed gangsters to operate freely but worked with them to destabilize some of the most destitute neighborhoods in the capital, particularly areas loyal to his political opponents. Whatever the reason, the rise in violence is being felt most acutely by some of the country's poorest residents. Residents like Marie Ren\u00e9 Bonet. Bonet spent most of her life in the Martissant neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. The 73-year-old raised her children there. But in early June the situation became intolerable. \"I was at my daughter's house and we heard shots,\" Bonet says. \"We rushed out to a church to pray. But then we were forced to leave the shrine and take refuge at a friend's house. When we arrived, I found my friend's family packing up to leave their house.\" Gang members were moving block-by-block through the neighborhood of cinder-block and sheet-metal homes, looting, shooting, taking whatever they wanted. The violence had been escalating since the beginning of the year. The police had abandoned their local barracks months earlier. That was the last night Bonet spent at her own home.

Along with two of her grown children and four members of their families, they left taking only what they could carry. \"From the beginning, people have been dying, people have been shot,\" she says. \"Nobody says, 'No, this can't continue.' And now the situation is getting worse.\" A friend from church let them move into one of his kid's bedrooms in a house that's still under construction in a neighborhood all the way across Port-au-Prince from Martissant. There are now 13 people living in the three-bedroom cinder-block building. Bonet worries that she's imposing on the owner of the house. \"I feel better here, because I don't hear the sound of gunshots,\" she says. \"But when I'm here, it makes me very sad because the owner of this house also has children in the house. It bothers me. I would like to give them their space back.\" Her son, Junior Milien, says he's trying to raise enough money to move out but for now they have few options. \"We just sleep on the floor,\" he says, holding back a curtain to show a small dark room with a rough concrete floor. \"We put down some sheets and we sleep on the floor.\" Milien says he wanted to go back to Martissant to retrieve some of their belongings. \"When we tried to get back, there was a lot of shooting,\" he says. Neighbors warned him not to try to return to his mother's house. \"They said the (gang members) shoot on people. If you come into your house to take your things, they will shoot on you.\" He heard from another friend that their home had been ransacked. \"We just learned recently that they took everything,\" he says. His mom says she and her family have become refugees in their own city. This family is not alone. The U.N.'s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that nearly 15,000 people have been forced from their homes in Port-au-Prince just over the last six weeks. Doctors Without Borders shut down its clinic in Martissant after it was attacked on June 26. The month before, one of their staff was robbed and killed. \"He was the father of three children,\" says Julien Bartoletti, the Haiti mission director for Doctors Without Borders France. And in February, gun battles forced the medical charity to move its burn unit out of a clinic in Drouillard, near Cit\u00e9 Soleil. \"It's like a war context in some neighborhoods,\" Bartoletti says. There are front lines that certain people, including some of his staff, can't cross. \"We can't have patients in a burn ward with this high level of insecurity,\" he says.

But Tabarre faces its own security challenges. The rising level of violence, Bartoletti says, is the biggest challenge to Doctors Without Borders operations right now in Haiti. \"Our staff, we thank them a lot,\" says Bartoletti, \"because every day they are at risk at any time of kidnapping, robberies, killings. They are really brave.

Now, they're even more unstable. Attorney Samuel Madistin says that this is no accident. He says Mo\u00efse gave the gangs carte-blanche to do just about whatever they want. \"Those gangs have impunity, official impunity,\" Madistin declares smacking his desk with his palm. \"There's been no trials for any gangs for three years.\" Madistin is a criminal defense attorney. He says usually he handles 50 cases or so a year. But after Mo\u00efse took office, the number of trials started to dry up. Just as Mo\u00efse let parliament dissolve and never held elections to reinstate it, the slain president allowed the judicial system to collapse, Madistin says. Courts shut down as judges weren't appointed to fill empty seats. Prosecutors stopped filing charges. Suspects languished in jail. Madistin says he hasn't had a single case go to trial since 2018. \"And every day you have people killed, you have people raped every day, kidnapped every day,\" Madistin says, and the government does \"nothing to stop this bad situation.

The criminals feel so untouchable that after Mo\u00efse's assassination the leader of one of the largest gangs in the capital, Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Ch\u00e9rizier, held a press conference to weigh in on the political crisis. A former police officer turned head of the G9 gang, Ch\u00e9rizier called Mo\u00efse's killers \"cowardly\" and called for justice for the slain president. He also warned that his forces will use their weapons to protect the Haitian people. \"We invite all those who are trying to take advantage of this coup to think carefully,\" he told the assembled reporters. \"And consider whether they have in their hands the appropriate solution to the country's problems.\" Getting arrested or held accountable for the reign of terror he's unleashed was the last thing on the gangster's mind. Haitian journalist Monique Clesca says Mo\u00efse was a victim of his own efforts to weaken the power of the Haitian state. \"While he was in power [Mo\u00efse] really worked very hard to destroy or weaken a lot of the country's institutions, including the security apparatus,\" she says. \"And this moment shows us that he was successful. The security apparatus of the Republic of Haiti was not able to save the president.\" President Mo\u00efse was a polarizing figure in Haiti.

Graffiti in Port-au-Prince from before his assassination says, \"Down with Jovenel (Mo\u00efse)\" and \"Down with the dictator.\" And the assassination sent a chilling message to ordinary Haitians, that \"nobody else is safe,\" Marie Ren\u00e9 Bonet's son Junior Milien says. \"If they get mad at you, they can enter your house and shoot you easily. That's the message this is sending right now to people. People are afraid.\" Madistin, the attorney, says this has to change. He was no friend of Jovenel Mo\u00efse. Madistin calls the former president a dictator. But he says Haiti needs justice for Mo\u00efse. \"Justice is symbolic. It's not for the individual person,\" he says. \"It is to say to everyone, 'We can't accept these things. We can't accept crime in our society.'\" Building a criminal case against the assassins of Mo\u00efse, Madistin says, would symbolize that Haiti's justice system is functioning again, that impunity won't be tolerated, that the country is moving in a new direction.",

STOCKHOLM \u2014 Stefan Lofven, Sweden's Social Democratic prime minister since 2014, lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday, making him the first Swedish leader ever to lose such a motion. The development creates new political uncertainty in the Scandinavian nation after the last election in 2018 created a deadlocked parliament and months of negotiations to produce a government. Under a timeline dictated by the Swedish Constitution, the prime minister now has one week to decide whether to call a new election or ask the parliament speaker to find a new government. Lofven said he wants \"to take some time\" though \"not necessarily the whole week\" to decide on his next step. That government, a Social Democratic-Green coalition, is a minority government that has relied on votes from the small Left Party to pass laws. The no-confidence motion in Lofven's government was called by the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, but it ultimately succeeded because the Left Party had withdrawn its support from the government over proposed legislation to tackle a housing shortage. Lawmakers voted 181-109 against Lofven, with 51 abstentions. The Left Party said it lost confidence in Lofven over a proposal to abolish rent controls on newly built properties. Sweden has strict regulations on rents aimed at maintaining affordable prices in larger cities. However, this makes property developers less willing to invest in building new homes for the rental market. People wanting to rent a home can wait years for a contract and buying property is increasingly hard amid soaring home prices. However, the Left Party fears that deregulating the rental market will lead to rapid price increases and deeper segregation between rich and poor. After the vote, Lofven, 63, said that \"regardless of what happens, I and my party will be available to shoulder the responsibility for leading the country.\" \"My focus has and will always be to do the best for Sweden,\" he added. Over the weekend, Lofven held last-minute meetings seeking to secure a majority in parliament for his proposed rent reforms. On Sunday, he sought to soften the reforms by inviting landlords and tenant organizations for talks. However, Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar said the party was standing by its decision to oppose Lofven and said his effort was \"a political show.\" \"We have done something that is perceived as unusual in politics ... kept our word,\" she said. The Left Party's initiative was supported by three other parties, including the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing populist party which the mainstream parties generally refuse to cooperate with because they consider it extreme. The Sweden Democrats made huge gains in a 2018 vote to 17.6% \u2014 a showing attributed to a backlash against large-scale migration. In 2015, Sweden, with a population of 10 million, took in a record 163,000 refugees \u2013 the highest per capita of any European country. The populist party became Sweden's third-largest party in the 2014 vote. The 2018 election produced a hung parliament, with parties on the left and the center-right bloc securing about 40% of the vote each. In January 2019, Swedish lawmakers approved Lofven's minority government, ending a four-month political deadlock.",

She has moved the Greens increasingly to the political center. BERLIN \u2014 The post-Merkel era is imminent, something an anxious German electorate has been trying to ignore. But the mood grew more upbeat last week after the Green party announced its first-ever chancellor candidate and Merkel's conservatives decided, after much internal wrangling, on theirs. With the election five months away, the race has now begun in earnest to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down after 16 years in office. Merkel's departure comes at a difficult time for a country in the grips of the pandemic's third wave, and for a continent struggling to deal with the virus' economic and political ramifications. Armin Laschet, the candidate from Angela Merkel's party who is running to succeed her as chancellor, speaks at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. He is a longtime Merkel ally and shares many of her moderate and centrist views, including a pro-refugee stance.\n                \n                    \n                    Christian Marquardt - Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Armin Laschet, the candidate from Angela Merkel's party who is running to succeed her as chancellor, speaks at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. He is a longtime Merkel ally and shares many of her moderate and centrist views, including a pro-refugee stance. Three parties have now announced their chancellor candidates \u2014 the Social Democrats' Olaf Scholz, the Christian Democrats' Armin Laschet, and the Greens' Annalena Baerbock. With the Greens now leading the polls, Baerbock, 40, is seen as a serious contender, and the race is likely to center on her and Laschet. All candidates sit in the political center, even if their parties traditionally haven't. While 62-year-old Scholz, the current finance minister and vice chancellor, is a respected and experienced politician, his party is polling too low for him to have a likely chance of entering the chancellery. Baerbock immediately declared her intention to shake things up. \"Democracy thrives on change,\" she said in her first campaign speech. \"Sure, I've never been chancellor, never been a minister. But I'm running for renewal while others are running for the status quo. This country needs a fresh start.\" Baerbock, a career politician, was relatively unknown until she became party co-chair in 2018. A member of the Bundestag since 2013, she grew up in a rural village near the northern city of Hanover. Her parents took her to anti-nuclear demonstrations in the 1980s, which also attracted supporters of the Green Party, then in its early years. Baerbock speaks fluent English, having studied at the London School of Economics, and was a medalist at national trampoline championships. Since Baerbock's candidacy was announced, the German press has been awash with comparisons to Merkel, citing fellow lawmakers who say she is tenacious, meticulous and places great importance on expertise \u2014 all traits for which the outgoing chancellor is also well known. Laschet, the 60-year-old conservative candidate, is also often compared with Merkel. The son of a mining engineer, he's served as state premier of North Rhine Westphalia, one of Germany's major mining regions. Laschet has been slow to back a coal industry shutdown by 2038 \u2014 something Baerbock wants to bring forward to 2030. But this long-term, loyal ally of the incumbent chancellor shares many of Merkel's moderate and centrist views, such as her pro-refugee stance. Although he's running for the party that's been in power for the past 16 years, Laschet is also promising change. \"We cannot continue with business as usual,\" he said on announcing his candidacy. \"This country needs modernizing. It needs speeding up and improving.\" But Jana Puglierin, head of Berlin's European Council on Foreign Relations, says Laschet \u2014 a centrist within the center-right Christian Democratic Union \u2014 is very much business as usual. \"Armin Laschet is basically the reincarnation of continuity,\" she says. \"He is, in many ways, Merkel in a [men's] suit.\" While polls suggest German voters aren't yet convinced he really is Merkel's successor, Laschet is often underestimated, Puglierin says. He is an experienced politician who governs Germany's most populous state, home to the cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Bonn and Essen. Nonetheless, with Baerbock in the race, he'll have his work cut out for him. \"Germany is a very status quo-oriented country,\" Puglierin says. \"But after 16 years, I think there is some change in the air. And Annalena Baerbock is the newcomer. She is fresh air. She's new ideas, a new spirit.\" At an outdoor market in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg, Clara Himmel, a 66-year-old retired nurse, says she likes Baerbock and is considering voting for her. \"She's knows what she wants,\" Himmel says, \"and she's no-nonsense about getting it.\" Himmel recalls anxiety in the past about the possibility of contaminated produce at market stalls like this after Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 \u2014 an incident that galvanized the Greens. Still, Himmel has never voted Green. She says they were always too radical. That is, until Baerbock, who has moved the once single-issue environmentalist party into the political center, balancing an ambitious climate policy with the interests of big business. \"She's a breath of fresh air that would do our country good,\" Himmel says. On the domestic front, the Greens plan to invest in the infrastructure neglected by Merkel's administration, which has prioritized balanced budgets for the past decade. The Greens also diverge from their rivals on foreign policy. Instead of putting business interests first and pursuing the policy of Wandel durch Handel \u2014 change through trade, and strengthening economic ties in the hope of gaining influence \u2014 as Merkel, her conservatives and their coalition partner, the Social Democrats have done, the Greens take a tough line on China and Russia. And they oppose the controversial Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, whose construction Merkel's government has supported. Arne Jungjohann, an analyst with the Green-affiliated Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, says the Greens' rise in polls from 8% three years ago to as high as 29% this week can be attributed, in part, to the counterweight the party offers to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD), currently polling at 9%. \"The Greens today are a pro-European force, they are refugee-friendly,\" Jungjohann says. \"They see themselves as defenders of democracy against attacks from the extreme right.\" While Laschet, like Merkel before him, also fits this description, it's currently having no effect on the polls. His party and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have lost more than 10 percentage points in recent weeks, following revelations about conservative lawmakers profiting from face mask deals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Puglierin says the CDU is at risk of losing voters who only ever cast their ballots for the party because of Merkel: \"The Green party is now attractive to those that were once attracted to Merkel,\" she says, because it has moved just enough into the political center to appeal to a very broad portion of the German electorate. But for all the buzz about the Greens, the CDU/CSU could still make a comeback in the polls, she believes. Laschet, after all, took North Rhine Westphalia back from the Social Democrats in state elections in 2017. While Baerbock and Laschet fight over the political center, Germany's proportional representation voting system and historical reliance on coalition governments means the two candidates could well end up governing together, Puglierin says, with Laschet probably taking the top job, and Baerbock potentially serving as foreign minister. But Puglierin and other analysts predict the Greens will be in the driving seat when it comes to coalition negotiations. And it's possible that Baerbock could oust the CDU/CSU by forming a government with the Social Democrats and libertarian Free Democrats, taking the top job in the process. That really would be a change.",

            "article_content": "The Biden Administration makes big foreign policy moves, including an end to the Afghanistan War and sanctions on Russia for election interference.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST: Yesterday, a reversal at the Justice Department. Attorney General Merrick Garland restored the use of consent decrees to address police abuses. The Trump administration had restricted the practice. Joining me to talk about this change and some other big moves by President Joe Biden this week is NPR's Ron Elving. Good morning, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Hey. Good to be with you, Debbie. ELLIOTT: So we haven't seen consent decrees used this way since, well, the last administration Joe Biden was a part of. It has been a good while. Remind us of how the Justice Department can use this legal tool. ELVING: Back in the Obama years, the Justice Department negotiated these consent decrees, as they're called, with a number of police departments, for example, in Ferguson, Mo., and in Baltimore, Md., after the deaths of two young Black men, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray. This was a way to get police departments to commit to serious reforms, the kind of things that Randy Shrewsberry was just talking to you about - reforms to the way that police operate on the street, the way they treat people of color. And this tool fell into disuse during the Trump administration, especially after an announcement of a change of policy in the fall of 2018. And now the Biden administration is bringing them back, and they will be part of the effort to deal with police tactics under the new attorney general, Merrick Garland. ELLIOTT: Earlier this week, President Biden also announced an historic shift in U.S. foreign policy, a withdrawal of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. This is the end of a war that's lasted nearly 20 years. Is he just finishing what President Trump had started? What's his thinking here? ELVING: In a sense, it is a continuation of the Trump commitment to draw down U.S. forces in Afghanistan. They had been talking about May 1 as a date to get out. And the U.S. had already come way down from the peak of 100,000 troops in that country at one point to about 2,500. And Biden said this week we would leave a small protective force for U.S. diplomats and aid workers, but otherwise, we're going to be out by September, which is when we mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, which were, of course, the trigger for our long commitment in Afghanistan in the first place. ELLIOTT: Biden and Trump may have been on the same page about getting out of Afghanistan, but they were not in the same book about dealing with Russia, as we're seeing this week. Can you give us a little compare and contrast, please, Ron? ELVING: It's pretty stark. President Biden is setting out a new set of rules for the Russia relationship that include consequences for Russian actions, and Russian actions such as the hacking program known as SolarWinds and the efforts to interfere with U.S. elections in recent years. And the two countries have been exchanging the sort of brushback moves we used to see, such as sending diplomatic personnel back to their home countries. But it has not yet become a full-scale rupture on the scale of the Cold War, and Biden has indicated some willingness to sit down with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at some point yet to be determined. ELLIOTT: And briefly, some confusion yesterday coming out of the White House. The Biden administration said it was going to stick with the Trump-era cap on refugees allowed in the U.S., and then it backtracked. What happened? ELVING: During the campaign, the Biden team said they were going to bust through the 15,000 cap and maybe go to more than 100,000 a year. Then that came back to 60,000 a year earlier this year. And then this week, we heard that the system for processing and resettling refugees needed more time to get back up to speed. Maybe the cap would be OK for a while. And then the White House turned around after a storm of criticism and said there would be more refugees this year, and the old cap would be lifted. And we'll hear just how many - just how high the numbers might go next month. ELLIOTT: Well, thank you, NPR's Ron Elving. ELVING: Thank you, Debbie. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

For months, a conflict in Ethiopia between the government in Addis Ababa and a defiant region has cost thousands of lives and displaced at least a million people. Despite the increasing brutality in Tigray, until now, it has been largely overlooked by the outside world. But attention and concern is growing with news of alleged atrocities and a worsening refugee crisis. We've put together nine things you should know about the situation in the Horn of Africa. Where is Tigray and what is going on there? Tigray is Ethiopia's northernmost region. Bordering Eritrea, it is home to most of the country's estimated 7 million ethnic Tigrayans. The ethnic group, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population, have had an outsized influence in national affairs. A map showing Ethiopia's Tigray region, highlighting key cities.\n                \n                    \n                    Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption A map showing Ethiopia's Tigray region, highlighting key cities. In early November, the regional government \u2014 controlled by the Tigray People's Liberation Front, a leftist political party \u2014 launched a full-scale siege of a key Ethiopian military base at Sero, using tanks, heavy guns and mortars. Calling the TPLF assault a \"treason that will never be forgotten,\" Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a federal offensive against the region, setting off the conflict.

How bad is the humanitarian crisis? Bad. But the scope of the problem is still unclear. The United Nations says the humanitarian community has been largely unable to get outside the major cities, such as the regional capital of Mekele, to see what's happening in the countryside. So far, the conflict has killed thousands of people, many of whom allegedly died as a result of indiscriminate shelling of cities in Tigray by Ethiopian forces. A local official told Reuters in January that more than two million people have been displaced by fighting, far exceeding previous estimates. The conflict also threatens a regional humanitarian disaster. In January, the U.N. refugee agency said some 56,000 people had fled the fighting in Tigray, many of whom have ended up in neighboring Sudan. Last month, The New York Times published a story citing an internal U.S. government report that described a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. Fighters supporting Addis Ababa's side in the conflict were \"deliberately and efficiently rendering Western Tigray ethnically homogeneous through the organized use of force and intimidation,\" the Times quoted from the report, which also said that, \"Whole villages were severely damaged or completely erased.\" Tigrayan men sit atop a hill in Ethiopia overlooking part of the Umm Rakouba refugee camp in neighboring Sudan, where many people who fled the ongoing conflict have gone for refuge.\n                \n                    \n                    Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tigrayan men sit atop a hill in Ethiopia overlooking part of the Umm Rakouba refugee camp in neighboring Sudan, where many people who fled the ongoing conflict have gone for refuge. What is the Tigray People's Liberation Front? The TPLF originally formed in the 1970s to push for Tigrayan self-determination, a goal it later moved away from. In a remarkable twist, it eventually found itself at the center of national politics. It became the dominant player in a coalition of ethnic political parties known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, or EPRDF, which led Ethiopia's government for nearly three decades. Abiy came to power in 2018 as the head of the EPRDF. But a year later, he dissolved the party, saying he hoped to put its history of ethnic divisiveness behind it. Instead, Abiy sought to fold the EPRDF's constituents into a new political party. But the TPLF refused to go along, instead retreating to its power base in Tigray, where it enjoys widespread support. What led up to the current conflict? After it was sidelined at the national level, the TPLF was accused by Abiy's government of seeking to destabilize Ethiopia by orchestrating ethnic violence across the country. Abiy had promised to hold the country's first truly democratic elections last summer. However, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, he postponed them. The TPLF said that delaying the vote amounted to an unconstitutional extension of Abiy's presidential term. The group then held its own regional elections anyway, claiming a decisive win. Abiy's government subsequently declared the Tigray elections invalid. The two sides called each other illegitimate in the lead-up to the TPLF attack on the Sero base. In response, the government sent the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, backed by soldiers from the Amhara region, which borders Tigray. Who has the upper hand in the fighting? After fighting commenced in November, the Ethiopian National Defense Forces quickly captured many of Tigray's main cities, including the regional capital, Mekele, with approximately a half-million people. Abiy declared the main phase of the conflict over; however, the TPLF still controls large swaths of Tigray. Ethiopia has said it is waging a \"final offensive\" against the group. What role has Eritrea played? Eritrea, which was once part of Ethiopia, fought and won a brutal, decades-long war of independence that ended in 1991. The two countries went to war again in 1998 in a territorial conflict that ended inconclusively in 2000, claiming an estimated 100,000 lives. However, shortly after taking office, Abiy reached out to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, and the two forged a historic peace accord aimed at putting the countries' mutual enmity in the past. Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict.

Abiy appears to have won a staunch ally in Isaias. Eritrean forces are reportedly engaged in the Tigray fight, backing Ethiopia. The Associated Press reported that Eritrean soldiers were involved in a massacre of civilians in the town of Axum in the early days of the conflict. Amnesty International has also blamed Eritrea for the mass killing at Axum. Eritrean forces also reportedly carried out a similar attack on civilians at a church in the Tigrayan town of Dengelat. Both governments have denied that Eritrean troops are even in Ethiopia. In an interview with state media last month, Isaias didn't comment on the presence of Eritrean forces in Tigray, but he appeared to hint at it. He expressed concern over the Tigray situation and said Eritrea was \"trying our level best\" to help Ethiopia \"in accordance to our obligation,\" the BBC reported. Abiy, speaking to parliament in November, called the Eritrean people \"our brothers,\" and friends \"who stood by our side on a tough day.\" What does the U.N. say? The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has asked Ethiopia for access to Tigray to investigate possible war crimes there, after reports of extrajudicial killings and sexual violence. Bachelet says her office has verified some atrocities in Tigray, including ones committed by Eritrean forces, as well as the \"indiscriminate shelling in Mekele, Humera and Adigrat towns in Tigray region.\" What has the U.S. said? The Biden administration describes the situation in Tigray as \"a deepening humanitarian crisis.\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken, citing \"credible reports\" of human rights abuses, has pressed Addis Ababa to end the conflict, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. \"The secretary urged the Ethiopian government to take immediate, concrete steps to protect civilians, including refugees, and to prevent further violence,\" he said in a statement. The Biden administration has repeatedly called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean soldiers and Amhara regional forces. It has also asked for the African Union to help resolve the crisis. Echoing comments made by Blinken, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said \"The onus to prevent further atrocities and human suffering falls squarely on the Ethiopian government shoulders.\" \"We urge the Ethiopian government to support an immediate end to the fighting in Tigray,\" she said. \"To that end, the prompt withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray are essential steps, and we urge the broader region to work fast and together toward a peaceful solution.\" An Ethiopian child is seen at Um Rakuba refugee camp in February as those fleeing the conflict in Tigray continue to live under harsh conditions.\n                \n                    \n                    Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An Ethiopian child is seen at Um Rakuba refugee camp in February as those fleeing the conflict in Tigray continue to live under harsh conditions. What is at stake in the conflict? With the apparent involvement of Eritrea, and a flood of refugees into Sudan, the situation threatens to become both a wider conflict and a deepening humanitarian crisis in a part of the world that has seen more than its share of human misery in recent decades. For Abiy, the Nobel laureate, and Eritrea's Isaias, their reputations as peacemakers have taken a severe hit. Allegations of atrocities and possible war crimes could effectively end whatever international good will they enjoyed. Meanwhile, for President Biden, the conflict could prove a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, the Biden administration has shown an eagerness to reassert the U.S.'s role as an international champion of human rights, after such considerations took a back seat under former President Donald Trump. But by shunning Addis Ababa, the administration would risk decades of close U.S.-Ethiopia ties and cooperation in fighting regional terrorism. Since the end of its conflicts with Eritrea, Ethiopia has played a stabilizing role in the Horn of Africa region \u2014 most notably making up the backbone of the African Union Mission in Somalia, where peacekeeping forces have sought to tamp down a resurgence of the Islamist insurgent group al-Shabab.",

They demanded the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, whose elected government was toppled by the army that also imposed an Internet blackout. Tens of thousands of protesters rallied in Myanmar on Sunday demanding an end to the military coup and release of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained alongside other elected officials in last week's military takeover. Protesters amassed in Yangon, Myanmar's most populated city, chanting anti-military slogans and waving the red peacock flag representing Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party. Many wore shirts and carried balloons with the party's colors in the day's largest protest. Protesters carried banners reading \"Respect our vote,\" the BBC reports, a reference to a landslide victory by Suu Kyi's party in a Nov. 8 election. Military leaders justified their takeover claiming, without evidence, that the vote was fraudulent. One demonstrator, quoted by the BBC, called Suu Kyi  \"our true leader.\" \"She is our only hope for our democracy. If she died or something happened to her, what is our future? We really need her back,\" the protester told the BBC. Prominently on display was the three-fingered salute, a gesture borrowed from The Hunger Games series that's become a widespread symbol of defiance in the coup's aftermath. Passing motorists honked in support as protesters threw out the borrowed symbol during the day's largest demonstration. \"We don't want a dictatorship for the next generation,\" one protester, 21-year-old Thaw Zin, told Reuters. \"We will not finish this revolution until we make history. We will fight to the end.\" Protesters in Yangon made their way from every corner of the city, Reuters reports, to Sule Pagoda, at the city's center, which has been a focal point of 2007 monk-lead protests and other movements within the country. Protesters march toward Sule Pagoda in Yangon on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters march toward Sule Pagoda in Yangon on Sunday. Armed police with riot shields set up barricades but did not otherwise interfere with the protests. The protests marked the second straight day of demonstrations in Yangon, coming close to a week after the Feb. 1 coup which ended a roughly decade-old democracy in Myanmar and put the military's Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing in power. Sunday's protests were the largest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, which led to bloody crackdowns by the military. A day before the protests, the military leadership had put in place a day-long Internet blackout, which appeared to ease on Sunday. In Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, tens of thousands marched to express their support for the civilian-elected government and decry the military takeover, The Myanmar Times reports. In the capital, Naypyidaw, a city built at the direction of military generals, marchers were joined by hundreds of motorcyclists, both the Myanmar Times and New York Times report.

Demonstrations were also held in nearby Bangladesh, where thousands of Rohingya Muslims are settled in refugee camps following the bloody military crackdown on the ethnic-minority, The New York Times reports. That support came despite past criticism of Suu Kyi \u2014 a Nobel Peace laureate \u2014 for inaction during the ethnic cleansing. \"They killed Rohingya, they tortured us and we haven't forgotten those brutal days,\" Abdur Rahim, who lives in the Kutupalong camp, the world's largest refugee settlement, told the Times. \"We express solidarity with those who are protesting against the military government in Myanmar.\" There were few reports of violence during the day's demonstrations, although earlier gunshots were reportedly fired in the Myanmar border town of Myawaddy. The BBC cites local media outlets which report that police had used rubber bullets to break up a rally. Myanmar's military did not comment on Sunday's protest and has largely been silent over the growing opposition to the coup. The U.S. and United Nations have repeatedly denounced the takeover. In the aftermath, the military has also charged Suu Kyi with illegally importing walkie-talkies and she reportedly will be kept in detention until at least Feb. 15.  Reuters adds that at least 160 people have been detained since the military seized power, according to the U.N. Michael Sullivan contributed to this report.",

As a former international correspondent who covered a dozen wars and revolutions, I know the signs of civil strife. And now, I see the battle lines being drawn up in my own family's text-messaging groups, in heated email exchanges and, more chilling, in the refusal to discuss politics at all just to preserve a common bond. My family \u2013 which is Cuban \u2013 fled communism. My mother was 21 and pregnant with her third child when she ended up in Florida in 1959 while Fidel Castro stormed Havana. My father was 23 and managed a paper route in Ft. Lauderdale to make ends meet after being dispossessed of country and home. My parents became in some ways unmoored, moving from country to country \u2013 the United States, then Panama and England, where I was born - before returning finally to Florida. The pain of exile and the fear of political unrest defines the politics of that older generation still. I grew up being told those stories of our exile and the tumultuous days of revolution and expulsion that predated my birth. In a way, I am the heir of a bitter legacy of political division \u2013 to this day the Cuban people remain apart, making their lives on either side of the Straits of Florida, separated by 90 nautical miles and a decades-old, bitter political conflict. It has been stunning to watch political division come to our family again. Inflammatory messaging filled with allusions to \"The Big Lie\" have some believing that communism might come to American shores, that the election was rigged, that democracy cannot survive under a different political party. I have been repeatedly sent incendiary material by some of them that is demonstrably untrue. I have pleaded with them to stop spreading disinformation, to little avail, and it has caused a painful rift. Whether in Kosovo or Venezuela, the pattern I witnessed as a journalist is the same. A nation can be divided, pitting person against person until it cracks like brittle. The first to go is always the middle ground. People and places that act as bridges between communities are frayed, and then destroyed. In Iraq, I reported on the story of a mosque in Baghdad and of a Muslim cleric who was trying to stop the sectarian bloodletting. He was assassinated because the forces that were trying to divide the country did not want someone to bring people together. At the time, the beginning of 2006, we were still debating whether Iraq had begun its civil war, not yet fully realizing we were already well into it. Here in Washington, D.C., as I write I can hear helicopters overhead, and there is the presence of thousands of troops encircling an area dubbed the \"Green Zone\" like its Iraqi counterpart that I once reported on. To be clear --Washington, D.C., is not Baghdad and yet, something deeply unsettling is happening in this country. In most of the repressive nations I lived in or reported on, the media were also called \"enemies of the people\" by politicians. I have been expelled from Cuba for wanting to report on the illness of Fidel Castro in 2006. I have been confronted by mobs in both left-leaning Venezuela and authoritarian states like Hosni Mubarak's Egypt. I have seen what happens when the very fabric of a country breaks down. And then, during the storming of Congress, I again saw angry mobs targeting journalists - but this time, seasoned international correspondents like CNN's Alex Marquardt had to flee from their fellow citizens. The dehumanizing language employed by President Trump has trickled down to Americans through their living room televisions and their social media feeds. White supremacy has been unleashed; race has been weaponized. The president's enablers in right-wing media and many Republican politicians have echoed him. As I have seen in every country in crisis I've covered, when a country's people fractures like this, there are political powers that seek to profit. For some of us immigrants, it feels eerily familiar. Right after the election, my cousin, who is an ardent Trump supporter, was in an exchange with my brother, who is not. She cut off all contact with him and his family because they disagreed over politics. Our parents and grandparents were divided by Fidel Castro. Now Donald Trump is having the same effect on our generation. Americans who may have believed themselves immune to the instability that plagues other countries would be wise to hear the cautionary words of their fellow citizens who have joined our democracy from those troubled regions. A former Iraqi colleague who came to the United States as a refugee, wrote me a note: \"I never imagined saying this to you in D.C., but please stay safe!\" He became a citizen last year and voted for his first time in this election. We acknowledged the irony of suddenly being caught in a familiar spiral. He told me he just bought a gun, something he hadn't owned since living in Baghdad and he found that there is an ammunition shortage. \"9 mm bullets are the new Lysol,\" he quipped. \"It's almost unreal,\" he wrote. \"For all the wrong reasons it suddenly looks and feels like home.\" Is America on the brink of civil conflict? As I discovered in Iraq, if you have to ask the question, you may already know the answer. Lulu Garcia-Navarro is host of NPR's Weekend Edition.",

            "article_content": "Belarus is sending migrants across its border with Poland to pressure the EU, and when Poland illegally sends asylum-seekers back across the border, they face mistreatment by Belarussian police.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe, is being accused of bringing migrants from war-torn and impoverished countries to its capital, Minsk, and then encouraging them to illegally cross the border into the EU. It is in revenge for economic sanctions the EU placed on the Belarusian regime. Poland estimates 16,000 people have illegally crossed in its border with Belarus since August. NPR's Rob Schmitz was on that border last week. Rob, Poland says hundreds of migrants are crossing into its country each day. Were you able to talk to any of them? ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Yeah. And after we arrive at the border town of Sokolka, my producer and I heard that police were looking for two migrants wandering around the town. We went outside to check, and a few minutes later, we found police officers with two men who looked exhausted. (Speaking Spanish). DONIEL MACHADO PUJOL: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). SCHMITZ: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). MACHADO PUJOL: (Speaking Spanish). SCHMITZ: (Speaking Spanish). MACHADO PUJOL: (Speaking Spanish). SCHMITZ: And you can hear me speaking to them in Spanish here. The two men were from Cuba. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. Poland's border with Belarus, I wouldn't imagine, Rob, is a typical place where you'd find Cubans, at least I wouldn't think. SCHMITZ: No - these are the forests of Eastern Europe, quite a distance from the Caribbean. I asked them how they had gotten here. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). MACHADO PUJOL: Belarus. SCHMITZ: OK. They said they had visas for Belarus. They flew from Havana to Moscow, and a smuggler drove them to Belarus. They said Belarusian soldiers helped them climb through razor wire into Poland. And for the past 10 days, they have been hiking through forests, sleeping under piles of leaves. And they were caught by Poland's border patrol twice. Each time, they were taken back to Belarus. And that's where Doniel Machado Pujol says soldiers beat him with batons before sending them back to Poland. He shows me his legs. They're cut, bruised and swollen, and he can barely walk. MACHADO PUJOL: (Speaking Spanish). SCHMITZ: \"After we were pushed back, they beat us badly. And they refused to give us food or water. And now we're going on ten days with hardly anything to eat or drink,\" he says. They've been drinking water from a river and eating raw corn from the fields. He's starving. And he says he feels like a ball that's being tossed between Poland and Belarus. Nobody wants him. He's not alone. KALINA CZWARNOG: Some of them are Iraqis. Some of them are Kurds. There are people from Yemen, from Syria. There are people from African countries, like Nigeria, Cameroon. SCHMITZ: Kalina Czwarnog works for the humanitarian organization Fundacja Ocalenie, which is delivering food and water to migrants, helping them with asylum applications. She says the government of Belarus is orchestrating this crisis. CZWARNOG: They are inviting them to Belarus, saying that they can cross EU border from there. And they are getting, like, a seven-day visa or a stamp. SCHMITZ: And then Belarusian soldiers escort them to the border and help them illegally cross it. Czwarnog says, when Polish border guards catch them, they're supposed to allow them to apply for asylum. Instead, they're putting most of them in vans and taking them back to Belarus, where soldiers often beat them and send them back to Poland again. At least five migrants have died. Czwarnog fears more will perish as the weather gets colder. She says, the other day, she found a group from Iraq with three young children suffering from hypothermia. CZWARNOG: They were very, very cold. The youngest child, we didn't really see if she was breathing. We had to get her warm so she started to breathe normally. We couldn't get in contact with the younger children because they were so weak. SCHMITZ: Czwarnog called an ambulance. And Poland's border patrol took two children and two adults but sent a 6-year-old child with five adults back to Belarus. But not everyone is sent back. A Syrian family, who wouldn't give their names for fear of being caught, spoke to NPR at a local homeless shelter. The father, a psychologist whose family fled war, says he paid a travel agency $16,000 to secure visas to Belarus and to be escorted to the Polish border. He, his wife and their two young children crossed a river and hiked through dense forest for 12 hours before being caught. He says his son's spirit kept him going. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He was just saying to me, Daddy, don't just lose my hand. Just catch my hand and I will keep walking. He's my hero. SCHMITZ: He thinks Poland did not send his family back because they were suffering from hypothermia, they had young children and they have a good chance of being granted asylum in the EU. MARCIN PRZYDACZ: This phenomenon we've been witnessing recently is a kind of weaponization of migration. SCHMITZ: Marcin Przydacz is the deputy foreign minister of Poland. He says Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and his financial backer, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have launched a hybrid attack on the European Union. After the EU accused Lukashenko of stealing his country's last election, it placed economic sanctions on Belarus. And Przydacz says this migration crisis is Lukashenko's plot to destabilize Europe. Lukashenko denies all of this. When I asked Przydacz why Poland is violating European Union law and the U.N. Geneva Conventions by sending these refugees back to Belarus without processing them, he stands his ground. PRZYDACZ: If we allow more and more people to cross the border, then Mr. Lukashenko, who's doing also business on that, will invite even more of those people. So what should we do? SCHMITZ: Meanwhile, activists along the border report that Belarusian soldiers are becoming more violent when Poland's border guards send back migrants. MART\u00cdNEZ: Rob, Poland says Belarusian President Lukashenko has turned human trafficking into a business - any evidence of that? SCHMITZ: Yes. A Polish journalist found a trove of documents left behind by a group of migrants along the border. He shared these documents with us. There are a list of travelers from Iraq, receipts of payment made to Belarusian travel agencies for flights to Belarus on a state-owned airline and receipts of stays at state-run hotels. There are also signatures of Belarus and officials who made all of this happen. What's also telling is at the beginning of the year, there was only one flight a week from Iraq to Belarus. Now there are several from multiple cities. Iraqi Airways says their flights are sold out through November. And that's just Iraq. There are flights coming from Africa, Asia and Latin America. MART\u00cdNEZ: Going back to that Cuban man you met at the beginning of the story, what's the latest with him? SCHMITZ: Well, I've been in touch with his family. They tell me that after I interviewed him, Doniel was sent back to Belarus. When he got there, soldiers beat him up again. And they beat the other Cuban man he was traveling with so badly that they fractured his skull. The two men are still along the border, injured, scared and still hoping to make it to the European Union. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Rob Schmitz, who just returned from a reporting trip to the border of Poland and Belarus. Rob, thanks a lot. SCHMITZ: Thank you.

The U.S. and other countries announced new sanctions against Belarusian officials and Lukashenko's allies. The U.S. government announced new sanctions Monday on Belarusian government officials and wealthy allies of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, calling the measures a response to the regime's ongoing political repression and corruption. The Treasury Department said it was sanctioning 23 people and 21 entities linked either to the violent crackdown on peaceful protests, the forcing down of a flight to detain an opposition activist in May, or ongoing efforts to finance the regime \"at the expense of the Belarusian people.\" The Treasury sanctions are connected to an executive order that the White House said would enhance the \"ability to impose costs on the regime.\" President Biden said in a statement that the actions of the Lukashenko regime \"are an illegitimate effort to hold on to power at any price. It is the responsibility of all those who care about human rights, free and fair elections, and freedom of expression to stand against this oppression.\" The actions come on the one-year anniversary of Lukashenko's election to a sixth term in a vote that the U.S. and the European Union say was fraudulent. It set off months of massive protests and forced his main challenger, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, into exile. Human rights activists say there are 610 current political prisoners in the country, and the opposition says more than 35,000 have been detained in the last year. The sanctions target rich business owners in Belarus that the Treasury calls Lukashenko's \"wallets,\" who are involved in the oil, coal, tobacco and construction businesses. The sanctions also block the assets of members of national and local-level Belarusian security services for violence and repression against protesters and political opposition. The individuals include officials at a detention center in Minsk, Belarus' capital, where the U.S. says protesters and journalists are being held. On May 23, Belarusian authorities forced a plane going from Greece to Lithuania that was crossing over Belarus' airspace to make an emergency landing. On board was the fugitive dissident Roman Protasevich, the former editor and founder of an opposition blog and social media channel. Authorities boarded the plane and arrested Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega. Both are still being detained. The sanctions include five Belarusian officials the Treasury Department says were connected to the incident, who work in transportation and aviation or defended the flight's grounding in parliament. Also included in the list of sanctions is the Belarusian National Olympic Committee, which is run by Lukashenko's son, Viktor Lukashenko. The Treasury accuses the country's Olympic committee of being a tool to \"launder funds and evade sanctions.\" The country's Olympic team was in the news last week after sprinter Kristina Timanovskaya refused a flight home from Tokyo after publicly criticizing her coaches. She was then granted a Polish humanitarian visa. Timanovskaya said last week that her husband would join her in Poland, and that they would decide whether to seek political asylum there. Many of the people and entities listed by the Treasury are also being sanctioned by the EU, Canada and the United Kingdom. In a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian leader denied being a dictator and accused his opponents of plotting a coup. He said he was ready for talks with the West and that \"there is no need to take up the sanction axes and pitchforks,\" Reuters reported.",

The IOC revoked credentials for Artur Shimak and Yury Maisevich. They \"were requested to leave the Olympic Village immediately and have done so,\" the IOC said. In a tweet, the IOC said the move was \"in the interest and wellbeing of the athletes of the [National Olympic Committee] of Belarus who are still in Tokyo.\" Timanovskaya, 24, refused to board a flight back to Belarus after the coaches pulled her from Monday's 200-meter event and ordered her home from the Games. The Belarusian Olympic Committee claimed Timanovskaya was being withdrawn from competition because of her \"emotional, psychological state,\" but she told Reuters that she was being forced to go home because she had criticized the coaches on social media. In a scene reminiscent of Cold War-era defections, Timanovskaya was subsequently granted a Polish humanitarian visa while seeking political asylum. At a news conference Thursday in Warsaw, Timanovskaya said she had been angry at her coaches for wanting to run her in the 400-meter relay, a race for which she hadn't trained. She was concerned she would injure herself and jeopardize her chances in the 200-meter \u2014 her specialty.

Both received three years in prison for organizing and attending a protest on China's National Day on Oct. 1, 2019. BEIJING \u2013 Ten veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and politicians have been sentenced to up to three years' prison time for organizing a demonstration in October 2019. The sentences are the latest in a series of roundups among Hong Kong's beleaguered political opposition for their part in the broader anti-government demonstrations against Beijing's rule that rocked the region throughout 2019. Former lawmakers Albert Ho, Lee Cheuk-yan and Leung Kwok-hung were each given two consecutive 18-month sentences by Judge Amanda Woodcock for organizing and attending the protest, which fell on China's National Day on Oct. 1, 2019. Six others \u2014 including media tycoon and textile billionaire Jimmy Lai \u2014 were given lesser sentences of 14 months for helping organize the protest. Cyd Ho, Lai, Lee and Leung already are serving jail time for organizing another unauthorized protest in August 2019. Woodcock then denied bail for another former lawmaker and activist, Claudia Mo, who is facing a separate charge of violating a national security law. Among the evidence the judge cited were interviews Mo continued to take with reporters at the BBC, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times after she was charged with subversion alongside 46 other activists. All of them had tried to organize an informal primary poll in the run-up to legislative elections before they were postponed. Thursday's sentencings are part of an extensive cleanup of political agitators, lawyers, politicians and businessmen who took part in regionwide protests demanding democratic reforms in 2019. More than 10,000 protesters were arrested during those demonstrations, which stopped entirely last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong later adopted harsh legal measures to deter political dissent. Among those measures is a national security law passed by Beijing that created broadly defined crimes of subversion of state power, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, and assigns punishments of up to life in prison. The law has spurred dozens of Hong Kong protesters to seek political asylum outside China. Beijing also approved electoral changes that dramatically overhaul how Hong Kong's legislators and chief executive are chosen in a way that gives pro-Beijing parties a boost.",

            "article_content": "A judge blocks Donald Trump's bid to keep the public from seeing what he did Jan. 6. Troops prevent migrants from crossing into Poland from Belarus. Sixteen U.N. staffers in Ethiopia are detained.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: A judge blocked Donald Trump's bid to keep the public from seeing what he did on January 6. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The judge's ruling came last night. The one-time president had asserted a right to secrecy, saying that he should be able to keep Congress from examining documents relating to the attack on the Capitol. He claimed executive privilege of president's power to keep some communications private. The judge rejected that because Trump is no longer president and Congress is doing its job. His lawyers are appealing, but the chairman of the House investigation, Representative Bennie Thompson, calls this ruling a big win. MARTIN: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is with us to talk about it more. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Remind us, first off, what the committee is after here. MONTANARO: Well, the Congressional Investigative Panel is seeking more information about what happened on January 6. You know, what did the president know? When did he know it? What was he saying behind the scenes? What advice was he getting leading up to this day and on the day of? You know, there are some 800 pages of information here that they're trying to get released and looking into his communications, you know, his emails, visitor logs, call logs, see who he was talking to. They want to see potentially draft speeches, talking points, memos with possible legal strategies. You know, the House panel says that its reasoning for going after the then-president is because they say that he, quote, \"helped foment the breakdown in the rule of law.\" The panel, in recent days, we should note, has stepped up a lot of pressure. They've issued a round of almost two dozen subpoenas of people close to the former president, wanting them to testify. Many of them have declined to voluntarily come forward, and the president here is trying to claim executive privilege. MARTIN: OK, so explain more about the details of the judge's ruling, the significance of this. MONTANARO: Yeah. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, noted that she agreed with congressional investigators who say that discovering and coming to terms with the causes underlying the January 6 attack is a matter of unsurpassed public importance because such information relates to our core democratic institutions and the public's confidence in them. She noted that it's in the public interest to get to the bottom of what happened and to prevent such events from happening again. Now, Trump had sued the National Archives to try and shield these records, keep them out of the public eye. And, you know, Joe Biden, though, the current president, decided not to assert executive privilege, and the judge punctuated that in her ruling, saying presidents are not kings, and the plaintiff is not president. And the timeline here - we could see records released to Congress as soon as Friday. MARTIN: Trump's team, as we have noted, says it's appealing. So where could this go? MONTANARO: Well, you know, he is trying to keep the record secret, at least until the U.S. Court of Appeals can weigh in. So it might not be released as soon as Friday. But Trump's team says the president needs, quote, \"full and frank advice,\" and that wouldn't be possible of every communication were to become public. The Democratic chairman of the panel, Bennie Thompson, said it's, quote, \"little more than an attempt to delay and obstruct our investigation.\" And, you know, as we said, some of Trump's former advisers - not cooperating. And there's possibility they could delay things past the midterm elections, believing Republicans are likely to win the House and end this investigation. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Domenico Montanaro, we appreciate your reporting in that context. Thank you. MONTANARO: Hey, you're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Thousands of migrants are crowded in front of a barbed wire fence that separates Belarus from Poland. INSKEEP: Yeah, they're trying to cross into Poland, which means they're trying to cross into the European Union, of which Poland is a member. Thousands of Polish soldiers are defending that barbed wire trying to keep people out. The European Union accuses Belarus of tricking asylum-seekers with false hopes of entering Europe. The president of Belarus allegedly is using migrants as a weapon, retaliating against EU sanctions on his government. MARTIN: We're going to talk about all this with Suzanne Lynch. She is with Politico Europe. She's been following the developments from Brussels. Suzanne, thanks for being here. SUZANNE LYNCH: Good morning. MARTIN: First of all, can you just explain more about this particular migrant group? Where did they come from? Who's among them? LYNCH: It does seem that most of the migrants here are originally from Iraq, but there are also migrants from Syria and parts of Africa. And they are taking flights from various airports in the Middle East; also, maybe from Turkey, you know, Damascus. And they're being encouraged by the Belarusian authorities to fly to the Belarusian capital, Minsk. And then they are being funneled through or encouraged to move on and enter the European Union through its border. So there are reports that Belarus is organizing visas, that smuggling groups are organizing flights and travels, overcharging people to make this perilous journey and then leaving them, encouraging them to go to the border with the European Union and then just leaving them there. Poland, which is on the eastern flank, if you like, of the European Union, has been taking a very tough response. It's been sending its own troops to the border, saying that these migrants do not have a right to enter. And that, in turn, is raising human rights concerns because a lot of people here in Brussels are concerned that Poland is not living up to its obligations under human rights laws. And a lot of these asylum-seekers do have the right to seek asylum. MARTIN: So it's both Belarus and Poland that could be bad actors in this moment. But let's focus on Belarus because what is - what's the play here for the president, Alexander Lukashenko? I mean, why would he set these migrants up for failure basically by sending them there? LYNCH: It is a cynical move. I mean, tensions have been rife between Belarus and the neighboring European Union for a long time. Last year, Belarus held elections. The European Union said they were fraudulent. And then in May, Belarus audaciously, really, diverted a Ryanair flight and arrested a Belarusian dissident on that flight. Now, since that time, the European Union has imposed sanctions, and Belarus is not happy about this. And they have come up with this ploy, essentially, to smuggle and encourage migrants and essentially cynically instrumentalizing people and the threat of a migrant crisis and encouraging them to go to to Europe. Now, the issue for Brussels is that it does need to show solidarity with these countries on its eastern border. It's not just Poland; also Lithuania, too, has declared a state of emergency. As I said, there - you know, there are other concerns about how Poland is dealing with this. For example, it's not letting NGOs into the region - it's not letting journalists. So there's a whole problem here about what's actually happening on the ground. And we're depending on footage from the Polish and the Belarusian authorities on this. MARTIN: Lukashenko, we have to acknowledge, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Is the EU suggesting that Putin has a role in this, frankly? LYNCH: Yeah, I think there is a concern here. The Polish prime minister said in the Polish Parliament yesterday that President Putin is masterminding this, and he accused explicitly Russia. So I think there is concern about the connections between Belarus and Russia on this issue. MARTIN: Suzanne Lynch - she is a reporter for Politico Europe based in Brussels. We so appreciate your - sharing your reporting. Thank you. LYNCH: Many thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Here's a question - exactly why did Ethiopia detain more than 20 people who work for the United Nations? INSKEEP: Yeah. Ethiopia's government took custody of those staffers in the capital. Some were released, but 16 remain in custody. A U.N. spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, says they have not been given an explanation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHANE DUJARRIC: I can't comment on why the government is doing this, all right. What I can only comment on is that we have colleagues that are currently in detention that should not be in detention. INSKEEP: Ethiopia's move comes amid a civil war. The government has been attacking rebels in the Tigray region, and the rebels have lately been advancing on the capital. MARTIN: NPR's Africa correspondent Eyder Peralta has been following this and joins us now. Eyder, thanks for being here. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Thank you, Rachel. MARTIN: Do you have any more details about exactly the number detained and what's the situation at this moment? PERALTA: So, look, we know that originally 22 of the staffers, of their staffers, and an unknown number of their dependents were arrested. But this is also happening amid a huge crackdown in Addis Ababa. Human rights groups say that hundreds of ethnic Tigrayans have been rounded up for seemingly no other reason than their ethnicity. And the AP is reporting that the U.N. staffers who were arrested were Tigrayan. The U.N. would not comment on that, but this is also not the first time that the U.N. is caught in the government crosshairs. Last month, Ethiopia threw out seven top-ranking U.N. officials. And all of this has obviously made it harder for the U.N. to address a dire humanitarian situation in the country. Remember that the U.N.'s priority is to get food aid to a part of the country that they say is on the verge of catastrophic famine, and this makes that harder. MARTIN: Do these detentions tell us something about the nature of this conflict or how it's evolving? PERALTA: Yeah. I mean, look, this is a conflict that started as a power struggle between Ethiopia's old rulers and their new ones, but it has turned viciously ethnic. Ethiopian troops and Eritrean troops have been accused of pillaging and raping their way through the northern part of the country. The Ethiopian government has been accused of using hunger as a weapon of war against the people of Tigray. And now, as the conflict moves out of Tigray and into neighboring states, we're hearing accusations that the rebels are doing some of the same things against the people of Amhara. Both sides frame this war as existential, so it's become vicious, and the U.N. and humanitarian groups and mainly civilians are bearing the brunt. MARTIN: What is the next move by the Ethiopian government here? PERALTA: Look, so as you said, the U.N. says that the government has given them no explanation, and the Ethiopian government says that the U.N. staffers were arrested not because of where they work but because of, quote, \"their wrongdoing and their participation in a terror act.\" The government didn't provide any evidence for that. But I think it tells you that the government has no apologies for what's happening. MARTIN: So, I mean, when you look at this now long and very complicated conflict, Eyder, I mean, what is the end game? I mean, where do the mediation efforts stand between the government and the Tigray rebels? PERALTA: So, look, there is an effort ongoing from the U.S. and the U.N. and the African Union to mediate a solution. And this week, an A.U. envoy spoke to both sides in this war. But all of this is coming a year into this civil war, and analysts I've spoken to seem to think it's too little, too late. MARTIN: NPR's Eyder Peralta reporting for us this morning. Thank you, Eyder.

            "article_content": "House impeachment managers wrap their case, now it's time for Trump's attorneys. Separately, there are multiple state cases investigating Trump. Head of Tokyo Olympic organizing committee resigns.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin closed out his argument with a quote commonly attributed to Voltaire - quote, \"Anyone who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\" SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: It was the Democrats' last push to convince 17 Republicans to join them in order to convict former President Trump of inciting the insurrection on January 6. House impeachment manager Joe Neguse implored senators to hold Trump accountable for the lies he spread. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE NEGUSE: Because if you don't - if we pretend this didn't happen or, worse, if we let it go unanswered, who's to say it won't happen again? PFEIFFER: Democrats say the evidence is clear that last month's insurrection was foreseeable, predictable and a direct result of Trump's behavior. Today, the defense will answer that evidence. MARTIN: We've got NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis with us. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So the Democrats' closing argument, as we heard, was as much about the future as it was about the past, right? DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, they were really making the case for conviction of Trump as a deterrent, not just to him, but to any future president, really. Here's lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMIE RASKIN: My dear colleagues, is there any political leader in this room who believes that, if he is ever allowed by the Senate to get back into the Oval Office, Donald Trump would stop inciting violence to get his way? Would you bet the lives of more police officers on that? Would you bet the safety of your family on that? Would you bet the future of your democracy on that? DAVIS: Another one of the managers, Ted Lieu of California, said the concern was not that Trump would run and win again, but that he could run and lose again, causing that same kind of unrest we saw on January 6. That was a point that really made an impression on senators. Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota told reporters that he thought that was a very powerful argument, and he made note of it and said many of his colleagues did as well. MARTIN: So he made note of it. But does that mean he's going to vote for conviction? I mean, is there any indication that the presentation changed the minds of any Republican lawmakers? DAVIS: Yeah, it's really unlikely. I mean, the same senator, Mike Rounds, said he just continues to believe the Senate does not have the constitutional authority to convict someone who's no longer in office. That's the broad view among Republicans, although the Senate did vote in a bipartisan way to affirm they do have this authority. None are really defending the president's actions on the merits, what he did that day. But this could also still be the most bipartisan impeachment in history. We've already seen 10 Republicans vote to impeach in the House. And if more than just one Republican senator votes to convict in the Senate, it would set a record for senators breaking with their own party to vote to convict a president in an impeachment trial. And there's at least six Republican senators who have indicated they could do that. MARTIN: So Trump's lawyers get their shot today. They're going to lay out their defense. Do we have a sense of what that's going to look like? DAVIS: Well, it looks like it's going to be pretty short. David Schoen, one of his defense attorneys, talked to reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday. He said they'd probably only take about three or four hours to make their case. You know, Rachel, they sort of have the benefit of not having the quality of their arguments have much impact on the outcome of the case here, so they can be brief. The defense argument is, again, going to focus on this view that they believe the process is unconstitutional. They're also going to make a First Amendment argument that Trump was exercising a right to political speech here. That was an argument impeachment managers tried to get ahead of throughout the case over the last two days. They argue that the First Amendment simply doesn't apply if the speech undermines the very same oath of office that presidents take to protect the Constitution. Raskin compared Trump to a fire chief who incites a mob in a - to set a theater on fire, then refuses to put out the fire and then encourages the mob as the fire spreads throughout the theater. MARTIN: So if they wrap today, when does it look like the trial might end? DAVIS: You know, several senators said yesterday they think they could wrap on Saturday. They still will have to do about four hours of senator questions, and they'll get closing remarks. If it doesn't wrap on Saturday, possibly Sunday. But right now, we have no indication that it will spill into next week. MARTIN: OK. NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thank you. DAVIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. So former President Trump may escape conviction in his impeachment trial, but that's not the end of his legal problems. PFEIFFER: Now that he's out of office, Trump could also be facing criminal charges in several cases. New York's district attorney is widening an ongoing investigation into Trump's business dealings. That investigation is focused on potential financial crimes in Trump's private businesses. And prosecutors in Georgia have also started a criminal investigation, this one centered around that infamous phone call Trump made to Georgia's secretary of state, the one in which he asked him to find votes to reverse his election loss. MARTIN: Joining us now, Andrea Bernstein from member station WNYC in New York. She's the co-host of the Trump, Inc. podcast. Andrea, thanks for being here. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. It's always great to talk to you. MARTIN: We're happy to have you. So let's start in New York. What's that investigation about? BERNSTEIN: So the most significant case that Trump is facing is this looming criminal investigation the Manhattan DA, Cyrus Vance Jr., has underway. And this is the case where the DA's been trying to get Trump's tax returns, and Trump has sued. And that case is now at the Supreme Court for a second time. But from what we know, the investigation is far along. And because Trump's been trying to block the subpoenas, there's a great deal in the public record. So we know the DA is looking at Trump, his family, his business. And we know the crimes - for possible bank, insurance and tax fraud, including some serious felonies that would carry significant prison time. So though the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against Trump the first time, the former president came back with a new claim. But most experts think that eventually Vance will get the records he's seeking. And if that happens and if Vance decides he believes crimes were committed, there could be indictments this year. MARTIN: It's crazy to think back that the tax returns - it's always been about the tax returns since the beginning. So that's not it, though, right? Can you tell us about some of the other cases? BERNSTEIN: Right. So as you mentioned, we learned just this week that Georgia prosecutors are examining whether Trump violated criminal election statutes when he engaged in that all-out campaign to change the results in Georgia. So even though that case has just begun, it's another criminal case, and it would actually be much more straightforward than the complex financial crimes the Manhattan DA is looking at. Then, the New York attorney general is looking at whether Trump failed to pay proper New York state taxes. The District of Columbia attorney general is looking into whether Trump's inaugural committee violated charities laws when it paid big fees to Trump's hotels during the last inaugurations. And there are multiple civil suits. So there's really a lot of litigation. MARTIN: And as you said, some of these investigations, I mean, they've been going on a while. But things have changed now that Trump is out of office. How so? BERNSTEIN: Right. So in a lot of these cases, what he was arguing was that his status as president meant he deserved special treatment, that he could withhold records, testimony and generally stymie the probes. And it worked. So in some of the investigations into his private business while he was president, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened. That can't happen anymore. Now he's just an ordinary citizen. So while he can and is arguing the investigations are politically motivated, he has to defend himself just like everyone else. MARTIN: Andrea Bernstein from member station WNYC in New York, host of the Trump, Inc. podcast. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Today, the Biden administration is announcing dramatic changes to the nation's asylum system. PFEIFFER: The Trump administration established a controversial program known as \"Remain in Mexico.\" It forced asylum-seekers to wait for their cases to be heard across the border in Mexico instead of in the U.S., often in dangerous and squalid conditions. President Biden's immigration team plans to replace it with what they say is a more humane and orderly process. MARTIN: NPR's John Burnett is with us now from Austin, Texas, with more details. Hey, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So what can you tell us about this new policy? BURNETT: Well, there are about 25,000 asylum applicants that are stuck in Mexican border cities, some with kids. And some of them have been waiting as long as two years to be allowed into a U.S. immigration court to make their case as to why they should receive protection. Many are Central Americans who fled family violence or criminal gangs, but they're from all over. So under Obama and the first half of the Trump years, they were allowed to travel to U.S. cities, stay with friends or family and get hearings at the nearest immigration court. But Trump eventually put a stop to that, and they had to wait in Mexico in precarious situations like the refugee camp in Matamoros that I've visited a lot. There are thousands of migrants living in flimsy tents amid mud, mosquitoes and illness and extortion gangs prowling the streets. What Biden's people are doing is setting up a process that allows them to cross the border and enter the U.S. to wait safely while they await their day in court. MARTIN: Wow. So I understand you've already gotten some reaction from asylum-seekers who've been waiting in Mexico. What are they telling you? BURNETT: Yeah, they're elated. Only last week, the White House released an executive order that said it would take three months to figure out what to do with all the people at the border. So his officials surprised everybody by announcing this new processing protocol today. Last night, I called up Yady Meyan Calderon, a 34-year-old chemist from Cuba. For the last year and a half, she's been living in a beat-up tenement house in Reynosa, Mexico, with 15 other Cubans. They're all enrolled in Trump's program. The formal name is Migrant Protection Protocols, which critics thought was a sick joke. YADY MEYAN CALDERON: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: She says they feel like they finally arrived at the light at the end of the tunnel. She says there are hundreds of Cuban asylum-seekers in Reynosa, and they've grown desperate, facing daily street violence and joblessness. But she says now they have confidence that soon the door to the U.S. will be open to them. MARTIN: So - I mean, this sounds like a positive step for those who are waiting for asylum. But how is it actually going to work in practice? BURNETT: Well, last night we got on a call with some senior Homeland Security officials. And as they explained it, the first phase starts next Friday. It'll cover only those currently at the border and not the many thousands of others who've already gone back to their home countries. Of - this first group will be taken to staging areas in Mexico where they'll get tested for COVID. And if they're healthy, they'll be transported to a U.S. port of entry, processed and then turned over to a humanitarian group like Catholic Charities, who will help them catch a bus to their destination city. Initially, the program should process about 300 migrants a day. And once it gets going and work the kinks out, they'll expand it. Another big difference is they won't be sent to these private detention centers. They'll be fitted with electronic ankle monitors to make sure the government can keep track of them and allowed to travel into the U.S. interior. MARTIN: So as you noted earlier, John, I mean, this is happening really fast. I imagine that there are critics who say that this could just create chaos at the border. BURNETT: That's right, Rachel. And, you know, you can expect immigration hawks to complain this is a return to what they called catch and release, that migrants won't show up for their court hearings and just disappear. They warn that when the word gets out, it'll become a magnet to attract even more unauthorized migrants to the border. They say there's already an uptick in illegal border crossings, 3,000 arrests a day last month. So Biden's team will have to make sure the folks who are being let in show up in court. And if they lose their asylum cases, they'll be deported. MARTIN: NPR's John Burnett in Austin, Texas, giving us reaction to this new change announced by the Biden administration to U.S. asylum policy. Thank you so much, John. BURNETT: You bet, Rachel.

            "article_content": "A yellow banner that reads \"JESUS SAVES\" stands out in the pro-Trump mob outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A yellow banner that reads \"JESUS SAVES\" stands out in the pro-Trump mob outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Updated on Friday at 3:02 p.m. As the pro-Trump mob stormed up the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, a big yellow banner stood out among the blue Trump flags carried high by the throng: \"JESUS SAVES.\" Nearby was another, with an even stranger message \u2014 \"JESUS 2020\" \u2014 as if the Lord himself had been a candidate in the disputed election. Christian nationalism was one of the underlying themes of the nearly all-white insurrection at the Capitol, which also featured symbols of the Confederacy. For Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, the event represented an \"unholy amalgamation of white supremacy and Christianity.\" The connection was not surprising given the strong support for President Trump among white evangelicals. Most of the U.S. senators who objected to the certification of the Electoral College results for President-elect Joe Biden identify strongly with the conservative evangelical movement, and some evangelical Christian leaders have been prominent in the promotion of baseless allegations of widespread election fraud. Among the attendees at the pro-Trump rally that preceded Wednesday's attack on the Capitol was Jack Hibbs, senior pastor at Calvary Chapel in Chino Hills, Calif. Though Hibbs did not participate in the storming of the Capitol, his condemnation of the violence was somewhat equivocal. \"This is what you get when you eject God from the courts and from the schools,\" Hibbs told Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, speaking on Perkins' radio show. Perkins himself, an ordained minister, had been among those who called for state legislatures to reject pro-Biden electors. On his show, however, Perkins recognized that the violence at the Capitol tainted Christian involvement in the pro-Trump movement. \"I would be hard-pressed to find Bible-believing Christians that would be OK with what took place at the Capitol,\" Perkins said. \"I think this sets us back in terms of addressing the concerns that endanger our republic.\" Other evangelical Christian leaders were far more outspoken in their rejection of the attack on the Capitol and more willing to blame President Trump. \"I don't know the Jesus some have paraded and waved around in the middle of this treachery today,\" tweeted Beth Moore, well known in evangelical circles for her Bible studies. \"They may be acting in the name of some other Jesus, but that's not the Jesus of the Gospels.\" \"It was a moral abomination incited by the president,\" said Russell Moore (not a relation), president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, speaking Thursday to a group of religion journalists. \"Enough is enough\u2014and indeed was enough a long time ago,\" Moore wrote on Wednesday in a commentary reacting to the day's events. \"It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we can start now \u2014 just by not being afraid to say what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.\" In a follow-up tweet on Friday, Moore called on Trump to \"step down and let our country heal.\" Moore has been a regular critic of Trump, but some pro-Trump evangelical leaders broke with the president over his incitement of the attack on the Capitol. Albert Mohler, president of the flagship seminary of the Southern Baptist Convention, created a stir last year when he announced he would be voting for Trump in spite of not doing so in 2016. Since the election, however, Mohler has been highly critical of Trump's behavior, and he made clear Wednesday that he blamed him for the attack on the Capitol. \"President Trump is responsible now for unleashing mayhem,\" he said. In a podcast released Thursday, Mohler said he did not regret his vote, but he clearly distanced himself from the president. \"I do not follow a cult of personality,\" Mohler said. \"I am committed as a Christian to certain moral principles ... that I believe are derived from biblical Christianity. ... But what we saw in Washington, what we heard from the president, not just yesterday but in recent days, is an attempt to subvert the very constitutional order that he took an oath of office to defend.\" Other Christian leaders were similarly quick to weigh in on Wednesday's events. Cardinal Blase Cupich, the Chicago archbishop, did not mince words. \"What has been unfolding at the Capitol today should shock the conscience of any patriotic American and any faithful Catholic,\" Cupich said in a Wednesday statement. \"The eyes of the world look on in horror as we suffer this national disgrace. For many months we have witnessed the deliberate erosion of the norms of our system of government. Peaceful protest is a sacred right. ... But violence is its opposite. Violence in the service of a falsehood is worse.\" The Rev. Michael Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, was similarly outspoken. \"We believe the actions of armed protesters represent a coup attempt,\" Curry said, according to a roundup of faith reactions by the Religion News Service. \"This threatens the integrity of our democracy, the national security of our nation, the continuity of government and the lives and safety of our legislators, their staffs, law enforcement and all who work in the Capitol.\" The attack on the Capitol came on the same day a Black Baptist preacher, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, was confirmed as the winner of his Senate race in Georgia. His election victory was, in significant part, the result of political work by Black churches in his state and exemplified the power of Black voters, who deserve much credit for the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The refusal of Trump supporters to acknowledge the Biden-Harris victory, and the hateful attack on the Capitol, were seen by some Black leaders as racist reactions. \"What we saw today in the U.S. Capitol was un-American, based on our Constitution, but it was not non-American, because oppressed people have seen this kind of mob violence many times before in this country,\" noted the Rev. William J. Barber, pastor of the Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C., and a co-leader of the Poor Peoples Campaign. Non-Christian faith leaders joined in denouncing the violence at the Capitol. \"The very values and rights bestowed by our democracy are degraded and diminished when police officers have to draw their guns to protect our duly-elected officials in the heart of our nation [against] violent protesters, who, by their reckless and dangerous behavior, have inflicted grievous wounds on our nation,\" said Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. Hier offered a prayer at President Trump's inauguration in 2017, but he was unsparing in his reaction to the events at the Capitol. \"Nothing, not even the emotional charges of voter fraud in a presidential election, can ever legitimize or excuse such behavior,\" Hier said. \"For as the Talmud warns, 'Pray for the welfare of our government, for without it, man would swallow his fellow.\" Criticism of the attack on the Capitol was so widespread among U.S. faith leaders that the Wednesday events may actually set the stage for greater acceptance of a Biden-Harris administration. Among those taking a softer line on Thursday was Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham and an early and stalwart supporter of Trump. \"The division in our country is as great as any time since the Civil War,\" Graham tweeted. \"I am calling on Christians to unite our hearts together in prayer for President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris, and for the leadership in both parties.\"",

Famous for her fiery speeches and welfare programs geared toward women, Banerjee, 66, is beloved in her home state. This year, Time magazine included her in its list of the world's 100 most influential people. KOLKATA, India \u2014 Strings of flags showing one woman's smiling face zigzag back and forth above the old colonial streets of this city formerly known as Calcutta. The same face appears on the side of Kolkata's city buses and on posters along the banks of a Ganges River branch. It even shows up in graffiti, as the face of a 10-armed Hindu goddess \u2014 and as Mother India, banishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi into the Bay of Bengal. It's the face of Mamata Banerjee, the popular chief minister of West Bengal \u2014 a state in eastern India that's more populous than most countries. Banerjee governs about 100 million people. Famous for her fiery speeches, welfare programs geared toward women and the simple white cotton saris she wears, Banerjee, 66, is beloved in her home state, especially among the poor and women. She preaches inclusivity and accuses Modi's Hindu nationalists of trying to divide Indians along sectarian lines. It's a message that's worked for her at the polls: In May, Banerjee's center-left party, the All India Trinamool Congress, trounced Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, halting its sweep of state elections. Graffiti depicts Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, as \"Mother India\" banishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi into the Bay of Bengal.\n                \n                    \n                    Sushmita Pathak/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Now, with the national opposition to Modi in shambles, Banerjee \u2014 already one of Modi's fiercest critics \u2014 has emerged as secular, liberal Indians' best hope, analysts say, for ending what they see as Modi's authoritarian rule. Her profile is rising: In 2019, a Bengali-language movie called Baghini \u2014 \"The Tigress\" \u2014 was made about her life. This year, she was included in Time magazine's list of 100 most influential people. But Modi is India's most popular leader in decades. And with the next general election likely more than two years away, analysts say Banerjee \u2014 a regional leader from a non-Hindi speaking state, and a woman without the backing of a political dynasty \u2014 has her work cut out for her. Banerjee has none of the family connections that helped India's best-known female politician \u2014 the first and only woman to serve as prime minister, Indira Gandhi \u2014 rise to the top of patriarchal politics in the 1970s. Gandhi's father was India's first post-colonial prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Banerjee's father died when she was a teenager. \"She came from a family with very little means, an extremely humble upbringing, and with the loss of her father, the entire responsibility of a household pretty much fell on her,\" says Shutapa Paul, author of a biography titled Didi: The Untold Mamata Banerjee. (\"Didi,\" Banerjee's nickname, means elder sister in several Indian languages.) Paul says Banerjee did odd jobs as a teenager, giving tutorials to schoolchildren and working at milk booths \u2014 kiosks where small portions of milk are sold in the street. She then won a spot to study history and law at the University of Calcutta. She got involved in student politics, attended demonstrations and drew the attention of local leaders of India's then-dominant political party, Indira Gandhi's Indian National Congress. Graffiti in Kolkata depicts West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as the 10-armed Hindu goddess Durga, ahead of a Hindu festival called Durga Puja celebrating the goddess.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Her speeches were fiery! She was quite aggressive even at that time,\" Paul explains. \"She can be brash. She's confident \u2014 sometimes overconfident.\" There's a famous photo from that era of Banerjee dancing atop the hood of a rival politician's car. \"The police would come and round up [the student protesters] and throw them in prison \u2014 lock them up for half a day or so,\" Paul says. \"She would take her college books and start reading inside the prison cell itself.\" At first, Banerjee joined the Congress party and became one of its student leaders. She was elected to India's parliament as a member of that party in 1984, when she was 29. She later fell out with Congress leaders, and in 1998, founded her own political party. It's a center-left party, active primarily in West Bengal. Banerjee's biggest political victory came 10 years ago, when she was elected West Bengal's first female chief minister, ending 34 years of Communist rule in the state. She's also served in the national Cabinet several times, in coalition governments. She was India's first female minister of railways and of coal \u2014 both high-profile jobs. And she served as the minister for youth and sports, women and child development, and human resources. Nowadays, the confrontational spirit that led Banerjee to dance on that politician's car in the 1970s comes out in her news conferences. She often taunts Modi. \"Mr. busy prime minister, what [do] you want? What [do] you want, to finish me? Can you do it? Never!\" she exclaimed in a May 31 news conference, clips from which went viral in India. Flags of Mamata Banerjee's All India Trinamool Congress party alongside laundry hanging in Banerjee's own neighborhood in central Kolkata, India.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Her reputation is as a feisty, 5-foot thorn in Modi's side. And perhaps because Banerjee is a woman, she's also become famous for what she wears. The simple white cotton saris she favors are made of the same material worn by Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa, who helped Calcutta's sick and impoverished and is buried here. \"What she wears is a conscious decision to project a simple, grassroots, common person. That is the image she has cultivated and honed in West Bengal \u2014 this image of being an elder sister, a mother figure, somebody who is fond of your family,\" Paul, her biographer, says. That's not unlike the image Modi has cultivated on the national stage. Modi was a tea seller as a teenager; Banerjee worked at the milk booths. Both Modi and Banerjee are single, childless, from humble roots, said to be workaholics, devoted to their politics. Graffiti in central Kolkata depicts Mamata Banerjee playing soccer with a cast on her leg. \"Vote for TMC\" is a reference to Banerjee's political party, the All India Trinamool Congress, or TMC. In May, Banerjee campaigned in state elections with a cast on her leg, after she was injured in a melee that some members of her party blamed on operatives from a rival party.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Another part of the image Banerjee has cultivated is that of a survivor \u2014 and possibly, a master of political theater. In May, she campaigned in state elections with a cast on her leg after she was injured in a melee that some of her party members blamed on operatives from Modi's BJP. A BJP spokesman accused Banerjee of \"putting up a drama\" \u2014 essentially, milking her injuries for public sympathy. But there are signs that Modi sees Banerjee as a threat. Last spring, in the lead-up to West Bengal's state elections, Modi's party circulated a video clip of Banerjee reciting Muslim prayers. It was edited down from a longer clip in which she recited Hindu and Sikh prayers too. The suggestion was that Banerjee favors Muslims over her fellow Hindus, who are India's majority. The BJP's ploy backfired, and Banerjee's party won those elections. But Hindu nationalism, or Hindutva \u2014 a movement that seeks to make India's Hindu faith the basis for the country's policies \u2014 has worked for Modi nationally. Banerjee has taken note. She recently started mentioning her Hindu caste (Brahmin) in public speeches \u2014 something she never did before, says political scientist Proma Ray Chaudhury. \"Alongside these welfare mechanisms that Mamata projects, she also in a way appeals to soft Hindutva \u2014 a softer version of the muscular, aggressive Hindutva that Modi and his party projects,\" she says. \"She's trying to beat Modi at his own game.\" If Banerjee challenges Modi in the next election, it will be a \"David versus Goliath narrative,\" says Shoaib Daniyal, a political reporter who has covered Banerjee for the news site Scroll.in. That's a dynamic Banerjee is familiar with, he says. \"She's always the David, even when she's the chief minister,\" Daniyal says. \"She first defeated the Communists at a time when they looked absolutely invincible in West Bengal, and now she's going up against the behemoth that is Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.\" The prime minister remains popular. A weekly survey of domestic approval ratings for 13 top global leaders shows Modi as the most popular for most of the past 20 months. And Banerjee has been dogged by corruption allegations against her aides, though they haven't seemed to hurt her at the polls, Daniyal notes. \"Indians, while they dislike corruption, it seems that if you really deliver a lot of [welfare] benefits to them, they are willing to overlook the fact that they have to pay a bribe to get them,\" he says. \"So it seems like welfare delivery has sort of overridden the allegations of corruption in her case.\" Political flags and graffiti in Kolkata bear the symbol of the All India Trinamool Congress, the regional political party Mamata Banerjee founded.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Another factor that may work against her at the national level is that Banerjee is not a native speaker of Hindi, a language spoken across much of northern India. (Bengali is more widely spoken in her home state.) And she heads a regional party, not a national one. \"A regional outfit expanding from a non-Hindi speaking state and trying to become a national player is something that has actually never happened before in Indian politics,\" Daniyal notes. For Banerjee to become a candidate for prime minister, her Trinamool party would have to form a pre-election pact with a wide range of other regional parties that all oppose Modi's BJP \u2014 even if they have disparate regional interests and policies. It could make for some odd bedfellows, says Chaudhury. \"A pre-poll coalition is doable,\" she says, \"but it could be messy.\" Being a woman is often a liability in India's patriarchal politics. That may now be changing, Chaudhury says \u2014 and Banerjee's gender may actually help her. \"Because for the first time in Indian politics, women are forming a very salient and distinctive electoral constituency. So their votes have become decisive factors,\" she says. \"We saw that in the [spring 2021] West Bengal elections, and in the 2019 general elections as well, that women voters have proven to be a voting bloc \u2014 and Mamata Banerjee, through her welfare trust mechanism, caters to this particular voting bloc.\" Indian women are voting more \u2014 and not just for the candidates their husbands or fathers want them to support. Banerjee appeals to women not just because she is one \u2014 but because her welfare programs prioritize women. Possibly emulating those, Modi has also introduced similar initiatives on a national scale \u2014 for example, a recent program to subsidize cooking gas canisters for women. Other parties are also taking note of this voting trend: For upcoming state elections in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, the opposition Congress party says it will reserve 40% of assembly seats for female lawmakers. The idea is that women might be more willing to vote for a party that guarantees them representation in local office.

On the night before the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Washington Post reporter Robert Costa walked through the streets of D.C., surrounded by a throng of Trump supporters. He says he remembers a particular energy in the crowd that night. \"They were clashing with police officers. They were fighting with each other. There was a euphoria,\" Costa says. \"The mob ... it was loud.\" Costa's new book Peril, which he co-wrote with journalist Bob Woodward, centers on President Trump's final days in office \u2014 specifically the events leading up to and following the Capitol siege. As the crowd agitated outside, Costa says, inside a \"war room\" at the nearby Willard hotel, Trump lawyers and allies, including Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon and Jason Miller, were laying out a strategy to overturn the results of the 2020 election. According to Costa, Trump attorney John Eastman drafted a memo suggesting that an alternate slate of electors be used as a tactic to stop the certification of the election results. \"They were trying to get [Vice President] Pence and others to move the election to the House of Representatives to block Biden from taking office,\" Costa explains. Costa says that Pence declined to go along with the plan \u2014 mostly because there were no alternate slates of electors on hand. But, Costa adds, \"Imagine if in January 2025, Republicans are much more organized and they have alternate slates of electors ready in many states. What happens then?\" Ten months later, hundreds of members of the mob who stormed the Capitol are facing prosecution for their actions. But it remains to be seen whether anyone from the Willard war room will be charged. \"The looming question for Merrick Garland, the attorney general, is: Is he going to go at the key players, who may not be directly tied to the violence or may not have their fingerprints on the steel bars that were used against the Capitol Police officers that day, but [who] were part of planning an effort to defraud the United States?\" Costa says. \"I'm not a lawyer, but I think raising the question is certainly understandable based on all of this reporting.\" On the scene on the street the night of Jan. 5 and into Jan. 6 Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa\n                \n                    \n                    Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa [The crowd] was so loud that Trump could hear them. And Trump doesn't like being outside \u2014 from what I've witnessed over the years, he's more of an indoor person \u2014 but he keeps the door to the Oval Office open on the night of the 5th after Pence leaves just so he can hear the mob. And Woodward said to me, it's almost like when he was writing The Final Days with Carl Bernstein, when [Richard] Nixon was talking to the pictures on the wall, Trump is talking to the mob. A few aides come in from the press shop, and say, \"Mr. President, Mr. President, it's cold. We closed the door. Why is the door open?\" [And Trump says,] \"I want to hear my people. Listen. They have courage. Listen.\" And he keeps the door open for the whole meeting on the night of Jan. 5. On Trump's direct calls to the Willard war room The fact that the calls happened is very important in the context of the whole insurrection because for months, as reporters, we know that Trump was pressuring Pence in the Oval Office. That's been well-documented, and we knew that Giuliani and Bannon were up to a lot of stuff in Washington that night. What we wanted to figure out when we were looking at this book is was there a connection between the two? And the fact that Trump calls Bannon and Giuliani after Pence leaves the White House around 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 5 to update them, it shows that there is at the very least coordination between these two power centers on the eve of an insurrection. It will be up to the DOJ to decide whether this is a conspiracy, a crime to defraud the United States. On the statement the Trump campaign issued Jan. 5 about Pence's support, which wasn't true \u2014 and the resulting tension between the president and the vice president It was a campaign statement on Trump campaign letterhead saying, in Donald Trump's words, that Mike Pence fully agrees with me. The quote that stunned the Pence people was \"Mike Pence is in total agreement that on Jan. 6, the election should be overturned and he should move it to the House.\" It was issued on a formal statement. This is where you start to see the crack in the American democratic system \u2014 when the vice president and president are not in sync, and the president starts to speak for other constitutional officers. This is where Pence and his team really go into a bunker mode and they don't even share the letter Pence ultimately releases on Jan. 6, explaining his decision to not try to do anything crazy on Jan. 6. They don't even share it with the White House counsel or with Trump. That was the level of tension between the president and the vice president. On a possible criminal charge of defrauding the U.S. for those who organized the insurrection It's a well-known part of the U.S. Code, and if someone wants to look it up, it's 18 U.S. Code 371. It means that if you have one or two people conspiring to commit an offense against the United States, to defraud the U.S., then you have committed a crime and you shall be fined or imprisoned for possibly up to five years. This is a crime, and it's been prosecuted many, many times. On the perils that remain and the threats to our democracy You have a former president in Donald Trump who refuses to share documents to give any kind of information to an investigation about an insurrection that his friends and allies were part of, at least on the legal and political level, in trying to force the election to be overturned. There is violence and connections that need to be explained at a grassroots level and potentially at a higher level. And these unanswered questions are part of the peril that remains. If we don't have accountability in truth and answers in a democracy, then what kind of democracy is it? There are so many things that we just still don't know. ... What else don't we know about the domestic side of things? The QAnon movement, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers seem to be growing by the day across the country. There's a violence and extremism and a lot of the rhetoric now, publicly. You see Trump out there ... he's as active as ever. ... There is a huge effort, whether it's the Arizona \"audit\" \u2014 isn't an audit at all. But the Arizona effort to maybe say Trump won the state. All these Republican-controlled states have people in them, in the Legislature's key leaders who are doing a lot to try to change election laws, change voting rights. And [House Majority Whip] Jim Clyburn ... says in our book that \"democracy is on fire\" because, on the federal level, Democrats won't break the filibuster and pass voting rights legislation that they all agree on. But Republicans are very busy passing their voting laws in different states. And what I just see on the horizon is a collision of some sort on the voting rights issue and on the foundation of democracy. If the system's not functioning and people aren't accepting reality and pushing to change the laws, who knows what happens next?

Later that day, the Capitol building was breached by a violent mob driven by what's commonly known as \"the big lie\": that President Biden wasn't legitimately elected.\n                \n                    \n                    Jack Gruber/USA Today Network via Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters gather at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Later that day, the Capitol building was breached by a violent mob driven by what's commonly known as \"the big lie\": that President Biden wasn't legitimately elected. Jared Stacy is still processing his decision to leave Spotswood Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va., last year. Until November, he was ministering to young parishioners in their 20s and 30s. But in the four years since he had joined the church as a pastor, Stacy had found himself increasingly up against an invisible, powerful force taking hold of members of his congregation: conspiracy theories, disinformation and lies. Stacy has seen the real consequences of these lies build up over the years; he says it has tainted the name of his faith. \"If Christians in America are serious about helping people see Jesus and what he's about and what he claims, then the label 'evangelical' is a distraction because it bears, unfortunately, the weight of a violence,\" he told NPR. \"I would not use that term because of its association with Jan. 6.\" That's the day the U.S. Capitol was attacked and invaded by a violent mob driven by what's commonly known as \"the big lie\": that President Biden wasn't legitimately elected. The rioters moved toward the Capitol following a rally held by then-President Donald Trump, during which he repeated that big lie. Rioters say they were compelled to stop Congress' certification of Biden's election, which was happening at that time at the Capitol. The lie is so powerful that a recent survey by the conservative American Enterprise Institute shows that 3 in 5 white evangelicals say Biden was not legitimately elected. Among them is Pastor Ken Peters, who founded the Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tenn., last year. \"I believe that right now we have an illegitimate president in the White House and he was not elected by the people,\" Peters told NPR. \"I believe the truly 'We the People'-elected, should-be president is residing in Florida right now.\" On its website, the Patriot Church is described as a movement: \"a church interceding on behalf of her nation.\" That movement has a name: Christian nationalism. Some conservative evangelical circles have incubated and spread these kinds of conspiracy theories \u2014 some of which have led to violence \u2013 for years. Andrew Whitehead, who has spent several years researching Christian nationalism at Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis, defines it as the belief that America is a Christian nation, one that should privilege white, native-born politically conservative Christians. \"We do find evidence that Americans who embrace Christian nationalism are much more likely to embrace conspiratorial thinking,\" Whitehead told NPR. \"The leaders of those movements have continually cast doubt on who you can really trust or even the federal government.\" Trump seized on the opportunity to exploit their distrust for his own political survival. He made himself a champion for evangelical social issues \u2014 abortion being at the top of the list. He won their confidence \u2014 and their blind loyalty. For Stacy, the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 is not something he fathomed when he decided to step away from his mainstream church in November. Rather, it was a slow burn of other conspiracy theories that had been churning at his church and others for years. Jared Stacy was a pastor at Spotswood Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va., until last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Jared Stacy\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jared Stacy was a pastor at Spotswood Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va., until last year. The danger of ambivalence During the protests last summer after George Floyd's killing, Stacy noticed his congregation making a turn toward a conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking. \"I began to see on social media people ignoring or pushing away Black Lives Matter by saying, you know, oh, well, no one's over here talking about trafficking,\" Stacy told NPR. He said the concern about child trafficking started out as legitimate \u2014 it is an awful truth that exists. But he quickly noticed that his parishioners started using it as shorthand for a lie: that Democrats with prominent roles in business, media and government are running child trafficking rings. It was that conspiracy theory that compelled a man named Edgar Maddison Welch to fire inside a family pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in December 2016. That false notion became prevalent again nearly a year later at the center of QAnon, an umbrella of conspiracy theories that has amplified false ideas about an evil liberal agenda and that casts Trump as a savior. QAnon has coalesced since then, perpetrating the lie that President Biden's election was illegitimate. Stacy was afraid of what he saw taking root in his church. \"This is about a wholesale view of reality \u2014 what is real, what is true,\" he said. He saw some people in his own congregation \u2014 mostly the parents or elders of the young adults he worked with \u2014 elevating the idea of sex trafficking of kids and what he called \"Democrat pedophilia.\" \"It was people who I respected, and that's even more complicated because they were [my] elders,\" Stacy said. \"The crack, the split was kitchen tables, where you have two completely different information streams, one that the parents use and one that their kids use,\" he said. Those two streams of information divided families: Older members of the church were entertaining conspiracies, and younger members were pushing back. Stacy tried to have conversations with the members who believed these falsehoods. He saw it as his duty, even though the church he worked for avoided these discussions. \"As a church we're not in that discussion,\" a member of Spotswood Baptist Church leadership told NPR. \"We have no interest being involved in that. It's not something that's been in any way discussed or on our agenda.\" But Stacy couldn't separate his role as pastor from the conspiracy theories that were putting a strain on the younger parishioners he worked with. \"The danger was of them being given a co-opted Jesus, a Jesus who believed in Q, a Jesus who believed in deep state, a Jesus who automatically voted Republican.\" He said he could see several outcomes, none of which was any good: Either the younger members would leave the church altogether, or they'd buy into the conspiracy theories or they'd just learn to tolerate them. That tolerance \u2014 and ambivalence \u2014 could be what do the most damage. They're how conspiracy theories spread. A threat to democracy When asked about the QAnon conspiracy theory that political leaders run a sex trafficking ring, Peters of the Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tenn., wouldn't disavow it. \"I don't know if they're right or wrong \u2014 I have no evidence personally to go one way or the other,\" Peters said. \"Let's investigate that instead of investigating preachers who were at the [Jan. 6] rally as if we started some sort of insurrection.\" Peters was among those who participated in the Jan. 6 rally with Trump. What can come off as a benign plea of ignorance and a feigned desire to learn the truth is enough to keep the theory going \u2014 and have it gain steam. According to a recent study by Lifeway Research, 49% of Protestant pastors say they frequently hear members of their congregations repeating baseless conspiracy theories. The recent study by the American Enterprise Institute showed that 27% of white evangelicals \u2014 the most of any religious group \u2014 believe that the widely debunked QAnon conspiracy theory about political leaders running a child sex trafficking ring is \"completely\" or \"mostly accurate,\" and that 46% say they're \"not sure.\" If Peters pleads ignorance about that conspiracy theory, he fully embraces the big lie that led to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In a video of a sermon on Jan. 24, he shouts from the pulpit, \"Biden was illegally put in as president, [the] fake president of the United States.\" Mixing God and country in this way is a danger to the American way of life as we know it, researcher Whitehead explained. \"Christian nationalism is a threat to a pluralistic, democratic society because it sees particular ends, like keeping a certain person in the presidency, as that is what God has desired and that God wants. It's really difficult to ever come to the conclusion of 'We should share power or compromise or even abide by the democratic process' because if God does desire to, who are we to stand in the way of that?\" Taking distance to gain clarity Stacy needed distance to figure out what was happening in his church. He's living in Scotland with his wife and kids and earning a Ph.D. in theology at the University of Aberdeen. He eventually wants to come back to the U.S. and pastor a church again. He reflected back on the conversations he had with his older parishioners: \"It's almost like putting a pebble in someone's shoe, and eventually you just got to stop walking and you've got to sit down. You have to take your shoe off and you have to figure out what in the world is it that is making me limp forward here?\" \"That is what those conversations were designed to do.\" But he's going to have to figure out if planting pebbles of truth is enough to dismantle a mountain of lies.",

They gathered to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump in the 2020 election. A pro-Trump mob later stormed the Capitol, breaking windows and clashing with police officers. Five people died as a result. This week's Senate impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump centers on his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, when thousands of rioters disrupted Congress, killing and injuring Capitol police officers and others in the process. The crowd had come directly from an event where Trump had spoken to them. But the acts at issue stretch back much earlier than Jan. 6. In a legal brief filed last week, prosecutors from the House of Representatives, which impeached Trump in January, specified actions by the president many months before that day. In the trial, set to begin on Tuesday, the impeachment managers will seek to prove that his actions directly incited the insurrection. The ex-president's lawyers argue that Trump \"did not direct anyone to commit lawless actions\" and that his comments on Jan. 6 are protected by the First Amendment. In its own brief filed Monday, Trump's defense team also claims the Senate does not have the right to try a president who has left office \u2014 a point many constitutional experts disagree with.

Here, according to an NPR review, are some key moments. Apr. 7, 2020: Attacking the election Trump made one of his first false claims about the security of mail-in ballots. \"Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters,\" he said. \"They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases.\" In reality, mail-in ballots had been used safely by several states for years, with insignificant instances of fraud. The president himself had voted by mail. April 7 was a momentous day: the date of Wisconsin's presidential primary. Voters were standing in long lines despite the risk of coronavirus. The state Supreme Court had rejected an effort to extend absentee balloting in the pandemic. Other states were debating vote-by-mail measures for the fall election. Trump supporters protest against the passage of a mail-in voting bill during a Nevada Republican Party demonstration.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption June 25: The chorus Attorney General William Barr followed Trump's lead. He questioned mail-in ballots, raising the specter of counterfeiting \u2014 even though he acknowledged in an NPR interview that his concern had no basis in fact. \"Did you have evidence to raise that specific concern?\" he was asked. \"No,\" Barr replied. \"It's obvious.\" July 19: \"I'm not going to just say yes\" By midsummer, Trump was consistently behind in polling against Democrat Joe Biden. The president told Fox News that \"mail-in voting is going to rig the election.\" Interviewer Chris Wallace responded, \"Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?\" \"I have to see,\" Trump replied. Wallace tried again. \"Can you give a direct answer: Will you accept the election?\" Trump replied: \"I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.\" Aug. 19: \"I appreciate\" people who believed a conspiracy theory At a White House briefing, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the QAnon movement, adherents of an elaborate, false conspiracy theory. The FBI had previously warned that this conspiracy would likely cause people to \"carry out criminal or violent acts.\" Trump replied: \"Well, I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate.\" Sept. 29: \"Stand back and stand by\" At a presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he was willing to denounce white supremacists. Instead, he told the Proud Boys \u2014 which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as a hate group associated with white nationalism \u2014 to \"stand back and stand by.\" Ryan Goodman, editor of the website Just Security, tracked the group's online reaction as part of research for its own timeline of the attack. \" 'Stand by' is thought of as a signal to them that's actually quite positive,\" and they vowed to stand by for orders from him, Goodman said. Trump later said he meant for them to \"stand down.\" Nov. 3: Election Night The president was widely expected to claim victory on election night, when he might be leading in early ballot counts. At a White House event at 2:30 a.m. ET as ballot counting continued, including in crucial swing states, he falsely claimed victory: \"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\" In the days that followed, Trump supporters mobbed ballot-counting sites. Nov. 7: Biden wins News networks, including NPR, accurately reported that Joe Biden had won the election, based on state and local vote tallies across the nation. Rather than acknowledge the result, Trump's allies launched dozens of baseless lawsuits, often over minor issues that would not have changed the election even if true. Nov. 9: Republicans offer cover Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not repeat the president's false claims of fraud \u2014 but still defended the president's refusal to concede: \"A few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end of the republic.\" He was speaking on the Senate floor, where rioters who believed the election falsehoods would be standing less than two months later. Nov. 19: The hair dye incident In court, Trump's lawyers, including Rudolph Giuliani, pointedly told judges that he and his team were not alleging fraud; they could be punished for lying in court. Outside courtrooms, it was different. Lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell held a press conference at the offices of the Republican National Committee. \"I know crimes,\" GIuliani said. \"I can smell them. You don't have to smell this one. I can prove it to you 18 different ways,\" though he never did. What seemed like hair dye ran down his face as Powell spun out an elaborate theory linking ballot fraud to the long-deceased Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. Dec. 1: The warning Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia election official, made an appeal directly to the president at an Atlanta news conference: \"Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed.\" Dec. 14: The Electoral College votes Presidential electors met in their state capitals and cast their votes for president. A last-ditch lawsuit to disrupt the count, supported by numerous Republican state attorneys general, had been dismissed by the Supreme Court. Dec. 15: An unsuccessful effort to rein in Trump McConnell signaled that the time for the \"few legal inquiries\" had passed. \"Today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,\" McConnell said. Dec. 19: \"Will be wild!\" Trump tweeted about the upcoming joint session of Congress, where the electoral votes submitted by the states were to be formally counted. \"Big protests in D.C. on January 6. Be there. Will be wild!\" It was one of several times he promoted a rally his allies were organizing. Dec. 30: The objection Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley announced he would object to the certification of the election on Jan. 6. Republicans in the House had already indicated they would object, but it was necessary for at least one senator to join House members to force debate; Hawley's move assured this. Jan. 2, 2021: The phone call Trump phoned Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, asking him to change the state's vote total by just enough votes for Trump to prevail by a single vote. \"There's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you've recalculated.\" NPR and others reported the call the next day. Raffensperger stuck with the accurate results. Also on Jan. 2, before the call was public, the Proud Boys announced that they would attend the Jan. 6 protest. Ted Cruz and other senators released a statement saying they would join Hawley in raising objections to the vote count on Jan. 6.

Pence had declined Trump's demand that he disrupt the count, insisting on following his duty under the Constitution. Immediately afterward, \"The crowd goes wild about calling Pence a traitor,\" said Ryan Goodman of Just Security. Goodman's website compiled time-stamped video of a rioter inside the Capitol shouting on a phone: \"Can I speak to Pelosi? Yeah, we're coming, b****. Oh, Mike Pence? We're coming for you too you f****** traitor.\" \"Bring out Pence,\" others chanted. Robert Pape, who studies political violence at the University of Chicago, says that numerous rioters told reporters at the time, and the FBI afterward, why they had attacked: They believed Trump told them to. 4:17 p.m. After lawmakers appealed to Trump to call off the attackers, Trump eventually released a video that repeated his election claims, but also called for peace: \"So go home. We love you. You're very special.\" Rioters followed the president's instructions and began to disperse. Congress eventually reconvened that night and formally certified Biden's election. 6:01 p.m. In one of his last tweets before his account was removed from Twitter, the defeated president appeared to justify and celebrate the attack: \"These are the things and events that happen,\" when what he falsely called an election victory is stolen. \"Go home with love and in peace, remember this day forever!\" It would not be until a week later, the day the House impeached him, that Trump delivered an unequivocal denouncement of the attack.

With Joe Biden just days away from his inauguration as the nation's president, Pastor Darryl Knappen was still denying reality and even declaring himself willing to take up arms to keep Donald Trump in office. \"It was pastors who led the way in colonial times to encourage our country to shake off the totalitarian regime of the king of England,\" Knappen said in a Jan. 9 Facebook message to his Minnesota congregation. He was referring to the \"Black Robed Regiment,\" a name given to those ministers who supported the Revolutionary War effort. \"I was tempted to wear my black robe today and cover up my AR-15 beneath it,\" Knappen said from his Cornerstone Church sanctuary in Alexandria, Minn., \"but I thought that would be way too graphic for all of you and for Facebook to allow. But I would be part of that movement back then, and I may be part of that movement today.\" Conservative evangelical Christians have been among Donald Trump's most fervent and loyal supporters. While few have gone as far as Knappen and endorsed armed struggle on his behalf, the rhetoric of some evangelical leaders has been notably militant. In a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Dec. 9, the right-wing Christian author and radio host Eric Metaxas said he did not care about the overwhelming odds against any effort to overturn the election of Joe Biden. \"What's right is right,\" Metaxas said. \"That is so wrong. We need to do absolutely everything we can. What's going to happen is going to happen. But we need to fight to the death, to the last drop of blood, because it's worth it.\" Three days later, Metaxas was the emcee at the Jericho March in Washington, where he and others implored God to keep Trump in office. \"We are here because we know he is the God who does real miracles when his remnant cries out to him in humility and love,\" Metaxas said. \"We are here to cry out to the God of heaven to ask him to have mercy on the greatest nation in the history of the world.\" A rally organizer, Robert Weaver, told the assembled crowd that God had appeared to him in a vision after Biden's election victory and told him, \"It's not over.\" The notion that God would take direct interest in a U.S. election is an expression of the ideology of Christian nationalism, says Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Indiana University-Purdue University and co-author of Taking America Back For God. \"It's the idea that God has a plan for this nation, that God wants a particular outcome,\" Whitehead says. Such convictions, Whitehead says, gave extra potency to efforts in support of Trump's attempts to overturn his clear election defeat. \"Religion is such a strongly and closely held system of beliefs and values,\" Whitehead says. \"So if God has said, 'This is the way I want this nation run, and this is the person that I want leading it,' why would you brook any opposition, no matter what?\" Taken to an extreme, Whitehead says, that viewpoint can even be seen as justifying violence. \"Among Americans who see a fusion between their religious identities and their national identity,\" he argues, \"it tends to draw on a framework of conquering outsiders and taking violent hold of what is rightfully yours.\" Speaking at last month's Jericho March prayer rally, the founder of the OathKeepers militia group, Stewart Rhodes, told the crowd he hoped Trump would use the Insurrection Act to \"drop the hammer\" on his opponents. \"He needs to know from you that you are with him,\" Rhodes said, \"and that if he does not do it now, we're going to have to do it ourselves later, in a much more desperate, much more bloody war.\" Among the flags at the rally was a big yellow banner that said \"JESUS SAVES.\" The same banner was seen again in the crowd that assaulted the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, among other examples of Christian imagery. One of the leaders of the invasion of the Senate chamber, Jacob Chansley, actually asked the rioters to pause in their rampage and join him for a moment of prayer to God. \"Thank you for allowing the United States to be reborn,\" Chansley said, standing on the dais occupied a few hours earlier by Vice President Pence. \"We love you and we thank you. In Christ's holy name, we pray,\" Chansley said, as recorded in a video by Luke Mogelson, a writer at The New Yorker. The rioters, many of whom had quietly removed their hats, erupted in a cry of \"Amen!\" The post-election expressions of right wing Christian protest suggest that Christian militancy on occasion can lead to political extremism. \"Inherent in the idea of Christian nationalism is the idea that America is representative of God's truth, and for that reason it needs to be defended. It needs to be protected,\" says Kristin du Mez, a historian at Calvin University and author of Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted A Faith and Fractured A Nation. \"Because the dangers are so great and the stakes are so high, that often will require violence. It's violence for the sake of righteousness, violence to achieve order, violence to bring peace and security,\" du Mez says. \"There's a willingness to do what needs to be done.\" Since the Jan. 6 assault on the on the Capitol, pro-Trump Christian activists have generally kept a low profile. After an article on the Jericho March was published by The Atlantic, a spokesperson for the organizers wrote to say the March \"denounces any and all acts of violence and destruction, including any that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021.\" But not all Christian militants have been chastened. In his Jan. 9 Facebook message, Knappen issued a call to arms. \"There is a need in every one of our localities to have individuals, patriots, who are ready to arm up and be part of a citizen militia to protect our freedoms,\" he said, noting that he was in church, speaking in front of the cross. For Andrew Whitehead, the protests led by Christian militants in the aftermath of Trump's election defeat show that Christian nationalism can be a dangerous phenomenon when it calls into question the idea of sharing power with an adversary, and one not likely to disappear any time soon. \"It really is a threat to a pluralistic, democratic society,\" Whitehead says. \"It should be taken very seriously.\"",

Updated at 8:44 p.m. ET The head of a far-right extremist group, the Proud Boys, was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Monday evening less than a day before thousands of pro-Trump and far-right demonstrators are expected in the city. Enrique Tarrio, 36, was taken into police custody and charged with destruction of property, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Police Department. The charge is related to his actions during last month's pro-Trump demonstration in D.C. that turned violent. Tarrio admitted to removing and burning a Black Lives Matter banner from a historically Black church, an action the Proud Boys are now being sued over. According to the police statement, Tarrio is also being charged with possession of a high-capacity feeding device. Officers found two high-capacity firearm magazines with him when he was arrested. The FBI says the Proud Boys have \"ties to white nationalism,\" and the organization has previously been associated with acts of violence. Three conservative groups have officially submitted permit applications to the National Park Service for events on Tuesday and Wednesday, as reported by USA Today. Women for America First and the Eighty Percent Coalition requested permits for thousands of people each. A third event run by the organization The Silent Majority filed a permit for several hundred attendees. The protests coincides with the newly sworn-in 117th Congress official certification of the Electoral College ballots on Wednesday, marking the last step in the election before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Trump is supporting the protests and vows to attend. Meanwhile, city leaders are preparing for possible violence, especially as reports show members of the Proud Boys are planning to attend the march dressed incognito. In the lead-up to the demonstrations, information advising people how to secretly bring guns to the protests has been posted online, according to The Washington Post. In a statement Sunday, Mayor Muriel Bowser advised D.C. residents to avoid areas near downtown and issued a reminder that firearms are illegal while in National Park Service areas, including the National Mall and Freedom Plaza, two areas where protesters are expected to gather. Open possession of a firearm is also illegal throughout the city. I am asking Washingtonians and those who live in the region to stay out of the downtown area on Tuesday and Wednesday and not to engage with demonstrators who come to our city seeking confrontation, and we will do what we must to ensure all who attend remain peaceful. Bowser has also requested assistance from the National Guard for both Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the mayor's office, there will be around 114 members available \"at any given time\" and 340 available in total. Bowser submitted the request to the commanding officer of the D.C. National Guard, Maj. Gen. William Walker, on New Year's Eve, according to a copy of the letter provided to NPR by the mayor's office. The Guard members will be unarmed and responsible for duties such as traffic control, in order to free up police. Many streets in downtown D.C. will also be closed off starting Tuesday. National figures have also expressed concern about the upcoming demonstrations. Former Defense Secretary William Cohen told NPR's Morning Edition on Monday he thinks the events will present \"a real challenge to maintain order and stability.\" Cohen, who served in the Clinton administration, joined the other nine living former defense secretaries in an opinion piece that ran in The Washington Post Sunday condemning Trump's attempts to subvert the election and reaffirming that the military plays no role in political disputes. Cohen is concerned civil disruption could be used as a pretext to deploy military forces in the streets. \"There are things taking place which pose, I think, a threat to our domestic tranquility and security, and that is the president encouraging some of the more right-wing extremists to march on Washington and to protest,\" Cohen said. \"And the indication is he's urging them to \u2014 it's going to be wild.\" In a statement Monday evening, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine condemned groups that plan to incite violence at the protests, referring to them as entities that \"promote hate on a racial and religious basis.\" He did not specifically name any groups. \"While we respect their right to protest, we will not tolerate criminal behavior\u2014and we should deny them the opportunity to cause chaos,\" he said. Racine also echoed Bowser's request for residents to stay away from the area. \"Hate has no home in the District,\" he added. \"Let's keep the peace, rather than provide this band of agitators any more attention than their divisive and hateful demonstrations will otherwise receive.\"",

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said Friday that his government will withdraw the controversial farm laws that were met with year-long demonstrations from tens of thousands of farmers who said the laws will shatter their livelihoods. NEW DELHI \u2014 In a surprise announcement, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Friday his government will withdraw the controversial farm laws that prompted year-long protests from tens of thousands of farmers and posed a significant political challenge to his administration. Modi made the announcement during a televised speech that was broadcast live. He urged the protesters to return home and said the constitutional process to repeal the laws will begin in December when parliament sits for the winter session. \"Let us make a fresh start,\" Modi said during the address. The announcement came on the day of the Guru Purab festival, when Sikhism founder Guru Nanak's birthday is celebrated, and ahead of key elections in states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Most of the protesters are Sikh farmers from Punjab. The laws were passed in September last year and the government had defended them, saying they were necessary to modernize India's agricultural sector and would boost production through private investment. But the farmers protested, saying the laws would devastate their earnings by ending guaranteed pricing and force them to sell their crops to corporations at cheaper prices. These perceived threats to their income terrified India's farmers, who mostly work on a small scale: More than two-thirds of them own less than 1 hectare of land. Clauses in the legislation also prevented farmers from resolving contract disputes in court, leaving them with no independent means of redress apart from government-appointed bureaucrats. Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the group of farm unions organizing the protests, said it welcomed the government's announcement. But the group said the protests would continue until the government assures them guaranteed prices for certain essential crops \u2014 a system that was introduced in the 1960s to help India shore up its food reserves and prevent shortages. The government had so far yielded very little to the drawn-out demonstrations that led to unprecedented farmer protests across India and posed a major challenge to Modi, who swept polls for the second time in 2019. Modi's decision will be seen as a political masterstroke ahead of some key state polls, particularly in Punjab, where growing alienation of the Sikh community over the laws was palpable. Initially, Modi's government had tried to discredit the Sikh farmers by dismissing their concerns as motivated by religious nationalism. Some leaders in Modi's party called them \"Khalistanis,\" a reference to a movement for an independent Sikh homeland called \"Khalistan\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Such allegations backfired, further angering the farmers. In November last year, the farmers escalated their movement by hunkering down on the outskirts of New Delhi, where they have camped out for nearly a year, including through a harsh winter and a coronavirus surge that devastated India earlier this year. While the farmers' protest movement has been largely peaceful, demonstrators in January broke through police barricades to storm the historic Red Fort in the capital's center. Clashes with police left one protester dead and hundreds injured. \"At last, all of our hard work paid off. Thanks to all the farmer brothers and salute to the farmer brothers who were martyred in this battle,\" said Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmers' leader. Dozens of farmers died due to suicide, hostile weather conditions and COVID-19 during the demonstrations. Opposition leaders, who earlier called the laws exploitative and supported the protests, congratulated the farmers. \"The country's farmers, through their resistance, made arrogance bow its head,\" tweeted Rahul Gandhi, India's main opposition party leader in Congress. \"Congratulations on the victory against injustice!\" Farmers form the most influential voting bloc in India \u2014 and are often romanticized as the heart and soul of the nation. Politicians have long considered it unwise to alienate them, and farmers are particularly important to Modi's base. Northern Haryana and a few other states with substantial farmer populations are ruled by his party.",

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said last week he will make masculinity a signature political issue. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was the first lawmaker to publicly vow to challenge the 2020 presidential election results, and memorably raised his fist in solidarity with protesters outside the Capitol on Jan. 6. Now he has a new focus: defending the men of America. In a keynote speech at the National Conservatism Conference last month, Hawley accused the political left of seeking to redefine traditional masculinity as toxic, and called for a \"revival of strong and healthy manhood in America.\" \"This is an effort that the left has been at for years now and they have had alarming success,\" he said. \"American men are working less, they are getting married in fewer numbers, they're fathering fewer children, they're suffering more anxiety and depression, they're engaging in more substance abuse.\" Hawley said he did not want to paint all men as victims. But he blamed the left for wanting to define \"traditional masculine virtues\" like courage, independence and assertiveness as \"a danger to society.\" \"Can we be surprised that after years of being told they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness, and pornography, and video games?\" he said at one point. In a TV interview with Axios last week, Hawley again accused liberals of telling men that their masculinity is \"inherently problematic.\" And he said he'll make masculinity a signature political issue. When pressed on whether any of his claims are supported by data, Hawley said millions of men are idle in part because of liberal policies. He pointed to a lack of jobs, fatherlessness and the \"social messages we teach our kids in school.\" Others disagree \u2014 like Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a gender studies professor at Calvin University and author of the book Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation. \"I think there are many challenges that the younger generation is facing right now, women and men,\" Du Mez said. \"But there are a lot of assumptions that Hawley's making that the problems are caused by some sort of destruction of manhood or destruction of masculinity, when we could look at: What are the expectations of masculinity that might be inappropriate, that might be outmoded, that are perhaps exacerbating this crisis?\" There are many ways in which liberals are actually working to strengthen fathers, she added, pointing to things like paid paternity leave and broader family leave policies. \"There can be ways to find common ground here rather than pitting half of America against the other half,\" she said. \"And I think that white men actually have a really critical role to play in that respect.\" Du Mez spoke to Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep about what she makes of Hawley's recent comments (NPR has invited him on the program too, Inskeep notes). So what is exactly is the ideal man, in Hawley's view? \"A man is a father. A man is a husband. A man is somebody who takes responsibility,\" he told Axios. In his keynote speech, Hawley said society needs \"the kind of men who make republics possible.\" Hawley doesn't exactly define masculinity in his remarks, Du Mez said, though she noted a call to action. \"He is calling on conservative men to step up to their roles as providers and protectors \u2014 protectors of faith, family and nation and to protect what he calls 'our culture,'\" she said. Du Mez notes that Hawley's keynote remarks drew on the notion that God created men and women as distinct and even opposite, with men as more assertive and women as more submissive. Though his speech focused on masculinity, Hawley did take a moment to acknowledge the role of women and to describe their virtues as \"every bit as necessary to the success of our republic.\" (He also slammed liberal lawmakers and advocates for using the phrase \"birthing people\" instead of \"mother\" and \"trying to destroy women's sports, as if women and men are somehow interchangeable.\") \"Men are protectors, women are designed to be protected,\" Du Mez said. \"This vision of gender difference really runs through conservative Christianity and through American conservatism more generally.\" She cautioned that she was not speaking to Hawley's personal beliefs, but noted this line of thinking is a widespread religious belief that would \"resonate powerfully\" with conservatives, especially conservative evangelicals. Traditional masculine virtues are in the service of white Christian nationalism, Du Mez argues. She described Hawley's language as \"militant\" and said militancy does sanction violence, something that would also resonate with much of his base. She cited survey data that shows the majority of white evangelicals believe the 2020 election was stolen, with 39% of those believing political violence may be necessary to save the country. NPR reported on those findings earlier this year. Inskeep asked Du Mez why she is using the term \"white Christian nationalism,\" anticipating that Hawley might point out he didn't bring up race himself. Du Mez answered that it's important to understand how Hawley's words might resonate with this base in particular ways. \"With this calling on men to defend our 'shared culture,' in his words, he really does seem to be tapping into a distinctive notion of who real Americans are,\" she said. \"And those are Americans who share his conservative values, not just around gender but arguably also around what this country is supposed to be, what this country is supposed to look like.\" The audio version of this story was edited by Steve Mullis and produced by Barry Gordemer.

Critics are slamming Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona for sharing an altered anime video in which he kills Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swings swords at President Biden. Gosar shared the video from both his personal and professional Twitter accounts Sunday, writing, \"Any anime fans out there?\" in the latter. Twitter has not removed the tweets but instead hid them from view, with users required to click on a label in order to see it. \"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct,\" reads the label. \"However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\" The 92-second clip appears to be an edited version of the opening credits of the Japanese manga series Attack on Titan. It intersperses clips of migrants and Border Patrol agents, images of Democratic leaders and animation of Republican politicians \u2014 including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado \u2014 on the attack. Blood spatters and words like drugs, crime, murder, poverty, gangs, violence and trafficking flash on the screen at points. The Phoenix New Times reports that the plot of Attack on Titan is seen by some as an allegory for immigration and white nationalists' extinction theory and that its anime has faced criticism for antisemitic, pro-fascist and pro-genocidal themes (which the show's creator denies). It seems as though the video was done in-house, as Gosar wrote on his personal Twitter that \"the creativity of my team is off the hook.\" His press secretary has not responded to NPR's request for comment but told The Washington Post that \"everyone needs to relax.\" Ocasio-Cortez castigated Gosar in a series of tweets on Monday, spanning the personal and the political. She slammed Gosar's video as just one of several incidents of harassment she has faced on the job, arguing that institutions \u2014 Congress included \u2014 fail to protect women of color. \"So while I was en route to Glasgow, a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me,\" she wrote. \"And he'll face no consequences bc [House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy] cheers him on with excuses. Fun Monday! Well, back to work bc institutions don't protect woc.\" Ocasio-Cortez recalled other incidents that happened at work and without consequences, such as when Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., called her a \"f****** b****\" on the steps of the Capitol. She promised to go back to business, but not before taking one final dig at Gosar: This dude is a just a collection of wet toothpicks anyway. White supremacy is for extremely fragile people &sad men like him, whose self concept relies on the myth that he was born superior because deep down he knows he couldn\u2019t open a pickle jar or read a whole book by himself Other Democratic representatives took to Twitter to condemn Gosar's behavior, which California Rep. Ted Lieu called \"sick.\" \"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired,\" he added. \"These blood thirsty losers are more comfortable with violence than voting. Keep exposing them,\" tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, also of California. Gosar, an ally of former President Donald Trump, has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the Capitol insurrection and has spread misinformation about what happened on Jan. 6. Earlier this year, he denounced \"white racism\" after speaking at a far-right conference whose organizer spoke approvingly of the storming of the Capitol and white nationalism, the The Washington Post reported. And Gosar was among the lawmakers whose phone or computer records a House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection asked social media and telecommunications companies to preserve, as those lawmakers were potentially involved with efforts to \"challenge, delay or interfere\" with the certification or otherwise try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, The Associated Press notes.

Rittenhouse, an aspiring police officer, shot two people to death and wounded a third during a night of anti-racism protests in Kenosha last year. A jury has been selected for the high-profile homicide trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, with 12 jurors and eight alternates seated on Monday. Opening statements are set to begin Tuesday morning, and the trial expected to last two weeks, according to the Associated Press. The jury will decide whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, as claimed by his lawyers, or acted as a vigilante when he opened fire last year and killed two protesters and wounded another in Kenosha, Wis. Already, the case has gotten much attention as the judge, a 40-year veteran of the bench, has made controversial decisions favoring the defense. It will be up to a jury to decide whether to hold Rittenhouse responsible or acquit him as a protector who felt threatened. Rittenhouse faces multiple felony charges of homicide and recklessly endangering the safety of others, along with one misdemeanor count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His case began three days after police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times at close range. Blake is paralyzed from the waist down. On Aug. 25, 2020, Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, traveled a short distance from Illinois in response to a call from a Kenosha-based militia group saying it hoped to protect businesses from protesters. The night was chaotic, with firebombs, looting and gunshots in the air. Rittenhouse's lawyers will argue he was acting in self-defense when he killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz. Conservatives immediately took to social media with some painting Rittenhouse as a martyred patriot and others lionizing him. The Rev. Jonathan Barker, the leader of Kenosha's Grace Lutheran Church, said that if Rittenhouse isn't convicted, it will set a dangerous precedent for people's rights to free speech and assembly.\n                \n                    \n                    Angela Major/ WPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. Jonathan Barker leads Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha's Uptown Neighborhood, which was nearly destroyed during the Blake protests. He has been warned to stay away from the courthouse during the trial because it could become a hub of white nationalism. Barker says that if Rittenhouse isn't convicted, it will set a dangerous precedent for people's rights to free speech and assembly. \"I have deep concerns about how this will go, and I've been disappointed,\" Barker said. \"I am ready for anything. But I want to be a person of hope as a Christian and as a pastor.\" The judge in the case, Bruce Schroeder, has spent months making decisions that will affect what the jury will hear. Most recently, he upheld a long-standing rule in his courtroom that the men whom Rittenhouse shot can't be called \"victims\" during the hearing. He did say the defense can refer to them as \"rioters, looters and arsonists.\" Paul Butler, a Georgetown University law professor, said that's not uncommon and a similar decision was made in the George Floyd case. While this may be legally true, the average person will watch this trial unfold over the next three weeks through their own political and moral lens. Butler believes what has captured the public's attention is that so much of the evidence has been captured on video. Usually those videos benefit the defense, Butler said. \"Multiple interpretations creates reasonable doubt of the prosecution,\" he said. Dwayne Simpson doesn't need a video. He was protesting near Rittenhouse when the shooting began. Dwayne Simpson lives in Kenosha's Uptown neighborhood, which still has dozens of businesses boarded up because of the August 2020 looting.\n                \n                    \n                    Angela Major/WPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"We was just all walking, and then next thing we know it, we heard a lot of shots,\" Simpson said. \"All I heard was someone try to take his skateboard, or someone try to hit him with one.\" The young Black man lives in Kenosha's Uptown neighborhood, which still has dozens of businesses boarded up because of the looting following the Blake shooting. \"He was just trying to protect everybody,\" Simpson said. Judge Schroeder has repeatedly said he plans to treat this trial like any other homicide case. But it's not a normal case. It will determine whether Rittenhouse was a defender of law and order during violent unrest, or a vigilante responsible for needless deaths.",

On Friday, Francis will welcome Biden to the Vatican for the first time since Biden took office, becoming the second Catholic president in U.S. history. Ahead of President Biden's visit with Pope Francis on Friday, a question was posed in a White House briefing about whether the meeting will be \"personal or formal,\" and the answer from national security adviser Jake Sullivan was, \"Both.\" Biden is just the second Catholic president, and while John F. Kennedy took pains to downplay his faith, Biden often places it front and center. He quoted St. Augustine in his inaugural address and regularly cites Pope Francis in speeches. Biden has talked and written about praying the Rosary in the Situation Room during the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Perhaps the most powerful signal to America's practicing and cultural Catholics came the night Biden spoke after being declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election. At a raucous honking drive-in rally, Biden recited lines from \"On Eagles Wings,\" a '70s-era hymn that has become a mainstay at Catholic funerals. \"It goes like this,\" Biden said. \"He will raise you up on eagle's wings. Bear you like the break of dawn. Make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.\" Biden's religion is so engrained in his public persona, yet at the same time he and his staff treat the matter as deeply private. For all those moments Biden has made it central to his public identity, the White House often bristles at questions about his faith; they make sure reporters are nowhere near the church services he attends. The contrast between that public and private faith can play out during those Masses. When Biden spends the weekend in Washington, D.C., he often attends Saturday evening Mass at Holy Trinity, a historic Georgetown church where Kennedy worshiped, too. Outside, crowds form, motorcades block the streets, and reporters scurry into place to snap pictures and shout questions as Biden makes the brief walk from a black SUV into the church's door. \"The outside is, as you can imagine, a real production,\" Fr. Kevin Gillespie, S.J., told NPR. \"Inside, it's a regular Mass.\" President Biden arrives at Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., for Mass on Feb. 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden arrives at Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., for Mass on Feb. 20. Gillespie is the pastor of Holy Trinity (where, I should briefly note, I am a parishioner). When Biden slips into one the back pews of the church just as the service begins, it's a coordinated move to minimize disruption. \"He's not trying to draw any focus on himself,\" said Gillespie. \"He's there sort of in a very humble way.\" The Jesuit priest does say it's hard to fully treat the president like any other person. Among other things, Gillespie admits he'll give his homily a closer read when he knows Biden is coming. And sometimes in conversations with Gillespie at the end of Mass, Biden's public and private faith come together. \"He intimated with me, this was perhaps a month ago, how the pope has been so supportive of him during his presidency,\" Gillespie told NPR. \"Leading me to believe there is perhaps some kind of conversation, periodically.\" Biden and Francis have met three times, all when Biden was vice president,  according to the White House. The two men spoke on the phone during the transition, as well. Francis' audience with Biden at the Vatican on Friday will, of course, be a formal sitdown between two heads of state. It will also be an opportunity for two kindred spirits to compare notes on common goals on global issues, as well as more basic parallels in their lives. \"These are older guys in their last jobs. No one else really thought they would be here. Biden was done. [Then-Cardinal Jorge] Bergoglio was too old. And now, here they are,\" said John Carr, the director of Georgetown University's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. Francis shares two of the foreign policy priorities Biden emphasizes on trips like this: addressing climate change and taking on a rise in nationalism and populism. \"In a recent encyclical, Pope Francis warns us against this 'phony populism' that appeals to \u2014 quote \u2014 'the basest and most selfish instincts,' \" Biden said during a high-profile speech in Warm Springs, Ga., during the final stretch of the presidential campaign, going on to quote the document at length. When it comes to how this Catholic president's policies line up with Catholic teaching, Carr said Biden and Francis can divide things into three buckets: \"My sense is the president and the pope are likely to focus on the first thing,\" said Carr. That's what Francis has done since Biden has taken office. Notably, he's done this even as a high-profile group of American Catholic bishops have taken the opposite approach, criticizing Biden's support for abortion rights and calling for him to be barred from receiving communion. When several American bishops released a statement on the day Biden was inaugurated and slammed his support for abortion rights, the Vatican countered with a warmer, welcoming statement. As the push to bar Biden from communion got more attention in recent months \u2014 a formal report on the question will be released at an upcoming conference of American bishops \u2014 Francis made a point in a press conference to say he's never denied communion to anyone, ever. The debate isn't theoretical for Fr. Gillespie and Holy Trinity, where Biden attends Mass. They have followed the pope's lead, and the parish council put out a statement earlier this year: \"Holy Trinity will not deny the Eucharist to persons presenting themselves to receive it.\" \"Now, that said, it's not like everyone's agreeing with his stance on abortion,\" Gillespie clarified. \"The cardinal and a number of us have reservations. But we're not talking about that at communion.\" Gillespie said there's one other way this church has found itself involved in the public life of the man sitting quietly in the back row. Recently, he said, the State Department asked for suggestions for a gift a \"high-level U.S. official\" could present to a \"high-level Vatican official.\" On Friday, Gillespie will be waiting to see if the State Department took his advice.",

MUMBAI, India \u2014 Outside an upscale Indian hospital last week, Baljeet Asthana put her phone on selfie mode, propped her eyeglasses on her head so she could stare directly into the camera, and hit record. Through a white polka-dot mask, she described her family's ordeal: Her 82-year-old mother was inside the hospital \"struggling for her life,\" Asthana said. Her mother desperately needed an intensive care unit bed, but the hospital \u2014 Fortis Hospital, one of the best-equipped private facilities in the capital, New Delhi \u2014 was full. Officials told the family to look for an ICU bed elsewhere. \"My mother is slowly dying,\" reads her tweet accompanying her video.

In this scenario I request Mr Modi to kindly legalize mercy killing and would ask him to do the honours for my mother pic.twitter.com/DYmzCIxXDN Near the end of her video, Asthana addresses Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as Delhi's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal. She asks them for advice on where she should take her dying mother and closes with a chilling request. \"If you cannot advise me, sir, I would request you to legalize mercy killing in India, because you have no idea what the common citizen of India is going through at the moment,\" Asthana says into the camera. \"We are struggling to get basic things like oxygen, medicines, hospitals. Please legalize mercy killing in India.\" \"Let us die with dignity,\" she adds. \"Thank you very much. Jai Hind\" \u2014 long live India \u2014 she says.

There have also been more profane outbursts on social media and in-person arguments as people's frustration mounts. Authorities have confirmed more than 300,000 coronavirus cases daily for nearly three weeks. On Friday, they confirmed 414,188 new cases, a global record since the coronavirus pandemic began. And scientists say the real numbers are likely much higher. India's health system has collapsed. There are shortages of hospital beds, medical oxygen, antiviral drugs and vaccines. People are dying in hospital parking lots, unable to get care, or at home, unable to get an ambulance. Many Indians say they feel abandoned by their government. Citizens are increasingly directing their outrage at Modi himself. His pre-pandemic slogan, Aatmanirbhar Bharat \u2014 Hindi for \"self-reliant India\" \u2014 no longer resonates in a country now struggling to process tons of international coronavirus relief supplies landing daily at New Delhi's airport. India's neighbors, including Bangladesh and Bhutan, which had just months ago been recipients of COVID-19 vaccines donated by India, are now sending aid in the other direction. Anger is growing against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid surging coronavirus cases. At least one poll has logged a decline in his public approval rating.\n                \n                    \n                    Kiyoshi Ota/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption These scenes challenge the idea of India that Modi sought to sell: a proud new global power with an ancient Hindu culture and a booming economy that had put its impoverished past behind it. India's quick descent into COVID-19 chaos, along with the resulting public ire, now amounts to the biggest challenge yet for the country's most powerful and popular leader in decades. Observers say they've never seen such anger against Modi, and at least one poll has logged a decline in his support. Mixed messages from Modi The prime minister hasn't given a televised speech to the nation since April 20. That was when he ruled out another nationwide lockdown (he had previously imposed one in March 2020) but urged Indians to take precautions to halt the coronavirus's spread. \"Discipline is needed to win the battle against corona,\" Modi said, asking Indians to stay at home if they can. \"With your courage, patience and discipline, the country will leave no stone unturned. Together we'll change the conditions.\" But three days earlier, Modi had held a massive political rally with thousands of attendees in West Bengal, a state that his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was trying to win in local elections. \"In every direction, all I can see is people! You are wonderful!\" Modi exclaimed to the crowd. That day, India confirmed 234,692 new coronavirus cases \u2014 more than 20 times its daily tallies from late January and early February. Nevertheless, there were few masks and scant social distancing in Modi's crowd. At the time, West Bengal had none of the pandemic restrictions reimposed in some other Indian regions. For weeks, Modi's Hindu nationalist government had also refused to halt the huge Kumbh Mela pilgrimage, in which millions of people gathered to bathe in the Ganges River throughout April. An Indian investigative magazine has since reported that a state official who urged that the pilgrimage be restricted was summarily fired by Modi's government. (Modi later advised that the festival wrap up early, but by then, thousands of pilgrims had already tested positive for the coronavirus and at least one religious leader died.) Naga sadhus (Hindu holy men) take a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.\n                \n                    \n                    Money Sharma/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Politics overrode any concern about the health crisis that was unfolding,\" says Yamini Aiyar, president of the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi think tank. About six weeks before Modi's April 20 televised speech to the nation, his health minister had declared that India was in the \"endgame\" of the pandemic. Case numbers had been creeping up, but officials didn't want to believe it, Aiyar says. \"There was a sense that we had crossed the hump and Indian exceptionalism was winning the day,\" she says. \"As [a] consequence, many crucial lessons we could and should have learned \u2014 what we needed to do to strengthen the health system and prepare for a second wave \u2014 were simply not learned.\" When cases plummeted this winter, India disassembled extra coronavirus wards it had set up in 2020. It made no additional efforts to stockpile medical oxygen and antiviral drugs \u2014 which are now in severe shortage. Indian diplomats celebrated the country's role in exporting COVID-19 vaccines, but the government didn't order enough to be manufactured and distributed to the domestic population. Aiyar says the government failed to bolster a public health system that's already one of the world's weakest, even in the best of times. India invests less in public health in proportion to its economy than many other large countries like Brazil and the United States. Criticism from within the party As thousands of Indians die of COVID-19 every day, even some of Modi's staunchest supporters are angry with him. Some of the governing party's social media forums are buzzing with criticism. In India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, a lawyer who has worked for the Bharatiya Janata Party for nearly two decades told local media he'll never support Modi again. \"This government has failed us,\" Arun Goyal said. \"I just saw a patient die right in front of me. We're all on our own now.\" His mother-in-law had a severe case of COVID-19, he said. He took her from hospital to hospital in what has become an all-too-familiar tale: Hospitals didn't have room, and his mother-in-law died. Patient Adila Ebadi, 58, who has been suffering from the coronavirus, is treated by volunteers at a makeshift clinic providing free oxygen outside the Gurdwara Damdama Sahib in New Delhi on May 3.

India is struggling with shortages of oxygen for patients as well as shortages of medicine and hospital beds. \"I'm ashamed to call myself a BJP worker,\" Goyal said. NPR contacted seven spokespeople for Modi's government or party to comment on the criticism. Two were sick with COVID-19. Another said he didn't want to talk. Four others did not respond to interview requests. Meanwhile, the government has been asking Twitter and Facebook to block certain posts it deems as critical of its handling of the pandemic. India's external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, has addressed some of the criticism. \"When a pandemic hits a society very hard, there are questions, there are arguments. There is a lot of second-guessing,\" Jaishankar told reporters May 5 in London. \"You know, 'You should have seen it coming,' 'We could have told you so,' etc. \u2014 it's not unique to India.\" Jaishankar was in London last week for a meeting with foreign ministers from the G-7 advanced economies. (Although not in the G-7, India and several other nonmember countries were invited.) Some Indians were surprised Jaishankar would travel abroad during such a crisis. (While India is on the United Kingdom's travel ban \"red list\" of countries with high coronavirus rates, diplomats are exempt.) While in London, two members of his delegation tested positive for the coronavirus. So the whole Indian team had to self-isolate and participate in those meetings virtually \u2014 which, as many Indians pointed out on Twitter, they could have just done from India. Photos have since emerged showing that the delegation did not self-isolate and still held meetings in groups without masks \u2014 prompting more angry tweets from observers back home. I thought the Indian delegation was isolating? Without masks? In a room full of other people? Did they miss the memo with #COVID19 appropriate SOPs-if you have possible  exposure you isolate ALONE? Unbelievable the sort of protocols maintained (NOT) by our leaders/bureaucrats. https://t.co/B7g8YImuGY Dip in the polls In the end, Modi's party did not win the elections in West Bengal that he had campaigned for so aggressively. Out of five Indian regions that held local elections in April, the BJP retained political control in only one, the northeast state of Assam. But it's unclear whether voters penalized the party for its pandemic response, because the voting was held in several stages, with some ballots cast in late March and early April, before the extent of the current coronavirus wave was clear. On May 5, the national BJP president, J.P. Nadda, held a news conference in West Bengal to talk about post-election violence in which some of the BJP's poll workers were allegedly attacked by supporters of a rival party. He was asked about COVID-19 and whether the party and prime minister were concerned about it. \"We are equally concerned and we are fighting it. Prime Minister Modi is taking meetings, discussing, taking very proactive steps,\" Nadda told reporters. Still, Modi's pandemic response has struck many Indians as inadequate, observers say. Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C., says he hasn't seen this level of outrage at Modi at any time since the prime minister was first elected in 2014. \"It's the ferocity of the virus, coupled with what people perceive as mismanagement, as a lack of empathy, as a prime minister who's usually leading from the front but seems to be receding into the background,\" Vaishnav says. Under a tent installed along a roadside in Ghaziabad, India, a patient breathes with the help of oxygen provided by a gurdwara, a place of worship for Sikhs, amid the coronavirus pandemic on May 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Sajjad Hussain/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption That's surprising for a leader who has so centralized power. Modi has been India's most popular prime minister in decades. He was reelected in 2019 with an absolute majority in both houses of Parliament. Modi's approval rating didn't budge much when India's economy shrank 24% last spring under a nationwide coronavirus lockdown. Nor did it falter after a border standoff with China and clashes with Chinese troops that killed 20 Indian soldiers last year. Nor even when Modi abolished most of India's bank notes in 2016 during his so-called demonetization policy, which most economists now say was a debacle. While political opinion polling in India is often unreliable, a poll by the data analytics company Morning Consult shows Modi's approval rating fell in April. The poll tracks similar ratings for 13 global leaders. Modi remains the most popular, compared with President Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and 10 other global leaders. But Modi's approval rating dropped from 74% on March 31 to 65% on May 4. Similarly, his disapproval rating rose from 20% to 29% over that same period. But Modi is also a master of reinvention, Vaishnav says. And the next national election is still three years away. \"One of his greatest skills is the ability to spin a yarn, to shape a narrative. In 2014, he [was democratically elected] on the promise of reforming India's governance and revitalizing the economy. Five years later when he was up for reelection, he hadn't fulfilled those promises and instead he campaigned on welfare programs and nationalism,\" Vaishnav says. \"So come 2024, you can bet that he will have reinvented the narrative once again.\" Arguments roll on In the meantime, as India breaks world records for daily coronavirus cases and its death toll mounts, shock across the country is turning to sorrow, and sorrow is turning to more anger. Opposition politicians have tried to capitalize on that anger. Rahul Gandhi, head of the opposition Congress party, tweeted Monday that if Modi's government had \"done its job, it wouldn't have come to this.\" Anger and political arguments could focus next on Uttar Pradesh, a state where COVID-19 is raging. Next year, the state will hold legislative elections \u2014 which will be a key test for Modi, whose close confidant is the head of the state's government. Last month, a political argument broke out at a crematorium in Uttar Pradesh. Video filmed at a crematorium in the city of Meerut and posted to Twitter on April 30 shows an argument between a family that had just cremated their loved one, who died of COVID-19, and another man who interrupts the family and scolds them for bemoaning the government. He tries to convince them that none of this is the government's fault. They all wave their fingers at one another, as funeral pyres burn around them. One man pleads with the other: \"Let's just not argue! Not here, not now. Not in this, of all places,\" he says. NPR producer Sushmita Pathak contributed to this report from Hyderabad, India.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., raise their arms after addressing attendees of a rally Friday at The Villages in Florida.\n                \n                    \n                    Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., raise their arms after addressing attendees of a rally Friday at The Villages in Florida. There's a sort of time warp going on at The Villages, the enormous retirement community in Florida. On streets made up to look like small-town Main Streets, it's maybe an idealized, slickly varnished version of the 1950s \u2014 albeit with legions of golf carts. At a hotel ballroom on Friday night, it was something like 2017. \"I just got to check something; I just want to make sure I'm in the right place. Tell me, who is your president?\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene yelled to a packed ballroom of mostly maskless supporters. \"Donald Trump!\" they yelled in response. \"That's my president, too,\" she said, to cheers. Greene, the freshman congresswoman from Georgia, was there with Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to kick off what they say will be a series of America First rallies. The Villages isn't in Gaetz's district or even Greene's state. But it is full of their people, which is to say, Trump's people. The three counties that make up The Villages voted for him last year at rates around 60% or more. The rally came at a time when a battle for control of the party \u2014 and for the party's very identity \u2014 is coming to a head. House Republicans are set to vote as early as Wednesday on removing Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, from her leadership role. \"You got to be a party person\" \"If Liz Cheney could even find Wyoming on a map and went there, she would find a lot of very angry cowboys who are not happy,\" Gaetz said during his speech, accusing her of being an establishment figure who doesn't get outside of Washington enough. \"She's sort of for every war: war in Syria \u2014 for it,\" he added, referencing her 2019 disagreement with Trump's decision to remove troops from that country. \"War against Trump and his supporters \u2014 for it. War against the Republican conference; war against her own voters.\" The opposition to Cheney isn't her ideology \u2014 she has a deeply conservative voting record. Rather, she voted for Trump's impeachment and has repeatedly repudiated the lie that the 2020 election was rigged or stolen for President Biden. While many Americans may have no idea who is in congressional leadership, the people who came to see Gaetz and Greene are paying attention, particularly to Cheney. \"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I cannot stand her,\" said Ria Amiess after the rally. \"Why does she hate Trump? She's supposed to be out of the Republican Party, you know? The Republican Party needs to be united.\" Don Perrin put it more succinctly. \"If you're going to be a party person, you got to be a party person. And she went against the party,\" he said. But Cheney wasn't the only Republican being targeted. Some of their most fiery attacks were reserved for those fellow Republicans who aren't unfailingly loyal to Trump. \"If Adam Kinzinger wants to be the frontman for the establishment to bring our party back to the days of Mitt Romney and John Kasich ... I'm not going back,\" Gaetz said, to loud boos from the crowd. \"This is Donald Trump's party, and I'm a Donald Trump Republican.\" Kinzinger, the Illinois Republican congressman, has emerged as a key critic of Trump alongside Romney, the U.S. senator from Utah, and Kasich, the former Ohio governor who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination in 2016. \"Trump is the leader of the Republican Party!\" Greene added, to cheers. Reinventing the party For Gaetz and Greene, a part of being Trump Republicans is adopting Trump's rhetorical strategies. Much like Trump, they talked a lot about their perceived enemies. And also like Trump, they gave a sense that being more embattled only makes them more defiant. In short, opposition \u2014 no matter how serious \u2014 just gives them more opportunities to put a thumb in someone's eye. Gaetz, for example, winkingly referenced an array of serious allegations against him, including sex with a teenage girl, as a way of slamming the media. \"I already know how CNN is going to report it: 'Matt Gaetz has wild party surrounded by beautiful women in The Villages,' so just get ready for it,\" he said. Greene, meanwhile, bragged about being stripped of her committee assignments after social media activity that promoted violence, racism and false conspiracy theories. She wore that punishment as a badge of honor, talking about how she decided to slow down House floor activities. \"If you want to give me some time on my hands, then you better believe I'm going to figure out smart ways to use it,\" she said. Even the name of the rally gets at their defiance in the face of scandal. \"America First\" was floated as an official caucus in the House. After leaked language about launching that caucus invoked white nationalism, many Republicans distanced themselves from it, and Greene decided not to launch it. People at an America First rally in The Villages are likely to be among the most hardcore Trump supporters in an already Republican area. But that doesn't necessarily make them fringe. Polls have shown that a majority of Republicans, for example, believe the lie that the election was stolen or rigged. One such Republican is Linda Murphy Griffaw, who came to the rally in a red dress with \"Make America Great Again\" emblazoned across the bodice. She voted for neither Barack Obama nor John McCain in 2008, nor did she vote for Obama or Romney in 2012. But Trump fired her up. \"I never vote unless I truly believe in the party I'm voting for,\" she said. \"And I truly believe that he wanted the best for us.\" Villages resident Linda Murphy Griffaw poses before the Gaetz-Greene rally on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption If there are enough voters like Murphy Griffaw, it lends weight to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's argument that the Republican Party can't \"move forward\" without Trump. But then the question is what comes of the Cheneys and Romneys. On NBC's Meet the Press, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy said Sunday the party can win only if all of those Republicans come together. \"For us to win in 2022 and 2024, we need everybody,\" he said. \"We need those who feel as Liz. We need those who feel as Lindsey.\" It's not clear, however what coexistence might look in the long term between Republicans like Cheney, who reject Trump, and Republicans who have built their identities as Republicans around Trump.",

            "article_content": "America, unlike some countries, is not defined by a common ancestry, nor is it tied to an official faith tradition. But it does have a distinct identity and a quasi-religious foundation. Americans are expected to hold their hands over their hearts when they recite the Pledge of Allegiance or stand for the national anthem. Young people are taught to regard the country's founders almost as saints. The \"self-evident\" truths listed in the Declaration of Independence and the key provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights have acquired the status of scripture in the U.S. consciousness. More than 50 years ago, sociologist Robert Bellah argued that such facts of American life suggest that the country adheres to a nonsectarian \"civil religion,\" which he defined as \"a collection of beliefs, symbols, and rituals with respect to sacred things and institutionalized in a collectivity.\" For these beliefs and principles to give definition to a nation, scholars argue, they may need the power that a religion holds for its believers. Characterizing them as a faith system elevates them beyond mere personal philosophy. \"I think the phrase 'civil religion' points to the way in which our political values have a dimension that goes beyond ourselves,\" says Philip Gorski, a professor of sociology and religious studies at Yale University and author of American Covenant: A History of Civil Religion from the Puritans to the Present. Acceptance of this uniquely American creed is seen as the key to one's identity as an American and distinguishes the United States from other countries. \"It is difficult to become German. It is difficult to become Swedish, because those identities are not ideas,\" says Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who writes often on religion and politics. \"Becoming American means you believe in the American idea, and at least in theory, that's open to any immigrant who's able to come here.\" In practice, some Americans have not been allowed full participation in society and political life. \"Because of the xenophobia Asian Americans are facing, because of the backlash against African American civil rights, we're seeing that this kind of citizenship, this intrinsic right to be in the U.S., to enjoy its freedoms, is not really for everyone,\" says Lynn Itagaki, a professor of women's and gender studies at the University of Missouri. The strength and binding power of America's civil religion is clearly being put to a test. Forming belief in the American idea Just as young people are usually raised in the faith tradition of their parents, young Americans are schooled in the basics of the country's civil religion. Boys who aspire to become Eagle Scouts, for example, must first earn the \"Citizenship in the Nation\" merit badge. As part of the requirements, they must familiarize themselves with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and they discuss the documents with a counselor. Among other requirements, they must choose a speech of \"national historical importance\" and explain \"how it applies to American citizens today.\" Discussion of the issue of America's unique identity is a key part of the merit badge course. \"Are we a country that's united by a nationality?\" asks Cheryl Repetti, leading a recent merit badge class for Scouts at an outdoor classroom in Alexandria, Va. \"Do we have hundreds of years of living together as a people, as a shared culture?\" Joe, a young man in the second row, raises his hand. \"I would say that the thing that really holds America together, it's our values,\" he says. \"Kinda like freedom and, like, respect to everybody.\" This is part of the civic education almost all young people in America learn, whether through a Scouting program or in their schools. Students from across the country visit Washington, D.C., in a typical year, as if on a pilgrimage, to see such hallowed buildings as the U.S. Capitol and get a firsthand look at the actual founding documents on display at the National Archives. \"I always tell my students that we started schools because we wanted children to understand our government,\" says Nicole Sarty, a fifth-grade teacher in Eagle, Idaho. \"What was important about our government, and why America is an awesome country and why people want to come here.\" Because of the pandemic, Sarty's students this year settled for a virtual visit to the nation's capital, including a guided online tour of the National Archives. Among the topics Sarty has discussed with her students, she says, are the opening words in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution: \"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more Perfect Union....\" This year, she tied the discussion to current events. \"That goes back to everything that's happened with the pandemic and the riots,\" Sarty says. \"We see things that aren't working right, but we're always striving to be a 'more perfect union.' We have great discussions, and it's exciting to hear 10- and 11- year-olds struggling with some of the same ideas that we've struggled with as a nation since the beginning.\" Updating the scripture Among the issues that teachers like Sarty have to confront is the flawed character of America's origin, when white Europeans violently displaced the native population. \"The U.S. is a white settler colonialist state,\" notes Itagaki. \"It was founded that way.\" Many of the founders were themselves slaveholders, including some who signed the Declaration of Independence, with its lofty language of all men being created equal. The original version of the U.S. Constitution stipulated that enslaved individuals should be counted in the census as only three-fifths of a free person. Shadi Hamid, who is the son of immigrants from Egypt, nonetheless argues that the darker aspects of America's founding should not discredit the American idea. \"If we completely do away with key founding figures, and we start problematizing the founding documents, which are part of the American civic faith, then the American idea doesn't have a lot to go on,\" he says. \"Foundations matter.\" For Lynn Itagaki, who writes about what she calls \"civil racism,\" the problem is less with the text of the founding documents than with their application. \"The United States is sufficiently inclusive as a philosophy,\" she says. \"In practice, it's obviously been exclusive and has pushed people out as not being deserving \u2014 or, in religious terms, not being faithful enough.\" Itagaki notes that the American idea would be meaningful to more people if more recognition were given to some of its less familiar sources. \"The Iroquois nation's Great Law of Peace was influential in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence,\" she notes. \"So we've got other thinkers, other texts, and I think we need to consider them in creating this civil religion that we talk about.\" Similarly, Yale's Philip Gorski argues that the notion of an American scripture needs periodic updating to incorporate the voices of others alongside the nation's founders, such as Frederick Douglass, the social reformer Jane Addams, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \"I think about the American civil religion as an evolving tradition,\" Gorski says. \"I sometimes liken it to a river whose banks grow wider over time and which is changed by the landscape that it flows through, instead of thinking about it as some kind of pristine spring that we have to return to again and again.\" Debating religious language The advocacy of a civil religion took a complicated turn in recent months as the American political idea became linked to Christian nationalism. Among those who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, claiming it as \"our house,\" were many who said they were led by their Christian beliefs, even as members of the Capitol Police warned they were violating a \"sacred\" space. One of the insurrection leaders, standing defiantly on the dais of the Senate chamber, actually called on his fellow protesters to join him in prayer. \"Jesus Christ, we invoke your name!\" he shouted, as recorded in a video by a writer for The New Yorker magazine. Among those upset by that scene was Myles Werntz, a theology professor at Abilene Christian University. \"When you have someone like you saw on Jan. 6 \u2014 someone who gets up into the Senate, declaring that the violence that is being done that day is being done in the name of God \u2014 that's when I think you find that religious language has gone amok.\" The widespread display of Christian symbols on Jan. 6, in fact, has triggered a general backlash against religious nationalism in the country. Werntz fears that the notion of a civil religion for the country may suffer as a result. Some of the most eloquent apostles of the American idea, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke from a Christian tradition, Werntz notes. \"In his speeches, he frequently uses reference to Scripture, and he's not speaking specifically to Christians,\" Werntz says. \"He's using these things as more basic moral instruction. My concern is that in trying to get rid of the Christian nationalist versions, the other things which might have some social benefit might get swept out as well.\" At stake in this new consideration of a civil religion for the United States is whether this collection of beliefs and principles can still inspire the nation and hold it together. The Scouts who gathered at a park in Virginia to work for their \"Citizenship in the Nation\" merit badge agreed among themselves that the work to put the American idea into practice is an ongoing process. \"We're kind of getting closer to that American dream,\" said Joe, in the second row. \"We will never reach that dream perfectly. But I think it's a history of getting closer and closer, from the American Revolution to the Civil War to the Cold War and then to now where we're having discussions about race, LGBTQ [rights], stuff like that. It's how can we get closer to that American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"",

At least 25 people charged in the attack appear to have links to the Proud Boys, according to court documents. Editor's Note: This story includes explicit language. In June 2018, a member of the Proud Boys punched a counterprotester in the jaw, shoved him into the pavement in Portland, Ore., and sent him to the hospital with a serious concussion. The counterprotester had used a metal baton to strike first, and the Proud Boys leader, Ethan Nordean, claimed self-defense. In the end, Nordean, a former bodybuilder, faced no legal consequences for knocking out the man. In fact, the far-right extremist group has celebrated the video of that punch as a rallying cry for more than two years, playing and replaying it, turning it into memes and even at least one painting. \"Violence isn't great,\" Nordean said not long after the incident, paraphrasing the founder of the Proud Boys. \"But justified violence is amazing.\" Federal prosecutors now allege that Nordean, 30, along with fellow Proud Boy Joe Biggs, 37, saw former President Donald Trump's calls to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election as justification to launch a conspiracy to bring violence and chaos to the Capitol on Jan. 6. After years of the Proud Boys largely escaping scrutiny from law enforcement, the cases brought by the government could result in prison time for leading members of the group.

Members of the Proud Boys, including Biggs and Nordean, have become central targets of the Justice Department's sprawling investigation into the Capitol riot. In an April 6 hearing seeking detention for Biggs and Nordean, prosecutors faced skeptical questioning from a federal judge and pushback from defense attorneys, who point out that neither Nordean nor Biggs is accused of attacking police, bringing \u2014 let alone using \u2014 a dangerous weapon, or personally damaging significant amounts of property. But prosecutors say Biggs and Nordean pose a danger to the public because of their particular ability to incite fellow Proud Boys and others to commit violence. That forms much of the basis for the government's argument that Nordean and Biggs should be locked up pending trial on conspiracy and other charges. An examination of hours of interviews and statements from Biggs, Nordean and other Proud Boys leaders shows that in addition to the group's often hateful and discriminatory ideology, violence has always been at the core of the group's identity. But it remains to be seen how years' worth of extremist rhetoric, and at times involvement with real violence, will play into the federal case against the group. Nordean's lawyer did not respond to NPR. And Biggs' lawyer declined to comment. The origins of the Proud Boys From its inception in 2016, the Proud Boys have been steeped in violence. But the group's use of seemingly outlandish rituals and even childish language can mask its danger. The group takes its name from a song in the Broadway musical version of Disney's Aladdin. Nordean goes by the nickname \"Rufio Panman,\" a reference to Hook, the 1991 family movie set in the Peter Pan universe. \"I think the absurdity and the ridiculousness of the Proud Boys is a very conscious strategy,\" said Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center. Miller argues that the group uses irony and humor \"to inoculate themselves from criticism from people who take them seriously.\" The group was founded by Gavin McInnes, a far-right political commentator from Canada who also co-founded Vice magazine. In a 2017 interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan, McInnes called the group an all-male \"gang,\" focused on drinking. Members sometimes refer to the group as a fraternity, or a \"drinking club with a patriotism problem.\" Like other gangs, members receive nicknames. To reach the second degree of membership, McInnes told Rogan, \"we beat the s*** out of you until you can name five breakfast cereals.\" Online videos depicting the second degree show members punching a recruit in the stomach as he tries to recite brand names like Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Cocoa Puffs. To reach the fourth degree, McInnes said, \"you get arrested or in a serious violent fight for the cause.\" (During the interview, Rogan responded, \"So you're promoting violence?\" and told McInnes, \"You should erase that part.\" McInnes has, at times, claimed the fourth degree should be reached only in self-defense.) The Proud Boys' cause, in the words of the Anti-Defamation League, is \"violent, nationalistic, Islamophobic, transphobic and misogynistic.\" Officially, the group rejects racism and touts the multiracial backgrounds of some members. But they also describe themselves as proponents of \"Western chauvinism\" \u2014 the belief that Western European culture is superior to all others. \"Essentially that translates to 'European chauvinism' or 'European pride,' which would have been the same thing as 'white pride,' that we would have said,\" said Christian Picciolini, a former extremist who now helps people disengage from the white supremacist movement. \"Proud Boys are probably the closest thing to what I was 30 years ago, and I was a white power skinhead,\" said Picciolini. It's not hard to find explicitly racist language from McInnes or connections to overtly white supremacist figures. For example, in 2016, McInnes called Jada Pinkett Smith a \"monkey actress.\" In 2017, he uploaded a video originally titled \"10 Things I Hate About Jews.\" (After receiving widespread criticism for anti-Semitism, as well as praise from white supremacists, McInnes later changed the title to \"10 Things I Hate About Israel\" and claimed he had been taken out of context.) Jason Kessler, who organized the 2017 white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., was a Proud Boy. After a neo-Nazi killed an anti-racism protester named Heather Heyer at that rally, McInnes disavowed Kessler.

In response to questions from NPR, McInnes disputed that any of his past comments were racist or anti-Semitic, describing them instead as \"satirical\" and \"sarcastic.\" He also wrote in an email that violence is not core to the group's identity. \"The violence you see from Proud Boys is a reaction to the unmitigated violence from antifa that the media ignores,\" he said, and that \"I have encouraged FIGHTING BACK.\" He also said that he discouraged the group from any involvement in the pro-Trump rallies on Jan. 6. \"I made it very clear the whole thing was a bad idea and implored Proud Boys not to go,\" McInnes wrote. Street violence Picciolini, who now runs the organization Free Radicals, told NPR that he views the Proud Boys as the \"street thugs\" of the white power movement. \"They're the ones who attend the rallies and protests to try and intimidate other people \u2014 counterprotesters,\" said Picciolini. When Ethan Nordean sent that counterprotester to the hospital with a \"significant concussion\" in 2018, according to a police report first reported by The New York Times, it became a powerful symbol to try to intimidate the group's opponents and recruit new members. McInnes called it \"the greatest punch in the history of Trump's presidency\" and called it \"art\" as he cackled while watching the video on repeat. Nordean also appeared on the far-right, conspiracy-mongering show Infowars, where host Alex Jones called him a \"folk hero.\" In June 2018, Ethan Nordean punched a counterprotester in the jaw and shoved him to the pavement in Portland, Ore. The Proud Boys have since used the video of that punch as a rallying cry.\n                \n                    \n                    Zakjal/Screenshot by NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In June 2018, Ethan Nordean punched a counterprotester in the jaw and shoved him to the pavement in Portland, Ore. The Proud Boys have since used the video of that punch as a rallying cry. Nordean appeared to embrace the praise and framed the violent brawl as a battle for the future of the country. \"This is at least a very soft civil war right now,\" Nordean told Jones, \"and if people don't wake up to what's going on right now, it's going to get worse.\" \"If you looked at the numbers of people who are joining these groups, they skyrocketed after Nordean's punch,\" said Miller of the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"So this is a really effective form of propaganda. And law enforcement was essentially taking a really hands-off approach.\" Later that year, in New York City, multiple members of the Proud Boys faced criminal charges for attacking counterprotesters after an event McInnes hosted. The event involved McInnes reenacting the 1960 assassination of a Japanese socialist leader by a far-right ultra-nationalist. McInnes played the assassin, according to a journalist who witnessed the event. Unlike the aftermath of other incidents, members of the Proud Boys received prison time. \"I know enough about history to know what happened in Europe in the '30s when political street brawls were allowed to go ahead without any type of check from the criminal justice system,\" said New York Judge Mark Dwyer as he sentenced two members to four years in prison. McInnes officially distanced himself from the group after the New York incident. Still, experts say the group continued to grow. \"It's not just about drunken street brawls, but it is about using street violence as a political tool to spread a message,\" said Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. \"And they've been pretty successful at doing that up until this point.\" Joe Biggs' path to the Proud Boys Joe Biggs, who is charged along with Nordean, brought a degree of media savvy to the Proud Boys, assisted in the group's growth and also has a history of violent rhetoric. In court papers, federal prosecutors have described Biggs as a key instigator of Proud Boys' violence with significant sway among its members. \"There is simply no adequate method to monitor [Biggs'] communication in such a way that would guard against future attacks by his followers,\" prosecutors alleged. Biggs came to the Proud Boys after serving in the Army, where he deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the military. In a 2020 interview with a podcast, Biggs claimed he told an Army recruiter, \"I want combat. I want to go to Iraq as soon as possible. I want to kill these motherf******.\" He was awarded multiple decorations for his service, including the Purple Heart, the Army confirmed to NPR. During one of his deployments, he told another podcast in 2019, he started getting interested in politics after watching the Sept. 11 \"truther\" film Loose Change. The film spread debunked conspiracy theories, including that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were the result of an \"inside job\" by the U.S. government.

Biggs, charged in the Capitol riot, assisted in the group's growth and also has a history of violent rhetoric. After leaving the Army, Biggs started working for Alex Jones' Infowars as a correspondent. But Biggs said leaving the military was difficult. \"He has struggled with combat-related PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), depression and some related alcohol problems,\" his lawyer stated in one court filing. According to court documents, he joined the Proud Boys in 2018 and became an organizer for the group. Biggs has compared planning for Proud Boys events to \"planning to go into a combat zone.\" His lawyer claimed in a court filing that Biggs was also providing information to the FBI about Proud Boys demonstrations, as well as antifa, around this time. But his claims of close contact with law enforcement did not keep him from threatening to use force. In one case, he recorded a video of himself holding an American-flag-themed bat with spikes on the end, saying he was preparing to \"bust some heads.\" He also wore a T-shirt with the phrase \"Training to Throw Communists Out of Helicopters\" emblazoned on the front. \"I'm going to talk s***,\" Biggs told an interviewer in 2020. \"Especially to the people I f***ing hate, that I despise. And yes, I do hate, and hate is a strong word, but that's a good word to use for those people.\" Escalating violent rhetoric After the November 2020 election, the Proud Boys supported Trump's bid to overturn the results, echoed his false claims of widespread voter fraud and escalated their calls for violence. \"It's time for f***ing War if they steal this s***,\" Biggs posted on social media on Nov. 5, 2020, two days after the election, according to federal prosecutors. The group also opposed public health efforts to impose new coronavirus restrictions amid a growing wave of new cases. Its rhetoric became even more violent, including toward government officials. \"They're evil scum, and they all deserve to die a traitor's death,\" Biggs said on a livestreamed Proud Boys show called WarBoys. \"Yup, Day of the Rope,\" Nordean replied. The \"Day of the Rope,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League, is a \"white supremacist concept\" taken from a book influential among racist extremists. The book, The Turner Diaries, depicts a white supremacist revolution, and it has been linked to more than 40 acts of violence and was a direct inspiration for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed more than 160 people.

After Nordean punched a counterprotester in 2018, membership in the far-right group skyrocketed, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Around that same time, in December 2020, prosecutors allege, Nordean and Biggs were two of the Proud Boys planning, raising funds and gathering protective gear and radios for the coming riot at the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors have said in court that Nordean managed to raise more than $16,000 ahead of the riot. The group publicly announced ahead of Jan. 6 that members would not appear in their typical black-and-yellow clothing and would instead attempt to blend in with the crowd. Biggs' defense attorney has argued that the decision to go \"incognito\" was a safety measure in response to a stabbing of a Proud Boys member in Washington, D.C., during a pro-Trump demonstration. Just days before the riot, Nordean spoke out on his own podcast and emphasized that he was willing to again use violence. \"When police officers or government officials are breaking the law, what are we supposed to do as the people? Discourse? What are we supposed to debate?\" Nordean asked rhetorically. \"No, you have to use force.\" By Jan. 5, federal prosecutors say, Biggs and Nordean had arrived in the Washington, D.C., area and Biggs messaged fellow members of the group: \"We are trying to avoid getting into any s*** tonight. Tomorrow's the day.\" The government's case against the Proud Boys Biggs and Nordean are among more than 20 Proud Boys who are facing criminal charges related to the Capitol riot, including charges of conspiracy. Separately, the group's chairman, Enrique Tarrio, is also facing charges in Washington, D.C., for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter flag at an earlier demonstration and for illegally possessing high-capacity ammunition magazines. Despite their violent rhetoric in the run-up to the Capitol attack, Biggs and Nordean have not been accused of assaulting law enforcement on that day. The government has primarily alleged that they helped instigate the mob and coordinate the attack, while other members of the group, such as Dominic Pezzola and William Pepe, face charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. Another Proud Boy, William Chrestman, is charged with threatening \"to assault, kidnap, and murder a federal law enforcement officer.\" Nordean's defense attorneys have sought to poke holes in the prosecution's claims of extensive planning by the Proud Boys, arguing in court papers that Nordean's cellphone had died and that he was unable to coordinate any attack on the Capitol that day. They also cite messages sent among other Proud Boys members in which there were complaints about the lack of planning, with one member stating, \"This is so unorganized!\" Nordean's attorneys argue that messages among members showed that the group was in Washington to \"thwart attacks on supporters of the president, not infiltrate the Capitol Building to commit crimes.\" They also cite the words of Michael Sherwin, the former acting U.S. attorney who until recently led the government's prosecution of the Capitol breach cases. Sherwin told CBS' 60 Minutes that while the government believes that the Proud Boys, along with anti-government militia group the Oath Keepers, developed plans for Jan. 6, \"we don't know what the full plan is.\" Biggs' attorney claimed in a court filing that his client supports law enforcement and \"twice came to the aid of a police officer who was being beaten.\" Researchers who follow the Proud Boys told NPR that they were uncertain about the degree to which the group may have orchestrated the storming of the Capitol, as opposed to exacerbating an already-chaotic situation. \"I think they saw an opportunity that if this escalated, they had a moment to be a part of that escalation,\" said Shannon Reid, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who has written about alt-right gangs. \"But I would be hard-pressed to really believe that they had a true well-executed plan for taking over the government.\" Still, even if the planning was haphazard, the events of the day resulted in five deaths, more than 100 injured law enforcement officers and an event that the FBI now describes as an act of domestic terrorism. And prosecutors say they intend to show that the Proud Boys were at the heart of that day's terror. \"It's a group that is trying to create really combustible situations and push them as far as they can,\" said the Southern Poverty Law Center's Miller. \"And on the 6th, that is exactly what they did.\"",

Who was he on campus?\n                \n                    \n                    Yifan Wu for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A college student charged in the Jan. 6 riot \"openly posted calls for America to become a whites-only nation,\" according to the FBI. Who was he on campus? For nearly a year, UCLA students said, they raised the alarm about one of their classmates. On Twitter, classmate Christian Secor attacked women and minorities, they said, and embraced the ideology of a far-right extremist. On campus, he pushed a student Republicans group toward extreme positions against all immigration. And on the video streaming site DLive, Secor took on the handle \"Scuffed Elliot Rodger\" \u2014 an apparent reference to the misogynist gunman who killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014. Students of color and Jewish students said they felt targeted by Secor's rhetoric, and given his self-proclaimed \"love\" of guns, they worried about their own safety. Multiple students told NPR they took their concerns to the UCLA administration but said the school took no action. So when they recognized their 22-year-old classmate in footage from the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, they weren't exactly surprised. \"I was a little shocked,\" said Grayson Peters, a Jewish UCLA student, though \"not because I thought it would be out of character.\" The Department of Justice alleges that Secor stormed the chamber of the U.S. Senate and sat in the chair occupied just hours earlier by former Vice President Mike Pence. Secor is now facing multiple federal criminal charges \u2014 including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers \u2014 in connection with the violence at the Capitol. Of the more than 300 people now facing charges, Secor and his path to the Capitol shed light on how far-right extremism among young people that is fostered online can bring violence to the real world. At a time when experts say extremists are increasingly looking to recruit young people, the case also highlights the struggle of public universities trying to tamp down on extremism, while adhering to First Amendment protections. The Justice Department says Christian Secor can be seen in surveillance footage from inside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Charging papers include this screen grab, allegedly showing Secor pushing against Capitol Police officers along with other members of the mob.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. Department of Justice\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Justice Department says Christian Secor can be seen in surveillance footage from inside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Charging papers include this screen grab, allegedly showing Secor pushing against Capitol Police officers along with other members of the mob. Secor's attorney declined to comment for this story. In a court filing, his attorney conceded that the evidence that he was present in the Capitol on Jan. 6 is \"incontrovertible\" but argued that he was acting under the sway of former President Donald Trump and that there is no evidence he planned the riot or assaulted law enforcement officers. In a statement, UCLA told NPR, \"Information on this person is not available to the public.\" NPR has pieced together a portrait of Secor by looking back at who he was online and on campus in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. \"Not a libertarian anymore\" Secor is from Orange County, Calif., which is among the wealthier counties in the state. It's also closely divided politically. In an interview on a far-right podcast in 2020, Secor said he grew interested in politics as a teenager through Ron Paul, the libertarian former congressman from Texas whose policy positions, such as ending all foreign aid and halting U.S. military interventions abroad, would become central themes in Trump's political campaigns. Paul's unsuccessful presidential candidacies were often fueled by enthusiastic young people who found each other online. At times, Paul also received backing from right-wing extremists, including anti-government militias and white nationalists, though the former congressman disowned such supporters. Christian Secor told the little-known right-wing podcast New American Patriots that 2017 was a turning point for him. He was 19 at the time, and he said he and his friends went to a protest against racism in Laguna Beach, Calif. soon after the deadly Charlottesville \"Unite The Right\" rally. Secor told the podcast he and his friends decided it would be \"funny\" to carry a Rhodesian flag around a group of left-wing protesters he described as being part of antifa. The flag originates from a former white-ruled apartheid state in Africa and has been embraced by white supremacists. The man who massacred nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 wore a Rhodesian flag patch. So when Secor and his friends carried the flag at the rally, he said, \"we're walking around waiting for them to realize what we were.\" A group of protesters then surrounded him and his friends, he said, screaming at them that they were white supremacists. Secor said at that moment he realized that antifa was \"evil\" and \"these people need to be crushed, which is why I'm not a libertarian anymore.\" Taking inspiration from an online extremist At UCLA, Secor majored in political science and joined the Bruin Republicans, a conservative student group on campus that included moderate Republicans alongside more pro-Trump members. Around this time, Secor also started to embrace a pro-Trump podcast host and extremist named Nick Fuentes. The Anti-Defamation League describes 22-year-old Fuentes as a \"white supremacist.\" Both Fuentes and Secor have Hispanic ancestry, but Fuentes, who has Mexican roots, has said he identifies as white. He marched in the deadly 2017 Charlottesville rally, which he described as \"incredible,\" and has been denounced by other conservative groups for his extreme views. He advocates a halt to all immigration to the U.S. to stop what he terms \"the racial displacement\" of white people. Variations on that theory \u2014 including the \"Great Replacement\" or \"White Genocide\" \u2014 are at the core of white supremacist propaganda. Fuentes' show, America First, typically consists of apparently unscripted rants. He wears a suit and uses a green screen to digitally add a city skyline behind himself \u2014 creating the effect of a low-budget TV set. Fuentes claims his most extreme statements attacking African Americans, immigrants, Jewish people, women, LGBT people and many others are satire. He has engaged in Holocaust denial and used other anti-Semitic rhetoric, only to later claim he was joking. Eventually, in February 2020, YouTube banned the show for violating the platform's policy on hate speech. Nick Fuentes (left) shakes hands with Christian Secor (right) in a photo cited by the Department of Justice in its criminal case against Secor. Fuentes is a far-right extremist podcaster who has repeatedly engaged in Holocaust denial. A student activist at UCLA saved the photo from Secor's Twitter feed, which has since been deleted.\n                \n                    \n                    Twitter\n                    \n                \nhide caption But Fuentes has continued to find other platforms to stream his show and has amassed a following. Fans of his America First podcast describe themselves as \"Groypers,\" a reference to a mutated version of the \"Pepe The Frog\" meme popular among the  \"alt-right.\" They often attack opponents online to provoke a response. Secor's Twitter feed, identified in court documents, frequently used that kind of \"trolling\" provocation. Near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, he tweeted, \"Can ICE just cough on illegals or something?\" \"This is hateful, direct attacks on members of our community,\" said Aidan Arasasingham, a UCLA student whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Sri Lanka. He described the rhetoric coming from Secor as \"incredibly traumatizing.\" Classmates said that online tactic sometimes crossed over into the classroom. In 2020, for example, Secor took a course in authoritarian politics, and one student, who asked not to be named due to fear of backlash from extremists, told NPR that he was known for asking \"devil's advocate\"-type questions in class. But the real concerns came when Secor deployed those provocations in a student debate. \"Hateful, direct attacks\" on fellow students Several students pointed NPR to a debate in February 2020 between members of the campus Democrats and Republicans. Secor, who holds extreme pro-gun rights views, debated for the Republicans on the topic of gun control. He told the New American Patriots podcast that fully automatic machine guns should be legalized and added, \"I love guns \u2014 everybody should have guns.\" Witnesses of his debate performance described him as \"combative\" and extreme. Combined with his Twitter feed, his support of Fuentes and his use of a school shooter's name as an online avatar, UCLA students grew increasingly worried. \"I felt threatened,\" said Oona Flood, a Japanese American UCLA student and member of the Bruin Democrats. Multiple students told NPR that they reported concerns about Secor to the UCLA administration, but they said they did not see the school take any action. Experts say that because UCLA is a public university, its response to extremism is limited by the First Amendment. The Constitution does not protect serious threats of violence against specific people, but extremists are often careful to avoid crossing that line. Secor's attorney has argued in a court filing that his campus political activities amounted to \"protected First Amendment speech.\" \"Hate speech most often is free speech,\" said Elissa Buxbaum, director of campus affairs for the Anti-Defamation League. Given the legal restrictions, Buxbaum argues that university administrators should fight extremism on campus with their own counter messaging. \"Counter speech is the most important tool in the toolbox,\" said Buxbaum. \"So just because someone is allowed to spread messages of hate doesn't mean that it goes unnoticed or without opposition.\" In its statement to NPR, UCLA said: \"UCLA believes the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol was an attack on our democracy. As an institution, UCLA is committed to mutual respect, making decisions based on evidence and using rational debate \u2014 not physical violence.\" Some UCLA students said they were disappointed that the university's statements about Secor did not denounce extremism. \"I would have preferred something along the lines of 'We condemn white supremacy. We condemn white nationalism. And we support students who might be affected by this,'\" said Grayson Peters. In response to that criticism, a UCLA spokesperson pointed to an \"ongoing racial justice and equity initiative\" that the university announced in June 2020, following the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. A hard-right turn UCLA students described a kind of feedback loop between Secor's activity online and on campus, as he took ideas from online extremists, brought them to UCLA, and then pushed the campus Republican group to take more far-right stances \u2014 especially on social media. Moderate members of the Bruin Republicans found themselves increasingly alarmed about Secor's rhetoric and the hard-right direction he was pulling the group. Eventually, Secor broke away and founded a campus group called America First Bruins (bearing the same name as Fuentes' podcast), but he still had allies among the campus Republicans. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Secor's group and the Bruin Republicans both signed on to a statement calling for an \"Immediate and Indefinite Immigration Moratorium.\" Secor commented to The Gateway Pundit, a far-right website known for promoting conspiracy theories, that \"our coalition of young students have come together to ask for President Trump to keep true to his word of America First and close the borders.\" Several moderate members of the Bruin Republicans disagreed with the statement, and in response they resigned from the group. \"Many members are children of the very immigrants the letter rails against,\" several former Bruin Republicans wrote in a letter. \"Xenophobia and racism have no place within the conservative movement.\" Multiple UCLA students described the situation to NPR as a \"coup.\" \"Bruin Republicans used to be a really honorable group,\" said Evan Farrar, president of the Bruin Democrats. He said he used to work closely with campus Republicans to organize quarterly debates. But by 2020, he said, he witnessed a \"decline into retweeting alt-right conspiracy theories.\" The Bruin Republicans would later claim that they \"banned\" Secor from their group for \"inappropriate behavior\" and said the group was wholly independent from Secor. But the group's Twitter feed suggests the group continued to hold far-right stances. In one tweet, the group continued to call for \"zero immigration\" to the U.S. and argued that \"America is not a nation of immigrants but a nation of settlers and citizens. America would still be America without immigrants, would it not?\" Bruin Republicans declined to comment for this story and did not respond to questions from NPR. The road to the Capitol After the November 2020 election, Secor; his group, America First Bruins; and the Bruin Republicans all embraced the baseless conspiracy theory that the election was \"stolen\" from then-President Donald Trump. Fuentes appeared at \"Stop The Steal\" rallies and urged his followers to join the protests. On Jan. 5, Secor tweeted a photo from an airport with the caption \"be there or be square...\" On Jan. 6, federal prosecutors now allege, he joined the storming of the Capitol, wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat and carrying a blue \"America First\" flag. In one video, prosecutors say, Secor was seen among \"a group of rioters attempting to push through a doorway that is blocked by no less than three police officers\" and \"breaking through a police line.\" There's no evidence that the Bruin Republicans knew Secor may have been among the rioters. But the group tweeted support for the pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, describing them as \"grassroots Trump supporters protesting for our country.\" \"The ones committing 'violence' are probably Feds,\" the group stated in another tweet. Nick Fuentes was in Washington, D.C., during the rioting and declared it a \"glorious day,\" but he said he never breached the Capitol. Fuentes did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Here is the full clip of Nick Fuentes telling his supporters to destroy their phones and SIM cards if they entered the Capitol building on January 6th -- and then backtracking. pic.twitter.com/oFdqRPk5X3 Later, on his livestream, Fuentes urged his followers who might have entered the Capitol to \"destroy your phone, your SIM card, all your information.\" He seemed to then backtrack, adding, \"I don't know, is that a crime to say?\" Based on federal court records, Secor may have agreed with that advice. One witness told the FBI that Secor moved back in with his mother in Orange County after the rioting, \"got rid of his phone\" and \"bragged that he would not be caught.\" The FBI conducted surveillance of Secor in late January, according to court documents, and he was arrested on Feb. 16.

So far, military veterans account for about 15% of those criminally charged in the Capitol riot, according to an NPR analysis. Less than two weeks after hundreds of rioters \u2014 including current and former service members \u2014 converged on the Capitol and broke through the doors, threatened lawmakers and injured and killed police, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin appeared before a Senate committee for his confirmation hearing. \"The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies,\" he told members of the Armed Services Committee. \"But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\" So far, military veterans account for about 15% of those criminally charged in the Capitol riot, according to an NPR analysis. Some rioters carried Marine Corps flags. Others dressed as soldiers, while at least one member of the far-right group The Proud Boys told an NPR reporter that he served two tours in Iraq with the 82nd Airborne Division. Historical data has shown a link between military experience and right-wing extremism, and military experience is a prized asset in extremist circles. Now Defense Secretary Austin has ordered a military-wide, one-day training \"stand down\" to determine the extent of extremist behavior in the ranks. At some point in the next two months, Austin wants military leaders to discuss with the troops the importance of their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution, to be aware of any unacceptable behaviors such as advocating violence or active participation in hate or white supremacist groups, and talk about ways to report suspected behavior. Also, he said he wants these discussions to consider possible solutions. A new urgency For decades military leaders have dealt with extremists in the ranks, from \"skinheads\" and neo-Nazis to gangs like MS-13. The senior officers have often said only a tiny fraction of the 2 million men and women in uniform hold these beliefs. But there's a new urgency following the nationwide rise of far-right groups in recent years. Former President Donald Trump at times seemed to support such groups, while some Republican members of Congress appeared to embrace extremist beliefs. Austin says he's trying to determine the scope, and as he said, \"sustainable ways\" to eliminate it. Navy leadership revealed that within just the past few weeks there have been separate incidents where \"symbols of hate' were left anonymously in living areas aboard two ships. In one instance an African-American sailor found a noose next to his rack; in another, graffiti on a bathroom wall read, \"Nazi life.\" Military leaders are still trying to gather statistics from the services that would shed light on the issue, including how many military members are disciplined, how many are kicked out of the military and how many recruits are turned away from any extremist ties. It's proving to be difficult. So far, NPR and other news organizations have been able to gather only a few statistics. The Marine Corps says in the last three years it found 16 cases of substantiated extremist behavior, mostly postings on social media. The Marines had no immediate information about whether any of them were kicked out. The Army, meanwhile, told NPR to file a Freedom of Information Act request with the Army's Criminal Investigation Command in order to get any information on extremist investigations. Little information It's unclear whether the military has carried out any surveys like the one conducted in 2019 by the independent Military Times newspaper. Roughly one-third of active duty troops said they had \"personally witnessed examples of white nationalism or ideological-driven racism within the ranks in recent months,\" according to the survey by the Military Times and Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families. Troops said they had seen \"swastikas being drawn on service members' cars, tattoos affiliated with white supremacist groups, stickers supporting the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi-style salutes between individuals.\" Some conservative commentators have questioned whether Austin's stand down is an anti-Trump exercise. But the Pentagon insists this is not about how a current or former service member voted, or what their political beliefs may be. Rather, it's how they act on certain beliefs, including calls for violence. Pentagon regulations from 2012, state that: \"Military personnel must not actively advocate supremacist, extremist or criminal gang doctrine, ideology or causes, including those that advance, encourage or advocate the use of force, violence, or criminal activity or otherwise advance efforts to to deprive individuals of their civil rights.\" The regulations go on to say that military personnel \"must reject active participation\" in such groups, including \"demonstrating and rallying; recruiting, training, organizing, or leading members; distributing material (including posting online); knowingly wearing gang colors or clothing; having tattoos or body markings associated with such gangs or organizations.\" Debating the rules Still, a service member can be a member of an organization such as the Proud Boys, just not an \"active\" one. That may be changing, says Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. \"Membership is not considered inconsistent with service in the military,\" Kirby told reporters recently, \"and it really is about what you do with that membership. I'm not going to be predictive one way or the other about where this discussion is going, but I think membership in these groups is something I would expect [Pentagon officials] to look at.\" Pentagon officials privately concede they will have to tackle some thorny issues. Confederate flags are now banned. But what about a patch from a far-right group or a bumper sticker that supports the conspiracy theories of QAnon? Indeed, what about soldier wearing a T-shirt reading, \"Stop the Steal?\" The argument could be made that that solider is saying the election was a fraud and therefore his commander-in-chief is illegitimate. That could be illegal under military law, which prohibits \"contempt toward officials.\" Austin sat down with the Joint Chiefs of Staff last week and asked for their ideas. Some suggested an education campaign for recruits that talks about extremism. Another idea is to counsel service members before they leave active duty: Be aware extremist groups may be looking to recruit you.",

Federal prosecutors have alleged that before the attack, Brock posted on Facebook about an impending \"Second Civil War.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Larry Rendall Brock Jr., an Air Force veteran, is seen inside the Senate Chamber wearing a military-style helmet and tactical vest during the rioting at the U.S. Capitol. Federal prosecutors have alleged that before the attack, Brock posted on Facebook about an impending \"Second Civil War.\" As a violent mob descended on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, lawmakers and aides hid wherever they could, waiting for the military and police to arrive. But many of those who stormed the Capitol were military veterans themselves, who had once sworn to protect the Constitution. In fact, an NPR analysis has found that nearly 1 in 5 people charged over their alleged involvement in the attack on the U.S. Capitol appear to have a military history. NPR compiled a list of individuals facing federal or District of Columbia charges in connection with the events of Jan. 6. Of more than 140 charged so far, a review of military records, social media accounts, court documents and news reports indicate at least 27 of those charged, or nearly 20%, have served or are currently serving in the U.S. military. To put that number in perspective, only about 7% of all American adults are military veterans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Several veterans are charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. One of them is Larry Rendall Brock Jr. The Air Force veteran was photographed in a military-style helmet and tactical vest carrying flex cuffs inside the Capitol. He posted on Facebook that he was preparing for a \"Second Civil War,\" according to documents filed in federal court. In the weeks after Biden's victory, Brock posted that \"we are now under occupation by a hostile governing force.\" \"I see no distinction between a group of Americans seizing power and governing with complete disregard to the Constitution and an invading force of Chinese communists accomplishing the same objective,\" Brock wrote. (There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.) He ended his post with a reference to the oath taken by members of the military: \"Against all enemies foreign and domestic.\" Some veterans who allegedly stormed the Capitol are still serving in some capacity. Jacob Fracker, 29, was an infantry rifleman in the Marine Corps and deployed to Afghanistan twice, according to the Pentagon. He now serves in the Virginia National Guard, according to widespread news reports, though he was not among the service members deployed to Washington ahead of the inauguration. He is also a police officer in Rocky Mount, Va. With him at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was his colleague from the Rocky Mount Police Department, Thomas Robertson, 47, who is an Army veteran also facing charges. Federal prosecutors have also alleged that multiple members of the right-wing extremist group the Oath Keepers took part in the \"incursion\" at the Capitol. The group has been known to target and recruit active-duty members of the military and veterans, in part for their specialized skills. Among those charged in relation to the storming of the Capitol are Thomas Edward Caldwell, a Navy veteran and alleged leader among the Oath Keepers, and Donovan Ray Crowl, a Marine Corps veteran. They have been charged with conspiracy to obstruct the Electoral College vote, among other alleged crimes. Attorneys representing those facing charges did not respond to NPR's messages seeking comment. Rooting out extremism Roughly one-third of active duty troops said they had \"personally witnessed examples of white nationalism or ideological-driven racism within the ranks in recent months,\" according to a 2019 survey conducted by the Military Times and Syracuse University Institute for Veterans and Military Families. Troops said they had seen \"swastikas being drawn on service members' cars, tattoos affiliated with white supremacist groups, stickers supporting the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi-style salutes between individuals.\" At least one individual charged in connection with the assault on the Capitol allegedly embraced that extremist ideology. Timothy Louis Hale-Cusanelli, 30, is a Navy contractor who has worked at a naval weapons station with a secret security clearance, according to court documents. He is also an Army Reserve sergeant in the 174th Infantry Brigade and an \"avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer,\" according to court documents. Some experts argue the military has not done enough to tamp down on extremism in its ranks. Rocky Mount, Va., police Officer Jacob Fracker, left, and Sgt. Thomas Robertson in the Capitol. Both Robertson and Fracker are also U.S. military veterans.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. Capitol Police via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rocky Mount, Va., police Officer Jacob Fracker, left, and Sgt. Thomas Robertson in the Capitol. Both Robertson and Fracker are also U.S. military veterans. Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, called the military's efforts largely \"haphazard.\" \"It's not like the military is just tolerating white supremacists,\" Pitcavage told NPR. But he said efforts to address the problem need to be more systematic. \"Not only does there need to be training,\" Pitcavage said, \"but there also need to be clear expectations coming down from on high about what you should do when you encounter an extremist in your unit, at your base or whatever the circumstances are, and that here are the procedures that need to be followed.\" The problem is not entirely lost on the Defense Department. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, a senior defense official told NPR there were 68 notifications of investigations by the FBI last year of former and current military members pertaining to domestic extremism. When extremism in the military does go undetected or ignored, the stakes can be high. As Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, testified to Congress, veterans and military personnel \"have training that makes terrorist attacks more achievable and more deadly.\" In 2019, federal prosecutors said that Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson had planned a series of violent attacks against liberal politicians, and was an avowed white nationalist for decades. Hasson ultimately pleaded guilty to drug and weapons charges. Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, was an Army veteran who served in the Persian Gulf War. He had taken inspiration from the white supremacist novel \"The Turner Diaries,\" which continues to hold sway among far-right extremists. Pitcavage cautions that there is limited evidence military veterans are more susceptible to extremist ideology than any other group of Americans. \"Overall, our veteran population is largely reflective of our general population,\" Pitcavage said. Veterans, for example, have also been on the front lines of the fight against extremism. Brian Sicknick, the police officer who died trying to prevent the mob from storming the Capitol, was also a veteran. The New Jersey Air National Guard, where Sicknick served, said, \"Staff Sgt. Sicknick's commitment to service and to protect his community, state, and nation will never be forgotten.\" In his inaugural address on Wednesday, President Biden pledged to combat \"a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism.\" Likewise, Biden's pick to lead the Department of Defense, retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, told Congress on Tuesday that, if confirmed, he would work to combat extremism in the military, a problem the Defense Department acknowledged in a report in December. Austin, who would be the nation's first Black defense secretary, said he would fight hard \"to rid our ranks of racists.\" \"The Defense Department's job is to keep America safe from our enemies,\" he testified. \"But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\" NPR\u2019s Barbara Van Woerkom, Monika Evstatieva, Austin Fast and Emine Y\u00fccel contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Osnos' new book focuses on coal country in West Virginia; hedge fund culture in Greenwich, Conn.; institutional racism in Chicago and why Democrat Joe Manchin holds remarkable sway in the Senate.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. How did America become so divided? Why is there so much rage and fear? How did the gap grow so large between the wealthiest and everyone else? And why did we come so close to overturning the results of a presidential election? These are some of the questions my guest, Evan Osnos, grapples with in his new book \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury.\" Osnos is also the author of a book about Joe Biden. He covers politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker, where he's a staff writer. He was the magazine's China correspondent from 2008 to 2013. His first book, \"Age Of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, And Faith In The New China,\" won a 2014 National Book Award. His new book \"Wildland\" reports on three different places that he's lived in. In Clarksburg, W.Va., coal country, where he started his journalism career working for a local paper, he considers what was gained and lost when some of America's wealthiest people tapped the natural resources beneath the homes of some of the poorest people in America. In Greenwich, where he grew up, he writes about how it became the hedge fund capital of the world and how that world of money affected American capitalism and politics. In Chicago, where he formerly wrote for the Tribune, he looks at the compounded effects of American segregation on health and wealth. Evan Osnos, welcome back to FRESH AIR. It's always a treat to have you on the show. Since you've written about West Virginia in your new book and you have a long article about Joe Manchin that you wrote a few months ago in The New Yorker, I want to ask you about Joe Manchin, Democratic senator from West Virginia, now in his third term. In some ways, he controls the Democratic Party now. They need his vote to pass legislation including voting rights and infrastructure. And he's insisting on bipartisanship when it's clear that that is not on Mitch McConnell's agenda. McConnell has made it clear that he basically wants to block the Biden administration agenda. He made it very clear that his goal No. 1 was to block Obama when Obama was president. So what is this bipartisanship insistence about, in your mind, when it's fair to assume that Manchin knows, as well as anybody else, that the Republican Party isn't into bipartisanship right now? EVAN OSNOS: I think Joe Manchin is responding to a couple of pieces from his life. Number one, he grew up in a state that was all Democrats for a very long time. And as recently as the year 2000, the congressional delegation of West Virginia was fully Democratic. And over the course of just a couple of decades, actually, it's gone now fully Republican with the exception of him. And so he operates almost literally at home - his neighbors, you know, when he's home, the places that he goes, the people he sees. And he doesn't look at the transformation of the Republican Party the way that I think many Americans do, which is that it has fallen into the grip of Donald Trump in ways that people find just bizarre. He actually looks at it, and he says, these are my - these are people I've known forever. I can understand the thought process that goes into their support for him. And so he is more inclined to imagine that he can persuade them. He can win them over - that he can figure out a way to try to get them to agree. I will say something else, though, I think is important. To understand Joe Manchin, you have to remember he comes from a town called Farmington, W.Va., that has a population of about 300 people. And for a long time, they were all Democrats. And now today, most of them voted for Donald Trump. And so he doesn't go and feel as if Republicans are intractable or impossible to persuade. In fact, they are people he has literally known his whole life. I think some people will assume that Manchin does what he does because he is looking for political survival, that, well, how could he get reelected if he doesn't do these things? I think there's something also a little bit deeper to it. On a deep level, he doesn't really want to be somebody who looks like he went Washington. I mean, he goes to elaborate lengths to try to show that he's still an authentic man of West Virginia. He lives on a houseboat in Washington, for instance, and likes to say that he could weigh anchor and leave any time. But the truth is that a lot of Democrats are - you know, will feel as if he is just wildly out of touch with where the Republican Party has moved. GROSS: So, you know, his record - he's had some success in persuading fellow Democrats to moderate their bills... OSNOS: Yeah. GROSS: ...To suit his needs and his constituents' needs or what he thinks his constituents' needs are. But has he ever won over - you know, in the recent past, has he ever won over Republicans in the Senate? OSNOS: No. He holds out hope for it, but we don't see examples of him being able to do it. I think he believes that, really, the role that he's playing is actually less about persuading Republicans to come over and join him than it is about preventing his own party from moving into a progressive direction that he doesn't think West Virginians would ever support. So he sees himself actually as much of a change agent within the Democratic Party as he does somebody who's going to be able to communicate with Republicans. GROSS: You - I hadn't seen this myself, but you write that his website boasted that he voted with the Trump administration 74% of the time and that no senator, Democratic or Republican, split with their party more often than he did. So I'm sure Democrats weren't happy to read that on his website. OSNOS: Yeah, he's proud of it. Look. He is this very strange, small species left in American politics. He's a Democrat in a sea of red in West Virginia. And the general understanding is that for the near term, there's probably no other Democrat who can win statewide in West Virginia. And so Democrats in the leadership, people like Dick Durbin of Illinois, have this very complicated relationship with him - or Chuck Schumer - because they say, well, he's driving us - I mean, I'm using - this is my words, not theirs. He's driving us slightly crazy. On the other hand, were it not for him, we wouldn't even have a chance to control the Senate. And I think among practitioners, Terry, there's this interesting detail, which is that among people who are professional politicians like Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden, on some level, they just admire the fact that Manchin is able to get elected in West Virginia. And so even though he drives them nuts by standing in the way of things that they're trying to solve, there is a piece of them that also says, well, were it not for him, we'd be in the minority. GROSS: You write that there's been a lot of pressure on Manchin from the right, including from the Koch network of foundations and businesses and activist groups. So what is that pressure like? And what impact do you think that's had on Manchin? OSNOS: They, at some points, have called for things like protests in the state capital of Charleston, trying to pressure him to be more responsive. And look. He knows this. He follows it. Manchin is a kind of a sleepless character. He's constantly on the phone. He's always talking to people and - even more so than most politicians. He's got a bit of a kind of limitless political hunger. He - I think there is a way in which he doesn't like to show anybody that he's responsive either to pressure from the left or pressure from the right. And in a curious way, Terry, he is a bit of a puzzle to people who are trying to make him change positions because they find they'll go in. They'll talk to him. They'll - he'll sound like he might agree with them. But then in the end, he ends up doing exactly what he wants to do. And oftentimes, he's sort of impulsive, and he'll do it at the last minute. He'll change his position a bit. But in some ways, the most important interactions in Washington are the ones between Joe Manchin and Joe Biden. And at one point, I remember Manchin saying to me that - he said, you know, I won't always do what Biden wants me to do. But when it came to the stimulus bill, which was just this huge, historic piece of legislation early on in the Biden administration, he said Biden asked him outright. He said, can you do this for me? And Manchin said, I will because I think you'll lose momentum as president if I don't. And there's a deeper lesson in there, which is Biden knows that. And he knows that he has this - he always has this option up his sleeve. But he can only use it a few times, and he can ask Manchin outright. There was once a moment in public when Manchin said, I want Joe Biden to be a successful president. And it sounds like a throwaway line, except what he's hinting at is that there may be moments, when push comes to shove, yes, he will demand a lot. He'll drive Democrats crazy in the things that he wants and dragging down some of the ambitious goals that they have for change. But when the final votes are counted, he may be there, and they're counting on that. And if they're disappointed, if they're wrong, he will go down in history as the person who stood in the way of the Democratic Party's opportunity. GROSS: I want to ask you about an ad that Joe mentioned, a TV ad back in 2010, and it has to do with basically - literally shooting legislation. Can you - could you describe this TV ad? OSNOS: Yeah. In 2010 he posted something that turned out to be kind of a landmark in political advertising. People had been holding guns in political ads for years, but he took it a step further. And in his television ad, he said, I'm going to take on Washington and this administration, meaning the Obama administration. He is, after all, a Democrat. And then he lifted a rifle to his shoulder, and he said, I'll repeal the bad parts of Obamacare, and he said, I'll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill because it's bad for West Virginia. He was appealing to West Virginians' suspicion of climate change legislation. And as a result of the ad, in which he fired a bullet through a copy of this cap-and-trade bill, it kind of created a bit of an arms race in political advertising. Pretty soon you saw other candidates shooting legislation. And there was one particularly memorable Republican candidate for Congress in Arizona who took the Obamacare bill and shot it with a handgun and a rifle and a semiautomatic rifle and then eventually ran it through a wood chipper. I mean, it was like - there was a way in which the symbolism of guns and politics and animosity had become fused in this particularly bizarre expression of American politics. And I - you know, this is the kind of thing that, coming back from abroad, I sort of looked at and had to do a double take and say, really? How did we start doing this? When did this happen? GROSS: Did you ask Manchin about that ad? OSNOS: I spoke to the person who came up with the ad, actually, one of his advisers. And he remembers they were not doing all that well in the campaign. It was late at night, and they were on a call. And this adviser - you know, he was from New York City. He says, I wouldn't really know the right end of a gun if I was - if it was sitting in my lap. But he said, can we shoot a bill? Can we - it doesn't matter what. Let's just shoot a bill. I think that's going to be the way that we're going to endear ourselves to voters. And people laughed at the idea originally. They said, no, no, we're not going to do that. And then he said, no, no, seriously, can we do it? And then they said, well, sure. And Manchin loved the idea, and they went ahead with it. GROSS: So Joe Manchin spent a lot of his career as a coal broker in the energy world. I'm not sure what a coal broker means, but who benefited from that company? And did coal miners - did working people benefit from the kind of work that the company did? OSNOS: As a coal broker, Joe Manchin's job was partly about lining up buyers and sellers. And so he operated very deeply in the coal industry. And, you know, I think you would hear different answers to the question of who benefited. Some workers would tell you, well, without coal brokers, then there's nobody to pay my salary. But the truth is that he was also - fundamentally, he was oriented to want to see the coal companies succeed. He wanted to see that economy as a part of West Virginia's future. And I asked him once - I said, you know, do you think that your own business interests have clouded your judgment on things like the environment or workers' protection? And he responded - he sort of bristled at that suggestion. He said, no, no. He said, I can separate these things. This is not a case in which my judgment is clouded. A lot of people in West Virginia, particularly Democrats, would disagree, and they feel as if he has very much been an agent of a period in which politics was dominated by the interests and the power of energy companies. And I think that's part of the reason why you see a lot of young people in West Virginia who kind of roll their eyes at the era of Joe Manchin's dominance of the state. And they want to see new blood, people who can envision a different way of earning a living. GROSS: Tell us more about the questions that drove this book, the things you wanted to learn from reporting on three cities - Greenwich, Conn., Clarksburg, W.Va., and Chicago. OSNOS: I think, in some ways, what really fascinated me was not only the degree of distance and seclusion and separation. In some ways, we know that. We know that we're polarized. What really surprised me was the degree to which places were impacting each other in ways that they didn't even know day-to-day. And I'll give you an example. I was really struck by the fact that, in Chicago, there was this very clear long-running effect of the financial crisis, particularly in predominantly Black neighborhoods. I met a man named Maurice Clark, whose family had taken a subprime loan, and the mortgage rate had gone through the roof. And eventually, they had lost their house. And he had walked me around the neighborhood and had said to me, you know, in Black neighborhoods in Chicago, he said, the financial crisis never ended. It's still going on. And I was struck by the fact that some of the people who had been primary architects and beneficiaries of the subprime mortgage period in American life lived in my hometown of Greenwich, Conn. It just fascinated me that people like Dick Fuld, who was the chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers and had made something like $300 million over the previous seven years leading up to the financial crisis, and Chuck Prince, who'd been the chairman and CEO of Citibank - and Citibank had received the largest bailout of any bank in American history. And I was struck by the ways in which you had these two places from my life that were experiencing a phase of American history in such radically different ways. And I needed to understand those connections. So in a curious way, Terry, it was actually not the distance between the places that fascinated me. It was the connections between them. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Evan Osnos. He reports on politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker. His new book is called \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Evan Osnos. He reports on politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker. His new book, \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury,\" examines how America became so divided and angry and close to overturning democracy. Two of the places that you write about are such interesting contrasts because there's, you know, Greenwich, Conn., which is the hedge fund capital of the world, and Clarksburg, W.Va., which is a struggling town. It's coal country. They've lost jobs. They have lost other businesses. They've lost population. How did they each go in terms of voting for Trump? OSNOS: Yeah, that fact actually gets to one of the things that is a surprise when you look now at the Trump phenomenon. At the time, it was sometimes described that Trump was like a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, and that was never actually quite right. What we realized is that it was actually a joint venture between elements of the Republican establishment and this more populist frontier of the Republican Party that Trump had activated. But they responded to him for very different reasons. One of the things I found in Greenwich in talking to Republicans there who voted for him - you know, people would say to me that they felt as if he was going to protect their economic interests or their taxes or things like that. And I think there was also a degree to which Greenwich is a place that has been at the heart of the Republican establishment for a long time. It was quite literally the hometown of George H.W. Bush, and his father had been a senator from Connecticut. And over time, that Republican establishment had gradually made its peace - in fact, had supported the rise of people like Ted Cruz and eventually Donald Trump, who represented this much harsher and cruder edge of the party. And I - look; I think the honest answer is that it wasn't - it didn't come out of nowhere by any means. It was, in fact, this quite steady accumulation of policy choices and the decisions that were made along the way to promote the kinds of politics that Trump represented. In West Virginia, people were responding to Trump for something very different, which was - Trump went down to West Virginia, and he put on a coal miner's helmet and said to people at a rally, I'm going to put you back to work; you're going to be working your asses off, as he said. And you know, I remember talking to a coal miner named David Efaw afterwards. And you know, I said, honestly, did you believe that that would happen? And he said, look; I have no illusions about who Donald Trump is. He voted for him. He said, but I voted for him only because he was the only one who was offering me a deal, offering me something. I mean, I'm paraphrasing here. But he was saying to him, I will bring back this industry. And look; the reality was that industry was not coming back. And over the course of the next four years, West Virginia lost an additional 6,400 coal jobs. So Trump's promises were an illusion. But there was a degree to which he was paying political attention to West Virginia in a way that people had not in a long time. And there was a desperation because of the degree of the falling away that West Virginia had experienced over the last 20 or 30 years that when somebody came along and did that, it was electrifying, and people gravitated towards him. GROSS: So did Trump do anything that actually improved the lives of people in Clarksburg, W.Va? OSNOS: Well, for a period of time, he created a regulatory environment that would promote the exploration for natural gas. And so some people did benefit from that. There were jobs that were created that hadn't been there before. But it's a Boom And Bust Economy in oil and gas, meaning that jobs can appear very quickly and then disappear very quickly when prices drop or the rules change. And I think to his critics in Clarksburg, people would tell you that what frustrates them is that there has been nobody in politics, Trump or anybody else, who has begun to create any kind of durable economic foundation, something that will last beyond the next boom in oil and gas. And so they find themselves still captive to this fragile economic model instead of putting in money into education and putting into the kinds of new technologies that might be there for decades to come. GROSS: Well, let's take a break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Evan Osnos. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker, where he covers foreign affairs and politics. His new book is called \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury.\" We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BILL FRISELL, ELVIS COSTELLO AND BURT BACHARACH'S \"VAMP DOLCE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Evan Osnos. He reports on politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker. His new book, \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury,\" examines how America became so divided and angry and close to overturning democracy. He reports on three cities that he's lived in, Greenwich, Conn., which became the hedge fund capital of the world, Clarksburg, W.V., coal country, and Chicago, which, like so much of America, is still dealing with the legacy of slavery and segregation. You not only profiled Joe Manchin for The New Yorker, you wrote a whole book on Joe Biden. So Manchin and Biden have worked together since 2010, when Manchin was elected to the Senate. Biden was already serving as vice president under Obama. And now Biden is president. Can you tell us a little bit about the history of their relationship? OSNOS: Yeah. They actually sort of understand each other in a way because, let's be honest, these are two Catholic Joes in their 70s, both white men who came out of a certain kind of politics in which, for Biden, in Delaware and for Manchin in West Virginia, they both imagined that they could speak to Republicans and Democrats and cut deals across the aisle. They're both back slappers of a certain kind in politics. And there was another piece of it, which was that during the Obama administration, Obama and Manchin never had much of a relationship. Manchin can tell you. He can sort of remember the few times that he spoke to Obama personally. And he has a bit of a - I think, a bit of a chip on his shoulder about it. Whereas, Biden was assigned, in effect, either formally or informally, to talk to Manchin. And so he would be the one who would call Manchin during the Obama years. And they struck up something of a rapport. Biden's a big believer - I've heard him say to me and others a lot over the years that you - don't try to get into the head of another person's politics. They will often be pretty smart about their own, local political reality, that if somebody feels like they have room to move on an issue, then they might - you might be able to get them there. But telling them that they're wrong is probably not going to - it's probably not going to work. And he's used that. Biden's used it in Baghdad and in Ukraine and, ultimately, in his dealings with somebody like Joe Manchin. And so one of the things he's always done is when he deals with Manchin, he's always been very conscious of not trying to tell him what his political space is and what his political reality is. He's trying, in some subtle way, to try to lead Manchin to a different destination without making him feel like he's being muzzled. GROSS: So what are you looking out for now in the political landscape with Joe Manchin and the Democratic Party? OSNOS: Well, I think there in a way is this moment in which Joe Biden is pulled between these two very different political conceptions of what the Democratic Party is. You have Bernie Sanders on one end, who is pushing for an expansive vision of what the Democrats can do at this moment. They control the presidency, both houses of Congress. And this moment is fleeting. And that's why Bernie Sanders, who is the chair of the budget committee, is pushing for this $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill that would cover improvements to child care and elder care and things like that. And then you have Joe Manchin, who represents also the Democratic Party but is pulling Joe Biden in the other direction. I think one of the ways that Biden became president was because he figured out a way to make two very different kinds of politician, Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin, both feel as if he was listening to them. Bernie Sanders provided a pivotal endorsement for Biden when he was running in 2020. And the reason he did so - he said explicitly - was because I always felt as if Biden would hear me. He didn't always agree with me, but he would hear me out. And Manchin says something similar. And what's fascinating is they're coming from completely different places. And so this is actually the moment that is sort of testing what Biden has always said he believes, which is that if you get people in a room, no matter how much they disagree with one another, that if you can start by identifying and establishing some of the things that they agree on, then eventually you'll have a firmer footing on which to talk about the things on which they disagree. And that moment has arrived. I mean, this is happening now. Really, over the course of just the next few weeks and months, this will be the period when we learn whether Biden's presidency is going to be remembered for having made major breakthroughs in what the state can provide for people, particularly vulnerable people, or whether it falls short because of the divisions within the Democratic Party. What's remarkable about it, Terry, is how much of it really does rest on these relationships, these dealings between these three men at the top of the Democratic Party. GROSS: In your writing, you had an interesting set of bookends to the Trump presidency. When Trump announced that he was going to run for president. You, at the time, were covering the far right. You were writing about white nationalists. And you happened to be talking to white nationalists at that time. And they were telling you why they were so excited at the prospect of Trump running for president and possibly even winning. And they knew that Trump might not define himself as a sympathizer with them. But some of the causes that he was espousing, like anti-immigration, was at the center of their beliefs. White nationalists don't want immigration. White nationalists don't like Muslims in America. And then, at the end of the Trump presidency, you covered the January 6 attack on the Capitol. I was wondering if any of the people who you spoke to when Trump announced, any of those white nationalists ended up being at the attack on the Capitol on January 6. OSNOS: Well, I will tell you the thing that surprised me most, actually, about having been through that first experience and then being at the Capitol on January 6 was that those white nationalists who I'd met at the beginning of the Trump phenomenon, you know, they were, in some ways, the kinds of people you would expect to be involved in white nationalism. They were young, angry white men. And when I was at the Capitol on January 6, almost five years later after that first moment, what really surprised me, Terry, was actually the fact that I was talking to people like grandmothers, people who had jobs and worked in more conventional parts of American life, that they had actually been drawn into this world that Trump represented. That was actually almost more chilling to me because that represented an expansion of this set of ideas beyond the most fevered fringe to this group of people who, frankly, I did not expect to get drawn into Trump's lies and the fantasies that he was promoting. And that was more alarming. GROSS: You've reported from so many places. Have you ever reported from a place where lies grew in very fertile territory, where conspiracy theories grew, and then truth won out in the long run? Does, like, truth ever win out once conspiracy theories and lies get so deeply rooted in a culture? OSNOS: It worries me, honestly, Terry. I think it is really hard to bring people back into some sense of faith in a system, but it's actually not impossible. I think one of the things that has encouraged me over the course of the last couple years is the idea that fact-checking as a concept, as a discipline, has become valorized. I mean, we talk about fact-checking now as something larger than just checking if a politician is telling the truth. It's actually sort of taken on almost more like a belief system, that there are facts and that they are worth checking and that there is a method by which you can ascertain if somebody is telling us lies. I had a moment in China that stays with me when - this is a place that has had a state-backed propaganda system for decades. And a lot of people grow up in China more or less assuming that what the state is telling them is not true. And once, a Chinese journalist friend asked me if I would give a talk to some other friends about fact-checking and the way we do it at The New Yorker because we have this pretty intensive, almost fanatical commitment to that process. And when I showed up for the event, I expected a couple people to be there, friends of his. And there were hundreds of people there, young people, especially young journalists who wanted to learn about fact-checking. And I talked about the process and how we go about it and how we often will re-interview people to make sure that we get the details right. And later, somebody wrote up the transcript, and it now circulates on the internet to my astonishment that this - it has nothing to do with me. It was just this idea that there is something deeply appealing and almost human about wanting to find the truth. And I think in order for the United States to find its way back to that, part of this is - look. Let's be blunt. There are some people, the hardest core of Trump's supporters, who will never be persuaded by reason. They have decided that they are his and his only. And - but there are other people who are looking to be persuaded of the truth and of fact. And I think part of the way you do that is you hold your people in power to a greater, higher standard. And instead of allowing this slippage over the course of decades in which people became more and more comfortable lying to the voters and to the public, it requires you standing up earlier and saying, no, no, stop. You've disqualified yourself from public life, from public service. You simply can't lie that way. And there is a moment - it feels to me now that there are people who are now alert to the risks of it and aware of it in ways that they weren't before the pandemic and before our president tried to subvert the election. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Evan Osnos. He reports on politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker. His new book is called \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PHIL KEAGGY AND HOLT VAUGHN'S \"BITTER SUITE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Evan Osnos. He reports on politics and foreign affairs for The New Yorker. His new book \"Wildland: The Making Of America's Fury\" examines how America became so divided and angry and close to overturning democracy. So I'm going to change the subject here and get to something that you write about in your new book, which is that your great-grandfather was shot in Chicago on the South Side in the early 1900s. First, briefly tell us the story of how he was shot. OSNOS: Yeah. Albert Sherer was his name. And he was coming home late at night with some other students, and they were at the University of Chicago in 1905. And the other students went one way, and he started walking alone. He lived with his parents. And some young guys stepped out of the bushes and pulled out a gun. And at first, he thought, well, this is a - maybe this seems like a stunt because they were so young. They were teenagers. But it was a real holdup, and they shot him. They shot him in the chest. And when he fell, they shot him again, and they ended up going through his pockets and just coming away with a few cents. Eighty cents is all they found. And he was reported in the newspaper as having been fatally shot. I remember finding this copy of the Chicago Tribune. But he wasn't fatally shot. He survived. And the president of the University of Chicago - the school had only been around for a short time at that point. And it was a big story in Chicago that a student had been shot. And the president of the university wrote him a letter while he was still recovering in the hospital and praised what he called his large promise of usefulness, which is a phrase that always - it sort of stuck with me, the - just the sense of support and belief that he was shown. GROSS: Was this a story that was talked about a lot in the family? OSNOS: Yeah, it kind of lurked in the family memory - not much. I just had heard about it. And it was a long time, actually, before I decided I wanted to understand a little more of what happened. And so I contacted the University of Chicago. It turned out that when my great-grandfather died decades later in the '70s, that his son, my grandfather, had taken these bullets which had been pulled from his body and had put them in an envelope. He didn't know what else to do with them, and he mailed them to the University of Chicago. And he said, these are for you if you want them. And they put them in the archives. And so I - when I called the university, I said, you know, I just wondered if they had anything about this shooting. And they said, well, sure, we actually do. So I went, and I went to the archives and held these bullets in the palm of my hand. And it just - it really sort of forced me into this period of thinking about how those lives, the - both my great-grandfather's life and the people who had shot him, how they had encountered one another and the course of their lives after that. And I - it was just kind of rattling around in my mind for years. And I always wondered what it might tell me. GROSS: Yeah. So you researched the story of the young man who shot your father, and then you tracked down his granddaughter, who didn't know about this story because when this young man, at an older age, got out of prison, he changed his life. He changed his identity. He changed his name. So she didn't know about this part of his past. Was it a hard decision for you to tell her? Like, did you know when you approached her that she didn't know? OSNOS: No, actually. I assumed that the family did know. I guess I'd sort of always imagined that this was something that they might have heard about. And I was calling actually because I thought maybe I would learn something about his life. And to the family's credit, they were incredibly generous about wanting to learn about this thing that had happened in the past. There was just this extraordinary event where he had gone off to prison and had come out and had gone to prison again and had come out. And then at a certain point, it just changed his life - changed his name and started over again and had become a successful person and - that started a family and had a job and had a life and was able - partly because this was the era before the internet, he could just close the door on what had happened before. And look. The blunt fact is that the - he was a white man who was coming of age in the post-war years and was able to make a life for himself. He was - there were advantages that he could have. And I think there was a way in which I came to want to understand how his life was juxtaposed against people coming out of prison today and the failures, in many ways, that we have as a society in creating the possibility for redemption that - it's so difficult. Some of the people I write about in the book - in particular, Maurice Clark - they come out of prison, and they don't have the luxury of being able to start over again. They can't disappear. The internet doesn't allow it. And the law, in many cases, is stacked against them. And so I wanted to understand how that had changed because sometimes we assume that things have always been broken. And part of this whole project was for me to say, no, no, things have been flawed, certainly. But if we don't identify specific points along the way - policy choices, cultural choices that we made that actually have disadvantaged people - well, then we're actually not really in the position to be able to fix them. And so we have to find those points. GROSS: So one more question - you had written after January 6 that democracy in America had come closer to failure than many Americans ever imagined. Now that Robert Costa and Bob Woodward of The Washington Post report in their new book that Vice President Mike Pence spoke with former Vice President Dan Quayle to ask Quayle whether there was any way of stopping certification of the presidential election, do you feel like you didn't realize how close democracy came to failing in the U.S.? OSNOS: Absolutely. You know, there was this realization that I had after January 6 that there was these really slender moments that saved the democracy - something as fragile as the secretary of state of Georgia refusing to give in to Donald Trump's bullying - that things as almost ludicrously fragile as those individual decisions - the people who refused to stop counting votes even though there were protesters outside threatening them - that - and then now we know, of course, that it was also Mike Pence's conversation with Dan Quayle that might have persuaded him from not subverting the results of the election. You know, if anything, what that showed me was that this process that I've been describing in my book was even more acute than I realized, which was that the political reality we inhabit now - the fragility of it, the moments of fury and instability - are the result of choices that we make as people, as individuals, not only some of the people who find themselves at that moment of the highest possible stakes, but the decisions we make in our own lives about how we behave as consumers and buyers, as managers, as citizens - who we vote for. These things have just grave stakes. And if there was one thing I had hoped to try to understand was how our individual choices end up contributing to the systems that define our lives. And I think this this election turned out to be a somewhat terrifying but I hope illuminating example of that. GROSS: Evan Osnos, it is always such a pleasure to have you on our show. Thank you so much. OSNOS: Thank you so much, Terry.

She says the Trump administration ignored the threat \u2014 and fanned the flames \u2014 of violent domestic extremism.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The increasing threat of domestic terrorism from right-wing extremists was something my guest, Elizabeth Neumann, warned the Trump White House about when she served as the assistant secretary of homeland security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. Trump not only ignored the threat, she says, he added fuel to the fire of extremism. So she quit in April 2020. Before the 2020 election, she wrote about why she thought Trump was so dangerous for our country. Lately, she's been writing articles and op-eds about domestic terrorism, the storming of the Capitol and what it means for the future of our national security. She sees a connection between many people on the far right and Christian nationalism, which teaches that America is not only a Christian nation, it's God's chosen nation. As a Christian, she finds this very disturbing. Elizabeth Neumann has more than 20 years' experience in homeland security, dating back to when she served on George W. Bush's Homeland Security Council. She initially joined Trump's Department of Homeland Security in 2017 as then Secretary John Kelly's deputy chief of staff. She's now co-director of the Republican Accountability Project, which was founded to push back against the lies and conspiracy theories about voter fraud and claims that the 2020 election was rigged, and to hold accountable elected leaders who have supported those claims and tried to overturn a legitimate election. Elizabeth Neumann, welcome to FRESH AIR. I want to start with the January 6 insurrection. In a lot of ways, it did not succeed. It didn't succeed in overturning the election. It didn't return Donald Trump to the presidency. Over 300 people have been charged by the Justice Department. Some of the Q followers were disillusioned that the prophecy about Trump remaining president didn't come true. So in that sense, the insurrection was a failure. Are there ways in which it was a success for the far right? ELIZABETH NEUMANN: Thanks for having me, Terry. And unfortunately, yes, it was viewed as a success for white supremacists, for anti-government extremists and, quite frankly, probably, many of our enemies overseas. They saw it as a success in that we have such societal discord that we can't seem to find, even post-January 6, the ability to come together on a basic thing like a commission to study domestic terrorism in our country and what happened on January 6. So we are very fractured as a nation at this point, very polarized. And that plays into our enemies' hands. So while the guard rails held up and the presidential transition happened on January 20, there is damage to our democracy that persists today, including the fact that you see so many Republicans at the state level and at the national level spending so much time and energy on voter suppression, because a sizable portion of the Republican Party, the Republican voters, believe that the election was stolen from them. That is not healthy. We are in a very precarious place in our country. GROSS: Are there ways that January 6 empowered the right-wing groups, the hate groups, the white supremacist groups, the militias? NEUMANN: Yes. In particular, if you look at white supremacists, they have this ideology behind them. And not every white supremacist holds to this. But going back 40, 50 years to the '80s when the white supremacist movement kind of consolidated and came to the conclusion that they were no longer going to be able to establish or achieve their aims through the government, they realized that they needed to make the government their enemy. And they basically declared war on the government and stated that their aim was to overthrow the U.S. government, to establish a white nation. So when you see the Capitol being attacked, which is this symbol of our seat of government, it has this rallying effect for a white supremacist who holds to this ideology that, eventually, there's going to be this massive war. And the U.S. government's going to be overthrown. And they're going to be able to establish this white nation. So it's not like they destroyed the Capitol. It's not like they disrupted the transition of power. But it was seen as kind of almost the starting point, perhaps, of the civil war that they have believed in their mythology was going to come at some point, a race war. And so you see on online chat rooms that you have groups using this as a recruitment tactic, that it's finally happening, if - you know, there's going to be this race war, that we're finally going to be able to achieve our aim of ridding the country of all of these people we don't think should be here, establishing our own country. And any time you have, for an extremist group or a terrorist group, something that symbolic, it affects and helps them with their recruitment, with their morale. So these - certainly, on the white supremacist side, we see an emboldening effect for those groups. GROSS: Which of the groups want to see a race war and want to see, like, a civil war that leads to a white nation? NEUMANN: So that particular strain is going to be in your white supremacist group, so neo-Nazis and other groups that borrow their mythology largely from Germany and Nordic countries. What you also see, though, is there's this other movement called the boogaloo boys. You may have heard of them as well. They also believe in a coming civil war. They also subscribe to an ideology of accelerationism, which a white supremacist might also ascribe to. That concept is that we are going to commit certain acts to accelerate societal collapse, to encourage the oncoming of a civil war. So it's not just a belief that someday there will be a civil war, as if you're being prophetic and you have awareness of something happening in the future. The accelerationism is it is my job to help bring it about. So boogaloo boy believes in civil war. And it may also have a white supremacist viewpoint, might believe it's a race war, but not necessarily. There are a lot of boogaloo boys who just believe that there's a coming civil war and it has nothing to do, at least at a witting level, with race. So the - (laughter) one of the hard things in studying extremism, especially today, is that increasingly, we have these groups kind of morphing. An individual may have multiple ideologies that they have cobbled together to form almost their own version of an ideology. And so you might easily have a white supremacist who is also a boogaloo boy. You also see that the melding between the white supremacist groups and the anti-government extremist groups, there tends to be a lot of overlap there. But you could find somebody easily - you could find a militia or a member of a militia who hates racism, who hates white supremacy. They are just about the right to bear arms and be able to exercise protection for their neighborhood through a militia. So it's really hard to categorize with broad brush strokes. And part of the reason that, perhaps, we haven't been able to take domestic terrorism as seriously as we should have is because of that decentralized lack of organization to many of these groups. I mean, you often see infighting between supposed leaders of these groups. And it can give this false sense that they don't have their act together, they're not actually that dangerous because they're always fighting with one another. And they can't even agree on the issues that they stand for. GROSS: Well, did January 6 and the insurrection have the effect of bringing these groups together and creating a previously un-existing alliance? NEUMANN: Definitely did. In fact, that's one of the biggest concerns that we had is (laughter) you had groups that maybe wouldn't have interconnected before, have an in-person, in-real-life experience, which during a pandemic is kind of rare to begin with, where they're meeting people. So that networking effect can be very powerful. Not only did they meet in person, they're having an experience that for them it had a lot of adrenaline, a lot of euphoria. It bonds you. It's like being in the foxhole together in war. It bonds you in a way that just meeting on the street would not bond you. So there is a concern then on the other side of January 6, you have groups interconnected in a way that they weren't before. We heard in the news on Wednesday that prosecutors have found interconnection between Oath Keepers and Proud Boys and Three Percenters. I think we're going to see more of this to come as the investigation unfurls. But the knowledge that they had been coordinating in the weeks up to January 6 is rather significant. These are not groups that necessarily share the same ideology. They shared a common purpose clearly and showing up on January six. And what has been revealed so far is basically coordination to be able to attack what they expected to be antifa showing up on January six. It'll be interesting to see if there's any more coordination specific to the capital, though, in the messaging traffic that was released, they were talking about an insurrection. So there clearly was this understanding in the weeks prior to January 6 that something that they labeled an insurrection was going to happen on January 6 and that they needed to coordinate to be able - to achieve that common purpose. That is rather concerning in that heretofore most of these groups kind of kept to themselves. And so, again, it's - something about January 6 definitely shifted the makeup and the threat that we were facing. It used to be small groups. And we were predominantly worried about the white supremacist groups because historically they have been the most lethal in their violence. But the other major problem with January 6 is so far of those indicted about, 85 to 90% - the numbers will change depending on, you know, who gets indicted next - but it's somewhere in that 85 to 90% of the individuals indicted are unaffiliated. That means they're not Proud Boys. They're not neo-Nazis. They're not Oath Keepers. They are just people that are passionate about Donald Trump. They are MAGA. To have that many unaffiliated people doing what happened on January 6 - and clearly, they were led by people that were more coordinated, more organized - they crossed into acts of terrorism by what they did to the Capitol on January 6. That's really concerning to most extremist researchers because it demonstrates we're kind of in a very different threat environment. It's not just these organized groups. It's that we have mass violence justified for political purposes. It's rather stunning, actually, the more the data comes out about who actually crossed the threshold into the Capitol. GROSS: Are you saying that when Trump was president, he was able to accomplish the kinds of things that these disparate groups, the Proud Boys, the white supremacist groups, the Three Percenters, all the accelerationists (ph), what they were not able to accomplish? NEUMANN: That's a great way to frame it. Yes. You know, if you're a Boogaloo boy or you're a white supremacist, your aim is for the U.S. government to collapse so you can establish kind of your own form of government. If you're in a very extreme anti-government militia type, you think that the U.S. government has basically violated its constitutional duties and needs to be scrapped and started over. So in a way, yes, you have, in Trump, kind of radicalized some portion of his followers, not all. But some portion of his followers have been radicalized to the point where they believe they are justified in using violence to overthrow the U.S. government. GROSS: Let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Neumann. She served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was fueling extremism instead of fighting it. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview about the growing threat of domestic terrorism with Elizabeth Neumann. She's worked in Homeland Security ever since 9/11. She served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was actually fueling extremism. If what you're saying is true, that Trump himself inspired a lot of the insurrectionists on January 6, do you think that he should be held legally accountable for that? And would there be any way of doing it? NEUMANN: I do believe he should be held legally accountable. I don't know. I'm not a lawyer by background, so I'm following the investigations closely, hoping that they might discover connections. But I'm guessing that the people around the president were careful to keep the president himself out of whatever they were planning on January 6. But I suspect we're likely to see some connection points between those groups that I just referenced - the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers. That coordination that was happening in the weeks leading up to January 6, I find it really hard to believe that there wasn't also connection points with people around the president. So I think it's important for us to find out and understand how coordinated this really was. I have - I still have very - I'm very concerned and very - I think there are a lot of outstanding questions about why it took so long for the National Guard to respond. I really don't want the story to be that our government was actually - that there were political appointees actually, you know, looking to see if the president could declare martial law if things got out of hand enough. I really don't want that to be the answer. But, you know, there's something that is just off about the timeline and the delays. And we need that question answered. And if, in fact, there was a nefariousness to it, not just a bad judgment call, those individuals need to be prosecuted and held accountable. Does all of that reach to the president? I think that's a tougher burden. But it does sound like from some of the stories that we're hearing from both former prosecutors as well as people that know this area of the law, there's at least a case to be made about incitement to violence or about obstructing the peaceful transfer of power. So seeing that the president lied to his followers for weeks and that by doing so deceived people to the point of believing that it was well within their rights and in some cases their duty to violently attempt to overthrow the election, we really need the truth to come out so that we can start to rebuild and lift that deceit from those that are still believing in it. GROSS: So some of the people who stormed the Capitol were members of the Oath Keepers or the Three Percenters which recruit from the military and from the police. And some of the people I'm referring to here were former members of the military or the police. And I'm wondering how much that concerns you if you see, for instance, the military as a training ground, not only for protecting the country, but also for the people who are accelerationists and want to start a civil war here. NEUMANN: I mean, certainly it's very concerning that we have former military, maybe even current military or current National Guard participating in any extremist group, especially extremist groups that are violent in nature. It's important to understand, though, the way that militias recruit. It's not necessarily obvious that what they're recruiting to is illegal. There's a big misunderstanding in our public about what a militia is. Militias are referenced in the Second Amendment, so there's this belief that it's legal, that it's constitutionally-protected activity. Turns out that's not the case. A hundred years ago, the militia turned into the National Guard. So if you want to participate in a Second Amendment-protected militia, you go join the National Guard. But that is not widely understood. And it's often manipulated by the militia. And consequently, when you're recruiting somebody that might be in the military, a member of the National Guard or former military and law enforcement, it's often framed as we get together, we run drills, and we're just there in case the governor needs us, in case we have a bad day, a natural disaster, war hits. We're there to protect our community. Well, hey, that sounds like a good deal. And if you're former military, former law enforcement, hey, that's what you signed up for when you joined those forces is to protect your community. So it on its face sounds like a good thing as compared to some of the other extremist groups that have as their ideology this idea of hatred towards somebody. A militia often is not about hate. It's about protection. The problem is that, one, they're outlawed in all 50 states. You cannot be a part of a private militia and conduct law enforcement activity. It is outlawed. Two, some of these groups over time kind of take on pretty extreme viewpoints that are anti-government in nature. It's not just about protecting. It's about pushing back against the authorities. And that's very much what we saw on January 6. You saw organizations that believe that the federal government had superseded its constitutional powers, that the government was trying to steal the election from Donald Trump. And they felt like it was time for revolution, time to go back to the basics of - you heard them screaming 1776 through the hallways. It is very much, they believe, about protecting their rights, protecting the Constitution. But that led to violence on January 6. And we sadly have a history in this country of anti-government extremists conducting some very violent acts. Probably the most notable was Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing. GROSS: And let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Neumann. She served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was fueling extremism instead of fighting it. We'll be right back after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Elizabeth Neumann about the growing threat of domestic terrorism. She served as assistant secretary of homeland security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was not only ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism, he was fueling it. She's now co-director of the Republican Accountability Project, which was founded to push back against the lies and conspiracy theories about voter fraud and claims that the 2020 election was rigged, and to hold accountable elected leaders who have supported those claims and tried to overturn a legitimate election. During your years working in Homeland Security, was there a turning point for you when you realized that these far-right extremist groups, including white supremacist groups, including groups that want to create a civil war, that they were more than just kind of background fringe, that they posed a serious threat to our national security? NEUMANN: I think that there are two moments that stand out to me. The first was in August of 2017 when we had Charlottesville, the protests that turned violent. And people were killed. It wasn't so much that we had a protest - counterprotest death. That - I mean, it's horrible. But that has happened before. It was that you had people so unabashedly walking about, carrying their tiki torches and saying these horribly racist things. That was very shocking to many of us at DHS. I think we all knew that racists exist in our country. I don't think we realized that they felt so comfortable that their face was associated with this. That they wanted to wear it, that it was their identity, that was rather stunning. So that moment certainly raised a lot of questions. We turn to our analysts in the intelligence community. What is happening? What does this mean? And sadly, we could - probably an answer to a different question. But we did not get good information from the intelligence community. I learned later that the best data was, actually, outside of the government from nonprofit organizations and researchers. So on the inside, we were not getting a good understanding of the trend lines, of the fact that hate crimes had increased, the fact that the president's rhetoric was increasingly being tied to hate crimes in court documents. And so it wasn't really until we get to October 2018 and we had another shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh - the Tree of Life shooting - that we started to realize that this problem was metastasizing. And not very long after that, you had Christchurch. And at that point, the counterterrorism community's eyes are very wide. And, oh, my goodness, this thing is global. We have been talking to our counterparts overseas. And they kept referring to things like the rise of right-wing violent extremism, the rise of nationalism, the rise of fascism. But we weren't quite understanding, I think, until Christchurch, how dangerous this - these conversations that had largely happened online - although, there was some travel between U.S.-based groups and other parts of the globe. Most of what was happening, most of what was metastasizing was online. And the U.S. was the exporter of this sick ideology. And so it was a recognition that we have this new threat. And we are not going to be able to stop it. GROSS: When you're talking about Christchurch, you're talking about the massacre at a mosque in New Zealand. NEUMANN: Several mosques. GROSS: So I want to ask you about when you were assistant secretary of homeland security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. Did you talk to Trump directly about the threat of domestic extremism? NEUMANN: I did not. But I am aware that several of my secretaries did. And I say several. We had five during my tenure there. GROSS: But you knew that Trump didn't want to use the word domestic terrorism. And - because you've written about how he stood in the way of the department talking about the threat of domestic terrorism. What was his problem with that? NEUMANN: This was shortly after the attacks in El Paso. This is August 2019. And we had already been working on some prevention capabilities that we were trying to convince Congress to fund. We were in the process of writing a strategy around how we were going to strengthen our prevention efforts and then briefing members of the president's senior staff. These are people that do brief him directly. They made it clear that the work that they were doing, especially after El Paso, was about violence prevention. And that's certainly an important lens through which to view the problem set. But it was interesting because I, of course, coming from the counterterrorism community, would - was explaining we also need to look at it through the terrorism lens, because what is being done is in the - meets that definition. And the national security community always defines the threat before we develop a strategy to counteract it. And I was told pretty directly, we cannot use that term. You guys can use that term, which was good because my secretary at the time, Kevin McAleenan, was very clear that we would be talking about domestic terrorism and calling it what it was. But it was clear to me - and, of course, at this point, it's three years into the administration. You learn how to read the cues. And working with Trump, he had trigger words. He had things that it just was not worth the time and the energy to try to bring up to him. Russia was one of those things. And apparently, domestic terrorism was one of those things. Not exactly clear why they were trigger words. I still don't know that we know the full story about him in Russia. But certainly, he would go off on tangents any time those things were referenced. And so it just wasn't worth bringing them up. And the senior staff and the cabinet members learned how to work around that and avoid those issues for the sake of trying to get something done. And that was the nature of the conversation in September 2019 that I was having with these White House officials. It was, we want to support you. We are trying to make sure that you get the funding that you need to be able to do this important work. Just so you know, we can't call it domestic terrorism. And I responded back, I understand. Just so you know, we will be calling it domestic terrorism. And it was kind of left at that. GROSS: Trump demonized so many groups when he announced his campaign. He demonized Mexicans. One of his first actions was the Muslim travel ban. The pandemic - it's the China virus. And suddenly, there's attacks against Asian Americans. He's accused of sexually harassing and assaulting women. He certainly insulted women. He said things that were insulting to Jews. And I'm wondering, following, like, spikes in activity when Trump would do any of these things that I just mentioned, could you see that? Could you see spikes in organizing activity in online comments? Like, how could you tell the impact that that was having? What impact do you think it had? NEUMANN: On the inside, when we were - when I was at DHS, we were not able to track that type of information - several reasons for that. But what is interesting, though, is over time you've had a number of researchers, news organizations dig into, you know, is there a cause and effect here? And since being out of government, I've had more time to read some of those studies. And it is quite remarkable. It is not even just a political assertion or commentary to - it's been so researched that I feel very confident, saying there is a direct connection between the words that he uses and the hate crime that we see shortly thereafter. A number of studies that have been done on this, but one in particular that I recall, they studied when he would tweet or give a speech in an area. And he would talk about Muslims, usually in a derogatory way. They were able to hold for, like, what the normal amount of hate crime or activity in a particular area would be and show the spike when the president had tweeted or when he might be in the area giving a rally-type speech. They could show the increase in the hate crime or the increase in the hate-filled language on social media. There was another news organization that looked through court records during the Trump presidency and found - and this was only 2 1/2 years into his presidency - they found over 50 cases of individuals being prosecuted for hate crimes that cited the president as the reason why they felt that they were justified in doing whatever they did. GROSS: It's clear from what you're saying that you think when Trump was president, he activated a lot of hatred. He activated a lot of people to take action on their hatred, either - whether it was a death threat or storming the Capitol. And also, I think you've pointed out that although Trump can turn this on, there's no indication he can turn it off. And so what are the implications of that for our future? NEUMANN: I think you said that so well. He's activated something that existed before he was here. We have to recognize that it was created through political and cultural means, and we need politics and culture to help fix it. So we need elected officials, especially on the Republican side, those who maybe even participated initially in supporting Donald Trump in the arguments that the election was stolen. We need people like that to come out and say the election wasn't stolen. You do that, and it shrinks a sizable portion of people we have to be concerned about. Now, that does not take care of the violent extremists out there. And it doesn't take care of, you know, other ideologies that might not have been so tied to Trump. But right now, you have this confluence of violent extremist organizations that, you know, have been emboldened by him, new groups that have kind of sprung up around him like the Proud Boys and then this big lie that many in the country believe is true, and it's just too much. So we need to shrink the pool of vulnerable individuals that might mobilize to violence. And that's part of the reason why I joined the Republican Accountability Project because this is inherently being fueled by politics. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Neumann. And she served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was fueling extremism instead of fighting it. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview about the growing threat of domestic terrorism with Elizabeth Neumann. She's worked in Homeland Security ever since 9/11. She served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit in April 2020 because of her concerns that Trump was actually fueling extremism. When you quit the Trump administration in 2020 and left your job in Homeland Security, what was the turning point for you where you decided you couldn't stay anymore? Was there a specific turning point? NEUMANN: You know, it was probably most directly El Paso, coming out of that. And, you know - when you're outside, it's very easy to see the evil. When you're in the middle of it, you're constantly pushing back against it. And it's so exhausting. You're just trying to get through each day. So the El Paso moment was the moment when he could have said, oh, my goodness, my words ended up in a terrorist manifesto. If you recall, the shooter talked about needing to stop the Hispanic invasion. Those were words straight out of Donald Trump's campaign. They had been used on thousands of Facebook campaign ads just that year alone. And he had spoken them personally. It ends up in a terrorist manifesto. And the proper response is, oh, my gosh, that's not what I meant. I never meant for somebody to kill somebody over this. Like, I've learned my lesson. He could say it in his own Trumpy way, but he could have said, I've learned my lesson. This is not who we are as a people. We respect one another. And I would have been willing to offer him grace that he genuinely didn't understand that his words were having this kind of impact. He did not choose to do that. In fact, he followed the normal pattern that he usually does, which is he kind of brushes aside any sort of question associated with, hey, do you realize your remarks are in a terrorist manifesto? He feels attacked. He attacks back. Then he reads some script that his staff wrote him that sounds conciliatory. And then a day or two later, he reverts back to his attacking style. I don't know if that's because in his heart he is racist. I think that's something between - that only he and God know. But I do think that he has exhibited that his ego prevents him from acknowledging wrong, from acknowledging that he's human and makes mistakes. And that is very dangerous for us to have in any form of leadership. So that was probably the moment that I realized he not only is ignoring the problem that Secretary Nielsen had raised multiple times to the White House, that my colleagues and I were trying to get the White House to act on. But he was actually making the problem worse. He was creating the problem for us. He was, as you have shared, pouring fuel on the fire of it. And so that was kind of that really remarkable moment for me of it's time for me to leave. It took a while for me to put things in place to step out, but it was definitely kind of the shifting point for me that I needed to move out. GROSS: What about the policy of immigration on the southern border with Mexico, of separating children from their parents and children ending up basically in cages? And many of those children have never been reunited with their parents because no one can find their parents. And that's in part because no one was really keeping track. There wasn't enough paperwork that was done. I don't know whether that part of policy came under your purview. But, you know, how did you deal with that aspect? NEUMANN: Yeah. Those were dark days. It did not fall under my purview - other people that dealt with immigration issues. When I heard about it, I was sick to my stomach. I attempted to try to - the best I could, are you - why this was the wrong approach. It was kind of explained to me that we at DHS had not actually made the decision, that it was a decision made at DOJ. And we were kind of caught flat-footed because we didn't know the decision was coming down. And everybody was scrambling to try to figure out how to handle it. I do know that you had career and political officials under tremendous pressure to get immigration numbers down. And some of the career officials really felt like the only way to get the numbers down was to do something drastic as a deterrence measure. And they - that's how they get to the place where they think family separation would send that signal. I was very grateful that the strong outpouring of anger by the American public kind of forced the president to change tracks on that pretty quickly. It was a - it is a stain on our country, and it's going to be with us for some time. GROSS: So, you know, we've talked about domestic terrorism. You served in Homeland Security in the George W. Bush administration and in the Trump administration. You're no longer in government. You've been writing. You've been speaking out against Republicans who support the stop the steal point of view. But what do you see for yourself in the future? NEUMANN: That's a great question. A year ago, this is not what I thought I'd be doing. I certainly have enjoyed spending more time with my kids and getting involved in our local community. And I hope I get to continue to do those things. I don't know what the future holds. I know that I feel called to try to persuade the community from which I came, the Christian community, the conservative community, that there is a path that is not governed by fear, that there is a path where we can lead with principles and with love that still embraces some of the things that you think that you hold dear but have been co-opted by people like Trump and others around him for their own purposes, for power and for evil. So right now, I know that I'm searching for how to best communicate and encourage that change. There's opportunity and maybe responsibility to try to encourage evangelicals that our faith is so much bigger than any problem that you perceive in this moment. And if we follow what Jesus taught us, it is much more about loving one another, serving one another, as opposed to being obsessed with having power and getting things your own way. GROSS: Elizabeth Neumann, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. NEUMANN: Thank you so much for having me, Terry. GROSS: Elizabeth Neumann served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security for counterterrorism and threat reduction in the Trump administration. She quit last April and is now the co-director of the Republican Accountability Project, which is pushing back on political conspiracy theories and trying to hold accountable elected leaders who've supported those theories.

            "article_content": "Some of the extremists who assaulted the U.S. Capitol are Christian nationalists. They believe they are on a divine mission to challenge government institutions in the name of God.  NOEL KING, HOST: Parts of Washington, D.C.'s center are blocked off by the National Guard today, owing to concern about people or groups that might try to disrupt Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday. Some of them are Christians who support President Trump and believe they have a God-given mission to continue fighting on his behalf. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Some of President Trump's most passionate advocates are Christians who fear their freedom will be in jeopardy under a Biden administration. Their militancy was evident weeks before the January 6 assault on the Capitol. In a podcast last month, Eric Metaxas, a conservative Christian writer and radio host, made a case for Christians waging a war to overturn the presidential election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC METAXAS: What's going to happen is going to happen. But we need to fight to the death, to the last drop of blood because it's worth it. GJELTEN: That was on December 9. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) U-S-A, U-S-A... GJELTEN: Three days later, Metaxas was the emcee at a prayer rally in Washington, where he and others implored God to help them keep Donald Trump in office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) METAXAS: We are here today to cry out to the God of heaven to ask him to have mercy on the greatest nation in the history of the world. GJELTEN: It was one of the rallies held around the country to protest what Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, was a stolen election. The rally organizer said God appeared to him in a vision and told him it's not over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Stop the steal. Stop the steal. GJELTEN: Between prayers offered from the stage, Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oathkeepers militia group, told the crowd he wanted Trump to drop the hammer on his opponents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEWART RHODES: If he does not do it now, we're going to have to do it ourselves later in a much more desperate, much more bloody war. GJELTEN: Among the flags at the rally was a big yellow banner that said Jesus saves. That banner was seen again weeks later in the crowd that assaulted the U.S. Capitol. This Christian militancy is rooted in a belief that America is fundamentally a Christian nation. KRISTIN DU MEZ: The idea that America is representative of God's truth... GJELTEN: Kristin du Mez is a historian who has written about Christian nationalism. DU MEZ: And for that reason, Christian America needs to be defended. And because the stakes are so high, that often will require violence, violence for the sake of righteousness. GJELTEN: Political extremism comes in many forms. But Andrew Whitehead, another expert on Christian nationalism, says extremism on behalf of Donald Trump may be especially potent when it's rooted in deep Christian convictions. ANDREW WHITEHEAD: Religion is such a strongly and closely held system of beliefs and values. And so if God has said this is the way I want this nation to run and to look and this is the person that I want leading it, why would you brook any opposition, no matter what? GJELTEN: Since the violence at the Capitol, Christian militants have generally kept a low profile, but not all have been chastened. Three days after that January 6 assault, Pastor Darryl Knappen of Cornerstone Church in Alexandria, Minn. posted this message for his congregation on Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DARRYL KNAPPEN: There is a need in every one of our localities to have individuals, patriots who are ready to arm up and be part of a citizen militia to protect our freedoms. GJELTEN: He spoke from the church sanctuary, standing in front of a cross. The violence this month at the Capitol showed how political extremism can be dangerous in America, including when it's motivated by religion. Tom Gjelten, NPR News.

They've called it an assault on democracy, and urged a peaceful transfer of power.  NOEL KING, HOST: What does the rest of the world think about what happened at the U.S. Capitol yesterday? Some world leaders issued statements using words that you don't often hear applied to ostensibly stable, free countries. They called it an assault on democracy. They urged a peaceful transfer of power. With me now to talk about how the world sees these events, NPR correspondents Rob Schmitz in Berlin, Emily Feng in Beijing and Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Good morning and hello to you all. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: Rob, let's start in Europe. Over the past four years, the U.S. has tested the patience of some of its closest allies there. What are Europeans saying? SCHMITZ: Well, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called yesterday's scene a disgrace, urging for a peaceful transfer of power, though he was blasted by opponents for not doing enough to call out President Trump's lies after the election. Here in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel reminded people, in a democracy, winners and losers have to play their parts with decency so that democracy remains secure. But she did say that it was a sign of hope that Congress worked through the evening to confirm the victory of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. KING: Germany is a democracy that is, to some extent, modeled on the U.S. It was shaped by U.S. lawyers after World War II. Does this have specific resonance there? SCHMITZ: Well, yes and no. You know, Germany has battled populism and nationalism throughout its history. And it's part of how it became a democracy again after World War II. But that battle is still being waged today. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier reminded Germans this morning that just this past August, right-wing opponents of democracy attempted to storm the Reichstag building here in Berlin, Germany's parliament, as part of a larger demonstration against coronavirus prevention measures. So while Germans may be shocked by what's happening in the U.S., they're not strangers to it. KING: Emily Feng, in Beijing, you've been watching reaction from around Asia. What are you seeing and hearing from the U.S.'s democratic allies in that region? FENG: The same kind of alarm that you're seeing in Europe. Japan's chief cabinet secretary said that they were watching the situation in Washington with concern. And they hope that the situation would resolve itself soon. And, well, not in Asia, but in the Asia Pacific region, Australia and New Zealand also offered swift condemnation. And New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she was actually devastated personally by the clashes. But noticeably absent in all of this were comments from Chinese leadership, from Xi Jinping, the president, or its premier. They normally do not comment on these sorts of things. But there was very little reaction out of China. KING: Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a right-wing nationalist leader who's close to President Trump. How are Israelis taking this in? ESTRIN: There was a lot of shock here. But Prime Minister Netanyahu said the rampage at the Capitol was disgraceful. He said lawlessness and violence are not values that Americans and Israelis cherish. But he did not hold Trump responsible at all, which some world leaders have. And then there are some parallels in Israel. There are upcoming elections here. Netanyahu is trying to cling to power. He's on trial for corruption. He calls that a deep state conspiracy. He refuses to step down. And anti-Netanyahu protesters have been staging these very loud protests outside his residence every week calling for him to step down. So there are parallels to the U.S. And Netanyahu's opponents see what's happened in the U.S. They're concerned about Israel. But Netanyahu's supporters are defending Trump. They're saying Trump was silenced by social media, betrayed by Pence. And they are saying Netanyahu could face a similar fate. KING: Daniel, I would imagine, having worked in the Middle East for some years myself, that people in the Arab world certainly have thoughts about what happened. ESTRIN: Oh, yes. On Arab social media, there's a lot of satire about America, the bastion of democracy, which suddenly resembles dictatorships in the Middle East. I've seen a meme of Trump in a traditional Arab headdress looking like an Arab dictator, a satirical meme of a Palestinian travel advisory against visiting the U.S. because it's too dangerous... KING: Oh, dear. ESTRIN: ...You know, mocking those U.S. travel advisories on visiting the Mideast. But regimes criticized by the U.S. are just relishing this moment. In Iran, the president, Hassan Rouhani, said events at the Capitol show that Western democracy is fragile. Turkish officials are ironically calling on parties in the U.S. to respect the law. In Syria, they're accusing America of hypocrisy. KING: Irony abounds, yeah. Emily, in Beijing, you said that China hasn't said much. China is a major competitor of the United States. Why not take this opportunity to shoot us one? FENG: Because the pictures speak for themselves. Videos, pictures from the break-in on Capitol Hill are going viral on Chinese social media, and many are being shared by state media accounts as well. And they focused on a number of the themes that Daniel brings up in the Mideast. They focus on what they perceive as American hypocrisy. In particular, they focus on an incident in July 2019, where protesters in Hong Kong broke into the region's legislative building after hours. And that break-in Beijing is now comparing to the Capitol Hill break-in. Here is China's foreign ministry spokesperson today speaking about this comparison at a press briefing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HUA CHUNYING: (Non-English language spoken). FENG: She's speaking about how violent protesters stormed Hong Kong's legislature, vandalized the building. But mainstream media in the U.S. condemned that breach, calling the incident - or, sorry, condemned the Capitol Hill breach, calling that incident violent, but then called the Hong Kong break-in a beautiful sight to behold. And what she's talking about is the fact that Nancy Pelosi called a separate, peaceful march in Hong Kong a beautiful sight. She did not condone that legislative break-in. But Chinese state media here are having a field day falsely linking the two. KING: Important to note that in Hong Kong, they are pro-democracy protesters, unlike these folks in Washington yesterday. Rob, last question to you. You've been doing some great reporting on right-wing movements in Europe. Are European leaders looking at the situation yesterday and thinking, we really need to get ourselves under control here? SCHMITZ: Yeah. Yeah. Here in Germany, the government is now considering putting its entire far-right party, Alternative fur Deutschland, which has dozens of members in parliament, under surveillance. Some members are already being monitored by the state. And that's because its members espouse racist views. And they've incited hatred and violence, which is a serious crime in Germany due to its Nazi past. And that decision is expected later this month. KING: NPR's Rob Schmitz in Berlin, Emily Feng in Beijing and Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks to you all for your reporting. SCHMITZ: Thank you. FENG: Thank you. ESTRIN: Thank you.

Gun sales increased in the U.S, following COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A clerk shows a customer an AR-15 style rifle at a gun show in Costa Mesa, Calif. in June 2021. Gun sales increased in the U.S, following COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Author Ryan Busse jokes that he was born with \"a shotgun in one hand and a rifle in the other.\" It's a shorthand he uses to explain the significant role that guns played in his childhood in western Kansas. \"I grew up hunting and shooting with my father. Guns were things we used on the ranch and farm,\" he says. \"The few times that we got to spend together doing something fun and enjoyable, oftentimes it was with a gun. ... [Guns] are things that became very culturally important to us.\" After college, Busse went to work for the firearms manufacturer Kimber America, where he was so good at marketing the weapons that he became a rising star of the industry. But over the years, he became disillusioned when he saw the NRA refuse to consider gun controls after mass shootings. \"After Columbine, [the NRA] stumbled upon this idea that fear and conspiracy and hatred of the other could be used to drive and win political races,\" he says. \"And, accidentally, those are exactly the same things that in high doses drove unhealthy portions of firearm sales.\" Busse notes that when he first started out, weapons manufacturers refused to market high-powered automatic weapons to the public. But, he says, the gun makers and the NRA have since embraced military-style weapons and tactical gear, branding them as symbols of masculinity and patriotism. This is when, he says, \"the frightening vigilante activity that we have seen with Kyle Rittenhouse or the various other incidents across the country really got its start.\" (Rittenhouse was tried and acquitted of all charges related to the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during protests in Kenosha, Wis., in 2020.) Busse eventually left the gun industry. In 2020, he accepted a position as an adviser to Joe Biden's presidential campaign, and in 2021 he was hired as a senior advisor to the gun violence prevention group Giffords. He says he still owns and uses guns, and he believes in Americans' right to do the same. But, he says, \"I also know that every right that we enjoy has to be balanced with the appropriate amount of responsibility. And I believe that over time ... that has gotten badly out of whack.\" Busse has written a new book called Gunfight: My Battle Against the Industry that Radicalized America. On what changed the way he viewed the gun industry When Sandy Hook happened, our boys were almost exactly that same age. It was just horrific to think about it, and so I became more disillusioned and more troubled, and it just became this sort of perilous existence. It was much tougher. And I couldn't hold my tongue. That knife edge was tougher to walk on. ... I did my best to try to change the things I can change. Something I didn't see coming, perhaps, was the degree to which the industry grew and changed into this behemoth. I didn't see the unbelievably huge ballooning of guns and the gun industry's importance in politics. When I started, really, it was very much like a small cottage industry. Everybody knew everybody. The companies were pretty small, but much like many other facets of America, it grew into something so large that I was deluding myself to think that I could have a measurable impact on something that had grown that large and powerful. On how the NRA identity and strategy changed It's often reported that the NRA is sort of a tool of firearms manufacturers. I found it to be exactly the opposite: The NRA ran the show. Ryan Busse My grandfather, who was a proud FDR Democrat, his favorite hat was the big black NRA gold-lettered hat. ... the NRA to him meant safety and camaraderie and responsibility. Then my father was an NRA member and up until the point where he disavowed his membership, we received the NRA magazines in our home. ... They were about interesting guns or shooting competitions or trapper leagues or things of that sort. Never about the impending doom of our republic or some conspiracy theory. ... It's often reported that the NRA is sort of a tool of firearms manufacturers. I found it to be exactly the opposite: The NRA ran the show. They set the course for the industry and everybody followed, and nobody questioned. On how the NRA and the industry reacted to the 1999 Columbine school massacre That was obviously the first large mass school shooting in our country. And as it so happened, it happened just south of Denver and the large NRA convention was set to happen in Denver just about 10 days later. And it sent a shock through the entire industry, and the NRA ended up canceling the largest portion of their convention that year, but they held the business meetings and there were large protests in Denver against the business meetings. The NRA ended up in what is now a rather infamous approach where they ended up doubling down instead of giving in. I believe the politics of never give an inch, never acknowledge any improvement or work towards any improving policy, really started then. Denver area residents gather the day after the April 20, 1999 shooting at Columbine High School.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Haynes/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Denver area residents gather the day after the April 20, 1999 shooting at Columbine High School. On the NRA's refusal to close the \"gun-show loophole\" after Columbine The gun-show loophole simply means that ... gun sales can happen without a federally mandated background check if they happen not through a federally licensed dealer. So an amateur gun trader, somebody who sells a few guns a year, can go to a gun show and sell a gun, literally, to whoever they want without a background check. And that probably should have been closed legislatively after Columbine, but the NRA decided to fight that despite the horror of that Columbine shooting. ... I believe two or three of the guns that were used in Columbine were purchased at a gun show just on the north end of Denver. And so it was really an opportune time to shut that loophole and still today, more than 20 years later, we have not shut that loophole. On two things that boost gun sales \u2014 shootings and Democrats getting elected Usually within hours after a mass shooting, then there would be discussions of potential legislative fixes and that sort of fear, which the NRA figured out how to tap into, could be used to both drive voters to the polls and ... it also drove gun sales like nobody ever imagined. So if you overlay gun sales over the last 20 years with mass shootings, soon after each mass shooting until just the last couple of years ... there would be incredible gun booms. The other thing that would drive gun sales is when any Democrat was elected, certainly elected as president, because again, the same fear was used that guns would be banned or that there would be legislative activity that would make it more difficult to get guns, so everybody would rush out and buy them after these events. Everything that happened was then spun in some fearful, conspiratorial, racial, just hate-filled way. Everything was spun that way, because every word that came out had to keep ... this sort of political pressure cooker. The way that the NRA figured out that it could succeed is to get the country just one step below boiling and just try to hold it there. On the state of the NRA today I think the NRA is an organization, at least currently, [that] is certainly weakened. ... NRA is not at its high point with regards to membership or fundraising or organizational health, that's for sure. But the sort of politics and NRA-ism that has been released across the country has not gone anywhere. And I liken it somewhat to a brush fire that is now raging across the country. It's dry and it's windy and it's still burning things. So I don't know that the NRA has gone or that it will be gone, but even weakened, the things that it has unleashed are certainly not weakened.

            "article_content": "The delta variant fuels a sharp rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases. President Biden meets Monday with Iraq's prime minister. The world's leading climate scientists will finalize a comprehensive assessment.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: The delta variant continues to fuel a sharp rise in U.S. coronavirus cases, NOEL KING, HOST: Yeah, and so we will need to adapt. Public health officials say vulnerable people might need booster shots. The CDC is reconsidering whether vaccinated people should wear masks. And some cities aren't even waiting on the CDC. LA revived its mask mandate a week ago, and St. Louis is doing the same today. MCCAMMON: NPR's Allison Aubrey joins us now to talk about the latest. Good morning, Allison. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, Sarah. MCCAMMON: So case counts are going up in many places, as we've heard. How bad is it, and how does that compare to where we've been over the past year and a half or so? AUBREY: Sure. Well, there were more than 64,000 cases reported on Friday. New cases have more than doubled over the last two weeks. And again, surges are really concentrated in areas where vaccination rates remain low. Just looking at data from Florida, some counties are reporting positivity rates in the 25% range, which means 1 in 4 tests are coming back positive. In Texas, there's also been a rise. I spoke to Marc Boom. He's the CEO of Houston Methodist Hospital, where the number of hospitalized COVID patients has climbed quickly. He says the tragedy is this was preventable. MARC BOOM: Nine in 10 people in our hospital right now are unvaccinated. So if they had been vaccinated, the vast, vast majority, if not all of them, wouldn't be sick. But furthermore, the other 10% who are here who are vaccinated probably wouldn't be sick either because we wouldn't have this rate of virus spreading throughout the community. So we owe it to them to help them. AUBREY: He says the best way is for everyone to get vaccinated. Unfortunately, models point to a continued increase in hospitalizations and deaths through the fall. MCCAMMON: And, Allison, we have in recent days been hearing a growing number of calls from Republican leaders in areas with low vaccination rates for people to get the vaccine, especially as this delta variant spreads. Are we seeing any signs that this is motivating unvaccinated people to do that? AUBREY: You know, it's really slow going, Sarah. About 30% of adults in the U.S. remain unvaccinated. But as you say, more leaders in states with low vaccination rates are speaking up. And they're speaking up more forcefully. This includes Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, telling Floridians that vaccines are saving lives; GOP Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama, who said it's time to blame unvaccinated people as cases rise; and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, also a Republican, told people in his state that they're losing ground to the delta variant. They're all trying to nudge people to get vaccinated. But a new AP poll found that 80% of people who have yet to be vaccinated say they probably won't get the shots. Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci stated again yesterday on CNN, vaccination is the best defense. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) ANTHONY FAUCI: If you are vaccinated, the vaccine is highly protective against the delta variant, particularly against severe disease leading to hospitalization. AUBREY: In fact, recent evidence from the UK found an mRNA vaccine to be 96% effective against hospitalization and death. MCCAMMON: It's important to stress that it's a small number here, but some vaccinated people are still getting the coronavirus. What do we know about what's happening there? AUBREY: Sure. Well, most of them are over the age of 65 and have some serious health complications. Dr. Fauci spoke about this yesterday, saying vulnerable people may benefit from a COVID vaccine booster shot. He pointed to data from Israel that suggests immunity can begin to wane by six months after vaccination. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) FAUCI: The data that's evolving from Israel and from Pfizer indicates that it looks like there might be some diminution in protection. And when you have that, the most vulnerable people who have suppressed immune system, those who are transplant patients, cancer chemotherapy, autoimmune diseases - those are the kind of individuals that if there's going to be a third boost, which might likely happen, will be among first the vulnerable. AUBREY: He says more should be known about a booster strategy and all this data soon. MCCAMMON: That's NPR's Allison Aubrey. Thanks so much. AUBREY: Thank you, Sarah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCCAMMON: Iraq's prime minister says his country no longer requires American combat troops to fight ISIS. KING: Mustafa Al-Kadhimi said that in an interview with the AP. He was referring to the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops that are in Iraq right now. He is meeting with President Biden today. And the big question is whether he'll say the same thing at the White House. MCCAMMON: NPR's Ruth Sherlock joins us now from Beirut to talk about it. Hello, Ruth. RUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Hello. MCCAMMON: What do we know about the discussions that are set to take place in the White House today? SHERLOCK: Well, ahead of this meeting, Iraq's prime minister, Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, had been briefing that Iraq no longer requires the presence of U.S. combat troops in the country. He told The Associated Press that he plans to discuss a timeframe for their redeployment during this visit. You know, this is part of an ongoing conversation about the status of American troops in Iraq. U.S. forces were sent there by President Obama to fight ISIS in 2014. And in recent months, President Biden and the Iraqi prime minister have talked about a shift to U.S. forces being present for a train and equip mission, but no timeline has been set for that. Today's meeting is a continuation of that conversation. MCCAMMON: And, Ruth, what can you tell us about what an end to the role of combat troops in Iraq would mean in terms of an overall U.S. military presence in Iraq? SHERLOCK: Well, you know, that is the question. Analysts say this is actually more about politics and diplomacy than any real change on the ground for now. They see this as almost a sort of window dressing to help the Iraqi prime minister with domestic politics back in Iraq. Iranian-backed militias and politicians are very strong in Iraq. And since the U.S. assassinated Iran's top security and intelligence commander, Qassem Soleimani, last year, those aligned with Iran have been calling for action against the U.S. So Iraq's parliament at one point even demanded that the government expel U.S. forces. So Iraq's Prime Minister Kadhimi is under a lot of pressure, especially as he has an election coming up. Renad Mansour, an Iraq expert at Chatham House think tank in the U.K., says that in calling for an end to U.S. combat troops in Iraq, the Iraqi prime minister is trying to appease the Iranian-backed factions. RENAD MANSOUR: Really, he's sending a message from Iran to the U.S. to say, remove your combat troops. And the Americans are replying saying, OK, we'll remove our combat troops, but we're going to have our advisers there. They might just look the same. SHERLOCK: And, you know, this is really the point. In actual fact, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq is expected to remain similar. Instead, their role will be redefined to provide training and intelligence to Iraqi forces. U.S. military officials say this is more or less what's already happening on the ground in Iraq anyway. MCCAMMON: For the U.S., what are the interests there now? SHERLOCK: Well, the U.S. wants to keep a presence in Iraq to help fight against ISIS. Troops in Iraq also support operations of U.S. troops in Syria. The U.S. also wants to counter Iran. Iranian-backed militias have escalated drone and rocket attacks against U.S. bases in Syria. And the U.S. has responded with air strikes. And many Iraqis, including the prime minister, say, you know, the U.S. needs to continue to support Iraqi forces. The U.S. also is important for many other European states in Iraq who operate in Iraq. MCCAMMON: That's NPR's Ruth Sherlock in Beirut. Thanks so much, Ruth. SHERLOCK: Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCCAMMON: Massive wildfires, extreme heat across North America and Africa, deadly flash floods in Europe and Asia. KING: Those are all signs of climate change, of course. But there's been no comprehensive report on the state of global warming for eight years. The last one came out in 2013. But today, more than 200 of the world's leading climate scientists will finalize an updated report on how the climate has changed and what the future might look like. MCCAMMON: NPR's Rebecca Hersher is with us now to talk about that. Good morning, Rebecca. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Good morning. MCCAMMON: So this meeting is set to last for about two weeks. There are many of the world's top climate scientists there. What are they hoping to achieve? HERSHER: So these scientists - they're serving the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That's part of the U.N. And they're finalizing this really important report. They've been poring over all the climate research published through January of this year. So that's thousands of studies about the Earth's atmosphere, about oceans, forests, weather patterns. And their goal is to summarize all of that research in one report that governments can then use to understand two things - first, the scientific consensus about how the climate has already changed and second, how the rest of the century will look, right? How quickly will the Earth heat up? What does that mean for hurricanes, for fires, for sea level rise? MCCAMMON: And this group of scientists has been convening for many years. But it's been a while since they've met, hasn't it? HERSHER: Yeah. So this is actually the sixth edition of this report. And the last version came out in 2013, which might not seem like that long, but it's an eternity in the world of climate science because global warming is accelerating. And advances in climate modeling and other climate research are also accelerating, you know, trying to keep up with the urgency of the moment, make sure humans have the knowledge they need to tackle this problem. So this report, the sixth edition - it's going to be a crucial document. And the authors hope it will inform basically the next decade of climate policy, for example, how quickly humans will actually cut greenhouse gases. MCCAMMON: How does a scientific report like this one that will come from the IPCC help governments make big decisions about policy question, things like, you know, how to generate electricity? Will these scientists explicitly tell world leaders what they should do to try to slow down climate change? HERSHER: So that's the tricky part. No, the scientists will not be making recommendations about specific policies. Like you won't see a bullet point in this report that says, stop burning coal right now, even though that would obviously reduce greenhouse gases. And that's because the role of scientists is to make sure that governments understand how policies like burning coal are affecting the Earth, and then it's up to governments to lead humanity through this energy transition. MCCAMMON: So, Rebecca, how do scientists help governments do that, exactly? HERSHER: So they're using five scenarios. And you can imagine these like imaginary policy worlds, kind of. So, for example, there's a scenario where countries work together to develop cheap, low-carbon technologies and then make them available to everyone. But then there's another scenario where nationalism surges, and governments kind of turn inward and focus on local energy options. Under most of the scenarios, it's important to say, it is still possible to keep global warming below that 2 degrees Celsius threshold. That's what the Paris Agreement aims for. It's just a matter of how. And at the end of these two weeks, on August 9, they'll release this report. So stay tuned. MCCAMMON: Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team, thanks so much.

As the sun began to peek over the horizon, it was quiet on the National Mall. Too quiet for organizers of the historic March On Washington. \"Nobody knew exactly how many people would come,\" recalls Norman Hill, a young activist and labor leader at the time. Organizer and transportation director Rachelle Horowitz estimated 90,000 people would be there based on the number of buses that had been chartered. By the end of the day, an estimated 250,000 people from across the country had marched on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Hill, Horowitz, and Joyce Ladner, then a coordinator for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), spoke with Throughline, to remember their days working on the march under the leadership of Bayard Rustin, the civil rights pioneer behind the March on Washington. Bayard Rustin, the deputy director of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, speaks to the crowd of marchers from the Lincoln Memorial. He was the organizer of the march, overseeing the largest march at that point in American history.\n                \n                    \n                    Bettmann Archive\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bayard Rustin, the deputy director of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, speaks to the crowd of marchers from the Lincoln Memorial. He was the organizer of the march, overseeing the largest march at that point in American history. Those who knew Rustin remember his charisma, his kindness, his slight British accent, and his tendency to break out in song. And they remember him as a master strategist. For decades before the march, Rustin had been organizing protests, marches and sit-ins, spreading the gospel of nonviolent resistance long before Dr. King came on the national stage. In fact, Rustin's surviving partner, Walter Naegle, describes him as a \"mentor\" to Dr. King. Rustin's belief in nonviolence began when he was a child growing up with his grandmother, a Quaker, in Pennsylvania in the 1920s. It solidified in adulthood after he discovered the work of Indian revolutionary, Mahatma Gandhi. For most of his life, Rustin was the person behind-the-scenes, dreaming up transformative moments like the March On Washington. He wanted others, including Dr. King, to be the face of that dream. Nearly 60 years later, Hill, Horowitz, and Ladner still remember waking up that August morning. They remember walking across the grass of the National Mall, hearing Bob Dylan \u2014 or Bobby, as Ladner calls him \u2014 perform. They remember the sound of the speeches over the loudspeaker system, which Horowitz says cost them a fortune. They remember watching John Lewis rewrite his speech up until the time he took the stage. And they remember watching as bus after bus pulled up, and one person became five, then a thousand, then tens of thousands. \"They were singing, they were happy and we knew it was going to be a success,\" says Horowitz. Ladner came from a small town in Mississippi, and when she looked out at the crowd she said she felt \"a sense of awe and pride. It still feels a certain way, and I still get it.\" What Hill holds on to is that it was a march for jobs and freedom. \"I think what is overlooked is that the thrust of the march had a class dimension as well as a civil rights dimension,\" he says. The crowd marched peacefully and without disturbance that day. It was an incredible feat of organizing that almost didn't happen. American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin is often overlooked as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement. But nevertheless, his influence and impact was instrumental to the movement he helped lead.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick A. Burns/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin is often overlooked as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement. But nevertheless, his influence and impact was instrumental to the movement he helped lead. Just a few weeks before the march, Rustin had come under attack. He was an easy target: a socialist, a pacifist who'd refused to fight in WWII and went to prison for it, and a gay Black man at a time of intense homophobia. He'd been attacked before for being gay, each time forcing him to retreat out of the spotlight. This time, the attacks came on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The segregationist senator Strom Thurmond accused Rustin of being a \"sex-pervert\" and \"draft-dodger.\" He hoped by discrediting Rustin he'd also put a stop to the march. But soon after, the director of the march and prominent leader of the civil rights movement, A. Philip Randolph, gave a press conference defending Rustin. And the march went on as planned. For the remainder of his life, Rustin turned his attention toward issues like economic injustice, gay rights, and anti-colonialism. He received criticism from some within the civil rights movement for his political views, namely, his tepid opposition to the Vietnam War, his conservative stance on things like affirmative action, and his support for Israel. He died in New York City in 1987 on the outskirts of the movement. Bayard Rustin was the sum of many, sometimes contradictory parts. And while his contributions are often overlooked, he was instrumental in the movement and the architect of one of the most influential protests in American history. In a way, that was his greatest gift: the ability to imagine a different world and rally everyday people to build that world with him.

The government announced Tuesday that D\u00e9by had died during clashes with rebels. Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, the president of Chad and one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, was killed in the country's north, where he had traveled to observe the fight against rebel insurgents, state media reported Tuesday. The announcement came just hours after election officials in Chad certified that D\u00e9by, 68, had carried nearly 80% of the vote in April 11 polls, setting him up for a sixth five-year term as president. In a broadcast on state television from the capital, N'Djamena, army spokesman Gen. Azem Bermandoa Agouna said Deby's son, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, \u2013 a 37-year-old four-star general \u2014 had been named interim president by a transitional council of military officers.

D\u00e9by \"has just breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield\" over the weekend, the spokesman said in a statement read on state television, according to Al-Jazeera. Surrounded by fellow officers, the army spokesman issued \"a call to dialogue and peace\" to all Chadians \"to continue to build Chad together.\" He said the transitional council was taking \"all measures\" to \"guarantee peace, security and the republican order.\" D\u00e9by \"took control of operations during the heroic combat led against the terrorists from Libya. He was wounded during the fighting and died once repatriated to N'Djamena,\" the army spokesman said. The military, which said the transition council would rule for 18 months, also imposed a nightly curfew of 6 p.m., according to The Associated Press. It wasn't immediately clear exactly how or when D\u00e9by was killed. While the army said he had died over the weekend, Reuters reports that his campaign had said Monday that D\u00e9by was joining government troops on the front lines after Libya-based rebels advanced south toward the capital, N'Djamena. His campaign manager was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying he had postponed his election victory speech to go to the front, where government forces are battling the Front for Change and Concord in Chad after the rebels attacked border posts on election day and then marched farther south. D\u00e9by, a former army commander-in-chief, came to power in Chad in 1990 at the head of a popular revolt against then-President Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9. D\u00e9by later won a series of elections beginning in 1996, all the while weathering numerous rebellions and coup attempts. His critics accused D\u00e9by of repression amid crackdowns on his opponents. The public was also growing increasingly discontent over his management of the country's oil wealth. In 2018, D\u00e9by pushed through a new constitution allowing him to remain in power until 2033. Last year, he took the title of \"Marshal.\" Speaking last year ahead of April's elections, he said: \"I know in advance that I will win, as I have done for the last 30 years.\" Freedom House rates Chad as \"not free\" and says that although it has had regular presidential elections since 1996, \"no election has ever produced a change in power.\" \"Legislative elections are routinely delayed, and have not been held since 2011. Opposition activists risk arrest and severe mistreatment while in detention,\" it says. Despite his critics at home, D\u00e9by, a Muslim, was seen by the West as an ally in the fight against Islamist extremists, such as Boko Haram \u2014 which is waging an anti-government insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin. Chad has also aided fights against al-Qaida- and Islamic State-linked groups in the region. The Chadian army helped push Boko Haram out of Nigeria's Borno state. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the U.S. offers \"the people of Chad our sincere condolences.\" \"We condemn recent violence and loss of life in Chad,\" he said in a statement. \"The United States stands with the people of Chad during this difficult time. We support a peaceful transition of power in accordance with the Chadian constitution.\" France, Chad's former colonial ruler, has based its counterterrorism operations in Chad's capital. Paris announced in February that it was sending 1,200 more troops to complement 5,100 French soldiers in the area, AP reports. \"France lost a brave friend,\" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement quoted by France24. He said the country \"expresses its strong attachment to Chad's stability and territorial integrity.\"",

            "article_content": "Talks about financial compensation between the Department of Justice and families that were forcibly separated during the Trump administration while seeking asylum have ended without a settlement.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The Department of Justice has broken off negotiations to pay monetary damages to families that were forcibly separated at the border during the Trump administration. That's according to a lawyer at the ACLU, which has been involved in the settlement talks. Those negotiations became a political liability for the Biden administration after some of the dollar figures under discussion leaked to the press. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration, and he joins us now. Joel, first just a status update - what's going on with the negotiations? JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Well, you know, as you said, these are negotiations regarding the families that were separated under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy while they were seeking asylum in the U.S., and the government had no clear plan to reunite them. Some of these families are still separated to this day. Many say they're still suffering the effects of that forcible separation. And dozens and dozens of them had brought claims, seeking monetary damages from the government. These talks were aimed at settling those claims, but now the Justice Department has walked away from those talks. CORNISH: Why did they fall apart? ROSE: Well, the talks had been proceeding quietly behind closed doors until October, when the Wall Street Journal broke a story that the financial compensation amounts could reach up to $450,000 per person in some cases. You know, the lawyers involved in the negotiations said that settlement amounts for most families would be way lower than that. But once the number was out there, it generated a lot of outrage among Republicans and conservative media in particular, who tried to link the issue to the soaring number of arrests at the southern border, you know, by arguing that giving big cash settlements to migrant families would encourage more illegal immigration. Now, the Biden administration and the president himself were asked about this a lot, and you could see, you know, clearly this was going to be an election year issue for them. CORNISH: What's been the reaction to all of this, at least so far? ROSE: Lawyers for the separated families are deeply disappointed by this move. I talked today with Lee Gelernt at the ACLU, who is one of the lead negotiators, who pointed out that there was bipartisan criticism of this family separation policy back in 2018 and that Biden himself has called it a moral and national shame. Here's Lee. LEE GELERNT: The president should have stood up, reminded people what happened to these children and said, we have a moral obligation as a country to fix this and not let partisan politics interfere with helping these young children. History will not judge this decision kindly. ROSE: The Justice Department put out a statement today that said the parties have been unable to reach a settlement, but, quote, \"We remain committed to engaging with the plaintiffs and to bringing justice to the victims of this abhorrent policy,\" unquote. CORNISH: What's the next step in this process? ROSE: Well, the Department of Justice will now have to defend many, many lawsuits brought by families seeking monetary damages likely. And in the end, immigrant advocates say the government could easily wind up spending even more money fighting all these cases than if it had, you know, just reached a settlement. And now the Biden administration will have to literally defend the Trump administration's policy in court. Meanwhile, the administration is working to reunite families that are still separated, and it is still in negotiations with the ACLU over some other issues, including the possibility of legal status for separated families. Those talks will continue, but, you know, the ACLU says this will not make them any easier. CORNISH: That's NPR's Joel Rose. Thanks for this reporting. ROSE: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn F\u00e9in president and leader of the opposition in the Republic of Ireland, about Brexit and how cross-border relations are working.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The last time I interviewed our next guest, I introduced her as the new leader of Sinn Fein, the Irish political party. It was 2018. Mary Lou McDonald had just taken over, and it marked a sea change. She was succeeding a giant of Irish politics, Gerry Adams, who had led Sinn Fein, often controversially, for more than three decades. Since McDonald and I spoke those three years ago, Sinn Fein has grown. Elections last year left them the largest party, the most seats in the Dail, the lower house of Ireland's parliament, and poised to make gains in the Northern Irish Assembly, too. Well, this week finds her here in the U.S. for talks, including with us. Mary Lou McDonald, welcome back to the program. MARY LOU MCDONALD: Thank you so much. It's great to be with you. KELLY: Well, and may I add, welcome back to the U.S. I know because of pandemic travel restrictions... MCDONALD: Yes. KELLY: You haven't been able to come. So welcome back. MCDONALD: Thank you. I'm delighted to be here. It's been two long years, and we're all so appreciative and grateful that we can travel again. So long may it continue. KELLY: Since you and I last spoke - again, that was 2018 - a lot has happened - a lifetime of political developments on this side of the Atlantic, and for you, among other things, Brexit. MCDONALD: Yes. KELLY: How's it going? MCDONALD: Well, you know, they say that there's only two certainties in life - don't they? - death and taxes. I think we can now add Brexit to that list. It is, of course, a very significant game changer politically and diplomatically. I mean, Brexit isn't a singular event or a moment in time. It changes forever. KELLY: It's a process. MCDONALD: Yeah - in a very significant way. KELLY: You lead a party that would prefer there were no border as you cross from north to south. But there is a border for now, and the big question in this precise moment is what that looks like with Northern Ireland now exited from the EU. What could you live with just realistically? MCDONALD: Well, look - the island now has been partitioned for 100 years. We mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland, a catastrophic event in history that led to generations of conflict. But we're also approaching nearly the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. And the truth is, since we arrived at that accord - and the United States had a very significant hand in delivering that - for all practical purposes, there has been no border on the island. Any of your listeners who have visited Ireland will know that you move seamlessly from Dublin to Belfast, from Derry to Cork all across the island and... KELLY: No checkpoints, right - but is that tenable now that Brexit has changed? MCDONALD: It's essential. I mean, one of the primary motivators for dealing so comprehensively with Brexit is to ensure that there is no, what they call, hard border on the island of Ireland. Like, we live on a small island. People work and marry and live and die all across the island, you know. And the idea that we would - again, having made so much progress post the Good Friday Agreement, as a society moving out of conflict, confidently wishing to move and create a new island and a new future, the idea that we would take steps backwards and have, again, division and a hard border on the island is completely unacceptable. I mean, that is not tenable. I just want to record how heartened I am to hear so clearly from the current administration, but also from right across - from across the aisle in United States politics, a clear message to the British government that leaving Ireland vulnerable or the Good Friday Agreement vulnerable to damage is not acceptable to the United States. KELLY: Election's coming up next spring in May in Northern Ireland. Many expect your party Sinn Fein to win. If you do, will you push for a referendum on reunification of the island? MCDONALD: As you know, I take nothing for granted ever in elections. We know that you have to work hard. But just to make this point, Mary Louise, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that within the next five to 10 years, we will be facing into referendums. We will be putting the question in respect of the unification of Ireland to the people north and south. And as I've been saying to colleagues on the Hill on this visit, we really need to start preparation now for an orderly, democratic and peaceful transition from a partitioned Ireland to a united Ireland... KELLY: Well, I was going to ask... MCDONALD: ...That it's actually irresponsible, in my view - reckless, actually - not to have a citizens' assembly, not to have a space in which the preparation begins now in a way that involves everybody, all shades of opinion. And I know and the polling data reflects that there is a huge appetite across the island for those preparations to commence, so... KELLY: So what is your message to unionists, the people - and there are a lot of them - who are determined to keep Northern Ireland inside the U.K., who will be listening to your words with horror? MCDONALD: Well, no, they won't. I don't believe they'll be listening with horror because - or with any great surprise. KELLY: You're outlining a goal that runs counter... MCDONALD: Yes. KELLY: ...Completely counter to their vision for their future of their country. MCDONALD: Absolutely. And I am fully aware and I fully respect that unionist colleagues will make the case politically for the union. And I absolutely respect that. KELLY: And I'm... MCDONALD: None of us have a veto. KELLY: So I'm asking less about the politicians. I'm asking just about ordinary people. How do you convince them they shouldn't fear Sinn Fein? MCDONALD: What I say to everybody that I meet is that each of us has a part and a perspective in this debate. And there's nothing to be feared here. This is a moment of great opportunity for the whole island. And even for those people who would wish to see the status quo maintained, I would like to believe that those folks can still see in a united Ireland and could articulate their needs and their ask (ph) and their view of what that society might look like. And by the way, the fact that Ireland has changed and is changing is well-known to sensible people within the unionist community. They know this is underway, and it's a subject of conversation. And I think we need to listen respectfully, engage respectfully. And I am up for that. And I happen to believe that many, many others are as well. KELLY: What is not up for debate is that there is more uncertainty over the future of Northern Ireland, more tension in Northern Ireland, over what the future looks like than there have been in decades. What is Sinn Fein doing? What can Sinn Fein do to make sure that with those tensions does not come a return to the violence that defined Northern Ireland for decades, the Troubles? MCDONALD: Well, we demonstrate that politics works. That's it. I mean, the - conflict and war and violence is the failure of politics. We have to demonstrate every day that politics - that the democratic institutions work. And just to say, although there have been some violence on the streets, that has been very, very limited. Those events should never happen. Please don't get me wrong. But I am very sure in saying to you that there is no appetite anywhere in any part of society in Ireland or in the north of Ireland for a return to conflict. That is over. That day is gone. KELLY: Mary Lou McDonald is the leader of the Irish political party Sinn Fein, speaking to us today from Washington. Thank you. MCDONALD: Thank you so much.

            "article_content": "Honduras, one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the Americas, is holding presidential elections tomorrow. On top of COVID-19, it has also seen large numbers of people leaving for the U.S..  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: We turn now to Honduras, where voters will head to the polls to pick a new president tomorrow. It has been a tough year for the country - had to deal with not only a pandemic but also two hurricanes and relentless political corruption and an exodus of its people. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Rafael Melgar's small two-room house that he shares with his wife and three small kids sits right below a large, earthen levee separating a sprawling, poor neighborhood from a mile-long flood-control canal. When the hurricanes hit last year, the levee broke. RAFAEL MELGAR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: He says he and his family barely got out. They trudged through the mud and water up to their necks, with their kids held above their heads. MELGAR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"Our ancestors talk about that exodus in the Bible,\" he says. \"We lived it in the flesh.\" They lost everything. He got no help from the government. His family only returned to the house a few months ago, but he says he's ready to leave again. MELGAR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"It's the fear of living in this country,\" he says. Gangs robbed his elderly neighbors, and he can't find work. Melgar says once the elections are over, he's heading for Los Angeles. He lived there before, working without documents as a security guard in Hollywood. Many Hondurans are doing the same. The latest figures show a big jump in the number of Hondurans crossing the U.S. Southern border. DILSIA CARRANZA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: There are no good options in the election, says 48-year-old Dilsia Carranza. She owns a small electronics shop downtown. The economy contracted last year by 10%, and as many as half a million jobs were lost. CARRANZA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: And now, with the country on edge over the election, she says, she isn't selling much. She wants the ruling party out. Much of voters' wrath is focused on Honduras's current president, Juan Orlando Hernandez. He's been in office for eight years after he maneuvered a change to the Constitution to allow for his reelection in 2017. A New York court recently sentenced his brother to life in prison for drug trafficking. Hernandez himself was implicated but denies any involvement. He's mocked frequently on social media about the alleged ties. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Juanchi, Juanchi, Juanchi. KAHN: In this viral video, the president, derisively called Juanchi, is taunted about being extradited for his own trial in New York. Jokes aside, distaste for Hernandez is deep. The opposition is leading in polls, united around a former first lady, Xiomara Castro. SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) XIOMARA CASTRO: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: At a recent campaign closer, Castro told the crowd she'll end the suffering Hondurans have endured since her husband was ousted from power in a coup in 2009. The opposition tries to cast her as a radical leftist and tire to her husband, who faced bribery allegations. She says she'll help the poor and create an anti-corruption commission. For his part, the ruling party's candidate, the two-term mayor of the capital, Nasry Asfura, doesn't talk a lot about corruption. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NASRY ASFURA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: He just says he's different, like at his closing rally this week in an attempt to distance himself from the current president. But Asfura himself was accused of misappropriating city funds, a charge he denies. The race remains close, and many are on edge, worried about a repeat of the post-electoral violence and fraud allegations of 2017. Businesses are boarding their windows around town. Javier Perdomo is 21 years old and works at a downtown barbershop. JAVIER PERDOMO: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: He says his job isn't very stable. He doesn't want to go to the U.S. like so many of his friends have done recently. He says he hopes Castro wins and cleans up the country. Carrie Kahn, NPR News, San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

            "article_content": "Honduras is holding its presidential election Sunday at a time of poverty, corruption and increased migration to the United States.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Presidential elections are set to take place this Sunday in Honduras. The Central American nation has been battered by the pandemic, two back-to-back hurricanes and a corrupt political system. Hondurans have been leaving the country for the U.S. in droves. And with past elections marred by accusations of fraud and violence, tensions are high. We're now joined by NPR's Carrie Kahn, who's in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. Welcome, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: We just mentioned a number of problems facing the country. What's the top issue on people's minds going into the election? KAHN: Yeah, there's a lot of issues. I'd say the top issue is the economy. Honduras' economy shrank by some 10% during the pandemic. We've heard estimates of half a million jobs lost in the past year. And then these hurricanes, Eta and Iota, were catastrophic, especially in the industrial north, where much of Honduras' economic output is. Reconstruction, at best you can say, has been slow. So first and foremost, it's unemployment and the economy. And coming in a close second is the widespread dislike and the corruption surrounding the current president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, and his National Party, which has been in power here for 12 years. And Juan Orlando has been in office for the last eight of those 12 years, and he has a very checkered record. He changed the constitution so he could be reelected in 2017, and that election was just marred by allegations of fraud and post-electoral violence. And also, Juan Orlando has been linked to his brother's drug-running activities. He denies that, but his brother was recently sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. CORNISH: So right now, who's on the ballot and what are they offering? KAHN: Yeah, it's quite a cast of characters. The frontrunner is Xiomara Castro. She's the wife of a former president who was deposed in a coup in 2009. Since that coup, she's emerged as a political leader in her own right. And she has - and she's seen as a champion of the poor. But the ruling party tries to portray her as this radical leftist aligned with Venezuela and Cuba, tying her to her husband's legacy and also long-standing allegations he has of taking bribes when he was president, too. Then there's the ruling party's candidate, Nasry Asfura. He's been the mayor of the capital here, and his slogan, Audie, is (speaking Spanish) - daddy at your service. And he portrays himself as this hard worker in that he's - his slogan is, I'm different. That's his attempt to distance himself from President Juan Orlando. But Asfura has also been accused of misdeeds, misappropriating public funds as mayor of Tegucigalpa to the tune of a million dollars. And then just quickly got to add one more candidate. He's running a distant third, and he's a political - familiar name here in the country - Yani Rosenthal. He just returned to Honduras after a stint in a U.S. federal prison for money laundering. CORNISH: What are you hearing from voters? KAHN: Many people I spoke with on the streets just aren't happy with this crop of candidates and just really aren't happy with politics in general. But Xiomara Castro has been able to rally the opposition to her candidacy, and she's ahead in the polls. Honduras - Hondurans have the lowest level of support for democracy in Latin America. And they're just sick of all this, and many are voting with their feet. Hundreds leave the country daily, and there's been a large increase in the numbers of Hondurans trying to cross the U.S. southern border. Even if you look at pre-pandemic levels and now, there's a big increase. And people here - that are here now are just worried about post-election violence, like what took place in 2007. I saw businesses all day yesterday boarding up storefronts. And U.S. officials have called on all parties to respect the outcome, but there are concerns about how the votes will get counted, vote buying and coercion by the ruling party. CORNISH: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn watching the campaigning in Honduras. Thank you so much for your reporting. KAHN: You're welcome, Audie.

In Colorado, a clerk went so far as to invite one skeptic to work at his office to see for herself.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Only about a third of Republican voters trust that elections are fair, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Election officials in states like Colorado say they're fielding more questions and more doubts than ever before. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland has the story of how a county clerk set out to win one woman's trust. BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: For most of her life, 68-year-old Kay Hunsaker says she simply accepted the results of elections. But in recent years, she says she became concerned about voter fraud and people potentially voting illegally. KAY HUNSAKER: It never crossed my mind that we had real problems until the last decade. Then it seemed all of a - maybe with the influx of a border that isn't secure. BIRKELAND: Last year, Hunsaker moved from the Denver area to a small town about two hours away. She says she loves the scenic vistas and the fact that, unlike Denver, the area is very conservative. But when she arrived, she says she was alarmed to discover that the clerk in charge of the 2020 election was the son of a Republican running for county commission. HUNSAKER: And I was like, OK, here we go, you know? What do we got, some family dynasty going on, you know? You know, I just thought this was typical, OK? BIRKELAND: She publicly asked the Republican clerk, Justin Grantham, to step down from overseeing the election, something state law doesn't allow. Grantham says it was rough that some Republicans believed he would or even could rig the election to help his father. JUSTIN GRANTHAM: I don't do any of the election. I don't deconstruct the envelopes. I don't pull them out. I don't... BIRKELAND: For him, Hunsaker's fears showed she wasn't familiar with how elections are actually run. GRANTHAM: Like, you know what? Comes see me. If you really think that I'm going to do something, come see me. Come take a tour. Come see how it works. HUNSAKER: You know, and I was a little confrontational with Justin. I was, you know, because I've heard some things. And, you know, he's like, well, sit down, let's talk. And that kind of disarms you right there. BIRKELAND: Grantham had a proposal - help out during the 2020 election. And Hunsaker found a secure system, and she was back working the most recent election. HUNSAKER: Do you have a question, sir? BIRKELAND: Hunsaker is wearing a bright American flag sweater and has purple streaks in her white hair. She smiles warmly at the voter who's just walked through the door. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: My last ballot was sent to this address. HUNSAKER: OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I've since changed my mailing address to here. BIRKELAND: Hunsaker is also going out into the community to tell local Republicans why the election is aboveboard. HUNSAKER: From being down and watching those ballots, I know there was no fraud going on. BIRKELAND: The clerk, Grantham, says he will keep trying to win over skeptics one at a time if that's what it takes. But Hunsaker's faith is limited to what she's directly experienced. She trusts her own county, but not necessarily other places. HUNSAKER: No, I do not believe the 2020 election was right. There was too much middle-of-the-night changes for it to sit well with me. So... BIRKELAND: Would that be Georgia and Arizona? HUNSAKER: And Pennsylvania and Michigan - there was a lot. There was a lot. BIRKELAND: There continues to be no evidence that the vote counts in those states were affected by fraud, but NPR's recent poll shows that Hunsaker isn't alone with her concerns. Three-quarters of Republican voters believe real cases of fraud changed the 2020 results. For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland in Denver.

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica \u2014 Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega is running for a fourth consecutive term to remain leader of the Central American country in elections that critics and U.S. officials have labeled a \"sham.\" In the run-up to Sunday's election, Ortega, who turns 76 on Nov. 11, has jailed dozens of opponents, including seven people who said they wanted to challenge him for the presidency. Student leaders, businesspeople and journalists have been rounded up, and tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have gone into exile. Ortega's Sandinista party controls Nicaragua's congress and recently passed a series of laws criminalizing nearly all forms of dissent. Observers say they haven't seen this level of repression in Latin America since the military dictatorships of the 1970s and 80s. Opponents are urging voters to sit this election out and are using a slogan from the coronavirus pandemic, \"Quedate en Casa\" or \"Stay at Home,\" to urge Nicaraguans not to go to the polls. The hashtag #MiCandidatoEstaPreso, or #MyCandidateIsIncarcerated, is being pushed on social media. Taxi driver Jose Leyva, 21, says he's heeding the call. \"I was going to vote a few months ago, but now all the candidates I wanted are in jail,\" he said. Leyva added he doesn't know anything about the other candidates listed on the ballot with Ortega. There are five other names, all members of small Sandinista-aligned parties. Nicaraguans call them zancudos, or mosquitos, dismissing their candidacies. But Arturo Cano, a vendor in the Nicaraguan capital's huge Oriental Market, says he actually will go to the polls. \"If I don't vote they'll just take it, steal my vote,\" he said, referring to government poll workers who he says would mark an \"X\" by Ortega's name if he didn't show up. A large number of Nicaraguans do not want Ortega to continue ruling the country. A recent CID \u2013 Gallup poll found that only 19% of Nicaraguans would actually vote for Ortega. And that Ortega's unfavorable marks had skyrocketed as well as that of his wife Rosario Murillo, who is the current vice president and is believed to run the country day-to-day. NPR was barred from boarding a flight to Nicaragua. Interviews inside Nicaragua were conducted by a local journalist, whose name NPR is not disclosing for their safety. When asked why NPR was barred from entering the country and for a response to criticism that the elections are not free and democratic, Murillo, who is also the country's top communications official, sent back an email response simply saying, \"Gracias....!\" Murillo and Ortega insist that they are victims of a campaign funded by the U.S. to topple their government, thereby justifying the jailing of opponents and charges of treason. U.S. officials have warned more sanctions on Nicaraguan officials will be imposed after the elections. Currently Murillo herself has been targeted as well as four of the couple's adult children, who run most of the country's media outlets and who hold the title of presidential advisers. \"Unfortunately, this is not just a dictatorship, it's dynastic. It's a dictatorship that seems to want to go in a dynastic direction,\" said a senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That dynastic turn is ironic, according to many critics and former revolutionary comrades of Ortega. In the 1970s Ortega, then a Marxist guerilla fighter, helped topple U.S.-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled Nicaragua since 1936. After toppling Somoza, Ortega went on to become the first post-revolutionary president. He lost his first reelection bid in 1990 to Violeta Chamorro and many observers say he has never gotten over that sting of defeat. It wouldn't be until 2007 that Ortega returned to the presidency, after making a pact with opponents to lower the threshold of votes needed for victory. He portrayed himself as a softer, less radical candidate who embraced Christianity and the business community he had long railed against. Once in power Ortega changed the constitution to allow for endless reelection. In 2018 he brutally quashed student-led protests, leaving hundreds dead and hundreds more languishing in Nicaragua's infamous El Chipote prison. \"That place is a mechanism of terror, used to break the people,\" says 35-year-old Jesus Tefel, who spent 46 days in El Chipote for participating in the 2018 protests. Tefel had an adventure travel agency in Nicaragua until earlier this year when he fled to neighboring Costa Rica with his pregnant wife. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have left the country in recent months. Many have fled to the U.S. which has seen a spike in Nicaraguan migration, with nearly 50,000 stopped by U.S. border agents in the first nine months of this year, a record. Tens of thousands more have relocated to Costa Rica. Tefel, who lives in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose, says he hopes his fellow Nicaraguans boycott Sunday's vote and are able to bring about a change in the government soon. \"The people are really scared, I know, but this situation of total repression in Nicaragua isn't sustainable,\" he said. And he's hoping that after Sunday's election other nations will increase pressure on Nicaragua for a change of government.",

Houston's Harris County experimented with new voting methods during the 2020 race \u2014 ideas that were later prohibited by GOP lawmakers. Isabel Longoria runs elections in Harris County, which is where Houston is. She says she loves her job and thinks most people who do that kind work feel the same way. \"I am an election nerd and I don't know a single other elections administrator who is not an election nerd,\" Longoria says. \"We geek out, literally, on having the coolest job in America that we get to run the founding principles of this country \u2014 which is free and fair elections.\" But since the 2020 presidential election, and amid the false allegations that followed claiming it was stolen, local election officials have faced increased scrutiny. Some have been harassed and gotten death threats. Some are leaving the job altogether. Longoria is not. She started her job as the county's elections administrator in 2020, during the worst of the pandemic and ahead of a contentious election. She came up with a lot of ideas on how to make voting safer \u2014 ideas that were later criticized and prohibited by Republican state lawmakers. Longoria says she's been doing what she can to help people understand what she does, but she's finding that some people cannot be satisfied. \"That is what is concerning to me. It's not that people hold us accountable, not that people have questions about how elections are happening, but that they are now trained to say that if there is an answer that is acceptable, that is true, it must be a lie,\" she says. \"And so, at what point then do people accept the truth?\" In some cases, this kind of distrust has led to harassment of local election officials. In Texas, an election official in heavily Republican Hood County, outside of Fort Worth, resigned following pressure from some Republican voters. Virginia Kase Solom\u00f3n, CEO of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters, says this is a nationwide problem. \"What we have seen is increasing threats of violence and aggression,\" she says. \"It's really, really sad. These are some of the most patriotic roles anybody can play and they have now been politicized and it's just really sad for our country.\" Election experts say they've already seen a rise in the number of beleaguered officials retiring early. At this point there hasn't been an exodus of election officials in Texas leaving their roles. Though there is another trend happening. Elections in the Lone Star State are run almost entirely by county officials, with the work of voter registration and election administration historically split between elected county clerks and tax assessors. But in the past several years more and more counties have consolidated both of those elected roles into one appointed position, often referred to as an election administrator. Out of the 254 counties in Texas, about half have switched to election administrator positions, says Remi Garza, president of the Texas Association of Election Administrators. It's a switch that mostly larger counties in Texas have made, but Garza says lately smaller counties have begun switching to appointed positions as well. \"I think there are a lot of different factors that they consider,\" he says. \"It could range from a budgetary cost or just that elections are becoming more complicated.\" It's not just technology that is getting more complicated, Garza says; state laws are also changing more often. He says that means there are more expectations and rules to follow. \"And there are additional repercussions for when things go wrong that people are going to want to turn to those individuals that specialize in this type of government function,\" Garza says. And those \"additional repercussions\" in Texas will soon include a slew of new penalties created by a massive voting bill that was passed earlier this year, following months of tension between Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. As to whether it's a good thing that fewer voters in Texas are directly electing the people who run their elections, Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, says it kind of depends. \"You know, it really can go both ways,\" he says. \"I mean you see some election administrators who do a really good job because they are professionals who stay in that job \u2014 for decades, in some cases.\" But Gutierrez says sometimes appointments can be pretty political. For example, he says, Gov. Greg Abbott recently appointed a new state elections chief who was part of former President Donald Trump's legal team trying to overturn 2020 election results in Pennsylvania. Gutierrez says in those situations, voters can't weigh in at the ballot box to vote someone out. He says this is why he thinks for this model to work, there needs to be transparency. \"With this type of appointment system you really need to have citizens involved, you need to have a public, transparent interview process where you have multiple candidates that people can interact with,\" he says. Harris County's Longoria says she thinks this appointment model in Texas actually creates more accountability because there's only one person voters look to for answers. \"It's one job you hold me accountable for,\" she says. \"From soup to nuts, I am the person who has to make that happen. And therefore voters have much more clarity on holding me accountable.\" In Cameron County on the state's southern border, Garza says he thinks that as the pressure mounts, election administrators like him are in a good position to take things in stride. \"There are always going to be some level of changes that we are going to address and we are not easily scared off to performing these types of tasks,\" Garza says. \"I think election administrators are made of stern stuff.\" He says the hardest part of the job will always be the nuts and bolts of getting polling sites up and running \u2014 and election results released. But experts worry getting those results released efficiently and accurately could be harder if the public continues to place such strain on election workers.",

In Texas, one election administrator in a heavily Republican county just resigned.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It is a hard time to be an election worker. In Michigan, election workers in 2020 counted ballots while a mob fueled by lies pounded on the glass. In Georgia, a Republican election official warned that lies would lead to violence. And the pressure has continued in 2021. Ashley Lopez of KUT begins this story with an election worker in Texas. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: In Texas, elections are run almost entirely by county officials - people like Isabel Longoria in Harris County, which is where Houston is. Longoria says she loves this job. And she thinks most people who do this kind of work feel the same way. ISABEL LONGORIA: I don't know a single other elections administrator who's not an election nerd.

LOPEZ: Election experts say they're seeing a rise in the number of beleaguered officials retiring early. That hasn't so much been the case in Texas. Here, another trend is happening. Counties have been moving away from elected positions and instead creating more specialized appointed roles for this kind of work. Remi Garza with the Texas Association of Election Administrators says there's a lot of different reasons for this. But a main reason is that running elections is getting more complicated.

            "article_content": "Democrats are trying to figure out what lies ahead after election setbacks, like a big loss in Virginia and a shockingly close governor race in New Jersey.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Last night was rough for Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: Democrats are waking up. This is a gut punch. UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: This is not good news for President Biden. UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: There is no doubt that alarm bells are going off. UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #4: Democrats have to figure out, how are they talking to these voters in 2022? CORNISH: The president's party lost the governor's mansion in Virginia to a first-time Republican candidate, Glenn Youngkin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GLENN YOUNGKIN: Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth. CORNISH: In New Jersey, the Democratic governor who was projected to win easily barely eked out a victory. Meanwhile, a ballot measure to reform policing in Minneapolis failed. And ballot measures aimed at increasing voting access in New York are likely to fail. Now, to understand the context around what happened and what it could mean for a Democratic Party still struggling to deliver on President Biden's domestic priorities, we turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson... MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there, Audie. CORNISH: ...And our congressional correspondent, Kelsey Snell. Welcome to you. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: Mara, I'm going to start with you because I remember when Obama - President Obama winning Virginia in 2008 was a big deal because he had flipped the state from red to blue. What does last night tell us about whether this is once again a swing state? LIASSON: Well, that's a good question. You know, we joke that historical rules only work till they stop working, but this time, they actually worked because in Virginia - Virginia has a long history of electing governors of the opposite party than the one in the White House. But the reason, as you said, that last night was such a big shock to Democrats is because they believed that Virginia had ceased to be a swing state. It had been so long since a Republican won statewide for anything. Joe Biden won the state by 10 points. Turns out, Virginia is still purple. And yes, there's a big danger in overanalyzing this single off-year election. But the most important thing to remember is that Terry McAuliffe did turn out his base. He got 200,000 more votes than Ralph Northam did in 2017. This was a very high turnout election. But Glenn Youngkin won because he not only turned out his base, but he also was able to persuade suburban voters - Trump Biden voters - to come back to the GOP. And the fact that this was a persuasion election, as well as turnout, that's what's giving Democrats so much to really soul search about today. CORNISH: Kelsey, I know Mara said that we should not overanalyze, but I'm sure Democrats on Capitol Hill are not taking that advice. What's going on? SNELL: Well, progressives are grumbling that they feel like, to some degree, the failure was in picking a moderate candidate who failed to drum up real excitement to bring out people who were not necessarily easy Dem base voters and reach people who were looking for a candidate that spoke to them. You know, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, who is currently a senator but was once governor of the state, argued the exact opposite. Essentially, he said that a Democrat can't win in Virginia and statewide if they're too progressive. And you can't win in rural counties unless they're meeting - you know, without meeting 20% in rural counties. And they can't win by obstructing all of the policy goals of the president from their own party. He also said that he thinks Democrats in Washington aren't doing enough to convince voters that they can actually deliver on any of the promises that they make. He used the stalled bipartisan infrastructure bill as an example of a policy that would spend a trillion dollars in people's communities but is stuck in Congress because progressives are using it as leverage to press for, you know, more agreement from moderates on social spending. Here is how he described it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK WARNER: For the last 60-plus days, we've had something sitting there ready to be passed - 69 votes in the Senate. I get asked about this every day in Virginia. When are you going to get that done? And it's not just the substance of the bill, but it's showing that you can govern in a way that affects people's lives. CORNISH: This conversation between moderates and progressives is just getting louder and louder, right? SNELL: Yeah. CORNISH: I mean, what does this mean for President Biden's actual political agenda? SNELL: Well, I mean, there's a ton of pressure for Democrats to move forward. We saw earlier this week that Joe Manchin from West Virginia was getting so frustrated about the stalled infrastructure bill that he called a press conference basically to chastise progressives. It's kind of turning into a circular firing squad, with both sides claiming that they're the ones who back the policies that will get voters to turn out and vote for Democrats. But everyone - every single Democrat I've talked to - agrees that they need to actually pass bills. They need to do something. But they're really stuck on some basic issues, like how to pay for all of the spending they want to do. CORNISH: Mara, I want to come back to something in Virginia because a persistent talking point is that the Youngkin campaign had made this promise to ban critical race theory in schools. This has become kind of a catchall term for activists who dislike the way systemic racism is discussed in grade schools. How do you think it played into the victory? LIASSON: Yeah, even though critical race theory is not taught in Virginia schools. But look. Race has been a feature of Republican campaigns for our entire lives, whether it's bussing or crime or affirmative action or Mexican rapists coming over the border. Now it's critical race theory, which is something that most people can't define. Virginia school leaders say it's not taught in Virginia schools. But it's become a buzzword and a catchall for how kids are taught about racism in a way that some white parents don't like. But don't forget, this was also in the context of COVID. Fairfax County Public Schools had been shut down for 18 months. Parents were really fed up. They were fed up with the school closings, with mask mandates. And the critical race theory just fit into all that. The big question for Democrats is, what do they do going forward? Do they just dismiss these kinds of attacks, say they're fake or they're racist dog whistles or bullhorns? Or do they decide it's a serious enough problem that they need an answer for? Now, next year in the midterms, these are federal elections for Congress, House and Senate. Education is a local issue. It's not run by Washington. So it's hard to say if this is going to resonate. But I do think the Republicans are going to say, we are the party of parents. CORNISH: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson and our congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell.

Terry McAuliffe.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Virginia's race for governor, Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin has rallied voters around national cultural divisions playing out in schools in his campaign against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. There's an old saying that all politics is local, but that doesn't seem so apt anymore. In Virginia, thorny cultural issues that have divided people across the country like race and vaccine mandates are all jumbled up as voters decide who to pick as their new governor on Tuesday. GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin plainly stated that if he wins a state that's become reliable for Democrats, it will ripple across the country. \"We have a moment here, a defining moment, where we get to change the trajectory of the great commonwealth of Virginia, not just for Virginians, not just for those who live here, but for the entire United States of America,\" Youngkin said last Tuesday at an event in Danville, Va., near the North Carolina border. Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe was on the opposite edge of the state that same day, at a rally just outside Washington, D.C., with President Biden asking voters to \"show up like you did for Barack and me,\" nodding to the fact that Democrats have won Virginia in every presidential election since 2008, including a 10-point victory for Biden in 2020. McAuliffe won the governorship once before, in 2013, on the heels of Obama's second victory, breaking a trend where the party holding the White House tends to lose the Virginia governor's race. Some took it as a sign that the state was becoming just too Democratic for the party to lose statewide. All signs show an incredibly close race, drawing national Democratic figures like Biden, former President Barack Obama, Vice President Harris and Stacey Abrams to the state in the final days. They are trying to fire up their party's voters and avoid falling to that historic pattern of losing Virginia after winning the White House, especially since Biden's popularity has sagged and Youngkin has kept the race tight in the polls with support from many independent voters. McAuliffe campaigned with the president in Arlington, the reliably blue part of the state with the crowded suburbs of Washington that are a microcosm of a changing America, where you can find a Vietnamese strip mall down the road from a kabob joint. Lisa Soronen is a Democrat who was at the campaign event with her 8-year-old daughter Sasha on a chilly, windy weeknight, even though she's not thrilled with her candidate. \"I was disappointed in some ways that it was Terry McAuliffe because he's already been governor and there are some great women candidates, great candidates of color,\" she said. But Soronen figures at least he knows what to do in the job. She has concerns about the pandemic and how a Republican governor might handle or mishandle the situation in schools. Democratic voter Lisa Sorenen and her daughter Sasha, age 8, at a rally for Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe in Arlington, Va., on Oct. 26.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic voter Lisa Sorenen and her daughter Sasha, age 8, at a rally for Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe in Arlington, Va., on Oct. 26. \"I have a school-age child who isn't vaccinated and my sister in Georgia, she sends me every single COVID notice she has and they're daily, multiple daily, and I don't have to worry about that,\" she said. Schools, school masking, school board meetings, school curriculum \u2014 it's all become possibly the most explosive subject this campaign cycle. Youngkin has been blasting McAuliffe for saying at a debate, \"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\" referring to control of which books are taught in schools. It's been all over local television in the Republican's ads. Harold Anderson is a longtime math teacher in public schools, and at the McAuliffe rally he defended the remark. \"Well, I've been teaching for 30 years. You can't let a parent come in and run a school system. That's why you elect a school board,\" he said. \"They make decisions for you.\" Pundits and pollsters are obsessively watching this governor's race to figure out how schools, the economy and vaccines might all factor into the 2022 midterm elections. Northern Virginia is home turf for Democrats, but there are worries about how many Democrats will actually make it to the polls, especially Black and brown voters. Democratic voter Kelly Hebron, who is a Black woman, says she has been hearing about this. \"Some folks are like, 'Oh, I'm not even going to vote.' And we don't want to hear that because whether or not you're happy or not with a party, this is what we have to work with,\" she said. \"And I think too many people don't feel like they're having a voice, and I think that is why this race is close.\" Drive less than two hours south of Arlington and you find Hanover County, a consistently red part of the state with high voter turnout. Folks here preferred Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. Anthony Hess had just cast his ballot at the main early voting site and said he's skeptical of politicians like McAuliffe. \"He's too, like, nationwide, I think. Not really Virginia-based, bringing in Biden and Obama, and it's not really here,\" he said. \"I think he's more next-level. I want someone that's going to focus on Virginia.\" Hess voted for Youngkin, who has never held public office. He made his fortune leading one of the most prominent private equity firms in the country, the Carlyle Group. And that matters with the economy on a lot of voters' minds. Nicole Anderson has a small construction business that does roofing, who thinks Democrats in the state have handled the economy \"extremely poorly\" and thinks pandemic relief was extended too long. \"Everybody is looking for people to work. No matter what you're doing as an employer, you're dealing with shortages, you're dealing with shortages on materials and equipment and supplies at every single solitary level. And people are not returning to work,\" she said. \"And so it's just going to continue to snowball.\" Republicans nationwide are eager to blame Democrats for inflation and supply shortages. They argue that business-minded Republicans would improve the economy. In Virginia, conservatives are particularly upbeat about their odds in this election. The local GOP chairwoman in Hanover County, Dale Alderman, sees this cultural moment as ripe for Republicans. \"I think people in this county feel that America is kind of on a collision course for very bad things. You know, they don't like critical race theory,\" she said. \"It's basically used to indoctrinate people.\" That's despite the fact that Hanover County Public Schools has said it is not teaching critical race theory. Local Democrats say the academic theory is not the real issue, anyhow, as society confronts racial and cultural changes. Last year, the Hanover school board agreed to rename two schools named after Confederate generals after years of pressure and a lawsuit. \"They don't want to be called racists, but your actions speak for you. And if you have to fight against the simple change in the name of the school, that speaks to me of racism,\" said Pat Jordan, president of the Hanover County NAACP. \"If you have to always threaten and call names of people who come to the school board meetings to express different opinions from you, those are racist things that are being done.\" Pat Jordan is president of the Hanover County, Va., NAACP. She has received threats over her political positions and sees Democratic candidate for governor Terry McAuliffe as an ally.\n                \n                    \n                    Melissa Gray/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pat Jordan is president of the Hanover County, Va., NAACP. She has received threats over her political positions and sees Democratic candidate for governor Terry McAuliffe as an ally. Jordan says she's gotten threats and been told to leave the county, where her family has lived for more than 200 years. She cast her ballot for McAuliffe because she says she wants a governor who is an ally. \"I do not believe that I am going to run from anyone. I just know that change is coming here,\" she said. \"In church we say there's a shifting in the spirit and I feel that shift taking place in Hanover County.

Thomas Leachman is a former Democratic voter who is put off by the way the party focuses on race. He voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but then voted twice for Donald Trump for president and supports Republican Glenn Youngkin for Virginia governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Melissa Gray/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thomas Leachman is a former Democratic voter who is put off by the way the party focuses on race.

You know, I just think he's a, you know, what-you-see-is-what-you-get type person,\" he said, adding that he appreciates the fact that Youngkin is a Virginia native while McAuliffe was born and raised in upstate New York. Leachman at one point motioned to the corner of his lawn, where a Glenn Youngkin sign was standing. \"It's the first political sign that's ever been a Republican in this yard, probably since, you know, whenever they started doing political signs,\" he said. Leachman does have another symbol in his yard that's not a political sign. The Virginia flag billowing from his front porch. It's been there for years, and Leachman says it does not matter who wins the governor's race this Tuesday, he'll keep flying that flag.",

            "article_content": "Eyes are on Virginia this week as voters elect a new governor. We hear from some in blue-leaning Arlington and in solidly-red Hanover about what's motivating them this election.  ASMA KHALID, HOST: There's an old saying that all politics is local, but that doesn't seem so apt anymore. In Virginia, thorny cultural issues like race and vaccine mandates are all jumbled up as folks decide who to pick as their new governor on November 2. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GLENN YOUNGKIN: We have a moment here, a defining moment, where we all get to change the trajectory of this great Commonwealth of Virginia not just for Virginians, but for the entire United States of America. KHALID: That's Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate down near the Virginia-North Carolina border the other night. Meanwhile, on the opposite edge of the state... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TERRY MCAULIFFE: We cannot let Glenn Youngkin be in charge of our children's education or their health. KHALID: The Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, brought the president of the United States to campaign for him at a rally just outside of Washington, D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: So, Virginia, show up. Show up like you did for Barack and me. (CHEERING) KHALID: McAuliffe is running for governor again after leaving office four years ago. We're in Arlington, the reliably blue part of the state. These are the crowded suburbs outside of Washington, D.C., where you can find a Vietnamese strip mall down the road from a kabob joint. It's a microcosm of a changing America. Lisa Soronen is a Democrat, but she's not thrilled with her candidate, even though she's here at his campaign event on a chilly, windy weeknight. LISA SORONEN: I was disappointed in some ways that it was Terry McAuliffe because he's already been governor, and there were some great women candidates, great candidates of color. KHALID: But, she figures, at least he knows what to do in the job. Plus, she says, she's really concerned about the pandemic and how a Republican governor might handle or mishandle the situation in schools. SORONEN: I have a school-age child who isn't vaccinated, and I have a sister in Georgia. She sends me every single COVID notice she has, and they're daily - multiple daily. And I don't have to worry about that. KHALID: Schools, school masking, school board meetings, school curriculum - it's all become possibly the most explosive subject this campaign cycle. We meet Harold Anderson in the crowd just as the campaign speeches are getting underway. He's been teaching high school math at a public school for 30 years, and he told us about this comment that's been making headlines. The GOP candidate, Glenn Youngkin, has been blasting his opponent, Terry McAuliffe, for saying during a debate that he did not think parents should tell schools what to teach. HAROLD ANDERSON: You can't let a parent come in and run a school system, and that's why you elect a school board. They make decisions for you. KHALID: For some people here, the race is about keeping this newly blue state blue. Democrats are getting anxious because polls show the candidates running neck and neck. They say this election should never have been this competitive. Joe Biden easily won Virginia last year. Still, pundits and pollsters are obsessively watching this governor's race to figure out how schools, the economy and vaccines might all factor into the 2022 midterm elections. Northern Virginia is home turf for Democrats, but there are worries about how many Democrats will actually make it to the polls, especially Black and brown voters. Kelly Hebron has been hearing about this. KELLY HEBRON: And some folks are like, oh, I'm not even going to vote, and we don't want to hear that because whether or not you're happy or not with a party, this is what we have to work with. And I think too many people don't feel like they're having a voice. And I think that is why this race is close. (CHEERING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, this is a little bit tricky. KHALID: We drive less than two hours south, and we're in Hanover County, a consistently red part of the state with high voter turnout. Folks here preferred Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: There's yours, and there's yours. Thank you for voting. KHALID: We meet Anthony Hess just as he walked out of the main early voting site. He tells us he's skeptical of politicians like Democrat Terry McAuliffe. ANTHONY HESS: He's too, like, nationwide, I think, not really Virginia-based. Like, bringing in Biden and Obama - it's not really here. I think he's more in the next level. I want someone that's going to focus on Virginia. KHALID: Hess voted for Youngkin, the Republican. Youngkin has never held public office. He made his fortune leading one of the most prominent private equity firms in the country, the Carlyle Group. And that matters because the economy is on a lot of voters' minds - voters like Nicole Anderson, who has a small construction business that does roofing. NICOLE ANDERSON: I did vote for Youngkin. KHALID: OK. How do you think the Democrats have handled the economy here in the state? ANDERSON: Extremely poorly. I understand that things need to be done during the COVID vaccines when things were shut down. But unfortunately, I think they held that relief too long. And so everybody is looking for people to work. No matter what you're doing as an employer, you're dealing with shortages. You're dealing with shortages on materials and equipment and supplies at every single solitary level. And people are not returning to work. And so it's just going to continue to snowball. KHALID: Are you - do - like, supply shortages or people shortages? ANDERSON: All the above. KHALID: OK. ANDERSON: So for instance, the materials on some of the projects that I need are not available until August of 2022, so it makes it exceptionally difficult to be able to do our jobs. KHALID: Republicans nationwide are eager to blame Democrats for inflation and supply shortages. They argue that business-minded Republicans would improve the economy. And here in Virginia, conservatives are particularly upbeat about their odds in this election. The local GOP chairwoman sees this cultural moment as ripe for Republicans. DALE ALDERMAN: People are very involved in Hanover. They're very patriotic. They love their country. I think people in this county feel that America is kind of on a collision course for very bad things. You know, they don't like critical race theory. It's basically used to indoctrinate people. KHALID: To be clear, Hanover County Public Schools has said it is not teaching critical race theory, and local Democrats say it's not the real issue here. PAT JORDAN: My name is Pat Jordan, and I am the president of our Hanover County NAACP. KHALID: Jordan says her family has lived in Hanover County for more than 200 years. JORDAN: So when I'm told by some of the people with differing views from ours to leave Hanover, I say I can't leave Hanover because this is my country, my county. KHALID: Last year, the Hanover School Board agreed to rename two public schools named after Confederate generals. This was after years of pressure and a lawsuit. Jordan wants a governor that's an ally, and so she's cast her ballot for the Democrat, McAuliffe. She says Republicans are sensitive to change. JORDAN: They don't want to be called racists. But your actions speak for you. And if you have to fight against the simple change in the name of a school, that speaks to me of racism. If you have to always threaten and call names of people who come to the school board meetings to express different opinions from you, those are racist things that are being done. KHALID: Have you been called names? JORDAN: I've been called names. I've gotten threats. KHALID: Do you mind me asking what kind? JORDAN: Yeah, the threats that I've gotten are telling me to leave Hanover County because of my quote, \"BS agenda.\" I do not believe that I am going to run from anyone. I just know that change is coming here. In church we say there's a shifting in the spirit. And I feel that shift taking place in Hanover County. And that is why I think there is so much unrest right now, because I believe others see that as well. THOMAS LEACHMAN: This is a family home. This is my grandfather's home. So my grandfather was the longtime Democrat here in the county. KHALID: We meet Thomas Leachman to talk politics on his broad wraparound porch just yards away from the railroad tracks where trains speed by like clockwork. Leachman proudly remembers voting for Barack Obama in 2008. LEACHMAN: Politically, I'm a tough nut to crack. For a majority of my life, I've been more left. KHALID: And in 2013, when Terry McAuliffe first ran for governor of Virginia, Leachman was behind him. So you did identify with Terry McAuliffe as governor when he ran the last time? LEACHMAN: Absolutely, yeah. KHALID: And why so? LEACHMAN: Just because I think he was - he was a different - he was a different person to me. I think he's power-hungry this time, and I think he's changed a lot. I really changed my feelings of Terry McAuliffe towards - when Trump got elected because I felt like he was so, so ugly about Donald Trump. And he wasn't - he wasn't part of the solution. He was part of the problem with some of the - some of the hate that we see. KHALID: It sounded like you voted for President Trump. LEACHMAN: Yes. KHALID: You voted - maybe you voted for him twice. I don't know. LEACHMAN: Yes, I did. KHALID: You voted for President Trump twice. You voted for Barack Obama the first time. LEACHMAN: Yes. KHALID: Not the second time. LEACHMAN: Romney the second time. KHALID: So what's made you move away from that Democratic Party that your grandpa was such a, you know, committed member of? LEACHMAN: One of the things that's really irks me is the rise of identity politics that has been used by the Democratic Party in Virginia over the past six-plus years. That is really what I think has really sent me more so than any other thing because I just - I'm so, so frustrated by everything being racist every single time. KHALID: But more important than party politics, he likes Youngkin. LEACHMAN: I just identify with him more. You know, I just think he's a, you know, what you see is what you get type person. You know, I like his story. He's a Virginian, too. He's a true Virginian, whereas, you know, Terry McAuliffe is a come-here Virginian. KHALID: Just as we were about to wrap up the conversation, Leachman pointed over to the corner of his lawn. LEACHMAN: Over there, you'll see a political sign. First... KHALID: It's a Glenn Youngkin sign. LEACHMAN: Yeah, it's a Youngkin sign, but it's the first political sign that's ever been a Republican in this yard, probably since whenever they started doing political signs. KHALID: And it may not be a political sign, but Leachman does have another symbol in his yard - the flag of Virginia. It's billowing from his front porch, and it's been there for years. Leachman says it does not matter who wins the governor's race this Tuesday. He'll keep flying that flag. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KHALID: This story was produced by Hiba Ahmad and edited by Melissa Gray.

BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraq closed its airspace and land border crossings on Sunday as voters headed to the polls to elect a parliament that many hope will deliver much needed reforms after decades of conflict and mismanagement. The vote was brought forward by six months in response to a popular uprising in the capital Baghdad and southern provinces in late 2019, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest endemic corruption, poor services and rising unemployment. They were met with deadly force by security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas. More than 600 people were killed and thousands injured within just a few months. Although authorities gave in and called the early elections, the death toll and the heavy-handed crackdown prompted many young activists and demonstrators who took part in the protests to later call for a boycott of the polls. A series of kidnappings and targeted assassinations that killed more than 35 people, has further discouraged many from taking part. A total of 3,449 candidates are vying for 329 seats in the parliamentary elections, which will be the sixth held since the fall of Saddam Hussein after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. More than 250,000 security personnel across the country were tasked with protecting the vote. Army troops, police and anti-terrorism forces fanned out and deployed outside polling stations, some of which were ringed by barbed wire. \"Get out and vote, and change your reality for the sake of Iraq and your future,\" said Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, after he cast his ballot at a school in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, home to foreign embassies and government offices. \"To those who hesitate, put your trust in God and go and choose those you deem appropriate,\" he added, reflecting concerns over a low turnout. \"This is our opportunity.\" The 2018 elections saw just 44% of eligible voters casting ballots, a record low. The results were widely contested. There are concerns of a similar or even lower turnout this time. Iraq's top Shiite cleric and a widely respected authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has called for a large turnout, saying that voting remains the best way for Iraqis to take part in shaping their country's future. The election is the first since the fall of Saddam to proceed without a curfew in place, reflecting the significantly improved security situation in the country following the defeat of the Islamic State group in 2017. Previous votes were marred by fighting and deadly bomb attacks that have plagued the country for decades. As a security precaution, Iraq has closed its airspace and scrambled its air force from Saturday night until early Monday morning. In another first, Sunday's election is taking place under a new election law that divides Iraq into smaller constituencies \u2014 another demand of the activists who took part in the 2019 protests \u2014 and allows for more independent candidates. A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted earlier this year authorized an expanded team to monitor the elections. There will be up to 600 international observers in place, including 150 from the United Nations. Iraq is also for the first time introducing biometric cards for voters. To prevent abuse of electronic voter cards, they will be disabled for 72 hours after each person votes, to avoid double voting. But despite all these measures, claims of vote buying, intimidation and manipulation have persisted. The head of Iraq's electoral commission has said that initial election results will be announced within 24 hours.",

Former President Donald Trump continued to champion the lie that he was unfairly stripped of office in the White House race against President Biden, saying Wednesday that the \"real insurrection\" happened on Election Day 2020. \"The Unselect Committee of partisan Democrats, and two very weak and pathetic RINOs, should come to the conclusion after spending many millions of dollars, that the real insurrection happened on November 3rd, the Presidential Election, not on January 6th\u2014which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results,\" Trump said in an unfounded, conspiratorial statement. The deadly January insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was egged on by Trump in the waning days of his single-term presidency, with protesters \u2014 some of whom waved anti-American flags \u2014 storming the Capitol building in an attempt to stop the certification of Biden's election victory. High-ranking lawmakers, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, had to be evacuated to safety as some of the protesters threatened violence, including chants of \"Hang Mike Pence,\" against those inside. Trump's statement comes after Pence, himself a major target of the insurrectionists' ire, attempted to downplay the bloody riot as little more than a protest by rightfully aggrieved Americans. \"I know the media wants to distract from the Biden administration's failed agenda by focusing on one day in January,\" Pence said during a Monday interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. \"They want to use that one day to try and demean the character and intentions of 74 million Americans who believed we could be strong again and prosperous again and supported our administration in 2016 and 2020.\" After Trump left office, Pence had tried to distance himself from Trump about the insurrection, saying he and the former president would never see \"eye to eye\" about the day. Pence's new comments come as many Republican officials are rallying behind Trump and excusing the behavior of some on Jan. 6. Crossing Trump is seen as politically problematic for Republicans seeking relevance and want a future in politics. Pence, who establishment Republicans had initially hoped would serve as a counterweight to Trump's most brash instincts, ultimately came to serve Trump loyally in the White House and beyond, as did much of the party leadership. In the Monday interview, Pence said he and Trump had parted amicably after the insurrection and that he and Trump have talked \"a number of times\" since leaving office. Trump on Wednesday praised Pence's Hannity interview, claiming it \"destroys and discredits the Unselect Committees [sic] Witch Hunt on the events of January 6th.\" He added, \"It will continue anyways, however, because the Fake News doesn't want to focus on Afghanistan, Russia, Taiwan and China, the Border, inflation, and a failing economy.\" Trump continues to stoke speculation that he could run again for the presidency in 2024. This weekend, he is heading to the early state of Iowa to give a speech.",

HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 The hammering typically begins at 8 o'clock sharp and continues through the day, its pulsing sound echoing along the gleaming renovated buildings and canals of this city's harbor district. It's the heartbeat of Hamburg. For the past 10 years, this has been the soundtrack to the transformation of Germany's largest port from one of run-down warehouses to a thriving cultural center filled with loft apartments, hotels and pedestrian trails and capped with a massive philharmonic hall, a glass goliath whose roof is in the shape of undulating ocean waves. This is the city where Olaf Scholz, 63, grew up and served as mayor from 2011 to 2018. Supporters credit Scholz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party, for steering the city's construction spree. Now the German finance minister and vice chancellor, he's shaping up in national polls and debates as the front-runner to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's election on Sept. 26. \"We had real great housing problems,\" says Matthias Bartke, a Social Democratic member of parliament representing Hamburg-Altona, \"and he made, in very few years, Hamburg one of the leading cities of the continent.\" The harbor district of Hamburg is filled with new hotels and loft apartments and is crisscrossed by canals. Former Mayor Olaf Scholz helped transform this district from one of run-down warehouses into a thriving cultural district.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption That's because Scholz came in with a plan, Bartke says, and meticulously executed it. He believes Scholz would do the same as Germany's chancellor. \"Merkel is very good in solving crises when there is crisis,\" he says of the country's leader for past 16 years. \"There are very few people who can handle it better. But she has no idea about the future. And Schulz has a very, very clear plan of how things should develop and look like.\" Scholz's plan starts with the country's minimum wage. He vows to immediately raise it from 9.60 euros to 12 euros an hour, the equivalent of around $14 an hour \u2014 a pay raise for 10 million of Germany's lowest-paid citizens. He also aims to create more housing and make the economy a greener one. But Scholz's two main rivals for chancellor have made similar promises. Observers think the difference is that Scholz has decades of experience at all levels of government, as well as a Rolodex to match. \"He is kind of the identical twin of Joe Biden,\" says Heinrich Wefing, managing editor of the politics desk at one of Germany's largest newspapers, Die Zeit. He calls Scholz a less chatty and gregarious version of Biden. \"They are both men of the apparatus,\" says Wefing. \"They are both centrists. They're institutionalists. They know how to get things done. And they know how to get a law passed. They know how to build consensus, they know how to build coalitions \u2014 and that is what he's best at.\" Heinrich Wefing is the managing editor of the politics desk at Die Zeit newspaper in Hamburg. He draws parallels between the political careers of German chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz and President Biden.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wefing agrees with Bartke that Scholz, as mayor of Hamburg, was able to execute his plan on providing more housing for city residents. But the editor says Scholz's tenure also exposed flaws in his leadership. In 2017, when Hamburg was slated to host the Group of 20 summit, Scholz assured Merkel that it would be a safe and secure event. However, protests turned into riots that led to hundreds of injuries and more than a dozen arson attacks. Bartke and Wefing both say Scholz learned a lesson from the event, but that it tested the limits of his confidence. The following year, Scholz became vice chancellor and finance minister in Merkel's government; the Social Democrats are a junior partner co-governing with Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union party. During the coronavirus pandemic, he has helped keep the economy afloat through a stimulus package that kept workers in their jobs through the country's furlough program, called kurzarbeit. Wefing says Scholz's steady hand through the pandemic has convinced voters that he's chancellor material. And the mistakes of his opponents have convinced voters that they're not. Olaf Scholz, Germany's finance minister, and Chancellor Angela Merkel talk at the beginning of the plenary session in the German parliament, the Bundestag, in Berlin on Jan. 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Bernd von Jutrczenka/dpa/Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In July, during a speech by Germany's president mourning the victims of floods, the chancellor candidate for Merkel's party, Armin Laschet, was caught on video laughing in the background. He apologized, but the gaffe contributed to an already plummeting popularity among voters. Scholz's other main opponent, the Green party's Annalena Baerbock, enjoyed strong polling numbers in the spring, but as voters scrutinized her lack of government experience, they gradually lost interest. That has left Scholz \u2014 a man who the parliamentarian Bartke says is the closest candidate in personality to Merkel. \"I think the people are unhappy to lose Angela Merkel, because for 16 years, she was a symbol of stability,\" he says, a stability that he believes voters now see in the leadership of Scholz. His campaign has exploited this resemblance: One of Scholz's campaign posters uses German's feminine form of the word \"chancellor\" to proclaim, tongue-in-cheek, Er kann Kanzlerin, or \"He's got what it takes to be madame chancellor.\" Back at Hamburg's harbor, tourists from across Germany mill at the base of the towering glass philharmonic hall, a project that was nearly abandoned before Scholz, as mayor, renegotiated the contract, pushing through its construction. When NPR asked tourists which party they'll vote for, many said they're not interested in the election. Of those who were, the preferences ran the gamut, from the left-wing Die Linke party to the libertarian Free Democratic Party. But they all shared one thing in common: All said Scholz would make a good chancellor. Christoph Homes, a security guard from a town on the border with the Netherlands, said he'll vote for Merkel's Christian Democratic Union but expects Scholz to prevail. \"He's been in the game from the beginning and has served in virtually every office,\" said Homes, \"so I think Scholz would be a good leader. It's his party I'm not keen on, and I'm not sure they'll get anything done. But then again, they're just not my party.\" Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Hamburg.",

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Hundreds of Hamas-backed activists on Saturday launched what they said was the first in a series of nighttime protests along the Israeli border, throwing explosives toward Israeli forces who responded with live fire. Organizers said the gatherings, which are to continue throughout the week, were meant to step up pressure on Israel to ease a crippling economic blockade on the Gaza Strip. \"The occupation will not enjoy calm unless the siege on our beloved land is lifted,\" said Abu Omar, a spokesman for the protesters. Israel and Egypt have maintained the blockade since Hamas, a group sworn to Israel's destruction, seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after it won Palestinian elections. The blockade, which restricts the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza, has ravaged the territory's economy. Israel has tightened the closure since an 11-day war in May, demanding the return of the remains of two dead soldiers and freedom for two Israeli civilians believed to be in Hamas captivity. Amateur footage and photos from inside Gaza showed hundreds of Palestinians protesters engaged in Saturday's gathering. Some appeared to be throwing explosives and chanting in celebrations as blasts sounded. The Israeli military said troops responded to the explosives by firing live rounds toward the protesters. It said there were no injuries on the Israeli side. Gaza health officials said three protesters were wounded by Israeli fire. Earlier Saturday, Gaza health officials said a 12-year-old Palestinian boy died from head wounds after being shot during a similar demonstration a week earlier. Another Palestinian man, identified as a member of Hamas' military wing, was also killed in that protest, while an Israeli soldier was shot in the head from point-blank range by a protester. The soldier remains in critical condition. Hamas-linked operatives also launched a number of incendiary balloons from Gaza Saturday afternoon, sparking two fires in southern Israel, according to the Israeli fire service. Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies that have fought four wars and numerous skirmishes since 2007. Israel says the closure is necessary to prevent Hamas from gathering arms while critics say the blockade amounts to collective punishment. Egypt has been trying to mediate a longer-term cease-fire that would ease the blockade and appeared to be making progress last week when it pressured Hamas to restrain a border protest on Wednesday. The following day, Israel said it was easing some of the commercial restrictions on Gaza, allowing vehicles, goods and equipment for rebuilding projects to enter the Palestinian enclave. Israel said the easing could expand further if things remain quiet. The Israeli government reached an agreement with Qatar on Aug. 19 allowing the Gulf country to resume aid payments to families in Gaza, a move aimed at reducing tensions with Hamas. Israel suspended aid payments in May, saying the move was necessary to ensure Hamas did not benefit from cash injections. But Saturday night's protest indicated violence could soon escalate again. At least 260 Palestinians were killed during May's Gaza-Israel war, including 67 children and 39 women, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas has acknowledged the deaths of 80 militants. Twelve civilians, including two children, were killed in Israel, along with one soldier.",

            "article_content": "COVID-19 and the Trump administration's interference have led to a major delay in the release of new census data used for redistricting. It's causing trouble with election preparations around the U.S.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST: This week, the Census Bureau is set to finally release detailed results from last year's head count. Those results are used to redraw voting districts across the country. And the delayed release has been causing chaos in states trying to prepare for future elections. NPR's census correspondent Hansi Lo Wang reports. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: In the middle of a pandemic and back to school season, you may not have noticed the second major set of 2020 Census results are coming out more than four months late. But for lawmakers like West Virginia State Senator Charles Trump... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLES TRUMP: It's frustrating to a lot of us. WANG: Trump, a Republican who's not related to former President Donald Trump, shared that frustration last month during a public hearing with other members of West Virginia's redistricting committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) C TRUMP: We haven't started to draw any maps for the next 10 years yet. WANG: In a normal year after a national headcount, the public would be able to see by now at least some draft maps of new congressional, state legislative and local voting districts based on the latest census results. But COVID-19 and Trump officials interfered. Last year, because of the pandemic, the Trump administration asked Congress for a 120-day extension of the legal deadline for new redistricting data. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: They have to give it. I think 120 days isn't nearly enough. WANG: But a few months after former President Trump said that, his administration tried to move up the release of the first set of census results. That did not end up happening. But it did ultimately force the Census Bureau to further delay new redistricting data because it needed more time to make sure the information is as complete and accurate as possible. In some parts of the country, that's pushed back voting, including in Charlotte, N.C... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MALCOLM GRAHAM: I make a motion that we delay the at large and the mayoral election until 2022. EDMUND DRIGGS: Second. WANG: ...Where Charlotte city councilmembers heard testimony in June from Janice Robinson, a local Democratic Party official who's part of the community group Black Women of South Mecklenburg. Robinson urged the city council to not split up elections among multiple dates because of census delays. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANICE ROBINSON: There's already too much chaos with the dates for our municipal races, which, by the way, is a result of the Trump administration screwing with the census. For those of us on the ground trying to educate voters, this additional chaos will only drive them further away from participating in this important civic duty. WANG: There's also chaos for potential candidates who are planning to run for office but do not know for sure the borders of the districts they would represent. Still, in Virginia, elections scheduled for this November are moving ahead. PAUL GOLDMAN: Right now, they're going to hold an election on districts that were based on the 2010 census. WANG: But Paul Goldmann, a Democratic political strategist who says he may run for Virginia's House of Delegates, has filed a federal lawsuit. Goldman is trying to force the state to hold elections three years in a row, including one next year under new voting maps. GOLDMAN: We have places in the state which has grown dramatically. We know that. We know population has shifted. So some regions of the state will maybe lose a delegate or two. And they'll be gained by another. WANG: Some states getting ready for elections next year, including Colorado and Oregon, have less than seven weeks to finish draft voting maps before their first deadline in the approval process. Ohio's redistricting commission has less than three weeks. Kathryn Sadasivan, a redistricting attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, says shortened timelines risk excluding input from the public. KATHRYN SADASIVAN: They don't have the time to really develop an effective map that they can provide as an alternative to whatever elected representatives put forward. WANG: That's adding another layer of complications. And Sadasivan says civil rights advocates are trying to make sure communities of color are fairly represented. SADASIVAN: Despite the delta variant, despite everything that's going on, we just don't have the ability or the option to wait it out. WANG: Once the new voting maps are out, the wait is on for lawsuits that challenge them before next year's elections. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in 2018, is widely expected to be reelected. Ethiopians are deciding Monday whether to return Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to office as a growing conflict in Tigray has threatened to engulf the region, unraveling the international goodwill that helped win Abiy a Nobel Peace Prize just two years ago. The vote, originally planned for last year but delayed by the pandemic, has been described by Abiy as the first attempt at free and fair elections in the country's history. Speaking at a rally last week, Abiy told supporters of his Prosperity Party that Ethiopia would defy the dire forecasts predicting violence surrounding the polls. \"When the entire world is saying we will fight on election day, we will instead teach them a lesson,\" he said. Even so, Monday's vote got underway against a chaotic backdrop \u2014 with delays in some areas due to violence. In other places, delays were being attributed to other factors, including a boycott over allegations that the ruling Prosperity Party has engaged in harassment of its opposition members. The anti-Abiy parties in Oromia, Ethiopia's largest and most populous state, have decided to sit out the election. Tigray, which held elections last year in defiance of the federal government, will not be voting at all. The country's election board chief, Birtukan Mideksa, said that most of the voting had been peaceful so far, but she expressed concern that opposition parties had complained about violence and intimidation in several regions, including in the state of Amhara, which borders Tigray. \"This will jeopardize the credibility of the election process and its result,\" Birtukan warned. Election observers from the African Union and a number of Ethiopian groups were expected to monitor the balloting. Counting is expected to begin immediately after polls close on Monday, but results could take days. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (center) arrives in Jimma last week during a campaign visit ahead of Monday's vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (center) arrives in Jimma last week during a campaign visit ahead of Monday's vote. Even though Abiy is widely expected to be returned to power, he is seen at  home and abroad as having squandered an opportunity at lasting regional peace by taking a heavy-handed approach against an insurrection in Tigray. But more broadly, the conflict in Tigray and the atrocities committed there threaten to tear apart Ethiopia, said Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation and a research professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. \"Ethiopians are going to the polls under a cloud of doubt as to whether their country can even exist as a single entity in the near future,\" he wrote in an email to NPR. \"In just the last few days, the Tigrayan resistance forces have inflicted heavy defeats on the Ethiopian army, exposing as false [Abiy's] claim to be within sight of a military victory.\" Soon after taking office in 2018, Abiy made an overture to Isaias Afwerki, the president of longtime rival Eritrea, which won a brutal and protracted independence struggle from Ethiopia in 1991. The two leaders forged a historic peace accord aimed at resolving their differences \u2013 a move that garnered accolades in the international community. But the conflict in Tigray \u2013 a region that straddles the border region between Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2014 quickly eclipsed his early peacemaking efforts. Tigray is home to most of the country's estimated 7 million ethnic Tigrayans. The ethnic group accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population. In November, its regional government \u2014 controlled by the Tigray People's Liberation Front, a leftist political party \u2014 launched a siege against a key Ethiopian military base in the region, using tanks, heavy guns and mortars. In response, Abiy ordered a federal offensive. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on both Ethiopia and Eritrea, whose troops are also believed involved in a supporting role in Tigray. In May, the U.S. State Department pointed to \"many credible reports of armed forces in Tigray committing acts of violence against civilians, including gender-based violence and other human rights abuses and atrocities.\" Desalgn Shume, a voter in the capital, Addis Ababa, speaking to The Associated Press, said Ethiopians \"need a government that brings us peace, unity and that will stop the killing everywhere, and we also need to be pulled out from these ethnic divisions.\" As balloting began, U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by reports coming out of Tigray of executions of civilians, sexual violence against children and forced displacement. \"The ongoing deployment of military forces is not a durable solution, and I encourage comprehensive and multidimensional dialog throughout the country to address the real grievances held,\" she added. The Prosperity Party is seen as the front-runner, and the election is expected to solidify Abiy's position. In addition to the violence and boycotts, the regional nature of the anti-Abiy opposition is likely to erode its chances at the polls further. Whether the results are viewed as legitimate depends a lot on what region of the country is concerned, said Tobias Hagmann, an expert on Ethiopia at Denmark's Roskilde University. The election contest \u2014 and who contests the elections \u2014 matters in places such as the Addis Ababa and the Amhara regions. However, \"Tigrayans, most Oromo and many others (in other regions) will see the elections as flawed, as yet another ritualistic exercise by which the ruling party wins,\" Hagmann wrote in an email to NPR. De Waal said much of the electorate is deeply disappointed with the country's prospects. \"Many of the most popular leaders \u2013 including those who led the democracy protests a few years ago \u2013 are in prison or are silenced; key parties are banned; the press is censored; and state media is filled with vitriolic condemnations of traitors and terrorists \u2013 categories that appear to include all ethnic Tigrayans and many, many others,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "President Biden returned to Washington after a summit with Russia's leader. Texas Gov. Abbott wants the state to build its own border wall. And, where things stand after 50 years of the war on drugs.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: President Biden is back at the White House this morning after his high-profile summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The two presidents agreed to keep talking about arms control. Putin said he thinks the two can find common ground there and in some other areas. Biden said the meeting was not that much togetherness, but he was pleased. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was important to meet in person so there can be no mistake about or misrepresentations about what I wanted to communicate. I did what I came to do. FADEL: Joining me now to discuss is White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So what did President Biden get out of this summit? KEITH: As he said, he did what he came to do, which is that he came to say what he wanted to say. That meant raising human rights concerns and pressing Putin on his treatment of political opposition. And it meant raising recent hacks and ransomware attacks attributed to cybercriminals in Russia that have affected a major pipeline, a major meat supplier and other entities in the U.S. FADEL: So when you say Biden raised these cyberattacks, what was said, and what was agreed on? KEITH: The U.S. is looking to see whether Russia will take action against those criminals. And it's definitely a wait-and-see. President Biden said he gave President Putin a list of 16 areas of critical infrastructure. Let's be clear - these are not state secrets. They are on a U.S. government website. But he said that these 16 areas should be off-limits to cyberattacks, including energy and water. And as a way of hinting at a possible U.S. response if these things aren't off-limits, he made the case that it was in both of their self-interests to agree to this. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BIDEN: For example, when I talked about the pipeline that cyber hit for 5 million - that ransomware hit in the United States, I looked at him. I said, how would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields? Said it would matter. KEITH: It was sort of a, that's a nice pipeline you have there; would be a shame if something happened to it. He said that they agreed to begin some diplomatic conversations around cybersecurity, but he also had a fairly heavy dose of skepticism. And he said he'd have to wait to see three to six months from now whether anything changed. FADEL: So how about Putin? What was his main message? KEITH: Putin called the conversations constructive and said there was no hostility. He talked about continuing talks in certain areas, including arms control and cybersecurity. But he also denied any Russian culpability for cyberattacks or election meddling. And when asked about his mistreatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, he brought up the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, seemingly sympathizing with the rioters and arguing they were just people expressing a political opposition. FADEL: Wow. So given the depth and breadth of tensions with Moscow - and Tam, you just gave a long list of all the things Putin's denying - did Biden walk out of this meeting with any more trust in Putin? KEITH: You know, he was asked several variations on this question, especially since Biden's press conference came right after Putin's, where the Russian leader made all of these denials. And Biden said it is not a matter of trusting Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BIDEN: This is not about trust. This is about self-interest and verification of self-interest. KEITH: Biden even lashed out at a reporter who asked why he was confident Putin would change his behavior. Biden said he never claimed confidence, though he did later apologize to the reporter. FADEL: So anything else you're watching with this relationship going forward? KEITH: Yeah, I'll be watching to see if there's any progress on releasing two U.S. citizens who've been detained in Russia, former U.S. Marines Paul Whalen and Trevor Reed. Biden said he raised the issue, but there was no outcome from that. FADEL: NPR's Tamara Keith, thanks. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Texas Governor Greg Abbott wants the state to build its own border wall. INSKEEP: The Republican governor says Texas has to protect itself from immigrants coming across the southern border. You will recall that building a wall was a key priority of former President Trump. But work on that wall stopped when President Biden took office. FADEL: We've got NPR's John Burnett on the line. He's covered the border wall for years. Hello, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So John, is this even legal? Can Texas just put up its own barrier along the Rio Grande? BURNETT: Well (laughter), we'll see. You know, border security is a federal responsibility. It's hard to imagine how the Homeland Security Department under President Biden will hand that off to Texas. We heard some sword-rattling language yesterday about how Texans have to defend themselves from what the lieutenant governor called an invasion from the south. Abbott said the state would initially transfer $250 million from the state budget into a disaster account. And he kicked off a crowdfunding webpage where people can kick in and help build the Lone Star Border Wall. He didn't have any specifics. We don't know how much it will cost, how many miles, where it will go or what the design will be. The governor basically said he's going to hire a bunch of experts, and they'll tell us all that later. FADEL: Some of this language sounds familiar. So how will they get their hands on the land? BURNETT: Right. Well, that's going to be tricky. Abbott says they can put up hundreds of miles of wall on existing state land along the border and on property he expects people to donate to the state. And he says people will install their own fences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG ABBOTT: As we speak, there are state agencies talking to landowners on the border about putting up fencing on their private land to be able to prevent the dramatic influx that these landowners have been suffering from over the past few months. BURNETT: If experience is a guide, good luck with that. Trump built 455 miles of barrier, and very little of it was in Texas because most of the borderland down here is in private hands. I've been interviewing landowners for the last five years, and most people don't want a 30-foot-tall steel and concrete structure on land that's been in the family since Texas was part of Spain. Now, if the state wants to condemn their property to build the wall, they can try. But even the Trump administration, with the vast power of the federal government, had a devil of a time establishing clear title and getting those eminent domain cases through federal court. FADEL: So meanwhile, the Biden administration wants to halt construction of Trump's wall altogether. Right? BURNETT: Right. Biden terminated the national border emergency, cancelled $2 billion and diverted Pentagon funds and stopped construction. Last week, he went even further. He called on Congress to cancel the nearly $1.5 billion it set aside for the wall this year and redirect it to mitigate environmental damage caused by Trump's wall construction. Here's Myles Traphagen with the Wildlands Network in Tucson. He says they're in talks with Biden's people about how to repair damage to mountainsides that were dynamited to put in the wall. MYLES TRAPHAGEN: And so we are very concerned about these locations that are going to be prone to severe erosion and further damage down the line after our monsoon rains arrive this summer. BURNETT: If folks thought the border wall would drop out of the headlines when Trump left office, here we go again. FADEL: Yeah. NPR's John Burnett, thank you for your reporting. BURNETT: You bet, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Today marks 50 years in America's longest war, the war on drugs. INSKEEP: President Richard M. Nixon ushered in new, far more punitive drug policies during a speech from the White House on this day in 1971. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD NIXON: America's public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new all-out offensive. INSKEEP: An offensive that outlasted Nixon's presidency and several other presidencies - it's now gone 50 years and led to millions of people imprisoned, disproportionately people of color. Entire families and communities were affected by mass incarceration, and many people have been asking whether it's time to try some other approach. FADEL: NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann joins us. Thanks for joining us, Brian. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: Good morning. So 50 years, that's a long time. Is there any evidence that punitive measures that came with America declaring a, quote, \"war on drugs\" worked? MANN: You know, the remarkable thing, Leila, is I've spoken to so many experts about this. And the short answer is no. You know, for a long time - a really long time - Democrats and Republicans embraced this idea that drug addiction could be fought this way on a kind of military footing. When he was a U.S. senator, Joe Biden was one of the biggest proponents of this. The U.S. spent hundreds of billions of dollars, hired whole new armies of police and federal agents. And of course, as Steve mentioned, we sent millions of mostly Black and brown Americans to prison on drug charges. But federal officials now acknowledge the streets are flooded with more dangerous drugs than ever before. And we had a record number of overdose deaths last year, more than 90,000 lives lost. FADEL: You know, you mentioned the mass incarceration of Black and brown Americans. So ultimately, these communities bore the brunt of the prison sentences, the enforcement. Right? MANN: Data collected during the drug war has always shown a devastating level of racial bias in the way these laws were enforced. And there's also a sense among Black leaders that the drug war changed policing in their communities in really troubling ways. I spoke to Kassandra Frederique about this. She's with the Drug Policy Alliance. She says police started treating many Black communities like war zones, you know, like occupied territory. KASSANDRA FREDERIQUE: Part of the reason we also need to end the drug war, not just for our loved ones that are struggling with addiction, but we need to remove the excuse that that is why law enforcement gets to invade our space - or kill us. MANN: And Frederique points out that some of the most tragic deaths that inspired the Black Lives Matter protests involve police responding to cases that involve drugs in some way. FADEL: So is this country at some kind of inflection point, a rethinking of this approach? MANN: You know, no one I talked to says the drug war is over completely. But some of the changes we have seen, Leila, already are dramatic. You know, severe laws are being scaled back. That's meant big reductions in prison populations. There's been this unprecedented move toward drug legalization, especially for marijuana. So yeah, we are seeing big changes. FADEL: So is this recognition, then, that this was the wrong approach, this punitive approach? MANN: Yeah. And I think there is a big pivot now toward health care, toward people getting more treatment. That's a very hopeful thing in this moment. But people are telling me still - after half a century dismantling this vast system, the war on drugs, it's begun - that the process could take years or decades. FADEL: NPR's Brian Mann, thank you. MANN: Thank you so much. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Biden meets with European leaders in Brussels. Most pandemic restrictions in California are lifted Tuesday. A father and son from El Salvador describe being separated because of Trump border policies.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: President Biden is wrapping up his work in Brussels today, but he already has his eyes on Geneva. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Which is where he'll sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow. President Biden is looking to set some red lines on hacking and human rights and election meddling and many other things. The president says he knows who he's up against. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I have met with him. He's bright. He's tough. And I have found that he is a - as they say, when you used to play ball, a worthy adversary. INSKEEP: And as he meets Russia's longtime leader, Biden would like to be coordinating his approach with U.S. allies in Europe, who he is meeting today. MCCAMMON: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez joins us now from Brussels. Good morning, Franco. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Sarah. MCCAMMON: So what's on today's agenda? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, Biden and the European leaders are going to launch a new Trade and Technology Council. The idea is to address issues together, like regulation for technology platforms and how to reform the World Trade Organization. And trade has been a point of tension. For example, there are still some U.S. tariffs on European exports of steel and aluminum. These were put in place by former President Donald Trump, and they really offend some European allies. I got to ask Biden about this just before he landed in Brussels. How do you justify that? And what are your plans? BIDEN: One hundred and twenty days - give me a break. I need time. Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Thank you, guys. Thank you so much. Thank you, guys. Thank you. ORDO\u00d1EZ: So he's saying he hasn't had enough time yet since taking office to work all this out in. And a White House official told me last night that talks are ongoing, but it's not going to be resolved overnight. MCCAMMON: And we've heard a lot on this trip about improved relations with U.S. allies. But it does sound like there's been some tension, right? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Right. I mean, there's no doubt that European allies are happy that some of chaos of the Trump years are gone, and they're happy that Biden is committed to working with them on a joint approach to the big issues. But there have been tensions on how aggressive to go in some areas, like China, for instance. I talked to Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund. She told me allies are worried that it could backfire on them. BONNIE GLASER: Well, we have seen a growing tendency in China to retaliate against countries that criticize it. MCCAMMON: And what about Russia? Are the allies concerned about this meeting between Biden and Putin tomorrow? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, not according to Biden. He spent a lot of time talking to them about their concerns, including the NATO members, who are next-door neighbors to Russia. He said he heard nothing but thanks from NATO members. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Every single one that spoke - and I think there were probably about 10 or 12 that spoke to it - saying they were happy that I did that. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, he was asked yesterday about his strategy for Geneva. He said he didn't want to tip his hand, but he said that he would talk about it at a press conference after he meets with Putin. MCCAMMON: And then President Biden will fly back to Washington. What's the White House saying about how they see the trip resonating at home? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, they're spending a lot of time thinking about that. You know, Biden and his advisers have said they want to do a better job connecting foreign policy with domestic policy. You know, they were alarmed that so many Americans heard something that they liked about the America First approach of Trump. And they know they need to show how doing these things, the G-7, NATO, this European summit, connects directly to people's lives. Does it make their lives better? Does it make their lives safer? So in many ways, the hardest part of this trip is really to come when they get back home to the United States. MCCAMMON: That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez checking in from Brussels. Thanks, Franco. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCCAMMON: California is reopening today. INSKEEP: Governor Gavin Newsom is lifting most of the restrictions from the height of the pandemic. Fifteen months ago, you may recall Newsom was among the first governors to order residents to stay home. Just six months ago, California saw some of the highest numbers of new infections in the United States. All that has changed. MCCAMMON: Jackie Fortier, health reporter at member station KPCC in Los Angeles, joins us now. Hi, Jackie. JACKIE FORTIER, BYLINE: Hey. MCCAMMON: California, as you know, is one of the last states to lift pandemic restrictions. What exactly is going to be different as of today? FORTIER: There are three big changes. Masks are no longer required for vaccinated people in most situations. The stay-at-home order is gone. And the color-coded tier system that restricted businesses disappears. It's a big change for Tommy Mofid. He owns The Wrigley Tavern in Long Beach. Since the bar was allowed to reopen in April, he's only been permitted to let half the usual number of people in. But today, he goes back to full capacity. TOMMY MOFID: I'm ecstatic. I feel like June 15 is going to allow us to go back to somewhat of a normal business plan. FORTIER: Now that he's expecting more customers, he wants to hire a bartender and servers. He's been taking out ads and asking around for months. MOFID: When I went to the store across the street to buy a help wanted sign, they had sold out. I really don't know what could cause a shortage in bartenders in Southern California because I have never known that to be the case. But today, there is. FORTIER: He's also got another decision to make - whether to ask his customers to mask up. MCCAMMON: Yeah, and California's masking guidelines have been in flux for weeks. What's happening with those now? Can people just take them off? FORTIER: Well, unvaccinated people are supposed to wear a mask indoors, but businesses can decide whether to enforce that. They have three options for their customers - require everyone to wear a mask, rely on the honor system or use a vaccine verification system, which is supposed to launch later this month. So I'd say people should keep those masks handy. If places they go allow it, vaccinated customers can go back to the gym or sit at a bar next to a stranger without a mask on. But we could see no mask, no service signs. Mask rules for workers gets more complicated. After a lot of pressure from business groups, state regulators are expected to pass rules this week allowing fully vaccinated workers to go without a mask. MCCAMMON: And of course, those vaccines are the big reason so much of the country has been able to open up. How's California doing with vaccinations? FORTIER: Over half of people are fully vaccinated. That puts it ahead of the rate of the U.S. as a whole and puts us ahead of Texas and Florida. Wealthy areas are continuing to get the shots, but vaccinations are trending down in lower income neighborhoods. Latinos and Black residents are behind the rates for whites and Asians. The lowest rates are among Latinos. MCCAMMON: Of course, we've seen so much improvement when it comes to the pandemic. But what plans are in place there in California if things were to get bad again? FORTIER: Well, technically, California is still under an emergency declaration. So the governor could institute another stay-at-home order. But there isn't a specific threshold that health officials have made public. Now the focus is really on vaccine equity, reducing the gaps between racial groups, especially that I just talked about. Rates are about 20% higher in wealthy neighborhoods than in poor areas. The state has been doing cash giveaways to get people interested in the shots. Today, 10 vaccinated Californians will be awarded $1.5 million each. MCCAMMON: That's Jackie Fortier of member station KPCC in Los Angeles. Thanks. FORTIER: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCCAMMON: During the Trump administration, some 5,500 migrant families were separated along the U.S. southern border. INSKEEP: Once it became clear how unpopular that policy was, some officials denied it was a policy at all. But when it began, administration officials said on the record, including here on NPR, that they were separating families in order to deter more people from coming. A new administration has been undoing that policy. MCCAMMON: Our co-host, Rachel Martin, was part of a team at NPR who worked to tell the story of one family who experienced being torn apart. And she joins us now. Morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Sarah. MCCAMMON: So tell us about this family. MARTIN: Yeah. Their names are Melvin (ph) and Nestor (ph). They're father and son from El Salvador. We're not using their last names for their own safety. In 2018, they left home because their family was being threatened by gangs, by organized criminal networks. They felt they had no other choice except to try to make it to the U.S. When they got to the border, though, in June 2018, they were separated under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy. MCCAMMON: So they were separated. What happened next? Were they detained? MARTIN: Yeah, Melvin was held in a detention facility in Texas. Nestor, who was just 11 years old at the time, was eventually sent to New York, where he was cared for by kind of a foster parent. Melvin says he asked immigration officials over and over about his son. He was just desperate for any information. I should say, this story only happened because of the work of MORNING EDITION producer Lily Quiroz. She's the one who spoke with Melvin and Nestor. And I want to play a little bit of their conversation with English interpretation. MELVIN: (Through interpreter) And I began to ask about the kids, and they said, no, you guys are going to return and they will stay here. You guys are going to criminal court, having entered the country illegally. But after the court case, they didn't return us to the same place. They took us to a different place. This is when the despair began. Everyone was asking, and the children and the children, what about the children? And they stopped telling us anything. MARTIN: Melvin was eventually released from detention. He made his way to Southern California, where his brother lives. And then on August 26, Sarah, 2 1/2 months after being separated from his son, Nestor was flown to Los Angeles, and they were reunited. MCCAMMON: How is the family doing now? MARTIN: It's been a lot, but they're stable. Melvin has a job driving a delivery truck. Nestor is starting high school in the fall, and they're waiting for their asylum case to work its way through the courts. But they each, as you can imagine, have suffered a lot of trauma, especially Nestor because he was so young. Once a week for about an hour, he sees a therapist, a trained therapist through a nonprofit called Seneca Family of Agencies. We talked with Melissa Tith. She's a program supervisor with Seneca. She's not working directly with Nestor, but this is what she's seen with other families. MELISSA TITH: We saw some pretty traditional post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, a lot of nightmares, flashbacks, fear of it happening again, not being able to be without their child because of the very, very valid fear of thinking that they're going to be ripped apart once again. MARTIN: And when our producer, Lily Quiroz, spoke with Nestor, he said he definitely struggled with some of those things. But the nightmares are getting better. The fear is subsiding. The Biden administration has started some reunifications, and they said they'll be able to reunite another 29 families in coming weeks. But there are still as many as 2,000 migrant children who remain separated from their families. MCCAMMON: Rachel, thanks to you and to Lily for your reporting. MARTIN: Thanks. MCCAMMON: That's MORNING EDITION's own Rachel Martin. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Time correspondent Simon Shuster says that Andriy Derkach,  a seven-term member of the Ukrainian parliament, gave misleading information to Rudy Giuliani to discredit Biden during the 2020 campaign.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Last week, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether former and current Ukrainian officials tried to interfere in the 2020 election, including by funneling misleading information through Rudy Giuliani. At the time, Giuliani was President Trump's personal attorney. One of the Ukrainian officials under investigation is Andrii Derkach, who was described as an active Russian agent by officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations. Derkach and his contacts with Giuliani are the subject of a new article by my guest Simon Shuster, a Time magazine investigative correspondent who worked out of Moscow for many years and has reported extensively on Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and connections between those oligarchs and Trump allies. Giuliani is not a subject of the Brooklyn investigation, although some of his contacts are. But federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Giuliani illegally lobbied on behalf of Ukrainian officials without registering with the Department of Justice, which would be a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Simon Shuster, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Thanks for joining us again. SIMON SHUSTER: Thank you. Nice to be with you. GROSS: So let's get to Andrii Derkach, who's being investigated by Brooklyn prosecutors. He's the subject of your new article. Just explain a little why he's being investigated by Brooklyn prosecutors - federal prosecutors. SHUSTER: It seems to be in connection to election interference. Now, it's not at all clear really what laws he would have violated, but they're looking at his communications with Rudy Giuliani and his attempts to influence the 2020 elections to help then-President Trump win a second term. Again, we don't quite know what laws he might have violated, so I'm going by the witnesses in the case who have spoken to federal investigators. And they then told me what questions the investigators were asking. And those questions centered around election interference. GROSS: So Derkach is a seven-term member of Ukrainian Parliament. He's still in Parliament? SHUSTER: That's right, yeah. GROSS: And he owned, like, a TV station and a bunch of radio stations. Does he still own them? Is he officially an oligarch? SHUSTER: Those stations have had to shut down because both - the U.S. government sanctioned them as sort of tools of Derkach's broad election interference strategy. So those stations are no longer on air, as far as I understand. GROSS: So when Giuliani met with Derkach in Ukraine, did Giuliani or did anyone in the Trump administration know that Derkach was a Russian agent? SHUSTER: He was certainly suspected of that. And it wasn't a big secret. It's kind of an open secret, certainly in Ukraine and for officials who worked in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. You know, Andrii Derkach studied at the KGB academy in Moscow. This is a well-known fact. It's in his Wikipedia page. So even if the U.S. government had not yet at that point, when Derkach met with Giuliani, the U.S. government had not yet officially identified him in public statements as an active of Russian agent - it wouldn't have taken much to learn about his background and his connections to Russian intelligence agencies. And indeed, some of Giuliani's close associates warned him. And they told me about this. They said, you know, when Derkach kind of appeared on the scene and reaching out to Giuliani directly and indirectly, when they began talking to each other, some of Giuliani's associates told him, hey, be careful. This guy is a Russian asset. He's connected to Russia. And any information he gives you is going to be tainted by Russian security services, so don't work with him. One of the incredible things is that Giuliani appears to have continued working with Derkach despite that advice. GROSS: What did Derkach give him, what disinformation? SHUSTER: Yeah, that was kind of one of the most interesting things of reporting this out. So I got to spend about two hours with Derkach, and he essentially gave me the spiel, the lecture, that he gave Giuliani, including some of the same documents. You know, he had it all prepared in a little manila folder. And it essentially lays out this kind of false narrative that we've been hearing if you, you know, followed the presidential campaign last year - the false narrative around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, and his work for a Ukrainian gas company as a board member. And there are just - there's sort of a whole host of corruption allegations swirling around that. And the allegations are that Joe Biden used the power of his office as vice president to help his son, to help further his son's financial interests in Ukraine and elsewhere. Now, again, this has been thoroughly investigated by journalists, by the Senate, by Republicans in the Senate, and there's no evidence that this is true. But this is the narrative that Derkach was supporting, promoting, popularizing. And the documents and materials that he provided to Giuliani were largely connected to that narrative. GROSS: He gave Giuliani tapes, right? SHUSTER: A little bit more complicated than that - or sneaky. He released the tapes publicly on YouTube. He released them in press conferences that he would hold in Kyiv in the months leading up to the election four times, four separate installments. And then once these were out in the public, Giuliani, then-President Trump, then-President Trump's son Donald Jr., the QAnon forums would just amplify it so that it reached, you know, a very broad cross-section of American voters. So it wasn't like he was secretly and clandestinely handing tapes to Giuliani. No, this was all done right out in the open. GROSS: So what are these tapes? Who made them? Who's on them? SHUSTER: Who made them is kind of a big mystery and something that the Ukrainian authorities are especially keen to figure out because it's quite embarrassing for them. They appear to have been made inside the office of the Ukrainian president. GROSS: Which president (laughter) are we talking about? SHUSTER: President Petro Poroshenko. GROSS: So which president was he? Was he Russian-backed? SHUSTER: No, not at all - not at all. He was, in fact, leading Ukraine throughout the most intense periods of armed conflict with Russia, so he was not. But the tapes - the tapes involve President Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, talking to then-Vice President Joe Biden about a variety of issues, mostly connected to Joe Biden's pushing Ukraine to do more to fight corruption in Ukraine. You know, the U.S. was providing a great deal of aid, financial assistance, military assistance and, therefore, had a very serious stake in making sure that Ukraine cleaned up its corruption and - partly because it wanted Ukraine to succeed and also because it didn't want the aid that the U.S. was providing to be stolen by corrupt officials. So the tapes are essentially, you know, official conversations between the president of - then-president of Ukraine, vice president of the U.S. about corruption. And these are the tapes that leaked out through their Derkach. The tapes don't include anything that's obviously incriminating or even really embarrassing for Joe Biden, but they were used as a kind of evidence of the claims that Derkach and Giuliani were making. And they were used - they said, aha, look, we have you on tape, you know, talking about corruption. And it created the kind of aura of graft or wrongdoing that Giuliani and Derkach were trying to create around Joe Biden. GROSS: When, in fact, what Biden was asking for was kind of the official policy of the Obama administration - and the European Union was on the same page with Biden. So it's not like he was, you know... SHUSTER: Totally. GROSS: ...Stepping out and being personally corrupt or anything like that. SHUSTER: Yeah, yeah. GROSS: So you said that there's nothing really incriminating or even embarrassing in the tapes of Biden that Derkach made public. So how was it used in such a way so that it could make Biden appear to be guilty of something? SHUSTER: The allegation is essentially that - so on the tape, you hear Biden, you know, telling the president of Ukraine that the chief prosecutor is not doing enough to combat corruption. Indeed, you know, that's - that is true according to various European officials and Ukrainian officials that I've talked to that this chief prosecutor was not doing enough to fight corruption. The allegation that you have from Trump, Giuliani, Derkach and their various allies is that Biden, then-Vice President Biden, had an ulterior motive for asking to remove that prosecutor. The allegation is that Biden wanted to remove that prosecutor because that prosecutor was investigating the company where Hunter Biden worked at the time. That's the kind of somewhat confusing allegation that Joe Biden wasn't trying to help Ukraine defeat corruption, he was trying to help his son avoid an investigation. That's the claim. That's the allegation. Now, again, Republican senators in the Senate investigated this for a year. They investigated this particular allegation at great length. And they found last year, I believe, in September, they released a long report saying that, no, Joe Biden does not appear to have used the power of his office to help his son. There's no evidence of that. Indeed, you know, my own journalistic investigations, many other journalistic investigations have looked in great detail at this allegation. You know, did Joe Biden have some ulterior motive to go against this prosecutor? And we've consistently found that there's just nothing to support. That's the case. GROSS: So Giuliani gets this information, puts his own spin on it to try to discredit Biden. When you were talking to Derkach, he offered you a thumb drive over the whole thing. And he also had like a whiteboard. And he outlined this, like, huge conspiracy theory that he has. Would you describe this conspiracy theory and what his, like, flowchart looked like? SHUSTER: Yeah. So he drew out some of the stuff on a whiteboard. He also had this really kind of fancy poster that he'd printed out and was distributing in digital form and in paper form. And it had - it's like a pyramid. And it has Joe Biden at the top right next to this Western billionaire, George Soros, a big kind of Republican boogeyman. And underneath them, like, all these kind of other Ukrainian and U.S. officials, diplomats, spies, you know, a whole kind of panoply of different figures in Ukrainian and American society. And the chart essentially alleges that all of them are sort of mixed up in this grand scheme, conspiracy to enrich themselves at the expense of Ukraine. Yeah, that's the conspiracy theory. Again, you know, no evidence to support it, but it's a sort of very professionally presented narrative, a false narrative. But it's - a lot of work went into making it look legit. And some of that work was, yeah, the kind of the sleek websites the Derkach created, these posters, you know, handing the stuff around on thumb drives and, again, doing this right out in the open. GROSS: He has a name for this conspiracy theory - DemoCorruption. Like, can you talk about that a little? SHUSTER: Yeah. So the term that - the shorthand he uses is DemoCorruption because he insists that not only President Biden is involved in this, but according to this conspiracy theory, the entire Democratic Party is sort of infused with this conspiracy and profiting from it, and all of its kind of financial backers of the Democratic Party are involved. So I think what that does, this narrative that Derkach and allegedly the Russian security services are promoting, gives it a bit more longevity and breadth, right? It's not only focused on Joe Biden. It's focused on the entire Democratic Party. That's - the target is not just Biden. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Simon Shuster His new article in Time magazine is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Simon Shuster, an investigative reporter for Time magazine. He was based in Russia for years. During the Trump administration, he reported extensively on connections between Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and Trump allies. His new article is about how Ukrainian oligarch and seven-term member of Parliament Andrii Derkach gave disinformation to Rudy Giuliani to discredit Biden during the 2020 election. You say that the Trump-Biden presidential debates may have been the first time that foreign disinformation made its way into a presidential debate. Which part of the disinformation are you talking about? SHUSTER: Yeah. I mean, to my mind, as I argue in the story, that was the culmination of the Russian disinformation campaign in 2020. That was the culmination of the election interference operation. During the debate, President Trump repeatedly hurled these accusations of corruption at Joe Biden on the debate stage. It was a fairly confused debate. If you remember, it was the first one, and there was so much crosstalk. And then President Trump interrupted Joe Biden so many times that the moderator was just, you know, incensed and almost had to stop the process. But in there, President Trump makes clear reference to a tape. And he tells Joe Biden - you know, he talks about the sort of - the conversation that Joe Biden had with the Ukrainian president, Poroshenko. And he says, you know, you're on tape doing it. You're on tape doing it. And this appears to be a clear reference to the tape that Derkach released, the tape of Joe Biden talking to the then-president of Ukraine. And I think - you know, I spoke to a former KGB spy who now lives outside Washington. And I got his opinion on, like, you know, what do you think was the main climax of the operation, the point when - the point toward which it was leading? And he's the one who sort of pointed me to this moment in the debate. And he said, look; this is the moment when Trump had the opportunity to, quote, \"fire the political weapon\" that Derkach and Giuliani had loaded for him. And I think that's right. Trump missed. He misfired because there was so much crosstalk because the moderator, you know, kept asking him to stop interrupting and also because I think the American public wasn't really primed or aware enough of these allegations to get what Trump was even talking about. You know, I think most Americans hadn't heard about these tapes. Like, it didn't reach a broad enough audience for American voters to really pick up on what Trump was trying to signal from the stage. But nevertheless, he took - he referred to the tape, you know, from the debate stage. And as this former KGB officer that I quote in the story told me, you know, this was the moment. You know, they would've been popping Champagne, he said, in Moscow over this. GROSS: So let's talk a little bit more about who Derkach is and what his connections are to Russian intelligence. Let's start with his father 'cause his father was very important in Russian intelligence back in the days of the Soviet Union. SHUSTER: Yeah, I'd say that's fair. He was a KGB officer, a career KGB officer. He started earlier in his career as one of the KGB officers in charge of protecting this top-secret factory in eastern Ukraine that produced the Soviet Union's most advanced ballistic missiles. You know, these were the rockets that were designed to carry nuclear warheads and - during the Cold War. So he was - he worked at that factory for some years. And then he proceeded to - he moved to Moscow to study at a very elite - the most elite KGB academy for KGB officers in Moscow, graduated from there. And then, indeed, his son, the main subject of my story, followed in his father's footsteps pretty much exactly. So he gained admission at the same KGB academy in Moscow in 1990 and graduated from there a few years later. Yeah. One of the things he studied there, he told me, was how to organize meetings with secret agents, you know? So this was kind of, at least partly, a clear education of a spy. And he doesn't dispute that. That's his background, and he's not ashamed of it. GROSS: Is he overt about saying, yeah, I used to be associated with the KGB? Like, when you talked to him, did you ask him about his ties to the KGB? SHUSTER: Repeatedly. Of course, yeah. Yeah, he's totally open about that. We talked about, you know, his time studying there. We talked about what it was like. His studies at the KGB academy in Moscow coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union. And we talked about what that was like, you know, to - the empire that he was studying to serve collapsed as he was, you know, two years away from graduation. So, yeah, he's very open about this. And again, a simple Google search - you know, if Rudy Giuliani had Googled Derkach, he would've learned about the fact that he studied at the KGB academy. This is not a secret. GROSS: When you ask him if he's still connected to Russian intelligence, what does he say? SHUSTER: He's quite evasive. And I was surprised by that because, you know, it was my responsibility and one of my goals in the interview to give him an opportunity to respond directly to the allegations of the U.S. government that he is an active Russian agent, essentially a Russian spy. And I repeatedly asked him to address that, and he just kept dodging. At one point he was like, let's talk about your president instead, changing the subject completely back to his narrative about DemoCorruption, about Joe Biden and all that. He was very evasive about his personal ties to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, because the U.S. government has alleged that this operation, this influence campaign in 2020 surrounding the presidential race was, quote, \"probably directed\" by and authorized by Putin. And the U.S. intelligence community has indeed concluded that Putin, quote, \"had purview over the activities of Andriy Derkach.\" So, again, quite an allegation that Derkach was taking orders essentially from Putin last year. And I asked him about this. You know, have you ever met with Putin? And he said things like, yeah, I probably met with him at certain kind of social functions and negotiations, but let's not go into that, you know? And he would just dodge, you know? But he would sort of - nondenial denials throughout. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here 'cause it's time for another break. My guest is Time magazine investigative correspondent Simon Shuster. His new article is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" We'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF QUADRO NUEVO'S \"DIE REISE NACH BATUMI\") GROSS: Let's get back to my interview with Time magazine investigative correspondent Simon Shuster, who spent years reporting from Russia. During the Trump presidency, he reported extensively on ties between Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and Trump allies. Shuster's new article is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Giuliani illegally lobbied on behalf of Ukrainian officials without registering with the Department of Justice, which would be a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Last week, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether former and current Ukrainian officials tried to interfere in the 2020 election, including by funneling misleading information through Giuliani. Andriy Derkach is one of the Ukrainian officials under investigation in Brooklyn. So the way you've described your meeting with Andriy Derkach is that, you know, he sets up a meeting in his office. You're not meeting in a secret location where no one, you know, can see you. You're in his office. He's just handing you over information. It's not in this, like, secretly decoded thing. He's giving you like a file. He's offering you a thumb drive. That's not exactly the kind of, like, spy craft that we're used to hearing. So is this, like, a new approach? SHUSTER: Yeah. It feels pretty new, especially if you compare it to the Russian election interference operation in 2016. At that time, if you remember, you know, the main thrust of the Russian operation was to have military hackers steal and leak emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign. And they did this throughout by trying to hide their identity through proxy servers, through fake personas online. And they were trying to sort of keep Russia's fingerprints off of it as much as possible. In 2020, as you say, the tactics seem to change. It was much more overt. And it seems to be that, you know, a calculation was made that you don't really need to hide behind all this cloak-and-dagger stuff. And, indeed, maybe it hurts you to do that. So they decided that it's fine to just go ahead and be a lot more overt - instead of covert operatives, overt operatives. GROSS: Do you think part of the goal of Derkach meeting with you was to say, look; if I was a spy, I wouldn't be meeting with you? That would be ridiculous. I would just be exposing myself. I'm not a spy. I just believe this. I believe I'm right. And I believe people in America should know it. I'm not guilty of anything. I may be being investigated. I didn't do anything. I'm just following what I believe is the truth. SHUSTER: Yeah. And you just paraphrased his message very clearly. That is what he says. GROSS: (Laughter) Great. SHUSTER: So he says that he went after Joe Biden as a way of exposing corruption not only in the U.S., but, first and foremost, in Ukraine, because, again, this conspiracy theory of DemoCorruption that Derkach invented holds that Ukrainian officials and American officials were kind of colluding - right? - in this cabal. So he says, you know, yes, I went after Joe Biden. But I went after him because he was the sort of figurehead of this grand conspiracy that also involved Ukrainian officials. And, Derkach says, as a member of the Ukrainian parliament, it's incumbent upon me to investigate the misdeeds of those Ukrainian officials. I wouldn't say that's particularly convincing. But that is the story he sticks to. Yeah. GROSS: In terms of Derkach being overt - when Derkach met with Giuliani, Derkach took a photo of them together and posted it on Facebook. And Derkach told you when you met with him that he didn't like secret meetings. Why do you think he posted that photograph? SHUSTER: Yeah. So I reported quite extensively on that particular meeting. It was their first in-person meeting. And I spoke to multiple people who were there, including Derkach. And it was fascinating to hear that he went in there. The setting for the meeting had a kind of cloak-and-dagger aspect about it. It was way out in the outskirts of Kyiv in this hotel that nobody would think to look for Giuliani there. And it was out of the way. It was sort of, you know, it felt secretive to Derkach. So when he arrived for the meeting, he said, I don't like this. This is his recollection. He told Giuliani, I don't like secret meetings. I would like this to be an official conversation. So do you mind if I take a photo? And Giuliani apparently agreed. And there's this photo that Derkach posted that same night on Facebook showing them sitting together in this hotel on the southern outskirts of Kiev as they exchange a sheaf of papers, some documents. And it's remarkable, you know? It's - at the time when that photo came out, it blew my mind because, you know, I knew already then who Derkach was and his connections to - historical connections to the Russian intelligence agencies. And just to see that posted on Facebook, you know, the lawyer of the U.S. president - then-U.S. president - receiving a sheaf of papers from a suspected Russian agent was just remarkable. And it was the - one of the most incredible examples of this overt operative idea that we've been talking about. GROSS: Derkach told you that he has more Biden tapes, five more hours of Biden tapes. Did he tell you what is on those tapes? Did he give you any clues about that? SHUSTER: No. And he actually announced that a couple days after our interview. But it was clear when we met that he intended to continue his, yeah, you know, propaganda war against the Bidens. He had been doing it a week before our meeting. He had released, you know, another kind of long text on his website with documents kind of connected to his theory of DemoCorruption. So he was continuing to do this. And he still is continuing to do this. And one of the things that I kept asking him is, you know, why he's doing it despite the very harsh sanctions that he's faced. You know, he's now under criminal investigation, reportedly, in Brooklyn, right? But even before that, starting in the fall of 2020 last year, he's been under very intense American sanctions that have really hurt him and his family. So his daughter, who went to school in California, she went to university in California, she had her visa revoked. Derkach told me that his 10-year-old son, who goes to a private school - or went to a private school in Kyiv that is affiliated with the U.S. embassy, that that school asked Derkach to take his son out. The school declined my requests for comment on that. But when I was talking to Derkach about it, it was clear that this was very painful for him personally, for his family. You know, what he's doing and the blowback from the American government has been very painful for him and his family. And I asked him, so why are you still doing this? And he didn't give a clear response. You know, he expressed a great deal of anger at the sanctions, and he conceded that they've caused him a lot of pain. But he just said, you know, I'm going to keep doing this because, you know, it's my - I see it as my job to expose corruption. And I'm not going to stop. GROSS: Do you think the conspiracy theories that Derkach has been spreading, including, you know, the false information that Biden worked to further his son Hunter's financial interests in Ukraine, do you think all this still has legs? I mean, so much of this information was brought out during the impeachment hearings in the House, and Trump was impeached in the House. SHUSTER: Yeah, I think it does very much still have legs. I think it's still a very influential narrative. And the reason I say that is, you know, there's a large - former President Trump still has a very large base of supporters. And, you know, among the news media and the online forums that his really devoted supporters use, this narrative that Derkach promoted and fueled is basically part of reality. It has been thoroughly incorporated into the perceptions of Joe Biden within Trump's base. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned while reporting the story is how much QAnon, the online conspiracy theory kind of cult-like movement of Trump devotees, how much they promoted the Derkach material. It was a remarkable thing. You can go back and read all of the statements from Q, the kind of anonymous profit of this movement. And, you know, at a very crucial moment in this movement - this movement is quite obsessed with numerology and, you know, the meaning of numbers and all that - dates, numbers. And there's - a lot of the people in that movement were expecting, what is Q going to post - post No. 4,500 because in kind of numerological thinking, 4,500, the 45th president, right? This should be an important post from Q. And what did Q post in No. 4,500? A link to a YouTube video, 1 1/2 hours long, of Andrii Derkach. And he says, worth reading, listening. So the promotion on the QAnon forums. To me, is very clear indication that, yes, the things that Derkach is pushing and promoting has made it very deep into the bloodstream of a large portion of former President Trump's base. And it's going to continue to be part of the lore of that group of American voters, which is very large. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Simon Shuster. He's an investigative reporter for Time magazine. And his new article is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Simon Shuster, a reporter for Time magazine. He was based in Russia for years during the Trump administration. He reported extensively on connections between Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and Trump allies. His new article is about how Ukrainian oligarch and seven-term member of Parliament Andrii Derkach gave disinformation to Rudy Giuliani to discredit Biden during the 2012 election. For your article in Time magazine about Andrii Derkach, there was supposed to be a photoshoot of Derkach. And then Derkach contacted you at the last minute and said he had to leave Ukraine and couldn't do the photoshoot. What happened to your knowledge? SHUSTER: I don't know, but it was very, very surprising that he suddenly pulled out really at the last minute. He said he had to leave Ukraine in a hurry. He's very sorry. And I didn't think much of it at the time. But when The New York Times reported that he was under investigation in Brooklyn, it crossed my mind. Was he trying to get to safer ground to avoid possible arrest? You know, if this investigation was real, if it was reaching some point of, you know, getting close to an indictment, would he have sought to, you know, get out of Dodge? And I asked him about this. He said, no, that's a ridiculous, provocative question. He said he did not go to Russia. But we don't know. I mean, one thing I can tell you is that I spoke to the president of Ukraine about Derkach and his case. And the president of Ukraine told me on the record that he is very keen to work with the American authorities to investigate any wrongdoing on the part of Derkach. And he emphasized that under his administration, members of the Ukrainian Parliament have been stripped of their legal immunity, so they can now be charged with crimes while serving in Parliament. So he said that, you know, we want to work with the Americans on this case, we're eager to. And he said that his investigators - not his, but the Ukrainian law enforcement - is currently focused on figuring out how Derkach got his hands on those tapes of Biden, because, again, to Ukraine, that was extremely embarrassing that tapes that were apparently made in the office of the former president of Ukraine managed to get into the hands of someone else, Derkach. They don't know how that happened. And President Zelenskyy told me that they're doing everything they can to figure that out. But, you know, the point is that, even in Ukraine, his home country, Derkach seems to be in some potential legal jeopardy. GROSS: Biden and Putin will soon be meeting for the first time since Biden became president. What are you expecting out of this meeting? SHUSTER: Not much. It's not much - a lot of theatrics. And I think, you know, the way that this meeting came to be was quite a victory for Vladimir Putin, you know, in my view and in my understanding of his approach to foreign policy. You know, the way it happened was in the context of a dramatic escalation of the conflict in east Ukraine, a conflict between Ukraine and Russia. And what Putin did is he brought tens of thousands of troops right up to the border of Ukraine. And the world was kept guessing for several days whether Russia was about to invade. And that's quite some brinkmanship there from Putin. And in the context of that, you know, kind of threatened invasion, President Biden reached out to Putin and said, let's meet and talk one on one, you know? And I think this - from people I've talked to in Russia, in Ukraine, this was clearly one of the goals that Putin was pursuing with this escalation of the conflict. He always wants to be treated by the United States as an equal partner, as someone who can, should and must sit down directly with the American president and talk eye to eye. You know, that relationship doesn't really match Russia's economic or political power in the world anymore. We're not talking about the Soviet Union. They're - Russia is no longer, you know, a superpower in the way that it was during the Cold War. But Russia and Putin very much want to maintain that status. And part of - one of the ways that you maintain that status is by holding one-on-one meetings with the president of a superpower, in this case, the United States. So I think, you know, whatever comes out of that meeting - and I don't think it will be very much. You know, it's going to be theatrical. But just the image of Putin standing next to Biden after everything, you know, Russia has done with, you know, needling the United States, challenging the United States, making trouble for the United States around the world, to still be on that stage next to Biden, talking one on one is going to be a propaganda victory for Putin. And, you know, we've seen the Biden administration kind of trying to preempt that criticism. That criticism has been quite loud from various corners in Washington and, indeed, Russia among the opposition movement there. And, you know, they're saying that, look; we need to talk one on one. This is the only way you make foreign policy. This is the way - you know, personal relationships are crucial. And that's all true. You know, I agree with that. And it has been one of Biden's most consistent positions in foreign policy that foreign policy is made on personal relationships. And he has a lot of those relationships. He's been dealing with Putin, you know, at various meetings and summits for years. So, you know, I think it's consistent with Biden's approach. But I think it's also important to keep in mind, you know, how this meeting came about, that it came about by Putin making a direct threat to Ukraine, threat of another invasion, and the U.S. stepping in to sort of - into the breach there to invite Putin to a summit. GROSS: Well, let's take another short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Simon Shuster. His new article in Time magazine is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' \"SMALL PLANET\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Simon Shuster, an investigative reporter for Time magazine. His new article is titled \"How An Accused Russian Agent Worked With Rudy Giuliani In A Plot Against The 2020 Election.\" Russia might not be the superpower that the Soviet Union was, but Russia is still kind of a superpower when it comes to spreading disinformation, when it comes to hacking and ransomware. So they're still causing, like, really serious problems. And it's not the threat of trouble, like nuclear weapons were. Nuclear weapons were a threat, but they weren't happening. Whereas the hacking, the disinformation, the ransomware - that's really happening. And whether it's happening - whether the ransomware is happening from hackers or from the government - and Russia - the Russian government does seem to be implicated in some of the hacking. So, I mean, they're still, like, really influential in terms of causing trouble - serious trouble. SHUSTER: Yeah. I agree with that. And the way that, you know, you - the smartest people who study Russia, the way they think of it is that Putin has been playing a weak hand very well. And he's doing it, you know, with the know-how that comes with a career in the KGB, through kind of semi-clandestine operations that allow him to maintain an air of deniability to always say, no, it wasn't us; it was these hackers over here or this member of the Ukrainian parliament over there. That's one thing. So the deniability is kind of a key aspect of the Russian approach to this kind of low-level conflict that it sees with the West constantly, that it pursues with the West constantly. And another aspect of it is it's very cheap. It's very easy. You know, these operations that we're talking about - hacking, disinformation - this doesn't cost very much. So you know, Russia isn't an economic powerhouse the way that it was in Soviet times. And the kind of, you know, what experts often call hybrid warfare, kind of clandestine warfare that Russia is waging against the West often relies on these very cheap technologies, cheap approaches, operations. You know, you don't need to spend a ton of money to deploy military bases around the world. You can just deploy smartly, cleverly at the right moment, disinformation actors and find enough allies - kind of worm your way deep enough into the American administration or elite circles in Washington to get your message to the right people and to enough American voters. And I think that's destabilizing. But it's done in a pretty clever way. And I think, you know - giving credit where credit is due - Russia has played a weak hand very well. GROSS: Do you have any idea what the Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs who've been in touch with people in Trump's circle and who have disseminated false information given to them by oligarchs, do you know what the oligarchs think of those people from the Trump circle that they've been in touch with? Do you know what they think of Trump or Giuliani? SHUSTER: Let me stick to Derkach - right? - the focus of my most recent report. I certainly talked to him a great deal about what he thinks of Giuliani. And he was quite complimentary. He said Giuliani is a very capable lawyer. And he said that it was very useful for him, for Derkach, meeting with him because Giuliani writes everything down, takes careful notes, never relaxes, never loses attention. And this is what Derkach was telling me about Giuliani. So he was quite supportive. He didn't have anything negative to say about former President Trump either. So on that front, you know, their message is that we very much liked working with Giuliani. You know, more broadly, it's harder to say, you know, what they make of him. The general sense that I get from my sources in Moscow is that Russia was broadly disappointed with the Trump presidency. They felt that he made a lot of promises to improve relations with Russia and to, indeed, forge a stronger relationship personally with Putin. But he was prevented from doing that by various investigations, the Mueller investigation. And he never managed to deliver on the, you know, improved friendly relationship between the U.S. and Russia that Russia was really hoping to see from him. So I think, you know, on the kind of official level in Moscow, there's quite a bit of disappointment. GROSS: So finally - but continuing to examine the relationship between Ukrainian, Russian oligarchs and members of Trump's inner circle, his allies, are we looking backwards? Or are we also looking forwards, because, you know, the kind of meddling and interference that we've seen from Russia and from Ukrainian oligarchs, that's not over, is it? SHUSTER: Yeah. It's not over. And I think it's been very frustrating for a lot of U.S. diplomats and investigators because the kind of overt operation that we saw in 2020, it's very hard to point to a crime, point to a law that it violated. So I think a lot of officials in the U.S. government are concerned that, you know, this sets a precedent that, you know, if there isn't a punishment that fits the crime as the U.S. perceives it, that could send a signal to other countries, to Russia and to other countries that this kind of meddling is somehow OK. Or you can sort of foresee the risk in terms of sanctions to running an operation like this. And you can calculate, is it worth it? Is it not? And the U.S. certainly has an interest at this point in raising the cost. You know, Biden has said this repeatedly, that he wants to raise the cost or impose costs on Russia for its, quote, \"malign activities.\" And the reason is deterrence, right? They want to prevent Russia from doing this in the future. And they want to prevent other countries from taking this playbook and running it in 2022, 2024 and on into the future. GROSS: Well, Simon Shuster, thank you so much for talking with us. And thank you for your reporting. SHUSTER: Thank you so much. GROSS: Simon Shuster is an investigative reporter at Time magazine.

Justin Fairfax makes comments during a debate on a bill during the state Senate session at the state Capitol in Richmond in March 2020. Fairfax denies the allegations against him.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption About a year after two women accused him of sexual assault, Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax makes comments during a debate on a bill during the state Senate session at the state Capitol in Richmond in March 2020. Fairfax denies the allegations against him. Two years after two women came forward and accused him of sexual assault, Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax is now running to become the state's next governor. Not only does he maintain his innocence, he says he was treated like George Floyd and Emmett Till. \"It becomes a complete injustice \u2014 and one that mirrors a history of racial injustice \u2014 when as an African American, you have no opportunity to establish that these allegations are not true,\" Fairfax said in an interview with NPR in March. While Fairfax, a Democrat, connects the allegations that made national headlines in 2019 to a broader pattern of injustices against Black men, some of Fairfax's detractors see his staying power as part of a troubling reversal of the #MeToo movement. Attorney Debra Katz, who represents one of Fairfax's accusers, points to other men her clients have accused of misconduct yet who remain in public service, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In the early days of the movement, even when they denied wrongdoing, prominent men accused of misconduct often stepped back from public life, or acknowledged the potential for misunderstandings in sexual situations, and expressed regret for the pain their accusers say they caused. But that has changed, Katz said. \"The fact that Justin Fairfax is still here seems to be exactly what politicians are doing these days: act completely indignant, never apologize, cede no ground,\" Katz said. \"It seems to be working.\" Fairfax maintains he has nothing to apologize for. Once a rising star in Virginia politics, the lieutenant governor faces a steep climb to the executive mansion. As of the end of the last campaign finance reports in March, his campaign had around $20,000 cash on hand, compared to $8.5 million for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat who easily leads the polls. Nor has Fairfax garnered the kind of national press coverage former state Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan have ahead of the June 8 Democratic primary. Both are aiming to become the first Black woman governor in U.S. history. Still, Fairfax's critics and boosters alike say he should not be underestimated. \"He still can pull it off,\" said Tommy Bennett, a Democratic Party activist in Danville, a small southern Virginia city on the border with North Carolina. Bennett is one of the roughly 8% of likely Democratic primary voters \u2014 and 13% of Black Democratic primary voters \u2014 who support Fairfax, based on a poll from Christopher Newport University last month. Bennett, who also serves as president of Danville's NAACP, said public figures are often targets of fabricated scandals \u2014 especially if they're Black. \"God help what they did to Bill Clinton,\" Bennett said. But to him, it \"depends on your color \u2014 whether you can get away with it or not.\" In an emailed statement, Fairfax's spokesperson Lauren Burke, also accused NPR of being \"a cheerleader for the #MeToo movement and not operating objectively.\" She suggested Black men accused in the #MeToo era are \"assumed automatically guilty\" with no investigation or review of the facts. Others say Fairfax is unfit for office. Adele McClure, Fairfax's former policy director, calls Fairfax \"vindictive\" and says he used his office to bully and discredit his accusers. Adele McClure resigned as Fairfax's policy director after a second woman, Meredith Watson, came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. McClure now serves as the executive director for the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Morley/Virginia Commonwealth University\n                    \n                \nhide caption Adele McClure resigned as Fairfax's policy director after a second woman, Meredith Watson, came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. McClure now serves as the executive director for the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. \"He can't wait to get to that governor's office, because not only does he feel entitled to it, but he knows that he can wield even greater power over those who spoke against him,\" said McClure. Fairfax brought the allegations up on his own in the first debate for Democrats in the race for governor in April, when he likened earlier calls for him to resign to the treatment of Floyd, who was killed by police in Minneapolis last year, and Till, who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955. \"No due process,\" Fairfax said, \"immediately assumed my guilt.\" The comment drew a sharp Twitter response from one of his accusers, Vanessa Tyson, an associate professor of politics at Scripps College in California. She tweeted that Virginia voters \"deserve better\" and she stood behind her decision to come forward. Tyson first went public with her allegations in February 2019, claiming Fairfax sexually assaulted her in 2004 in a Boston hotel room during the Democratic National Convention. Meredith Watson released a statement the same week accusing Fairfax of raping her while they were undergraduate students at Duke University in 2000. The lieutenant governor has denied the allegations, sued CBS for reporting them and repeatedly called for investigations by law enforcement. He ordered and passed two polygraph tests in an attempt to show his innocence. His legal team points to what they say are inconsistencies in his accusers' stories. For example, they have claimed that details in Tyson's story changed from when Fairfax first heard her account from reporters at The Washington Post. He also alleges that he and Tyson remained friendly after the encounter in Boston and that she even asked him to meet her mother, a point she has denied. Fairfax and his attorneys have argued that his accusers' credibility is undermined by their refusal to speak on the record after their interviews in 2019 with CBS and their refusal to respond to questions he has raised about their accounts. They have also described the accusations as politically motivated. An attorney for Fairfax sent a letter to NPR alleging that the details surfaced at a \"conspicuously political time,\" years after the alleged events occurred. They have argued Tyson's unsuccessful run for California State Assembly, after she came forward with the allegations, undermined her claim that she had no political motives. Vanessa Tyson declined to comment for this story. Meredith Watson and her attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, also did not agree to an interview. Katz, Tyson's lawyer, said her client stands by her claims. She said Fairfax is attempting to intimidate his accusers and keep them quiet. Whatever happened at Duke University in 2000 or the Boston hotel room in 2004, the allegations remain on the minds of those who are following the lieutenant governor's run for higher office. 'Catch her in a lie' McClure, Fairfax's former policy advisor, said he immediately won her over when he introduced himself at an event in 2013. Fairfax, then 34, was running to become the Democratic nominee for state attorney general. The former federal prosecutor appeared to be a thoughtful speaker and listener, McClure said. \"He looks you in the eye and makes you feel like he is absolutely listening to everything that you're saying,\" she said. McClure signed up to volunteer for his campaign, which fell short of winning the nomination. They also struck a friendship that included family cookouts and nights out at bars. When Fairfax won the lieutenant governor's post in the 2017 elections, McClure accepted the position as his policy director. A year later in 2018, with the #MeToo movement in full swing, McClure said she first became aware of Vanessa Tyson's sexual assault allegation when Fairfax and two other senior members of his office alerted her that the Washington Post was looking into details of Tyson's claim. The accusation was not yet public. McClure said Fairfax told her the encounter was consensual, and McClure said she believed him. The Post opted not to publish a story at the time, later explaining that \"it could not corroborate Tyson's account or find similar complaints of sexual misconduct.\" The allegation resurfaced after Feb. 1, 2019, a drizzly Friday afternoon, when a conservative blog published Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page. It featured a photo of a person in blackface alongside someone wearing a hooded KKK-style robe. Northam faced mounting calls to resign, and eyes quickly turned to Fairfax, his potential successor. In early February 2019, the top three elected officials in Virginia, all Democrats, were embroiled in different controversies, as pictured here on the front page of The Richmond Free Press.\n\n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In early February 2019, the top three elected officials in Virginia, all Democrats, were embroiled in different controversies, as pictured here on the front page of The Richmond Free Press. That weekend, a screenshot of a Facebook post made by Tyson insinuating Fairfax assaulted her began circulating on social media. In the office, McClure said an idea emerged to stage a coordinated attack against Tyson. The plan allegedly called for using Black women and anonymous social media accounts to question Tysons's credibility. McClure said she thought the plan was rejected after she and Fairfax's chief of staff, Larry Roberts, objected to it. Neither Fairfax nor Burke, his spokesperson, responded to questions about McClure's account of this alleged plan or the internal discussions surrounding it. In an interview, Roberts said he did not recall any conversations about trying to attack Tyson online and said he never would have agreed to that plan had it taken place. \"I am sure there were strategic conversations about 'Well, what do we do with the information that we have?'\" said Roberts, who now serves as director of the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership at the University of Virginia. Roberts said they were wrestling with how to respond: \"'When will we be allowed to say things without it looking like we are trying to stifle a woman bringing forward a story?'\" According to Roberts, the team ultimately settled on pointing reporters toward information that they argued undermined Tyson's credibility. McClure put it more bluntly: \"They were desperately, desperately, throughout the week trying to catch her in a lie to discredit her.\" McClure discussed the alleged tactics with Julia Billingsley, Fairfax's scheduler and the most junior staffer in the office. Billingsly said she felt like senior staffers were gauging her loyalty. \"It felt less of, 'How can I support these employees of mine, these members of our team?' And very much more 'Do they pose a threat to this office?' \" In the months following the public accusations, Fairfax did sometimes take his defense to Twitter. He has named Tyson and the second accuser, Meredith Watson, or their attorneys in more than a dozen Tweets, in one case tagging Tyson directly. He called the women \"false accusers\" and claimed Watson \"fabricated the allegation.\" Others have seemed to follow Fairfax's lead. Debra Katz, Tyson's attorney, has also noted a handful of anonymous Twitter accounts that defend Fairfax or attack his critics. \"I don't believe that these are real Twitter users,\" Katz said. \"I believe that this is a weaponized use of Twitter and social media. And I believe it's part of coordinated campaigns. And it does have a chilling effect on women. And it's very, very hard to police.\" NPR has not been able to verify who is behind the accounts. Roberts said he worried about \"everyone involved in the situation,\" including McClure, Billingsley, Watson, Tyson, and Fairfax. He argued he had run a \"very careful, thoughtful, ethical and attentive office\" where \"we empowered people of color and women.\" Roberts said, though, that McClure and Billingsley face a very different future than Fairfax. \"They get to go on and live their lives,\" Roberts said. \"He spends the rest of his life as an accused rapist.\" 'Lost the moral legitimacy' By Friday of the week Tyson's allegation came out, McClure and Billingsley, Fairfax's scheduler, said they were exhausted. McClure said she was getting into bed when she saw a headline that \"hit like a ton of bricks.\" Meredith Watson had come forward to accuse Fairfax of raping her when they were undergraduate students at Duke University in 2000.

Fairfax issued a statement that night denying the allegation and has continued to assert his innocence. Among other things, Fairfax has named another student who he said witnessed the encounter and would vouch that it was consensual. The other student has never come forward and did not respond to an interview request for this story. Watson has not publicly responded to Fairfax's claim that there was a witness. That night was when McClure and Billingsley said they knew they could not continue to work for the lieutenant governor. They began drafting a resignation letter but hoped someone would reach out to explain what was going on. They said Fairfax never did. \"The silence from Justin was deafening,\" McClure said. That same night, three consultants and two staffers for Fairfax's political action committee also resigned. One of the staffers for Fairfax's PAC, David Mills, is married to state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who is now a rival Democratic candidate in the race for governor. Several months later, McClure spoke out against her old boss at a Take Back the Night event in Arlington, Va., and said he had \"lost the moral legitimacy to hold public office.\" In communication with NPR, Fairfax's lawyers alleged that McClure is biased and supports McClellan. McClure has not publicly endorsed anyone in the race. 'There should be an investigation' In an interview earlier this year with NPR, Fairfax suggested that his accusers should face consequences for what he calls false allegations. \"There should be accountability when you falsely accuse someone of these kinds of crimes,\" he said. In Sept., 2019, Fairfax filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit against CBS for two interviews the network aired in which anchor Gayle King asked Tyson and Watson about their allegations. A district court judge dismissed the case in 2020, without reaching the issue of truth or falsity. It is now before the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. Fairfax has also repeated calls for prosecutors \u2014 and the media \u2014 to more closely vet the allegations, arguing that he had not been granted the same due process as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \"I think when people make allegations, there should be an investigation,\" Fairfax said. \"That's what's happening in New York. That's what didn't happen in Virginia.\" Outside the Capitol in Richmond on Feb 4., 2019, Virginia Lt. Gov.

Gov. Justin Fairfax addresses journalists about the sexual assault allegation against him from 2004. Because the accusers said the sexual assaults took place out of state and before Fairfax held public office, Virginia's attorney general, Mark Herring, does not have the jurisdiction to investigate them in the way that New York Attorney General Letitia James is currently examining the in-state accusations against Cuomo. Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts, the states where the encounters took place, would not comment when asked if their offices are investigating the accusations. Both Tyson and Watson have called for bipartisan legislative hearings into the allegations, but Democratic lawmakers refused, arguing they lacked a formal process for doing so. Katz, who represents Tyson, said she was \"very disappointed\" with that decision. Fairfax's defense appeared to be working, Katz said, insofar as it kept him on the campaign trail and debate stages. The broader #MeToo movement, she said, would be judged by its staying power. \"We had a moment that really galvanized the country, where we said, 'This is enough, no more.' \" Katz said. \"And yet, we're in a pandemic now, priorities have shifted and there's less of an urgency, it seems.\" On the campaign trail Fairfax had a busy spring in Virginia. He cast a tie-breaking vote legalizing the adult possession of small amounts of marijuana. He's toured schools in Bristol and shot hoops in Hampton Roads, campaigning with a message he says centers on justice, inequality, and racism. \"The people have always been on our side,\" Fairfax said in an interview in March. Both Fairfax's critics and backers describe the former prosecutor as an agile, charismatic speaker capable of moving deftly between audiences. \"He can go to the White House and he can go sit on the front porch in the projects,\" said Tommy Bennett, the Democratic activist in Danville.

Monica Hutchinson, founder of the Henrico County Democratic Black Caucus, said she understands the history underlying Fairfax's claims of unequal treatment. \"I am a cisgendered Black woman, married to a Black man, with three Black teenage sons,\" Hutchinson said. \"I completely understand that the justice system is not fair and is not blind.\" Still, Hutchinson said the allegations represented a \"dark cloud\" over Fairfax's candidacy. She's an enthusiastic backer of Jennifer McClellan, a Democratic candidate who has served in the state legislature over 15 years and is polling roughly evenly with Fairfax. Virginia made history in 1989 by electing the first Black governor in the U.S., Democrat Douglas Wilder. Now, she said, it could do so again by placing a Black woman at the helm. \"You put the weight of the world on our shoulders every single election,\" Hutchinson said. \"We're no longer going to stay in the shadows. We're coming out.\" In an interview in March, Fairfax said he expects his political career to continue even if he loses the June 8 primary. \"I've always been focused on being engaged in public service,\" he said. \"That's really where my heart's always been, and that's where it will continue to be.\"",

Russia says it will begin a phased reduction of troops from its border with neighboring Ukraine \u2013 apparently ending a deployment that had alarmed Kyiv and Western observers concerned about a possible repeat of Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking on Thursday after overseeing drills in Crimea involving more than 10,000 troops, appeared to suggest that the ominous troop buildup on the border was more or less a routine training exercise. He ordered ground troops to return to bases in Vladikavkaz and Novosibirsk and airborne units to Pskov, Ivanovo and the Krasnodar region, beginning Friday and finishing by May 1. Russian naval forces in the Black Sea were also part of the military exercise. \"I believe that the goals of the snap inspection have been fully achieved,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Shoigu as saying. \"The troops demonstrated the ability to reliably defend the country.\" \"In this regard, I have decided to complete the Southern and Western military district reviews,\" he added.

Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and is supplying an armed insurgency in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, which borders Russia. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the de-escalation by Russia but said Kyiv would remain vigilant. \"The reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. \"Ukraine is always vigilant, yet welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence & deescalate the situation in Donbass.\" The reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension. is always vigilant, yet welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence & deescalate the situation in Donbas. Ukraine seeks peace. Grateful to international partners for their support #StrongerTogether Shoigu ordered military chiefs to \"analyze the snap inspections in all levels of management and draw up a plan to eliminate shortcomings,\" according to Interfax. He also said that despite the troop reduction, Russia would keep a close tab on planned NATO exercises. Most of Ukraine was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the late-18th century and Ukraine was a founding republic of the former Soviet Union. It finally gained independence from Moscow with the collapse of the U.S.S.R. Although not currently a NATO member, Ukraine has long expressed a desire to join the Western alliance \u2013 a move Russia says would be a \"huge strategic mistake.\" Earlier this month, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was hoping to hasten progress toward NATO membership and announced that it would take part in joint military exercises known as \"Exercise Cossack Mace\" with NATO forces later this year. The Kremlin had rebuffed U.S. and European concern over the buildup, saying it will defend its national interests the way it sees fit. On Wednesday, Putin \u2014 who has ignored calls by Ukraine for talks to defuse the situation \u2014 warned NATO to stay clear of Russia's \"red lines.\" Russia ordering troops back to base after their deployment to the border is an important and timely move, a NATO official told Reuters. \"Any steps towards de-escalation by Russia would be important and well overdue,\" the unnamed NATO official said. \"NATO remains vigilant and we will continue to closely monitor Russia's unjustified military build-up in and around Ukraine,\" the official said. The tensions in Eastern Europe come at a particularly fraught time for relations between Washington and Moscow, with the U.S. ramping up sanctions against Russia in retaliation for a major cyberattack, the Kremlin's alleged interference in U.S. elections and reports that the Kremlin offered the Afghan Taliban bounty payments to kill American troops stationed there. Putin's government has denied all the allegations. Washington has also expressed concern over the health of Russia's main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a prison hunger strike. He is reportedly in precarious health.

The sanctions against Moscow signal that \"we are going to be clear to Russia that there will be consequences when warranted,\" the White House press secretary says. President Biden is ordering a new round of economic sanctions on Russia \u2014 a response in part to Moscow's election meddling and a Kremlin-linked computer breach that penetrated numerous U.S. government networks. Biden said Thursday that the United States isn't pushing for \"a cycle of escalation and conflict\" with Russia, but instead for both nations to manage tensions and work together when needed. But the president also said that during a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he made it clear that any actions taken against the United States would be met with proportionate repercussions. \"My bottom line is this, where it is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will. If Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,\" Biden said. \"We will always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people and our allies.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that \"our objective here is not to escalate, our objective is to impose costs for what we feel are unacceptable actions by the Russian government.\" The sanctions are also meant to impose a penalty over Russia's continued occupation of Crimea, which it infiltrated and annexed from Ukraine seven years ago, and for reportedly offering bounties for attacks against U.S. and coalition military personnel in Afghanistan. Psaki said that while the U.S. believes with \"low to moderate confidence\" that bounties were offered by Russia, \"we had enough concern about these reports that we wanted to have our intelligence community look into them.\" \"We still feel there are questions to be answered by the Russian government,\" she added. She said the sanctions signal that \"we are going to be clear to Russia that there will be consequences when warranted.\" On the possibility of a Biden-Putin summit at some point in the future, Psaki said that \"the invitation remains open.\" The Kremlin has denied any involvement in U.S. elections or on offering the bounties. Moscow has also said it had nothing to do with the SolarWinds computer attack. Speaking after the measures were made official, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the \"aggressive behavior\" would lead to an \"inevitable\" response and that the U.S. would \"pay\" for the deterioration in relations. \"The United States is not ready to come to terms with the objective reality that there is a multipolar world that excludes American hegemony,\" Zakharova said. In December, reports emerged that U.S. technology firm SolarWinds had been hit by a cyberattack that went undetected for months as the company sent out software updates with the hackers' code to its clients worldwide. The attack \u2014 first identified by cybersecurity firm FireEye when its own systems were found to have been compromised \u2014 later allowed hackers to infiltrate U.S. government networks, including those used by the Homeland Security and Treasury departments. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking with CNN on Thursday, said that the White House believes the sanctions \"are proportionate measures to defend American interests in response to harmful Russia actions, including cyber intrusions and election interference.\" A fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday morning said, \"The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable.\" \"We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory,\" it said. \"However, we have also been clear \u2014 publicly and privately \u2014that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.\" According to the White House, the latest sanctions target more than 30 Russian entities and individuals it said are involved in election meddling. The U.S. is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission from the country. The sanctions target six Russian tech firms believed to provide support to Russian intelligence. The sanctions also include a prohibition on U.S. financial institutions participating in the trade of bonds used by the Russian government after June 14. They leave open the possibility \"to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia as appropriate.\" On CNN, Sullivan said that in a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, Biden made clear that \"his goal is provide a significant and credible response, but not to escalate the situation.\" \"We believe that altogether, both the actions we are taking today and that broader diplomacy, can produce a better set of outcomes for U.S.-Russia relations,\" Sullivan said. Senior administration officials, speaking to reporters on background, said the U.S. has \"no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia\" and that the sanctions are intended to be \"proportionate and tailored\" to the Kremlin's past actions. While the latest sanctions are meant as a response to Russia's meddling in the 2020 presidential election, they follow on from Obama-era sanctions that called out the Kremlin for similar interference in the 2016 presidential race. Former President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed or denied any Russian involvement in the 2016 election, calling the accusation a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax.\" A U.S. intelligence report released last month confirmed that Russia sought once again to aid Trump in last year's election.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration is taking a victory lap on vaccinations but is being challenged by the surge of unaccompanied minors at the southern border.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: America is reopening thanks to accelerating vaccinations. Is America also reopening to migrants now that there's been a change in administrations? NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Let me raise this like this. President Biden says the U.S. is hitting his vaccination goal weeks ahead of schedule and this country will send doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine not being used in the U.S. to Mexico and Canada. He's been in office just two months. This is, of course, first and last, great news for millions of people. Does some credit have to go to the previous administration? ELVING: The previous administration did not prioritize the pandemic itself, as we know, but it did prioritize finding a vaccine. It does get some credit for that. At this point, shots are finally being produced, being distributed and getting into arms, and that's what matters. So instead of wondering when things might get better, we are seeing things get better. And while there are still variants and other wolves in the woods, we can finally better - feel better about the weeks and months ahead. SIMON: Of course, another surge of unaccompanied minors at the border. Elsewhere on the show, we talked to Senator Murphy of Connecticut about the visit that they made, and he said that he thought the press, in fact, should be permitted in and that you wouldn't want children staying in those conditions for 10 minutes. What is the Biden administration doing that's different than the Trump White House did? ELVING: The Biden White House supports the bill that passed in the House this week. That bill would create a path to citizenship for the DREAMers, the residents here illegally but brought here as minors, and also for certain farmworkers. Those are generally popular provisions. So it's easy to see why there's a different signal being sent and why we're seeing big numbers at the border again. And the U.S. has not built back the infrastructure that was dismantled, the infrastructure to deal with such numbers humanely. But there is at least a difference in the preeminent intention here behind the respective policies of the two administrations, this one and the last one. The current emphasis is on relieving a humanitarian crisis as best as possible while trying to manage the spikes in new arrivals. And the former administration's paramount priority was closing down and showing that new arrivals were not welcome and will be dealt with harshly. SIMON: Could more get done on so many issues, including recovering from the pandemic, immigration, infrastructure and climate change, if that Senate distinction known as the filibuster was at least modified? ELVING: It might be better to ask whether anything can get done if the filibuster remains intact, Scott. Filibusters have had a long history, but suffice it to say they've primarily been used to preserve arrangements from the past, such as segregation in the South, most famously. As such, the tactic was usually reserved for issues of paramount importance for each senator. But nowadays, we have what's called the silent or the virtual filibuster, and it gets used routinely to block the majority on virtually everything of any importance at all. That's changed the dynamic and made the tradition much harder to defend. And now it seems to represent not just the rights of the minority party, but the rule of the minority party. So if some senators want that, they should be willing to come to the floor and say so and to own up to it in broad daylight. SIMON: Meetings in Alaska between the U.S. and China this week didn't last very long. I was taken by the BBC's description of them as ill-tempered. ELVING: Yeah, and that may have been a British euphemism. Both sides seemed primarily interested in a display of toughness toward the other country, a contest to see who had the most crust, as the Brits might say. But while that made the headlines, you know, there were also negotiating sessions that followed, and those were a lot less bellicose. SIMON: Ron, President Biden agreed in an interview that Vladimir Putin is a killer. Vladimir Putin told the press, I wish Joe Biden good health. Sounded like a quote straight out of Al Capone. Next week, possibly new sanctions will be leveled as punishment for Russia's interference in U.S. elections. Are the West and Russia in a new cold war? ELVING: We should make a distinction between the Putin regime and the Russians. As a people, they might very well prefer a warmer relationship with the West. The Putin regime has a highly self-interested agenda, even a personal agenda, built around the survival of an autocrat. And Putin and his cronies are under increasing pressure at home and abroad. So this is a relationship bound for turbulence for some time to come. SIMON: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

            "article_content": "First lady Jill Biden speaks as she visits the Christa McAuliffe School in Concord, N.H., Wednesday, March 17, 2021, to pay tribute to the New Hampshire woman chosen 35 years ago to be America's \"Teacher in Space\" and to emphasize that the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan signed into law by President Joe Biden last week will provide funding for the reopening of schools.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption First lady Jill Biden speaks as she visits the Christa McAuliffe School in Concord, N.H., Wednesday, March 17, 2021, to pay tribute to the New Hampshire woman chosen 35 years ago to be America's \"Teacher in Space\" and to emphasize that the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan signed into law by President Joe Biden last week will provide funding for the reopening of schools. Here are two trends that very well may be preoccupying the White House right now: One, midterms tend to be rough for a president. The more seats the president's party holds in Congress, the more they tend to lose, according to data from the UCSB's American Presidency Project. In fact, if you plot seats lost or gained against seats held, the slope points decidedly downward. Since 1934, the president's party has lost on average 11% of their House seats in midterms. Were Democrats to have even an average midterm election next year, their 219-211 majority in the House would become a narrow minority. And with a similar trend in the Senate, the party could easily lose its as-narrow-as-possible majority there. Now, to trend number two: the higher the president's approval, the less painful the losses. Case in point is George W. Bush, who had a 67% approval rating ahead of the 2002 midterms and bucked history when his party gained eight seats. And it is perhaps with those front of mind that the White House put together this week's travel plan for the president, vice president, and their spouses. The trips were meant to be ways to tout the American Rescue Plan, which expands unemployment, gives $1,400 to many American adults, and expands the safety net in a variety of other ways. Those trips also just happen to go to places where Democratic lawmakers are set to face tough reelection prospects, as well as places where the party may see the opportunity to pick up GOP seats. White House press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged the political benefit of the trips, highlighting Georgia \u2014 a purple state where newly elected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock will be up for reelection next year. \"That's a state where [President Biden] campaigned with the two newest members of the Senate, in part on a commitment to deliver on these $1,400 direct checks, which is part of what was signed into law last week,\" she said. Psaki said this before an Atlanta-area shootings this week that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent. In light of that, Biden and Harris will still be making a planned trip to Atlanta but plan to focus on meeting with community leaders, while postponing a political celebration of the rescue package. Polling released this week by Democratic super PAC Priorities USA found that a plurality of voters the group considers persuadable \u2014 40% \u2014 believed Biden's economic policies would be \"good for people like you.\" Comparatively, 25% said the same of Republican Congress members' economic policies. \"Coming out of the American Rescue Plan and looking forward into infrastructure and other economic policies that the administration is focused on, we have an opportunity to zero in here specifically on these persuadable voters,\" said Guy Cecil, chairman of the super PAC, in a call with reporters this week. Below is a rundown of where the president, vice president, first lady, and second gentleman traveled this week, and the political stakes in those places ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. March 15 \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff to Las Vegas, NV Las Vegas borders on Nevada congressional districts 3 and 4, held respectively by Democrats Susie Lee and Steven Horsford. Republicans consider both of those members vulnerable, per a recent memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee that lists both as being in \"battleground districts.\" (And indeed, both districts are within just a few points of the national partisan split, per the Cook Political Report's Partisan Voting Index.) Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is also up for reelection next year. It's a race Cook listed as \"likely D\" in late January, but it's also a state that has only the narrowest of Democratic leans. March 15 \u2014 First Lady Jill Biden to Burlington, NJ Burlington is smack dab in center of New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District, held by Democrat Andy Kim. He's another member the GOP will be targeting, and with good reason: It's a district where Trump narrowly edged out Biden in November, according to 2020 results tabulated by Daily Kos. In addition, Burlington is near Philadelphia, always a focal point in national elections. That means word of Jill Biden's visit may have reached voters across the metro area's media market, potentially reaching the crucial Philadelphia suburbs (see next item on this list). March 16 \u2014 President Joe Biden to Delaware County, PA Delaware County is part of Pennsylvania's 5th Congressional District, which covers the inner western suburbs of Philadelphia. It's a solidly Democratic district, but also a key suburban area that helped deliver the state \u2014 and presidency \u2014 to Biden last year. In addition, touting economic accomplishments in Pennsylvania may be a sign of the White House on offense for 2022. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring from his seat in the purple state, and that race is considered a toss-up, per Cook. March 16 \u2014 Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff to Denver, CO Colorado doesn't have any obvious swing districts in the immediate Denver area; the state's tightest House race in 2020 was in the large third district, taking up much of the western half of the state. That seat is held by controversial far-right Rep. Lauren Boebert. The state does have one senator running for reelection next year: Michael Bennet, in what is considered a solidly Democratic seat. March 17 \u2014 Jill Biden to Concord, NH In New Hampshire's Senate race next year, Democrat Maggie Hassan will defend the seat she narrowly won in 2016 from Republican Kelly Ayotte in the swing state. As of late January, the state was preliminarily considered a \"likely\" Democratic win, but Hassan could have a tough campaign ahead if she's running against the state's popular GOP Gov. Chris Sununu, who has said he's \"definitely open\" to running. Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas will also be defending his seat in a swingy district that went for Obama in 2012, then Trump in 2016, then Biden last year. He is another Democrat whom the NRCC says it is targeting. March 17 \u2014 Doug Emhoff to Albuquerque, NM New Mexico has a congressional election coming up much sooner than 2022: the 1st District seat, which Deb Haaland vacated to become Interior Secretary. That election, by law, will happen within the next three months, according to the New Mexico Secretary of State. A visit to the state touting the White House's economic policy could boost Democrats in that race. March 19 \u2014 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to Atlanta, GA Georgia is of course a swing state that went blue for the first time since 1992 in the presidential race, a crucial part of Biden and Harris' victory. That makes it an important place for the White House to continue to focus attention. As mentioned above, one of the state's new Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock, has to run again next year to win a full term. However, the president and vice president's visit took on new, solemn importance this week, after the Atlanta-area shootings. Biden and Harris are now meeting with Asian-American community leaders on their Friday visit, along with state legislators. They will also visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to talk about progress against the pandemic, a public health priority which is also politically important. And the White House says to expect a return trip to Georgia before long.",

            "article_content": "President Biden is telling migrants \"don't come,\" as a humanitarian crisis grows at the U.S. border with Mexico. The administration is sending most people who cross the border back to Mexico.  NOEL KING, HOST: President Biden had this message for people who are coming through Central America and Mexico to the U.S. border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I can say quite clearly, don't come. And what we're in the process of getting set up - and it's not going to take a whole long time - is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don't leave your town or city or community. KING: That was in an interview with ABC News. The president said his administration is sending most people who cross the border back to Mexico. But children traveling alone - more than 4,000 of them - have been allowed to stay in the U.S., largely in cramped Border Patrol centers. Angela Kocherga of member station KTEP is covering this story from El Paso. Good morning, Angela. ANGELA KOCHERGA, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: President Biden's message there was very explicit. He is responding to events that tend to be cyclical. The people who are coming to the U.S., why are they coming now? KOCHERGA: Well, there are many reasons. But because it can be such a long journey to get to the U.S.-Mexico border, many migrants left their home countries before the presidential election, without knowing who might win. And I spoke with Jose Hernandez, who traveled from Honduras. He's a father of two. He left his family back home and is planning to send money as soon as he can enter the U.S. and find work. He told me he had to leave Honduras because the situation is so bad there. JOSE HERNANDEZ: (Speaking Spanish). KOCHERGA: He says necessity forced him to leave, that the economy in his country is so terrible there are no job opportunities. He says Honduras is devastated by hurricanes that flooded nearly half the country. Now, he already tried to cross into the U.S. once a few weeks ago and was turned away, and he says he's going to try again. KING: OK. You spent many years covering the border region. Is there something different this time? KOCHERGA: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says this migration surge is on pace to be the biggest in nearly two decades. Customs and Border Protection says they apprehended more than 100,000 people at the border with Mexico in February alone. Now, that's the highest monthly total since 2019. About 40% of those migrants have tried to cross multiple times, so that's driving up the total. And again, children traveling alone are not being turned away. According to CBP, more than 400 children are arriving at the border alone every day, some as young as 6 years old. Families with children and people who are adults older than 18 are being sent back to Mexico. And many are from other countries, mostly Central America. KING: And what happens after people are turned back and sent into Mexico, particularly if they're not from there? KOCHERGA: Well, across the border in Juarez, Mexico, they've got their own surge to deal with, not only as more people arrive to try and enter the U.S. but those that are being sent back to Mexico. In Juarez, there's a humanitarian relief effort. I spoke with Enrique Valenzuela, and he's the coordinator of the Chihuahua Population Council, which is helping manage shelters to take care of all the people who are prevented from entering the U.S. And here's what he had to say. ENRIQUE VALENZUELA: We believe that at this point we need to set up and build up more capacities. We need more shelters. And, of course, we need everything that comes with that and health care and attention for children, of course. KOCHERGA: So, again, there's the humanitarian crisis on both sides of the border. And Mexico is coping with its own surge. And not just here in Juarez along this stretch of border, but many border cities in Mexico, there are similar problems, Noel. KING: Angela Kocherga of member station KTEP in El Paso. Thank you, Angela. KOCHERGA: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Police in Georgia are investigating a series of deadly shootings in the Atlanta area. The humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is growing. Without people paying rent, landlord are struggling.  NOEL KING, HOST: Police in Georgia are investigating multiple deadly shootings that took place in the Atlanta area last night. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Eight people were killed, many of them reportedly women of Asian descent. Authorities are still investigating a motive, but we will note that advocacy organizations have recently released data that shows that reports of hate crimes against Asians have surged nearly 150% in 2020. KING: With us now is Alex Helmick, a reporter with WABE in Atlanta. Alex, I know you've had a very long night. Tell me, what do we know so far? ALEX HELMICK, BYLINE: Well, police say four people were shot and killed north of Atlanta in Cherokee County at a place called Young's Asian Massage. Another person was shot and taken to the hospital there. Not long after that shooting, about 40 miles away in northeast Atlanta, shootings at two more spas killed another four people. The spas were across the street from each other. Police say many of the people who died appear to be Asian women. KING: OK. Police have arrested one man. What do we know about him? HELMICK: Twenty-one-year-old Robert Aaron Long, who's white, does not appear to have a criminal record. Police say he's from Woodstock, Ga., about 30 miles north of Atlanta. He was arrested about 150 miles south of Atlanta in Crisp County, where he's being held. The sheriff there says state troopers arrested him after ramming his vehicle along the highway. And authorities say they have surveillance video of Long allegedly near the first parlor - that's the one in Cherokee County - around 5 o'clock yesterday evening when the shooting occurred. And Atlanta police say Long's vehicle was picked up on surveillance after that and have pieced together that Long's black SUV was in the area of the two Atlanta parlors. So officials say it's extremely likely this was the same suspect for all three shootings. KING: Have the police said whether or not they believe this was racially motivated? HELMICK: They have. And they say they're still investigating a motive. They have said, as we've mentioned, that most of the victims appear to be of Asian descent, but they haven't directly linked race to this shooting. KING: OK. And, Alex, what do you know about what will happen next? HELMICK: Well, officials say Cherokee County authorities are working with Atlanta police to further link the suspects in the shootings. And the FBI says it, too, is assisting both law enforcement agencies. And Long will likely be moved from south Georgia, presumably to either Cherokee County or Atlanta. And Atlanta police say they are planning a press conference for later this morning. KING: And I imagine we will learn a bit more about some of the victims. WABE's Alex Helmick. Alex, thanks for your reporting. We appreciate it. HELMICK: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. President Biden said this to people who are trying to make their way through Mexico to the U.S. border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I can say quite clearly, don't come over. What we're in the process of getting set up - and it's not going to take a whole long time - is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don't leave your town or city or community. MART\u00cdNEZ: He was speaking in a recent interview with ABC News. The Biden administration is sending most adults and families who crossed the border back across to Mexico. Now, that is causing a humanitarian crisis there. KING: Angela Kocherga has been covering this story. She's a reporter with member station KTEP in El Paso. Good morning, Angela. ANGELA KOCHERGA, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: All right. So President Biden's message there was explicit. He is responding to real events, a surge in people coming to the border. These events tend to be cyclical. The people who are coming now, why are they coming? KOCHERGA: Well, Noel, there are many reasons, but because it can be a long journey to get to the Mexico-U.S. border, many of these migrants tend to leave their homes - and they said they left their homes - months ago before the presidential election without knowing who won or who would have won. I spoke with Jose Hernandez who traveled from Honduras, and he's a father of two who left his family back home and is trying to send money to help support them as soon as he can enter the U.S. and find work. And he told me he had to leave Honduras because the situation is so bad there. JOSE HERNANDEZ: (Speaking Spanish). KOCHERGA: And what he told me is necessity forced him to leave. The economy in his country is so terrible. There are no job opportunities, he said, and that Honduras is devastated by hurricanes that flooded nearly half of the country. And we should say he has already tried to cross into the U.S. once a few weeks ago, and he was sent back to Mexico, and he says he's going to try again. KING: You have been covering the border region for many years. Is something different this time? KOCHERGA: Well, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says the surge of migrants is on pace to be the biggest in nearly two decades. And Customs and Border Protection say they've apprehended or expelled more than 100,000 people at the border with Mexico in February. Now, that's the highest monthly total since 2019. Many of those crossing have tried once and will try again. They're returned to Mexico. So at least 40%, according to CBP, are those that are going back and forth trying multiple times, driving up the total. The surge has come in a relatively short period of time, and that's putting a lot of pressure on local communities and authorities on the border. And children traveling alone, they are not being sent back to Mexico. So more than 4,200 unaccompanied children are currently being held in the U.S. And according to CBP, more than 400 children are arriving at the border every day. Parents and families with children and people older than 18, adults, are being sent back to Mexico. And many who try to cross are from other countries, mostly Central America, so that's not their home country. Now, Border Patrol's processing center in El Paso that was built about a year ago to address another spike in migration during the Trump administration is already filled to capacity. It can hold about a thousand migrants. And Border Patrol is now expanding that facility into the parking lot here in El Paso to make room for more people. KING: I want to ask you about something you said there. You said a lot of these people are from Central America. They are being sent to Mexico, which is not their country of origin. What is then happening to people once they arrive in Mexico? KOCHERGA: Well, across the border in the city right here from El Paso, Juarez, Mexico, they've got their own surge to cope with, not only as more people arrive to try and enter the U.S., but they're also helping those who are returned to Mexico. They're providing humanitarian relief. And I went to Juarez and spoke with Enrique Valenzuela. He's the coordinator of that relief effort. And they're helping set up shelters and working with churches to help take in all the people who are prevented from entering the U.S. Here's what he had to say. ENRIQUE VALENZUELA: We believe that at this point, we need to set up and build up more capacities. We need more shelters. And, of course, we need everything that comes with that and the health care and attention for children, of course. KOCHERGA: So, Noel, it's not just here in Juarez. It's at many border cities all along the U.S.-Mexico boundary. KING: Angela Kocherga is with member station KTEP in El Paso. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. So the latest round of COVID relief passed by Congress has billions of dollars in rental assistance for people who are out of work and trying to avoid eviction. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. Thing is, though, this could benefit landlords, too. Many have been struggling to keep their apartment buildings up and running, and some are helping residents try to get the new COVID relief money they're entitled to as quickly as they can. KING: NPR's Chris Arnold has been following this story for months now. Chris, you've been talking to landlords, and what are they telling you? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Noel. So, yes, I've been talking to them. I talked to some in Texas this week. And, you know, they say it's a big challenge just to keep the lights on and keep things running. You know, this is sort of a shocking number. Nearly 10 million Americans are still behind on their rent payments, according to the Census Bureau. So, I mean, that's just - I mean, that's scary in terms of the level of evictions we might be facing if we don't fix that. But that's also a lot of money that landlords are not getting. And I talked to Stephanie Graves who owns buildings around Houston. STEPHANIE GRAVES: I have a small property in town. It's about 22 units, and eight residents have not been able to pay over six months on and off. We'll get a hundred dollars on a thousand-dollar rent. ARNOLD: Now, Graves says she's not evicting anybody if they can pay a little bit of money when they can and they stay in communication with her, but that means that she's losing money and the rents that she's bringing in don't cover her mortgage and can't pay the staff. GRAVES: Then we had the freeze in Houston, and the hot water heater gave out. And so that was a $22,000 investment we had to make with no income. And then I worry, how am I going to pay that loan if this goes on for much longer? KING: What are she and other landlords doing to survive this? ARNOLD: Well, at some properties, stuff's just not getting fixed. Like, she says if a security gate breaks, she doesn't have the $5,000 to fix it. The pools and the gyms are closed at some of her properties just because they don't have the money to pay for the extra cleaning and to have people say, hey, you know, don't stand so close together. And then you've got the folks who are paying rent who get mad and they're like, I'm paying for the pool, you know? And then so, like, they get mad at the, you know, grounds people or the maintenance. Anyway, so there's frustration all around. Graves and other landlords for all these reasons really want to get this money that was passed by Congress. It's upwards of $50 billion in the last two stimulus bills. So they're, like, out there knocking on doors. They're setting up computers in their offices and trying to help renters apply so that - the way it works is the renters apply and then the money flows to the landlords. KING: And is that happening now? Are renters able to access that COVID relief money as we speak? ARNOLD: Well, that's the thing. It's starting to happen now. Like, these portals are opening and then they're crashing and, you know, so people are able to apply, but it's going to take months for this money to flow through the states and reach many of the people who need it. Meanwhile, you know, there's a federal order aimed at preventing evictions - this is from the CDC - but that expires in two weeks. And housing groups are worried, look, that's not enough time if we allow evictions to start going ahead. So here's Peter Hepburn with the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. PETER HEPBURN: What we're worried about is that if those protections are allowed to lapse, we could see, you know, a million eviction cases filed in very short order across the country. ARNOLD: And, you know, this is happening during a pandemic and evictions spread COVID. There's been research about this. People double up and families move in together. And, you know, we're talking about 10 million people behind on their rent. That hurts people financially, too. So housing groups want to see that CDC order strengthened and extended. Basically, look, let's pause evictions a few more months and give people time to get this money. KING: NPR's Chris Arnold. Chris, thanks so much. ARNOLD: Thanks, Noel. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

President-elect Joe Biden is under pressure to walk away from his pledge to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justine Trudeau said completing the project is a key priority for him. On this side of the border, one of the unions that want Biden to allow construction on the pipeline to continue is an Oklahoma local with a history of racism and sexism. Pipeliners Local 798 faces a new class-action lawsuit that claims Black members were denied promotions that were given instead to less-qualified white coworkers. The Pipeliners union is a powerful force in pipeline construction. With more than 8,000 members it works on pipeline construction projects across the country and has been a vocal supporter of the Keystone XL. The union's history is relevant to Biden's position on the pipeline because environmental justice is a centerpiece of the president-elect's plan to address climate change. Biden vowed to protect communities of color that are disproportionately harmed by pollution and ensure people of color are given preferential treatment in developing clean energy jobs. The plaintiff in this newest lawsuit, which was filed in November, is a Georgia man named Rodney Jones. His attorney says he's not commenting on the case as it proceeds through the court system. The complaint, filed in federal court in Tulsa, says Jones worked as a welder helper for the union in 2019 and was subjected to racial slurs and jokes from white coworkers. The complaint says when Jones tried to advance to the journeyman level, he was denied that opportunity while less-qualified white workers were allowed. Another Black member of the union named in the case, J.M. McIntosh, says a white colleague threw a rock at him partially blinding him in the eye. In the complaint, McIntosh says fellow union members refused to take him to the hospital, while a white welder with a similar injury was taken to a doctor immediately several days earlier. \"We're confident in the facts that will be presented. We're passionate about the cause... And we're happy to represent these people and to help them find some justice if we're able,\" says attorney Matt Miller-Novak. The company building the Keystone XL pipeline was quick to respond to allegations made against one of the unions that would get work building the project. \"We have no tolerance for racism in our company. Inclusion and diversity are at the heart of who we are and embedded in our core values,\" TC Energy Spokesperson Terry Cunha tells NPR. Local 798 is part of a national union, the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, which signed a labor agreement with the company last year. The local has lobbied for the pipeline as part of its effort to secure more work for its members. Pipeliners Local 798 did not respond to NPR's request to comment on the case. But in 2017 Business Manager Danny Hendrix told NPR his union has a clear policy prohibiting discrimination. At that time, NPR reported that for about 20 years Local 798 was under a strict oversight of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The union was forced to actively recruit and admit women and African-Americans. In the court case leading to that oversight, federal court Judge H. Dale Cook noted in his decision that there were \"no black members and there were no female members until the eve of the trial, May 1986, when Local 798 admitted a woman into the membership.\" The EEOC ended its oversight in 2007 but members continued to experience racism that included things like nooses left at work sites where Black workers could find them and racial slurs scrawled on pipelines. Three decades later, when NPR pointed out to Hendrix that his entire leadership team continues to be all white men Hendrix said, \"The cream always comes to the top and I've surrounded myself by some of the best leaders in the pipeline industry. Are they white? They just happen to be, yes.\" Environmental groups that have long opposed the Keystone XL pipeline were quick to criticize the Pipeliners union. \"Reports of racial discrimination within the oil industry is unsurprising given the history of violence and racism in how fossil fuel corporations have pushed dirty pipeline projects through Indigenous, Black, low income communities of color, poisoning their water and land for profit,\" said Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Director, at 350.org. On Monday TC Energy announced it would power pumping stations along the Keystone XL with renewable electricity by 2030. It was an apparent bid to save the project as it was widely reported in Canada that Biden was preparing to withdraw a presidential permit needed to continue construction. Emissions from operating the pipeline are not what's controversial. Instead it's the oil sands crude the pipeline would carry from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. What critics call \"tar sands\" oil emits more of the greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change because it needs more processing to make it usable. The 1,700-mile, $8 billion pipeline that would carry oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast was first proposed in 2008 and rejected by the Obama administration, and then revived under President Trump. The union has not yet responded to the initial complaint, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages but does not name a specific amount. While it's not clear how many black members of the union might be represented in the case, attorneys estimate it is more than 500.",

Updated at 4 a.m. ET Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' victory early on Thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in Washington, D.C. Extremists emboldened by President Trump had sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern American history by staging a violent insurrection inside the U.S. Capitol. \"To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,\" Vice President Pence said once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. \"Violence never wins. Freedom wins, and this is still the people's house.\" Biden and Harris finished with 306 electoral votes, while Trump and Pence had 232. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. In a statement released just after the certification was finalized, Trump at long last acknowledged his election loss. He said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, \"there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.\" \"I have always said we would continue our ... fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!\" Dozens of Republican House lawmakers, along with some Republican senators supportive of Trump, had planned to object Wednesday to the electoral votes of as many as six states that backed Biden. But late Wednesday night, some Senate Republicans withdrew their objections. Each objection requires the backing of a member of both the House and the Senate to be considered. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Braun of Indiana and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia all said that they would stand down. \"I cannot now, in good conscience, object to the certification of these electors,\" Loeffler said Wednesday, drawing applause from some of her colleagues. Loeffler was one of two Republicans who lost their races on Tuesday, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who took up Trump's call that lawmakers object to the results of the election, said Wednesday night that the Senate should consider his objections, but that they should be debated \"without violence, without attacks, without bullets.\" Senate lawmakers voted late Wednesday to reject the challenge to Biden's victory in the state of Arizona, and the House followed suit, but with many Republicans in favor of overturning the state's results. A similar result played out for the state of Pennsylvania, with both chambers voting to reject the challenge to Biden's victory there. Republican House lawmakers also objected to the electoral votes in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, but no senator would join in those objections. \"In that case, the objection cannot be entertained,\" Pence said repeatedly, chairing the proceedings in his role as president of the Senate. So the count continued, state by state, with Vermont's three electoral votes putting Biden and Harris over the 270 mark, until finally Wyoming's three electoral votes were tallied for Trump and Pence. How the chaos unfolded The process to affirm Biden's victory began in the early afternoon. The typically ceremonial affair, an affirmation of the democratic process, was expected to be a bitter, hours-long endeavor because of objections planned by Trump's congressional allies, despite the fact that they were certain to be met with bipartisan defeat. But as the process began, a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, bringing the counting of the electoral votes to a halt. Lawmakers were evacuated from the building as the violent, chaotic scene played out, prompting a citywide curfew. One woman was killed by a Capitol Police officer in the Capitol. Wednesday night, D.C. police said three other people died from medical emergencies in the surrounding area. Around 8 p.m. ET, hours after the Capitol was breached, lawmakers were cleared to return to finish debate and tally the Electoral College votes. In separate speeches in their respective chambers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to press ahead with the business at hand. \"We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. We are back at our posts,\" McConnell said, adding, \"and we're going to do it tonight.\" Trump's pressure The scene that unfolded at the Capitol on Wednesday was the culmination of months of efforts by Trump and his allies, publicly and privately, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Some of those efforts were based on unproven claims of fraudulent vote counts, while others were founded on baseless conspiracy theories. Trump had been particularly focused on Pence's role, publicly ratcheting up pressure on his vice president in recent days \u2014 including as he addressed supporters on Wednesday \u2014 to back his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. Pence, though, said Wednesday that he did not have the power to change the outcome of the election or to unilaterally delay the certification of Biden's victory. And the insurrectionists that disrupted the certification of the Electoral College votes did so after Trump spoke to them, demanding that they fight to \"stop the steal\" of the election \u2014 a false claim \u2014 and descend on the Capitol. \"After this, we're going to walk down \u2014 and I'll be there with you \u2014 we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down to the Capitol,\" Trump said earlier Wednesday, \"and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\" As the mob drew down on the Capitol, Trump remained largely silent and did not make widespread remarks condemning the violence, or attempts to quell it. At one point, he tweeted a short video in which he repeated claims \u2014 without evidence \u2014 regarding voter fraud and a stolen election, while saying \"we love you\" to the mob that had descended on Washington and urging them to go home. Later Wednesday, he tweeted that \"these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\" Twitter later demanded that the tweet and video be removed, and the platform temporarily locked the president's account, threatening to permanently suspend it. Condemnation of the president For his part, Biden called on the president to direct his supporters to end what he described as an \"unprecedented assault\" on democracy that \"borders on sedition.\" \"I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,\" Biden said in brief remarks. The president-elect also suggested that Trump was to blame for the violence, saying that \"at the best, the words of a president can inspire. At their worst, they can incite.\" As the chaos unfolded, some House Democrats have called for impeaching the president again during his final two weeks in office. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter that she was drawing up articles of impeachment. \"We can't allow him to remain in office, it's a matter of preserving our republic,\" she wrote. Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline faulted the president for the violence that consumed the Capitol and said, \"We should impeach and convict him tomorrow.\" Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark, D-Mass. called the president \"a traitor to our country and our Constitution\" and called for him to be removed from office \"and prevented from further endangering our country and our people.\" Donald Trump is a traitor to our country and our Constitution. He must be removed from office and prevented from further endangering our country and our people. 2/2 Trump also faced critics within his own party for his role in egging on the mob. \"What happened today was nothing short of a coup attempt. The President of the United States has been lying to his supporters with false information and false expectations,\" Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said in a tweet. \"He lit the flame of incitement and owns responsibility for this.\" And Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said that it's \"past time\" for Trump to \"accept his defeat, quit misleading the people, and repudiate mob violence.\"",

The New York City Council on Thursday approved legislation that would expand voting rights to hundreds of thousands of legal noncitizens, allowing a once-disenfranchised segment of Big Apple taxpayers a chance to participate in the local democratic process. The measure was easily approved by the City Council with the support of a number of advocacy groups, who say that New York's legal permanent residents have the right to weigh in on who leads the city and how their tax dollars are spent. If the bill is enacted and if it survives legal challenges, New York City would become the largest jurisdiction in the United States to allow noncitizen voting. Noncitizens would remain barred from voting in state and federal elections. New York is home to a massive immigrant population. Voting-aged, legal permanent residents account for some 900,000 of the city's 7 million adult residents. The legislation would open the door for hundreds of thousands of those residents to vote in local elections, including the nationally significant mayoral race. The voting rights bill applies to noncitizen residents who've resided in the city for at least 30 days, including green card holders, DACA holders and those who are legally authorized to work in the country. The decision moved forward without the help or support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has questioned the legality of the measure, but nonetheless said he would not veto the council's decision. Despite its relatively easy coast to council victory in the Democratic stronghold, the legislation will likely face legal challenges, including from Republicans, who have spearheaded efforts across the country to enact new voter restrictions. \"American citizens should decide American elections \u2014 full stop. Today's decision in New York is the product of a radical, power-hungry Democrat Party that will stop at nothing to undermine election integrity,\" Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement, adding that the RNC is reviewing legal options.",

            "article_content": "The delta variant is sparking concerns of a new COVID-19 wave in the U.S. Historic flooding devastates parts of West Germany. And, a federal judge ruled last week that the DACA program is illegal.  NOEL KING, HOST: Back this winter, around the middle of January, the number of new COVID-19 cases in this country started dropping. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: There was a blip upwards in April, but immediately after that, cases just kept going down, down and down. Then in late June, something happened - cases went way up. On June 21, the CDC recorded just over 8,000 new cases in the U.S. On July 16, there were 39,000 new cases. Hospitalizations are going up; deaths are going up. What gives? KING: NPR's Allison Aubrey is here with some answers. Good morning, Allison. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: These numbers do not sound good. AUBREY: Yeah. The U.S. is averaging about 30,000 new cases a day. This is far fewer than the 200,000 or so cases a day back in the winter, but it's triple the number of cases compared to just late June. What's happening is that there are significant increases in states with low vaccination rates, including Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned yesterday on CNN that the rise in hospitalizations and deaths that are largely preventable may continue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VIVEK MURTHY: I am worried about what is to come because we are seeing increasing cases among the unvaccinated in particular. And while if you are vaccinated, you are very well protected against hospitalization and death, unfortunately that is not true if you are not vaccinated. AUBREY: In fact, 97% of people hospitalized now with COVID are unvaccinated. I mean, there are instances where fully vaccinated people are getting infected, so-called breakthrough cases, but they tend to get much less sick. And as CDC Director Walensky has said, this has really become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. KING: What role is the delta variant playing? Because we keep hearing about how contagious it is, et cetera. Is that what's going on? AUBREY: Yeah, the delta variant is about 225% more transmissible than the original coronavirus strain. So when it finds pockets of unvaccinated people, Noel, it just spreads much more quickly. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb spoke on CBS yesterday about what this means in the coming weeks and months. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT GOTTLIEB: This variant is so contagious that it's going to infect the majority - that most people will either get vaccinated or who've been previously infected or they will get this delta variant. And for most people who get this delta variant, it's going to be the most serious virus that they get in their lifetime in terms of the risk of putting them in the hospital. AUBREY: He says the variant just cannot be underestimated. And that's why there are yet again more pleas to the roughly 30% of adults who have yet to be vaccinated in the U.S. to go ahead and get the shots. KING: You know, I was in the grocery store this weekend, and I noticed a lot of people not wearing masks, which I have seen for the past few weeks, but it was just very noticeable this weekend. Is anyone pushing to reinstate mask mandates or any of the other measures we did all winter? AUBREY: Well, Los Angeles County has reinstated a mask mandate for both unvaccinated and vaccinated people. And though this is very unlikely to happen nationally, lots of public health experts tell me, you know, it makes good sense to stay masked up in crowded indoor settings because it is still possible for fully vaccinated people to become infected. I spoke to Dr. Sage Myers. She's an emergency department physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She says this can help protect kids, too. SAGE MYERS: We're expecting our unvaccinated children to continue to wear those - wear their masks and helping them to feel more comfortable takes us doing it, too. And so I definitely will wear my mask when I'm with my 11-year-old who can't be vaccinated yet who has to have her mask on, even if it's a situation that as a vaccinated person I may otherwise have been able to not wear it. AUBREY: She says, bottom line, it's just a simple way to stay protected, and it's not hard to do. KING: For sure. NPR's Allison Aubrey. Thank you, Allison. AUBREY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. So at the moment, Germany is trying to recover from its worst natural disaster in about 60 years. MART\u00cdNEZ: Flooding killed at least 158 people in western Germany. Whole towns were destroyed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel toured some of the affected areas yesterday and called the past several days terrifying. Severe flooding also impacted parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. KING: NPR's Rob Schmitz is in the disaster area in western Germany. He's with us now. Hi, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: So the floods started last week, last Wednesday. It's been a few days. What does it look like there now? SCHMITZ: Well, I spent the day yesterday in the town of Bad Neuenahr, and it sort of looks like a tidal wave hit it. The Ahr River, which is actually more of a creek, flows through this town, and it's typically less than a foot deep. Residents told me that they usually walk across it barefoot in the summer. But on Wednesday night, this region received so much rain that this tiny creek went from inches deep to 25 feet deep within just a couple of hours. KING: Wow. SCHMITZ: Waves of water carried cars, parts of houses and uprooted trees into this valley, slamming them into other homes and bridges, destroying everything in its path. I spoke to Claudia Krah, who was busy cleaning up mud and debris from the first story of her damaged home. Here's what she said. CLAUDIA KRAH: It's so truly sad because we love (ph) the people of our hometown. And it's gone. It's gone - historical buildings, no restaurant, no businesses running. It's over. KING: Rob, do authorities have a better understanding now of why this got so bad, how so many people could have been killed? SCHMITZ: Well, it turns out Angela Merkel was here yesterday, and she said it's clear to her as a scientist that climate change is influencing extreme weather events like this one. And according to a recent study called the Global Climate Risk Index, Germany is among the top 20 countries in the world most impacted by climate change. It's worth noting that before this region received two months' worth of rainfall in just two days, there was a years-long drought. Here's Fred Hattermann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research talking to German broadcaster RBB. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRED HATTERMANN: (Speaking German). SCHMITZ: And, Noel, he's saying here that this year basically shows what can happen because of climate change. On the one hand, we have a persistent drought and now all of a sudden very heavy rainfall, which cannot be absorbed by the soil because it's too dry, and this leads to heavy flooding and erosion. KING: Do authorities there know how many people are missing? SCHMITZ: They don't. Many of those labeled missing were actually not reachable by cellphone because the towers were down, and we should have better numbers later this week. KING: OK. Has the rain stopped? I mean, as you look at the forecast, is the weather clear from this point out? And can people start recovering? SCHMITZ: Yeah, the weather's clear, you know, but the area is far from recovered. Residents told me that it'll be weeks before electricity is restored, months before they'll have gas. The region doesn't have clean drinking water, so the German military is sending convoys of water trucks to deal with that. KING: OK. And then lastly, Germany has a big election coming up. How might this affect that? SCHMITZ: Well, it's interesting. Yesterday, the front-runner to be the next chancellor to succeed Merkel, Armin Laschet, was visiting the region, was caught on camera giggling in the background while Germany's president was giving a speech. And this tone-deaf response sparked widespread outrage in Germany and Laschet apologized over Twitter. Popularity rankings show him as a weak candidate anyway, but this did not help. And because this disaster is seen as one influenced by climate change, many analysts say this could be a boost for the Green Party. KING: Interesting. NPR's Rob Schmitz in western Germany. Thank you, Rob. SCHMITZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: What does a federal judge's ruling mean for the future of DACA? MART\u00cdNEZ: That's the Obama-era program that protects kids who were illegally brought to the U.S. from deportation. On Friday, a judge in Texas ruled the program was illegal and blocked new applicants. Now, this adds another layer to an already complicated immigration situation for the Biden administration. Attempted border crossings hit a 21-year high in June. Now, in a statement, Biden called the ruling disappointing and urged Congress to create a permanent solution to protect DREAMers. But this week, Congress will put up for a test vote one of the president's other priorities, and that's the bipartisan infrastructure deal. KING: NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith is following all of this from here in D.C. Good morning, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: I want to start with immigration because this has bedeviled many an administration, and it seems fair to say it's happening again. KEITH: Yeah, it has certainly been a challenge for the Biden administration to calibrate their immigration policy. President Biden and his administration has aimed to show that they are more humane than former President Trump and his approach to immigration. But they have been criticized for struggling to manage a surge of unaccompanied minors. And just generally, apprehensions are way up under President Biden - border apprehensions. In June, border agents stopped more than 188,000 migrants trying to cross the southern border. Part of that may be a pandemic effect. Administration officials point out a pandemic emergency order means most people apprehended are expelled without being detained or processed. And many of them are trying again and again, driving up the number of encounters. Thirty-four percent of people who tried to cross the border last month had tried at least once before in the past year. But just more broadly, immigration is one area where polls have real warning signs for President Biden. People broadly do not approve of his handling of immigration. KING: OK. Let me ask you about this ruling last week. Besides appealing the court's decision, is there anything else the administration can do on DACA? KEITH: The president says longer term, it's really up to Congress to act to protect these so-called DREAMers. And Congress has been trying to do that for 20 years now. Biden is even urging Democrats to use that process known as reconciliation, that budget process, to put it through along with some of his infrastructure goals and other budget - other economic spending, that $3.5 trillion budget plan. He says, hey, just put it in there. It's not clear that Senate rules would really allow that to happen. You know, at the beginning of his administration, President Biden put forward a comprehensive immigration reform proposal, but you'd be forgiven for not realizing it because, unlike infrastructure, he hasn't been out traveling the country pressing Congress to pass it. KING: And then what is happening with infrastructure this week? KEITH: Yeah, that will come up for a key test vote this week, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he wants to push that forward to sort of force them to make a deal. It includes things like roads, bridges and broadband. But the Republicans who say they support the plan are balking. KING: NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks so much, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome.

NPR Music's Turning the Tables is a project envisioned to challenge sexist and exclusionary conversations about musical greatness. Up until now we have focused on overturning conventional, patriarchal best-of lists and histories of popular music. But this time, it's personal. For 2021, we're digging into our own relationships to the records we love, asking: How do we know as listeners when a piece of music is important to us? How do we break free of institutional pressures on our taste while still taking the lessons of history into account? What does it mean to make a truly personal canon? The essays in this series will excavate our unique relationships with the albums we love, from unimpeachable classics by major stars to subcultural gamechangers and personal revelations. Because the way that certain music comes to hold a central place in our lives isn't just a reflection of how we develop our taste, but how we come to our perspective on the world. It's been 20 years since I first heard a song from the mind of Santi White, but at the time I fell in love with it I didn't know I had her to thank. Back then White lived not in the spotlight but mostly in liner notes and underground scenes, a Black woman grinding, like so many before her, to make a name for herself in the music industry. Her final form \u2014 Santigold, the genre-defying heroine who'd later burn bright in my consciousness \u2014 was not yet a glimmer. In those early days of 2001, who I did know was her Philly friend Res (a singer whose debut album, it so happens, White largely wrote and produced). I'd managed to get my hands on How I Do months before it was officially out \u2014 one perk of dating the man for whom I'd recently moved to New York City. He was a music journalist with bylines in glossies like Vibe and Spin, a Queens-born hip-hop head. At the countless shows we saw Res open for Talib Kweli or Mos Def over the years \u2014 me tagging along as my man's plus-one, because my unglamorous gig slapping HTML around website copy could never get us on any guest list \u2014 I watched him nod hard to the bass-heavy tracks, and like a good girlfriend, I nodded yes too. But my favorite \u2014 that song I fell for fast \u2014 was How I Do's opener, \"Golden Boys.\" I loved its sound \u2014 Res' voice alternately sneering and soaring over music that, foreshadowing Santigold's own mashed-up aesthetic, couldn't be pinned as alt- or neo- or whatever prefix you tried to give it. And then there were the lyrics, written by White \u2014 a rebuke of deceptive images and false idols. \"Why are you selling dreams of who you wish you could be?\" she scolds in the very first line, putting on blast a nameless \"prince in all of the magazines.\" The coldest read comes at the chorus, though, courtesy of a sisterhood side-eyeing this prince from the corners: But then there's girls like me who sit appalled by what we've seenWe know the truth about you... I remember hearing these lines the first time, the synths swelling in the background, the beat picking up. Those \"girls like me,\" that all-knowing \"we\": They begged me to sing along, so I did. Was I cool enough to hang out on this scene, though, savvy enough to float free of its traps? Ask me today, with the benefit of hindsight, and I will assure you that back then, I was far from qualified. On some level, you might even accuse me of poseur tendencies too. Trailing behind a man, after all, wasn't exactly the feminist move. But if you'd asked me back then? When I was 24 years old and high on the bravado that even a nascent version of Santigold could stir in me? Well. For that runtime of 4 minutes and 38 seconds, you couldn't tell me jack. *** The exact details of my first dalliance with Santigold elude me \u2014 probably because when it arrived, in 2008, it instantly felt ubiquitous. (Technically, back then, the album was called Santogold, as was the artist \u2013 but both have been known as Santigold following a name change in 2009.) I heard \"Creator\" playing in the bars that my man and I frequented on the Lower East Side; I glimpsed her name in bold while flipping through the Fader or scrolling on Pitchfork, any number of those buzzy outlets obsessed with the new and the next; who knows, I probably even posted critic Leah Greenblatt's capsule review of the album on EW.com (where I worked at the time). When I nabbed my own copy I got a good look at its cover, connecting the sounds and the name I recognized with the image of the artist behind them. Imprinting, almost. And sis glared back at me, 100 percent grit \u2014 the only glam thing about her the gold glitter spewing out of her mouth. Whoa, I remember thinking, what's the story here? I discovered, to my delight, that Santi White and I had a lot in common. Both of us Black women, of course, and both 32 that year \u2014 the wrong age, race and gender to just be making a name, especially as creatives in youth-obsessed New York City. Like me, I'd learn from the profiles I'd dig into as companion pieces to my regular listening, she had paid dues behind the scenes before trying out for the showier roles (though her days in A&R and fronting a punk band called Stiffed were obviously more exciting than mine toggling between media jobs). Also like me, she was musically ravenous. Her skinfolk had steeped her in a love of traditionally Black forms \u2014 jazz and soul, then Afrobeat, dub \u2014 but she was interested too in other genres beloved by the weird white kids she'd befriended in school (among favorites she's cited: Devo, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Pixies, David Byrne). At some point she'd mustered the gall to mix it all up, and in her stew of an album I recognized a freedom, a flouting: the soul of Black folk banging alongside punks, pop idols, knob-twiddlers, new wavers. I thought about the long stretch of time between her start in the business and this inspiring moment, and sensed that art this accomplished, this sure, couldn't have come on any other wavelength or timeline. Considering our similarities, I held her success very close to my heart. Amid all the incredible music coming out of New York in the aughts, her style and perspective spoke the loudest to me. Lyrically, much of Santigold carried the swagger of the hip-hop I loved (from \"Creator\": \"Tell me no, I say yes, I was chosen / And I will deliver the explosion\"), but minus the misogyny that often stopped me cold on the dance floor. And though the era's resurgent rock & rollers like the Strokes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs sparked electric, channeling the city's jittery energy, for me Santigold's debut was funnier, sharper. She had a mean eye-roll, reserved for the city's suckas and the indignities of competing against them (\"L.E.S. Artistes,\" \"Shove It,\" \"Starstruck\"). But a wink was there too, in her stories of overcoming doubt (\"My Superman\"), cops and robbers (\"Unstoppable\"), even power outages (\"Lights Out\"). The album has big \"look what I can do\" attitude, and in that way it speaks to the New York dream of looming exceptional \u2014 one singular sensation \u2014 above the masses. And yet what is this city without its people, without the connections you make on your way to the top? To that point, some of Santigold's songs have a galvanizing magic too. There's the \"us\" in battle on \"You'll Find a Way\" (\"Can't pull us under/ You better watch out, run for cover\"), but the most famous example opens \"Shove It\": Seven years after the Res song that invited me to be cooler and smarter than I actually was, Santi White dropped another meaningful \"we\"\u2014 Brooklyn, we go hard \u2014 and the phrase was so rousing, such a rallying cry, that Kanye West built a whole banger around it for Jay-Z. By the year of Santigold the man and I repped the borough of Brooklyn too, capping a years-long Goldilocks hop around the city (our new garden apartment in Fort Greene was heaven, following stints living in cab-sparse Queens and stodgy Midtown Manhattan). I should say that along the way we'd tied the knot, in a DIY wedding-slash-cocktail party that, thanks to a reporter friend, made half a page of the Daily News. Finally settled among so many striving, thriving Black folks \u2014 this was, of course, just at the tipping point of gentrification \u2014 it finally felt like our \"we\" was expanding. The streets exploded with joy on Election Night, impromptu dance parties right outside our windows to celebrate the new President who looked like us, and I had never felt such a strong connection to my adopted home. At work I got promoted a few times by editing other people's stories, but still I dreamed of writing my own \u2014 a novel one day, if I could figure out how to hone my hustle. In the meantime, I took a few workshops in the West Village on Saturdays, trading amateur short fiction with other aspiring artists, and on occasional Sundays I joined a group of girlfriends for book club. All of them were girls like me, transplants to the city with blooming careers and ambition to spare. We read E.L. Doctorow and Ntozake Shange, and argued about them over brunch. We lovingly dubbed ourselves the \"Army of Bad B******,\" and hyped each other up for the Mondays ahead. *** In 2012, Santigold dropped a new album, Master of My Make-Believe, but at the time I was too busy to get into it. I had just started a new role as an executive editor at a media brand \u2014 still not working on a novel or even short stories anymore, though I tried to justify proximity to writing as close enough. I didn't have room in my brain for much of anything else (except TV, my sedative at the end of the day). The only new music I heard was in the background of prestige dramas or car commercials. The dreamer inside me, dying. On the surface, my life gleamed. Down South, my family was so proud of my climb that my mother framed and mounted on a wall of her house the masthead of a magazine where my name sat two lines away from the top. And in Brooklyn, the husband and I bought a new-construction condo down the street in Bed-Stuy, the down payment and later the mortgage drawn from my salary (since he'd quit his own day job to write movies on spec). The pressure was unreal, but wasn't I up for it? Wasn't leveling up the entire point? I imagine if I had listened to Santigold then, her effect might have been different. What I needed, what I wanted, more than a jolt of confidence to grow into the woman I wanted to be, was confirmation I'd conquered New York. But by summer 2013, what I'd assumed was gold turned a sickening green. At work, budgets shrank even tighter, and I resented wielding the hatchet come layoff time, resented my days reduced to numbers I could never make work. Meanwhile, at home, the husband expressed, in various hurtful ways, that this whole marriage thing just wasn't his jam. In the end I kept the condo, and the increasingly agonizing job that paid for it. I still had my Army of Bad B****** and they rallied around me whenever they could, but many of them had children now and/or their own stressful careers. So I spent much of my time off alone, wandering aimlessly, bitterly down Bedford Avenue. Eventually on those walks, I did listen to music again \u2014 my old favorites, Santigold among them. The confidence I remembered was still intact, but now, in songs like \"L.E.S. Artistes,\" my heart perked up at the earnestness, the desire glinting through disillusion: I can say I hope it will be worth what I give upIf I could stand up mean for the things that I believeChange, change, ch-change, changeI want to get up out of my skin \"I'd had this psychic reading,\" Santi White would later tell Mark Ronson in a 2021 interview, recalling the time before her breakthrough. \"And she's like, 'Well, you're going to get where you want to get to, but it's going to take longer because you just got to let go of wanting to get to a certain place and just make music for the sake of making music.'\" At my own crossroads, I had no such visions into my future. No clue yet that I could succeed on different terms, in more satisfying ways, or that it would take leaving New York for a while to get there. I would tap my savings and every ounce of courage to quit that big job, immersing myself in writing until it became not a dream but my purpose, my mission; until I had a whole novel centering a Black woman rock idol that Santi White might have admired the same way I'd always admired her. I would not know that this book would attract an agent, or sell to a publisher, or that anyone would even care to read the passion project of a 45-year-old woman. I, like Santigold, would learn to make art for the sake of art, and I would never feel more free. But that wandering summer, I was afraid. The only thing I knew, by instinct, was to listen to the arsenal of what I still had: a voice, a heart and just enough faith. So I put one foot in front of the other. Ran back the track, started over again.

Above, Manon Brunet of Team France, left, competes against Olga Nikitina of Team ROC during the Women's Sabre Team Fencing Gold Medal Match on day eight of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. I don't know how I got to be as old as I am without knowing that dressage horses danced to music. Don't get me wrong: I knew dressage was fancy horses. I just didn't know it was fancy horses who danced to an orchestral arrangement of Queen's \"Radio Ga-Ga.\" Coming into the Tokyo Games, I was conflicted and troubled, as a lot of people were, by a knot of injustices and safety concerns that made me wonder whether there was any way to really enjoy them at all. And so, I decided to treat them as a chance to visit a whole host of unfamiliar worlds in which people work harder than many of us can imagine to build toward a moment that, for many competitors, will only come once and will not result in any glory, or any real money, at all. To my own surprise, I find two weeks later that being a completist for the first time by watching some of every sport made me a fan again. And stepping away from the prime-time coverage that highlights only a few sports and only a few athletes \u2014 with heavily produced stories that sometimes contextualize their hard work in oversimplified ways \u2014 made it possible to think differently about what makes a sport beautiful in the first place. Of course, nothing improves the sports spectator experience like an obsession with arcane rules, so let me oblige. I watched more than every sport and less than every event; what I tried to do was catch every discipline. I also followed a Familiarity Rule, under which I made only symbolic visits to the Olympic sports that have the highest media exposure in the country where I live: baseball, basketball, boxing, tennis, and golf. If I'm going to sit down and spend time navigating the various viewing options needed to watch the Olympics, it's not so I can watch golf. (Sorry not sorry, golf.) But as to the rest, I watched as much as I could. Mostly athletes I had never heard of, mostly athletes who were not Team USA. And here's the problem and the shocking discovery: Each of these sports is the best sport in the Olympics. Some are the most beautiful, some are the most surprising, some have the most tremendous life lessons lurking just under the surface, and some are simply stunning examples of people who do extraordinarily hard things almost unimaginably well. I cried at some, I smiled at most, and I learned a lot. So here they are, from Archery to Wrestling: all the best sports in the Olympics. Archery I admire archery as a person with an anxiety disorder, because the athletes (and this is true in all shooting-type events) have to lower their own heart rates to stay steady. And \u2014 get this \u2014 this year, most of the archers agreed to a system that estimates their heart rates for TV viewers at home. Lowering your heart rate is one thing; lowering your heart rate while everyone watches you try to lower your heart rate resembles not just an anxiety dream, but an anxiety dream about having anxiety. Artistic swimming This and rhythmic gymnastics are the two events people most freely make fun of at the Olympics \u2014 I'm sure it's a coincidence that they're also two of the three events that are only competed by women (the other is softball). But you'll rarely see better visuals than the camera work that allows you to watch both what's going on above the water, which is judged, and what's going on underwater, which is generally not. What is above the water is beautiful and organized. What is beneath the water is effort, training, constant work, great strength. It's a metaphor for ... most things, actually. An overview shows Team China competing in the team free routine artistic swimming event. I don't know about any of you, but ... I couldn't do this.\n                \n                    \n                    Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An overview shows Team China competing in the team free routine artistic swimming event. I don't know about any of you, but ... I couldn't do this. Badminton Mary Carillo's legendary riff aside, badminton is a beautiful demonstration of working fast and slow at the same time. The reaction times are extraordinarily short, but the birdie also floats maddeningly and almost pauses in the air. A tennis ball could never! They are speedy but patient in this sport, and we can all aspire to that. 3x3 basketball I have watched a great lot of \"regular\" basketball in my life, but 3x3 is faster and makes two bold arguments about other basketball games: they have too many people, and there's too much running up and down. I admire the willingness to challenge the dogma that says all team sports should involve running up and down, and I swear I do not only say that as a veteran of middle school gym class. Beach volleyball In beach volleyball, because you play in pairs, there's nowhere to hide, but there is a person you can potentially disappoint. You cannot disappear into a team, and yet you are not competing alone, and honestly, what friendship could survive? These are the bravest warriors. I'm afraid to even cook dinner with another person. Canoe/kayak I love canoe and kayak slalom events, which take the athlete through not only downstream gates, but also upstream gates that require chaotic-looking (but expertly executed) paddling in the \"wrong\" direction. \"Winning requires a certain amount of working upstream and just getting that part over with as soon as possible\" is embarrassingly on the nose for a principle it's impossible to argue with. Cycling I watched plenty of cycling but especially loved BMX this year, both racing and freestyle. Those two disciplines really drive home a fundamental question of Olympic competition: Would you rather be out there doing whatever you want, alone on a course? Or would you rather be in a frenetic, adrenaline-soaked race where one false move can send you rolling down a steep track, and the false move might not have even been made by you? Special honorable mention to the commentator who tried to explain the BMX move known as \"the E.T.\" by asking if we remember when E.T. went home and pedaled the bike. I believe that is not, in fact, how E.T. got home, but that guy gets an A in E.T. anyway. Honestly, why didn't E.T. get home on the bike? That would have been a great movie.

Diving I have a secret: Most elite dives look the same to me, unless they go very very wrong. I am only capable of telling good dives from bad ones by seeing how big the splash is. Thus, diving is an illustrative example of something an unscrupulous person can pretend to have understood the entire time by watching for what happens at the very end, kind of like presidential elections and certain high fantasy novels. We must all be vigilant. Equestrian Equestrian events are a lesson in grace in the face of adversity, which I learned when I realized that I judge no Olympian more harshly than an equestrian who has a disappointing showing in something like a jumping event and fails to lovingly pat the horse on the neck. The horse is doing his best! The horse is a good boy or girl! You thank that horse, sir or madam! And as mentioned at the top, if you don't like horse dancing (which is the work of a skilled rider who can cue the horse so subtly that you don't even see it), then what are you even watching the Olympics for? The NBC Olympics channel on YouTube is one place to check out the dancing horses. Field Hockey I have not played many of the sports on this list, but I have played field hockey. Specifically, I have played field hockey in the same way I have studied calculus: long ago, not very successfully, and only because someone made me. But truly, watching people who are actually great at field hockey is very healing, since I mostly associate it with a sense of dread that it emphatically does not deserve. Field hockey is one Mighty Ducks-style movie away from being on every open lawn in the country. (Look, if you watched this many sports, you would probably find one that you might need therapy about.) Fencing Fencing is the sport I most admire that I do not really understand, in the sense that I know you're supposed to poke the other person, but there are a lot of complicated rules about how and when. When I tried to watch sabre fencing, I wound up spending about half an hour on Wikipedia trying to understand \"right of way.\" Fencing is the best sport because it has one of the most striking disconnects between how complicated it looks and how complicated it is. Plus, there is a special place in my heart for the wired gear that makes it so that when there's contact between a sword and a person, someone's helmet lights up. Imagine how much more exciting it would be in basketball if fouling someone on a shot resulted in a powerful buzzing noise coming from your shoes. That is some crazy video game stuff, and I never get tired of it. Gymnastics I learned this year that a \"wolf turn\" is like certain Canadian comedians: all of a sudden it's everywhere, and I feel like I missed something. Handball At some point, as a sports fan, you realize that soccer, basketball, water polo, lacrosse, field hockey, ice hockey and several other sports are basically the same thing, done in a variety of different ways. But you have to hand it to handball (I am so sorry), because while hockey asks \"What if we do this by hitting the ball/puck with sticks?\" and basketball asks \"What if we do this while bouncing the ball and then throwing it into a high net?\" and soccer asks \"What if we do this on an extremely large field using only our feet?\", handball is over here shrugging and saying, \"You guys are all making this unnecessarily complicated.\" If you think about it long enough, \"handball\" begins to sound like a heroically snarky thing for a sport to be called. (You can imagine a person saying, \"It's because we throw the ball. With our hand. So we call it hand ... ball.\") Judo You know what I love about judo? Grabbing the other person's kit (here called the gi) is not only allowed; it is expected. The first time you watch somebody try to flip somebody else over by grabbing their belt and pulling straight up, it might seem surprising since the rest of judo is often about very tricky moves reliant on a strong understanding of levers such as a human body. But if you were in an actual fight against a terrifying opponent, of course you'd grab the person's clothes! Verisimilitude in trying to avoid getting your butt kicked is my idea of truth in advertising. Karate You've got to watch some Olympic karate to see what I call the \"bloop bloop\" feet. (This is not an official sports term.) When the two competitors are waiting for the right moment to attack, they often do little hops in unison, like they're dancing, where one person goes forward and the other one goes back. This also happens in fencing, but I particularly like it in karate. Bloop-bloop! Bloop-bloop! I'm telling you, it's Fred and Ginger. Japan's Ryutaro Araga (L) competes against Kazakhstan's Daniyar Yuldashev in the men's kumite at the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games. Bloop-bloop feet!\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Japan's Ryutaro Araga (L) competes against Kazakhstan's Daniyar Yuldashev in the men's kumite at the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games. Bloop-bloop feet! Modern Pentathlon The big headline out of modern pentathlon this year was the coach who was thrown out for punching a horse. A little context: modern pentathlon includes swimming, fencing, riding, and then a combination of running and shooting. The horses for the riding portion are assigned to athletes in a random draw. And yes, the coach hit an uncooperative horse, but the real news should be sticking up for that horse's autonomy and its right to decline to participate. What's the lesson? Even in pursuits that you train and work at your whole life, there are elements you cannot expect to control. You can lead a horse to the Olympics, but you can't ... you know. Rhythmic Gymnastics Again, one that people love to make fun of, but if you can't see that the precision in throwing a ball many feet in the air and catching it on the back of your neck isn't all that different from the precision in shooting an arrow, you may be letting the glitter distract you. Rowing One of the challenges of being a rowing spectator, I find, is that the commentators don't seem sure what to talk about, because if you can see the race, you basically know as much as they do. Rarely does a sport have such a short list of necessary updates. The first item is \"who is ahead,\" and there is no second item. But seen from another angle, this is an advantage. I just want to watch the boats go fast! Rugby I love watching rugby, because I know it's wildly popular and the strongest vision I have of it is of Ross on Friends getting beat up by some of Emily's associates. Rugby is tough. It is the best sport if only in the sense that it's the one I believe would send me to the hospital the fastest. Sailing I began watching a sailing race early in my Olympic viewing, thinking, \"I'm just going to watch this one sailing race, because I have to do some work today.\" It took a while for me to realize this Olympic sailing race was going to take about two hours. Many sailing events are not really for those times when you are in a rush. They are contemplative. They are two hours long. Sailing is just like Christopher Cross always said: It takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. And by \"it,\" I mean \"watching a sailing race for the rest of the day.\" Shooting I must come clean: I am not a fan of sports that involve guns, simply because I am beyond finding guns entertaining in practically any context. But I'll say this: If all the guns were for this purpose, we'd all be a lot better off. Skateboarding Skateboarding had such a delightfully unpretentious presence as a new sport at this particular Olympics; like snowboarding and BMX freestyle, it involves a certain amount of trying the hardest things you can, packing in as much content as you can, even if some tricks don't work out. How can a sport where you wipe out and still excel not be the best sport? How is that not like life? You can't do well in gymnastics if you step out of bounds. Imagine if you could fall off the balance beam and land on your front teeth and still get a good score. Soccer Soccer is the best sport according to perhaps the largest number of people around the world who might vote for best sport, so who am I to argue? Like Ted Lasso, I have issues with the rules about offsides, but working on those issues is a good opportunity to be a better citizen of the world. Softball People who think an underhand pitch won't take your head off really aren't thinking about the right thing when they hear the words \"underhand pitch.\" Sport climbing Another new entry this year, sport climbing is the best sport because it has a section where you work your way up a series of walls with various arrangements of [synthetic] boulders, and you figure each wall out after you see it, and they call the walls \"problems,\" and that has big math class energy. Kyra Condie of Team USA works on a bouldering problem.\n                \n                    \n                    Maja Hitij/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kyra Condie of Team USA works on a bouldering problem. Surfing I have only watched one surfing competition in person: It was on the north shore of Oahu in (I believe) 2007, sponsored by Monster Energy (the drink, not the quality). One of my friends had won a sweepstakes and had a trip to watch from the Monster Energy hospitality house on the beach, and I got to tag along. Of all the things that are not me that I have ever done, watching surfing from the Monster Energy hospitality house might be the greatest among them, but let me tell you this: Surfing is very beautiful, and water is very temperamental, and when I watched competitive surfing this year, I thought, as I did back in 2007, \"I think my strategy would be to bob up and down in an unassuming fashion and hope everyone forgot I was there and thought I was a buoy.\" Swimming I think we all know that swimming is the best Olympic sport, and you know why? Because of the part at the end where they streeeeetch out their fingers to hit the pad at the finish, and sometimes somebody beats somebody else by a few hundredths of a second, and you really have to wonder whether cracking your knuckles before the race would have made a difference. Table tennis If I had to choose the athletes from one sport to give me pep talks every morning, I would choose the people who compete in table tennis. If you are asking why that is, I suspect you have not watched very much extremely competitive table tennis. It's the most intense energy I've ever seen focused on a  small flat area, other than when my dog tries to get a bite of my sandwich off the coffee table. Taekwondo At some point, all the fighting sports can begin to blend together, but taekwondo is a lot of fun to watch and is only held back from becoming wildly popular in the United States because people who don't know a lot about taekwondo don't realize that to a great degree, it's kicking. Olympic kicking. It's people kicking each other. Yyyyyyyyyeah! (Also, check out the story of taekwondo as a sport that has created medal opportunities for a lot of different countries.) Track and field I can't possibly cover all the track and field events I watched, but there are some amazing disciplines I must mention. One is racewalking, and people talk about it looking silly every four years. I get it, and it does have a certain \"well I never\" quality on first glance. But if you watch it for about five minutes, it stops looking silly and just starts looking a lot like running, but with very purposeful hips and elbows. Another is the throwing events, including the shot put and the discus, where the apparatuses are launched by way of a pirouette performed by what's often a very mighty and sturdily built athlete. Between that pirouette, pure speed events, and the fact that I was up early enough this year to be watching live when two athletes from Italy and Qatar agreed to share a gold medal in the men's high jump, I have no trouble arguing that track and field \u2014 or, as they also call it, \"athletics\" \u2014 is the best sport in the Olympics. Trampoline The thing that makes trampoline a great sport is that Olympic trampoliners (trampolinians? trampolympians?) bounce very, very high. How high? Thirty feet, they say. One guy got off-center, meaning he effectively fell from 30 feet in the air and put his leg right through the gap at the edge of the trampoline, and much to my endless shock, he didn't snap at the pelvis like a popsicle stick. In fact, he seems to be fine. This kind of terrifying happening obviously is not what makes it a great sport, but the rarity with which it happens given the heights involved might be.

It would take a very tall photo to show you where the trampoline is. Triathlon I think of triathlon people as solo dreamers, athletes who devote their entire beings to the most punishing pursuit they can think of. Thus, triathlon is the best sport because it is the one that sounds like the worst idea \u2014 unless you love doing it, in which case it is an all-consuming, beautiful idea. I do think there is something obviously missing, though, between the triathlon and the modern pentathlon. I would suggest the midcentury modern quadrathlon, which is made up of swimming, cycling, smoking, and picking out furniture. Volleyball This year's USA women's team won a gold medal after coming close for several Olympics in a row, and it was an absolute delight. Volleyball has theater in the form of fakes, drama in the form of arguing about what's in and what's out, research in the form of millions of people simultaneously Googling \"why does one person on the team have a different shirt?\", and simple athletic power that actually brings very tall humans right up in each other's faces. It's good stuff. Water polo We should all be watching more water polo! Water polo is the best sport because everyone should be united in the firm belief that we should all be watching more water polo! It is hugely entertaining and faster than soccer or hockey, the Team USA women are a tremendous group that won a gold medal for the third time in a row, and everybody looks great in those caps. Why aren't we all watching water polo right now? Bring me the year-round water polo league! Bring me the Ted Lasso of water polo!

You should probably be watching more water polo. Weightlifting There is only one thing I don't like about weightlifting, and that's my constant sense that some part of the athlete is going to collapse or fall off or bend the wrong way or explode. When I mentioned this on Twitter, someone told me that I definitely did not want to look up weightlifting injuries on YouTube, and that person is correct. I do not. Because I prefer to think of weightlifting the way I experience it as a spectator: as a series of emergencies (\"a very heavy thing is over my head and I can't hold it much longer\") that the athlete heroically resolves. Wrestling What's more suspenseful than a sport where who's winning is constantly shifting? For me, it's a sport where I have no idea who's winning at any given time. Now in fairness, yes, if one person is clearly cleaning the other person's clock, I will be able to tell who's winning. But I lack the background to know when someone is about to begin cleaning someone else's clock, meaning that it always comes as a delightful surprise to me. Thus, wrestling, like every sport, is absolutely, positively, the best one.",

House Democrats are planning a strategic wave of party priority legislation on everything from guns to immigration, even as none \u2014 if any \u2014 of the bills is likely to pass a 50-50 Senate. \"We believe these bills enjoy overwhelming support among Democrats, Republicans and independents among the American people,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said this week. \"Frankly, we don't know why that support, particularly in terms of Republican support, doesn't translate to the members of the House or the Senate.\" This week, Democrats passed a sweeping package to overhaul election and campaign finance laws, as well as a bill to change policing policies that was originally drafted in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police in Minneapolis last year. Last week, Democrats passed the Equality Act, which would explicitly ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Republicans were nearly unified in opposition to all three measures. Hoyer said that in the weeks ahead, Democrats will take up legislation to expand labor rights, as well as gun legislation to enhance background checks for purchases and to close the \"Charleston loophole\" to further tighten the background check system. The Equal Rights Amendment to require equal legal rights regardless of sex will get a vote, as will the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which expired in 2018 and has been stuck in a partisan deadlock since. Immigration bills are also on the agenda, including a proposal to provide permanent legal status to certain people, such as those brought to the U.S. illegally a children and often referred to as \"Dreamers.\" Since many of these bills were passed by Democrats in the previous Congress, they can be brought back up for House votes and bypass the committee process before April 1 under House Rules. All of them collected dust in the then-GOP-controlled Senate, but Hoyer said Democrats are hopeful that a Democratic-controlled Senate will allow some of these bills to see \"the light of day.\" They will also keep up the left's pressure campaign against the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority to pass legislation. Politically, Democrats are concerned about the prospects of a Democratic-controlled Washington's ability to pass their agenda and how that could spark a backlash in the 2022 midterms if they have nothing to show voters for giving Democrats the majority and the White House. In this polarized Congress, Senate Democrats will need 10 Republicans to advance any of their priorities, and none of these House bills has that level of support in the chamber right now. \"You don't have to be much of a mathematician to know, if you've got 50 on one side and 50 on the other side, getting things done is tough,\" Hoyer acknowledged. Like a growing number of Democrats, Hoyer said he supports changing filibuster rules. \"I personally believe that the filibuster is an undemocratic aspect of the United States Senate. At some point in time, the majority ought to be able to rule,\" he said. \"And we'll see if, at some point in time, the Senate gets so frustrated that it repairs to having majority rule.\" That conflict will be a reoccurring tension among Democrats in this Congress, as the vast majority support blowing up the filibuster against a small but critical mass of Senate Democrats who oppose it. Right now, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., doesn't have the votes to consider it. One key opponent to changing filibuster rules, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was asked last week if he could ever foresee changing his mind on the issue. \"Never!\" he yelled. \"Jesus Christ, what don't you understand about never?\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has promised \"chaos\" in the Senate if Democrats change the rules, saying that Republicans will object to all routine measures in a never-ending procedural protest. \"This body would grind to a halt like we've never seen,\" he said.",

Set in a fictional African village in the 1980s, it follows a group of villagers who take on an American oil company.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Our guest Imbolo Mbue is the author of the new novel \"How Beautiful We Were.\" It was described in The New York Times as a nuanced exploration of self-interest, of what it means to want in the age of capitalism and colonialism. Her first novel, \"Behold The Dreamers,\" which was published in 2016, won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Imbolo Mbue spoke with FRESH AIR guest interviewer Arun Venugopal. ARUN VENUGOPAL, BYLINE: \"How Beautiful We Were\" is Imbolo Mbue's latest novel. And it's set in a fictional African village in the 1980s. The book is a David-and-Goliath tale, pitting the villagers of Kosawa against an American corporation known as Pexton. The company has drilled for oil on the nearby land and, over the course of years, destroyed the environment. This has caused the villagers to lose their ability to hunt and forage and maintain their way of life. It's also caused many of the villagers and their children to grow sick from environmental toxins and die. But a sequence of events set in motion by the village madman convinces some of the villagers that they shouldn't give up on their ancestral land, that it's worth fighting for. One of those fighting is Thula, a young girl who becomes a revolutionary. Mbue started working on \"How Beautiful We Were\" 17 years ago but took a break to write her first book, \"Behold The Dreamers,\" which came out in 2016. That book about immigrants from Cameroon living in New York City was adapted into an opera, chosen for Oprah's Book Club and translated into 11 languages. Mbue grew up in Cameroon and moved to the U.S. to go to college before settling down here. Imbolo Mbue, welcome to FRESH AIR. IMBOLO MBUE: Thank you so much for having me, Arun. VENUGOPAL: Your first novel, \"Behold The Dreamers,\" was set in New York City. You set this book in a fictional African village, Kosawa - why a fictional village? MBUE: Well, I was more interested in the characters than I was in the setting. My interest was more in writing a story about what happens when a group of people decides to push back against a powerful corporation. And then, in the process of doing that, I decided to put it in this village, which is not like anywhere I've ever been to. But it felt very real because it is in Africa. And I spent my childhood in a couple of African villages. I also grew up in a town that had oil. So I was aware of the politics of oil as a child. And so I created this village. And I - in an effort to really show the extent to which the people struggle when they try to take on such a powerful adversary. VENUGOPAL: So you grew up in Cameroon. There's an oil refinery nearby as you're growing up. How did the presence of this oil refinery shape your politics growing up? MBUE: Well, I was very aware of the fact that, usually, people who live on the land do not benefit from the oil wealth as much as the government or the corporations from overseas. So in my town, barely anybody I knew had a job at this oil refinery. The people who had jobs there were people were connected to powerful people in government. A lot - all of the top jobs, they went to people in another part of the country. And there was a lot of grumbling among the adults in my town about how they couldn't get jobs there. So as a child, I was aware that having oil on your land doesn't exactly mean that you're going to benefit from it because you're from that place. And because I had this awareness of oil politics, I was very sensitive to how complicated it is, this issue of oil exploration. And the other thing that happened when I was growing up is that there was a famous environmentalist in Nigeria. His name was Ken Saro-Wiwa. And he was trying to fight against the Shell oil company because Shell's drilling for oil was destroying his ancestral land, similar to what is in the book. And Saro-Wiwa was executed. So being aware of oil in Cameroon, in my town, and then hearing about what happened to Saro-Wiwa certainly got the bells ringing in my head about how much injustice is involved in this process of oil exploration. VENUGOPAL: The environmentalists who was executed when you were growing up, tell us a little more about what happened to him. MBUE: So when I was growing up, we didn't have a television in my house. We only had a radio. And the radio was our source of news about what was happening in the outside world. And it was on this radio that I heard the word environmentalist for the first time. I heard about a man in Nigeria. His name was Ken Saro-Wiwa. And he was fighting against the Shell oil company because Shell was polluting his ancestral land. And it was called - it is called Ogoniland. So Shell was polluting Ogoniland. And Saro-Wiwa was an environmentalist. And he was very upset about it. And he and his fellow environmentalists just started this fight with Shell to get Shell to stop polluting their land. But the Nigerian government at that time, of course, you know, was - took the side of Shell because they were supporting the corporation. And they used trumped-up charges to get Saro-Wiwa to be imprisoned. And I remember every day after school, I would rush home to get home in time to hear the news to find out what was happening with Saro-Wiwa because the whole thing just seemed so unfair to me. So I was very hopeful that Saro-Wiwa will be released because there was this global outcry. And there was all this pressure being put on the Nigerian government at the time. But then one day, I came back home. And I heard on the radio that Saro-Wiwa and his fellow environmentalists had all been executed. They were hang to death. And so that was - I think that moment was probably a defining moment for me as a person with a social and political conscience because I was very upset. And in the process of writing this book, I did a lot of research. And I found out that to be an environmental activist can actually be very, very dangerous. But, yes, it certainly started with Saro-Wiwa. And this happened in 1995. So it was about 25 years ago that it happened. VENUGOPAL: And so did he kind of serve as sort of a mythic or heroic figure for you? MBUE: He was one of many. And because I grew up in Cameroon in the '80s and '90s, I was very aware of a lot of men who were pushing back against this sense of injustice from the Mandelas to the Steve Bikos, Patrice Lumumba and Thomas Sankara. All of these men were celebrated. They were all part of my inspiration. And also, while I looked at Saro-Wiwa and the Niger Delta, I certainly looked at, you know, the BP oil spill in America. I looked at Standing Rock. I look at what happened in Ecuador, what is happening there between the people in the Lago Agrio region and Chevron. So I got inspirations from all over the world, not just from Africa. VENUGOPAL: Our guest is writer Imbolo Mbue. Her new book is called \"How Beautiful We Were.\" Her first book, the New York Times bestseller \"Behold The Dreamers,\" won the PEN/Faulkner Award. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BOMBINO'S \"AZAMANE (MY BROTHERS UNITED)\") VENUGOPAL: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Arun Venugopal, back with novelist Imbolo Mbue. Her first book, \"Behold The Dreamers,\" won the PEN/Faulkner Award and was chosen for Oprah's Book Club. Her new book is called \"How Beautiful We Were.\" As serious as the subject matter is, the book is often really funny, in part because of the character of Konga, the village madman. What is the function of Konga in this story? MBUE: Well, yeah, I'm glad you find Konga funny (laughter). He was actually one of my favorite characters. No, he is the one who gets the uprising started. He's the one who says to the villagers, why are we letting them do this to us? Why do we feel as if somebody has to do something to save us? Let us do something. And he comes up with this crazy idea, which is what basically jump-starts the struggle between this village and this oil company and the government and the country, and the whole thing lasts for many, many years. Konga is a madman, right? In the village, he has a special place because he doesn't act like the rest of them. He doesn't exactly talk or interact with anybody for the most part. He mostly keeps to himself. And my inspiration for the character of Konga was this idea of madness, right? There's so much misunderstanding about mental illness to begin with, but there's also this idea that doing certain things are, quote-unquote, \"crazy.\" You know, whenever you come up with a - with this big idea, people usually say, are you crazy? What are you talking about? That's so crazy. That's insane. And I wanted to explore what it's like to actually be mentally ill and having this ability to see the world different because of that 'cause that is what Konga has. And also, the idea that you need a certain kind of madness in a way to bring about significant change in the world. One of my favorite quotes growing up was echoed by an African revolutionary, Thomas Sankara, and it talks about how to bring about any kind of change, like, there's - you're going to need to be different. You're going to need to think different and see things differently. And that was Konga. So with Konga, I was really trying to pay an homage to craziness, to wildness, to people who are eccentric and different and people who, by being so, bring about significant change, I mean, for better or for worse, right? For Konga's - in Konga's case, you have to read the book to decide whether his ideas ended up benefiting the village. VENUGOPAL: I'd like you to read a section of the book where Konga, the madman, talks to some other men in the village. And just to set it up here, he has an exchange, Konga has an exchange, with a group of men who are going out in search of their fellow villagers who've either been killed by the American corporation, Pexton, or may be imprisoned. And it's this scene where, basically, he interacts with Bongo, who is the narrator, as well as a gentleman by the name of Lusaka, who's sort of, like, a revered village elder, I guess. And some of the leaders want to turn to the West for help, but Konga completely disagrees. MBUE: (Reading) You do understand that all people from overseas are the same, don't you? The Americans, the Europeans - every single overseas person who has ever set foot on our soil, you know they all want the same thing, don't you? How do they remember the Europeans when he has no memory? You're young, he says. Someday, when you're old, you'll see that the ones who came to kill us and the ones who will want to save us are the same. No matter their pretenses, they all arrive here believing they have the power to take from us or give to us whatever will satisfy their endless wants. VENUGOPAL: You know, this passage, it reminded me of a couple things also from the 1980s. It reminded me of these ads that we were constantly subjected to as kids, you know, growing up in the U.S. these ads where they're raising money for starving children in the Third World. And it also reminded me of the song, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" - the song by the British all-star group, Band Aid, you know, featuring Bono and Sting and Duran Duran, and it raised all this money for famine relief. And at some point, as I was growing up, I remember hearing the verse, and there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime. MBUE: (Laughter). VENUGOPAL: And I remember thinking, like, OK, sounds kind of like Texas or Florida. I mean, there's just something so ridiculously distant and, I guess, kind of - what's this word? We talk about the bleeding-heart liberal, right? This performative kind of philanthropy. And it sort of kind of cuts to what you're seeing is all about, that when you say the people who come to kill us and the ones who come to save us are all the same. I'm just wondering, is this something you developed after moving to the U.S. and living in New York and encountering all these people who want to save Africa or the Third World? MBUE: Yeah. Well, the funny thing is that I did not really know about that image of Africa till I came to America. So, yes, you're right. I was surprised when I came here and people said, oh, it must be awful; it must have been awful for you growing up. And I'm thinking, what are you talking about? (Laughter) Because, like, I mean, this is not quite an issue that the book talks about, but - maybe in a way it does. You know, I think the issue was that - you know, the idea that I got in America was that, you know, we were poor because we didn't have certain things in life. So when I came here, I mentioned that, you know, I grew up - I spent my early life in houses that did not have electricity or running water, not - in some houses, they did; some houses, they didn't. Like, I think the very first few houses we lived in, there was no electricity or running water. But my family house in Limbe, we had electricity; we didn't have running water. But it was all very normal to me. There was nothing poor about it. I had relatives and friends and neighbors who lived in huts. And so there was no such thing as, oh, you guys live in huts; it's so awful. No, they lived in huts, and their lives were wonderful. Their lives were full and vibrant. And it was only when I came to America that I got this idea that, oh, those poor people, they live on $2 a day. And I'm thinking, $2 a day? That's a lot of money in my town. (LAUGHTER) MBUE: People in my town, you know, live very well on $2 a day. Maybe not now, but back when I was growing up, it wasn't that awful to live on $2 a day. But what this village is going through in the novel is different, right? Their struggle is not that they want - you know, they want to live in big houses. They live in huts. They don't have running water. They don't have electricity. But before this oil company came, their lives were wonderful. What they're dealing with is that they have many, many, many years of injustice that have been thrown on them. First, you know, there was the slave trade - right? - which did not really affect them, but it happened in their area. And then there was colonialism that came, and because of colonialism, they're living in a country which is ruled by a dictator who is in bed with European powers, and that is all very much affecting the country. And then they're living in the age of neocolonialism and corporate imperiality among globalization. So his point is that the outside world has done so much damage to us, do we really want to go back to them to come save us? Even if they think that they are different - right? Some of them think that they're liberal, some progressive and they care about Africa. But he sees them as being a sort of other. But with this particular struggle in this particular village, I think what Konga has has is quite a justified cynicism, right? He's justified in thinking that we can save ourselves. Like, we have depended for too long on people coming from other places to save us. And maybe Konga then says (ph), I don't believe in this whole white savior thing. I don't believe in white saviors. Let's not trust them. Let us save ourselves. Then, of course, you know, it gets more complicated than that. VENUGOPAL: Tell me a little more about, you know, where you grew up as a kid. You know, what was - in Limbe, in Cameroon, correct? MBUE: Mmm hmm. VENUGOPAL: What can you tell me about Limbe? MBUE: Well, Limbe is a town in the English-speaking part of Cameroon. So Cameroon is a bilingual country. Most of the country speaks French, about 80% percent of the country. And Limbe's in the 20% that speaks English. So they the northwest and the southwest regions are English-speaking. And Limbe is right on the ocean, sits right on the Atlantic Ocean. So I grew up in this town that was English-speaking, and it was by the ocean, and it was warm, and people were very friendly. I lived in a neighborhood where we had a public tap. So, you know, in the evenings after school, we all carried our books and went to the tap and fetched water and went back home. And again, I thought that was all wonderful. There was nothing horrible about having to go fetch water. It happens in many parts of the world. I loved it. I thought we had a great lifestyle. The one thing about Limbe which was not so wonderful, which is not uncommon around the world, is that there just weren't a lot of opportunities, which is something that I explore in my first novel. I mean, it's different nowadays because the world has changed. But when I was growing up, it was many people's dream to leave and to come to America. And I had the great blessing of being able to come to America to go to college here. But I was very aware of marginalization as a child. I was also aware of what it's like to live in a dictatorship because the president of my country is the same president now that was in my childhood. He's been president for almost 40 years. And maybe that is part of why I was so fascinated by dissidents and revolutionaries because I knew that many people were not happy that were living in a country with a dictator. But there wasn't a lot of effort to get rid of him. I mean, he's still there because, you know, efforts to get rid of him haven't been successful. And maybe my creation of a character like Thula, who takes on the dictator of her country, was, I guess, some kind of a childhood wish I had that I wouldn't - I could live in a democratic country because I really did not know what democracy was till I came to America. The idea of democracy completely fascinated me. When I became a citizen, I voted for the first time in 2016, and the whole day I was so excited that I got to vote because, you know, such issues were just not commonplace where I came from. But that said, Limbe was a beautiful town. I think Cameroon was a beautiful country. It still is in many ways. It's just, you know, when you have a dictator for so many years, you know, there's just certain freedoms that you cannot really have. VENUGOPAL: What kind of music did you listen to when you were growing up? MBUE: Oh, makossa, which is Cameroonian pop music. It's very heavy rhythms, very, you know, serious African dancing with lots of twisting and turning. And that's what I listened to. When I came to America, I discovered country music. And so I - my first days in America, I listened to a lot of Shania Twain and Dolly Parton and LeAnn Rimes and Dixie Chicks. So that was my introduction to American music - country music (laughter). VENUGOPAL: That's quite the playlist - makossa and Dixie Chicks. MBUE: Yeah, well, I love it. I still do. I just - there's something about country music that made me feel a little less homesick. I don't know what it was. VENUGOPAL: Oh, really? MBUE: But just listening to country music just made me feel - it made me feel like I was so close to home. I don't know what it was. But yes, I had - country music has a special place in my heart. VENUGOPAL: Country singers, they wear their hearts on their sleeve, right? They're not being coy or - you know, these are basic human dramas and emotions, I guess. MBUE: Yeah, I think so. And also, because when I came here, I was so homesick, and there were all these love songs and - about all these emotions. And I was like - I was just (laughter) - I just felt, OK, to your point - they wear it on their sleeves - like, I could just be emotional and think about my home and dream of being home and someday I'm going to go back home again, which is, you know, a separate point, which is probably why my - I think of my novels as love songs, maybe because when I came here, I listened to a lot of country music love songs, and I think that in most of my novels, I was hoping to write a sort of love song. GROSS: We're listening to the conversation our guest interviewer Arun Venugopal recorded with Imbolo Mbue, author of the new novel \"How Beautiful We Were.\" After a short break, they'll talk about her first novel, \"Behold The Dreamers.\" In 2016, before the election, the novel was described in The Washington Post as the one novel Donald Trump should read. Later, Kevin Whitehead will review a new Louis Armstrong boxset, and Maureen Corrigan will review two new novels about love and family. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITHOUT YOU\") THE CHICKS: (Singing) 'Cause without you, I'm not OK. And without you, I've lost my way. My heart's stuck in second place - ooh - without you. Well, I never thought I'd be lying without you by my side. It seems I'm... GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with novelist Imbolo Mbue. Her first novel, \"Behold The Dreamers,\" was a New York Times bestseller and won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. It's about immigrants from Cameroon who are working for a wealthy white Wall Street executive and his family just as the economic downturn hits. Her new novel, \"How Beautiful We Were,\" is about a fictional African village that decides to fight back against an American oil company that has polluted the land. Mbue is from Cameroon and became a U.S. citizen in time to vote in the 2016 election. She spoke with FRESH AIR guest interviewer Arun Venugopal. VENUGOPAL: What was it like to vote for the first time in the U.S. in 2016? MBUE: Oh, it was - wow, it was so good until it wasn't (laughter). I was so excited. I should mention that I got my citizenship in 2014, which was a huge moment for me. I remember when I got my citizenship, oh, I cried my eyes out. I was like, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I am an American. I was so happy. And then two years later, I got to vote for the first time. And I went to the polls. And I was so proud of myself. I took a selfie in the poll booth. I don't whether I can do that, but I did. And then obviously, when the results came, the person who I voted for did not win. But it was a huge moment for me because I had never been a part of a democratic process before. I just had never. I had seen democracy as something that other people took part in. It just never occurred to me that I could be - I could have a say in who the leader of my country is, because in all those years in America, I saw my American friends going to vote. You know, growing up in Cameroon, and I saw the adults going to vote. And I watched them. And I knew that obviously the votes didn't really matter in Cameroon whoever you vote for. You know, whoever wants to win is going to win. But I never took part in it. So in 2016, I got to take part in it. And that was significant. It was - I think I still have that picture. I did very much feel for the first time that I could have a say in the future of a country to which I belong. VENUGOPAL: Just a couple months before the election, The Washington Post ran an article about your book, \"Beholds The Dreamers.\" And the headline says, \"Behold The Dreamers:\" The One Novel Donald Trump Should Read Now.\" What did you think when you saw this headline? MBUE: (Laughter) I thought, oh, boy, does he read? No, I - what I think what we're trying to get at, you know, was that that novel and this one as well, they're all about empathy, right? I mean, these days, we hear the word empathy left and right. But that is what literature is. Writing both novels really pushed me to go beyond myself to really think about the other side, the other people who I don't agree with, the other people who have these points of view that really are so different from mine. And so what that I think it was trying to say, I believe, is that this is a time, like every time - and again, this gets said over and over. It's become a cliche. But really, it's a time for us to consider that other people do have a point of view. With both of my novels, people say to me, oh, both of your novels show so much kindness to everybody. You don't exactly take sides. But that was not how I started. When I started writing both novels, I took sides. I said, this is a side I support. (Unintelligible) about an African immigrant family and a wealthy white American family. And when I started a novel, I definitely took sides because I empathize with the African immigrants. They were like me. They were African immigrants, didn't have money, trying to settle in a new country. And I completely showered them with empathy. With the white Americans, I said, well, you know, the rich white people didn't really need my empathy. But I had to learn that it doesn't matter. You know, everybody is worthy of your empathy. VENUGOPAL: What did your family think when you told them that your first novel was going to be published? MBUE: Well, they said, what do you mean, you're a writer? (Laughter) Because I did not come to America to become a writer. I fell into writing. I - my first plan was to become a lawyer. That didn't work out. And I tried to become a college professor. It didn't work out. And I just tried to get a corporate job, and then I lost that. So I said, OK, I'll take my writing more seriously. So I like to joke that I became a writer because nothing else seemed to have worked well for me. But no, I think the way - I think they were surprised. My mother was surprised because I don't come from a literary world. Like I said, people don't leave my town to become writers. But I should also mention that if my mother had any concerns - and she had a few concerns - is because being a writer in Cameroon in my childhood and in some ways now as well, it was seen as being very dangerous. When I was growing up, on the radio, I heard it all the time. This writer was put in prison. So and so writer was - you know, journalist was put in prison for 10 years. So and so journalist has been arrested. I mean, it happened all the time. So I saw being a writer as being a very dangerous occupation. And so when I called home and I said that I wrote a book, I think the first concern was, oh, no, please don't say anything that's going to get you into prison. And first, I laughed it off. But, you know, one of my fellow Cameroonian writers, he was put in prison just a couple of years ago. So it is, you know, not only in Cameroon but all over the world. And you know that from your work that writing can be a very dangerous profession. But so far, the dictatorship in my country hasn't come after me, so I am safe. VENUGOPAL: Where did you come up with the idea for your first book? MBUE: That novel was inspired by chauffers I saw on a street corner in Manhattan. And this was in 2011. I was working. And I saw the chauffeurs. And I became very fascinated about the idea that some people had chauffers. And I started thinking about what it was like to be a chauffeur to a wealthy American family and also how the lives of the chauffer and his family and also the lives of the man he worked for, a Wall Street executive, how the lives of both families were affected by the financial crisis of 2008. Because I had lost my job. So I was working at a media company in 2009 when I lost my job because of the financial crisis. So I decided to write a story about two New York City families struggling to keep their lives together because - after the financial crisis happened. And that - the novel also allowed me to explore the idea of the American dream, because I came here really believing in it, because I - you know, based on what I'd seen on television, based on Hollywood and a lot of, you know, movies and TV shows, that the American dream was something for the taking, right? You come to America. You work hard. And you will live in a nice house like \"The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air\" or \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" And then I, you know, I came here and I saw that it wasn't quite like that. And I realized that a lot of immigrants I knew were disillusioned. Not only immigrants, even Americans who I met, they were disillusioned about the American dream. And so through this African immigrant chauffeur and the Wall Street executive, I was able to explore the cost of the American dream. MBUE: You've talked about all these stories that you grew up on, the stories of revolutionaries. And I'm wondering what you learned from this and specifically the question, why do some people rise up and fight while others do nothing? MBUE: Well, the one thing I learned is that these people are incredibly hopeful. They have this ability to hope, unlike anything I've ever seen. I mean, in the process of writing this novel, because I spent so many years, I'd read a lot of biographies and autobiographies and memoirs of dissidents and protesters and revolutionaries and anybody who ever took a stand and activists. And I realized that the reason why they're able to do what they do - right? - the reason why Mandela was able to be in prison for all those years or Dr. King or Malcolm X, they went out and did what they did knowing that they could lose their lives was because they were hopeful, was because they really believed that whatever they did would make a difference. And so that is what really helped me with the character of Tula. She's a young girl. And she's not married. She doesn't have children. And yet she believes that, even though she's a woman, she can lead her people to victory against an American oil company and a powerful dictator. I mean, you have to have a whole different level of hope to believe that you can bring an American oil company to justice, an American oil company that has resources and lawyers and all kinds of powers at its disposal. But Tula does believe that. And that is something that I learned from reading, from looking at their lives. VENUGOPAL: Imbolo Mbue, thank you so much for joining us today. MBUE: Thank you so much for having me on. GROSS: Imbolo Mbue is the author of the new novel, \"How Beautiful We Were.\" She spoke with guest interviewer Arun Venugopal, who's a host and senior producer at WNYC in New York.

            "article_content": "We look at the inauguration of President Joe Biden, the many executive orders he's already signed and the choice he has between unity and supporting the second impeachment of President Donald Trump.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Joe Biden is now president of the United States. He's called for national unity and knows that will be a test. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep, and they are real. But I also know they are not new. SIMON: And with the House sending at the Senate an article of impeachment against President Trump on Monday, it's one of the more immediate challenges. With us now is NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: So, Ron, how does President Biden pursue unity while Democratic senators are actively pursuing President Trump's impeachment over his role in causing the January 6 riot at the Capitol? ELVING: We've got a couple of weeks before the actual impeachment trial begins in the Senate. And President Biden can do those things, but it's going to take extraordinary skill. The challenge is to move in more than one direction at once, not just multitasking, but multitracking. He's got to work with one side sometimes and sometimes with the other, keeping the necessary relationships open and operating, reaching out for compromise, but without selling out the people who got you elected. It's a tall order, to be sure, but it's what Biden asked for, and it's what the Democrats asked for. And it's what the country needs right now. SIMON: And let me ask you about this extraordinary report from The New York Times last night that President Trump was plotting to get rid of the acting Justice Department attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, and replace him with a loyalist who would pressure Georgia lawmakers into overturning the state's presidential election results, obviously with no proof. Tell us about this story. ELVING: It's an amazing story, Scott. It shows how far Trump was willing to go. It tells us that in the final days of his presidency, he was not only pressing those state officials you mentioned to produce different results, and he was not only pressuring Vice President Pence to reject certified electoral votes from states, but he was trying to install a new attorney general who would contradict his own Justice Department findings and tell the states that there was evidence of fraud when there was not - all this before the day he incited the riot at the Capitol, and all this in an unlawful effort to overturn the results of the election and remain in office. And that matters, especially because in two weeks, the most important question before the Senate is whether to bar Trump from future office. SIMON: But let's get to President Biden - a multitude of pens to sign executive orders almost as soon as he was sworn in. President Trump once called - disdained executive orders as the easy way. But, boy, he signed a lot. Are executive orders President Biden's best options to get things done to both undo what he wants to do that President Trump did - and President Trump, who was largely trying to undo what President Obama did? ELVING: Yes, and that's not the best way to run a railroad, I think everyone would agree. But it may be the best that you can do right now, given how little you can expect Congress to do in the usual way, how difficult it is to get the contemporary Congress to do anything other than taxes and budgeting. And you can understand why a president who wants to make a difference or even to just make a mark feels he has to use these quickie policy measures in place of actual laws that are barred by the Senate's filibuster rules, among other things, especially in a moment of crisis. And right now, everything has to begin with the pandemic response. That has to be ramped up to wartime levels of effort and focus. That's the key to restoring the economy, to restoring confidence. But during the campaign, Biden made many statements about what he would do on his first day in office - getting the U.S. back into the Paris climate accords to combat climate change, stopping the wall with Mexico, redefining our response to immigration, especially redefining our policies on asylum, talking about lifting restrictions on people from Muslim countries, ending the deportation threat against the DREAMers. All these were touchstones of Trumpism, and Biden went after them all on Day 1. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Sonja Diaz, director of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at UCLA, about the significance of the Latino vote in California gubernatorial recall election.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Votes are still being counted for the California gubernatorial recall election, but the outcome is clear. Gavin Newsom will continue to serve as governor. Out of the state's 58 counties, 27 voted in favor of the recall. But those numbers change when we look at the Latino vote specifically. Around 40% of the population in California is Latino, so the way they vote can sway an election. To learn more about how Latinos voted in Tuesday's election, we're joined now by Sonja Diaz. She is founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at UCLA. Welcome. SONJA DIAZ: Thanks so much for having me. CHANG: You know, in national races, we often talk about the Latino vote as if it were some monolith, but obviously it's not. So let me ask you, who is the Latino voter in California, and how do they compare to Latino voters in other states? DIAZ: Yeah. Latino voters in California are younger than the state's largest electorate, which is white voters. They also lean Democratic. Now this is distinguishable from places in Florida and in Texas where the Republican Party has a higher number of Latino voters who identify with that party. But by and large, Latino voters care about the same things in California that they do in Texas - good jobs and good health care. CHANG: OK. Well, let's now just dig into the numbers here a bit. How did Latino voters vote, generally, in this recall election, and how does that compare to how Latinos voted in California in other recent elections? DIAZ: Our research out of UCLA looking at the 2020 presidential found that Latino voters in California, at a 3 to 1 margin, voted for Biden. And now what we were able to ascertain through the data that has been released in the state of California regarding the 2021 gubernatorial is actually outstanding, one of the reasons being that Latino turnout was higher. And in terms of their vote choice, by and large they were against the recall. In Los Angeles County, in high-density precincts with lots of Latino registered voters, 84% voted against the recall. CHANG: OK. Well, let's look at a specific county where Latinos made a difference. I'm looking at Merced County. That's north of Fresno. It was pretty interesting because the overall vote there was 50/50, but the Latino vote tells a very different story, right? DIAZ: Absolutely. So it wasn't as high as Los Angeles and Orange counties, but it was high. Merced - 74% of Latinos in these high-density precincts, again, against the recall. CHANG: OK. Well, Latino voters definitely supported the Democrat in this recall election, Gavin Newsom. But looking at the future, I am wondering if Democrats can just assume that they can rely on the Latino vote? DIAZ: Well, I was really curious about this recall given that it's on the heels of the 2021 Senate runoffs in Georgia and the work that Arizona organizers had done to send two U.S. senators from that state affiliated with the Democratic Party. Now, here in California, unfortunately what we saw was that it was civil society organizations that were going into low-propensity neighborhoods. These are voters that are registered to vote but need that mobilization to actually cast a ballot. So the fact that these voters came out, it was because of these community-based organizers that really put a message that was distinct from either party. And that message was defending California from either xenophobia, from a lack of data science, policy, you name it. That was very persuasive to these voters. And by and large, now they're likely voters going into the 2022 midterm elections. CHANG: Sonja Diaz is founding executive director of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative.

            "article_content": "The United States Capitol Police have identified the woman who was shot and killed by one of their officers during the pro-Trump rioting on Wednesday as Ashli E. Babbitt, an Air Force veteran from the San Diego area. She was among the rioters who stormed the Capitol building. Babbitt, 35, was one of four people who died during Wednesday's chaotic events, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). MPD Police Chief Robert Contee said the three others who died experienced unspecified \"medical emergencies.\" Ashli Babbitt of San Diego, seen here in a photo posted on Twitter in 2020, was shot and killed by U.S. Capitol Police during the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday.\n                \n\n                    @Ashli_Babbitt/Screenshot by NPR\n                    \n\nhide caption Ashli Babbitt of San Diego, seen here in a photo posted on Twitter in 2020, was shot and killed by U.S. Capitol Police during the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday. Babbitt's social media profiles indicate that she had most recently worked at a pool service company in Southern California. The military confirmed to NPR that she was also a veteran of the United States Air Force, where she most recently achieved the rank of senior airman. Babbitt entered active duty with the military in 2004, serving until 2008. After that, she served with the Air Force reserve from 2008 to 2010, and the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2016. During her service, she received the Iraq Campaign Medal, indicating she served there in support of the U.S. war. \"She saw first hand through her multiple deployments overseas how others were treated and was grateful to have the freedoms we have in America,\" her ex-husband and fellow Air Force veteran, Timothy McEntee, told NPR by email. Babbitt was a libertarian and supporter of President Trump, according to her social media posts, as well as a follower of the far-right conspiracy theory known as QAnon. The Anti-Defamation League describes QAnon as a \"wide-reaching conspiracy theory popular among a range of right-wing extremists\" and states the movement has \"marked undertones of antisemitism and xenophobia.\" Babbitt frequently retweeted far-right figures like the pro-Trump lawyer L. Lin Wood, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. McEntee told NPR that Babbitt was known for her outspoken political views. \"She had a personality that you either loved or hated,\" he wrote. \"She wasn't apologetic about it ... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American.\" \"I will be in DC on the 6th!\" she posted in the days leading up to Wednesday's planned demonstrations. \"God bless America and WWG1WGA.\" That acronym \u2014 meaning, \"Where We Go One, We Go All\" \u2014 is a slogan of the QAnon movement. Video of the shooting shows a chaotic scene inside the Capitol building that suddenly turned bloody. Babbitt is seen on the footage inside the Capitol wearing a backpack and Trump flag among a large group of rioters. When she approaches a window, a shot is heard and she falls back onto the floor. A witness to the shooting told the TV station WUSA9 that \"a number of police and Secret Service were saying, 'get down, get back, get out of the way.' She didn't heed the call.\" At that point, the witness said, \"they shot her in the neck.\" (NPR was unable to independently contact the witness, but he also appears in footage of the shooting itself.) \"As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female,\" the United States Capitol Police wrote in a statement on Thursday. \"Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.\" A law enforcement official told NPR that Babbitt was unarmed. Members of Babbitt's family expressed shock at the news. \"I'm numb. I'm devastated. Nobody from DC notified my son and we found out on TV,\" Ashli Babbitt's mother-in-law, Robin Babbitt, told the New York Post. \"Her laugh was infectious and her smile would brighten up any dark situation,\" Timothy McEntee told NPR. \"Her loss won't be an easy pill to swallow. I'm struggling myself to accept she's no longer with us.\" The Capitol Police along with the MPD are investigating the shooting, and the officer who killed Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy. Regardless of the outcome of that investigation, on Wednesday, Mayor Muriel Bowser blamed President Trump for the circumstances that led to Babbitt's death. \"His constant and divisive rhetoric led to the abhorrent actions we saw,\" said Bowser. \"And sadly it led to a loss of life that will forever stain what could have been and what should have been a peaceful transfer of power.\" NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.",

SUTTON, England \u2014 Hundreds of people, mostly from Hong Kong, turned out for a welcome party last month at a public park in this leafy London suburb. Children, newly arrived from the former British colony, squealed as they slid down a giant inflatable slide, stood in long lines to have their faces painted and joined together to sing \"It's a Small World After All\" for their beaming parents. The gathering, billed as the Sutton Friendship Festival, felt like a county fair for immigrants \u2014 an event that seemed at odds with a country that just five years ago voted to leave the European Union to limit immigration. \"I am so pleased that you've chosen to come here and make your home here,\" said Ruth Domby, leader of the Sutton Council, addressing some of the 400 Hong Kong families who've moved here. \"We want to help you in any way that we can to feel part of the community.\" In the first half of this year, a whopping 65,000 people from Hong Kong applied for a special five-year visa to live in the United Kingdom. They're fleeing China's tightening grip on the Asian financial hub for the safety of the former empire that once ruled them. The United Kingdom has set up a generous visa program that opens a path to citizenship for potentially millions of Hong Kongers. The government estimates as many as 475,000 will move here over the next few years. Sutton residents and newcomers from Hong Kong trade messages of welcome and calls for freedom using colored sticky notes. The message board recalls a similar one created along a wall in Hong Kong during its 2014 democracy protests.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank Langfitt/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption For couples such as Eric and Shelly, who arrived earlier this year, the visa program is an escape hatch. The couple fled Hong Kong after the Chinese government imposed a national security law which is being used to criminalize speech that had previously been free. As with nearly all the Hong Kongers interviewed for this story, NPR is not using the couple's full names to protect their relatives back home from possible retaliation by authorities. Shelly, a nurse, says that she used to write freely on Facebook. But since the new law in 2020, she says few in the territory post anything political or controversial. \"Nobody wants to talk,\" says Shelly. \"Nobody wants to share.\" This is a sea change in Hong Kong, where people used to speak about as freely as they do in the United States. Eric worked as a teacher in Hong Kong. Like other schools, his canceled a course on liberal studies, a subject designed to help students develop critical thinking skills. The school replaced it with another course built around a patriotic curriculum designed to instill support for the Chinese Communist Party. The Hong Kong government even set up a hotline where the public can anonymously report those whom they suspect of having violated the national security law. Eric and Shelly feared that if they stayed in Hong Kong, the government would eventually brainwash their children. \"I was afraid one day my children will report me through the hotline,\" says Shelly. She laughs, but isn't kidding. Britain took control of Hong Kong in 1842, after dealing a humiliating defeat to China in the First Opium War. The U.K. handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, but before doing so, China pledged in an international treaty to preserve Hong Kong's relative autonomy and freedoms for another 50 years. \"Now, Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong,\" said Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor, during the handover ceremony. \"That is the promise and that is the unshakeable destiny.\" For the first few years, that seemed possible. However, in 2003, Hong Kong's government drafted security legislation that many feared would be used to restrict their freedoms. After hundreds of thousands protested, authorities shelved the plan. But the government didn't give up. In 2019, it drafted legislation to allow extradition of Hong Kongers to stand trial in mainland China, where the conviction rate is about 99%. That provoked protests, which turned violent and paralyzed parts of city. China's parliament responded by imposing the national security law, which authorities have used to crush dissent, arresting dozens of pro-democracy activists including Jimmy Lai, the editor of the now-shuttered Apple Daily, an aggressive newspaper that routinely criticized the Communist Party. The U.K. said the new law violated the treaty between the two countries. It responded by offering most Hong Kongers five-year visas, with the right to apply for permanent residency. Hundreds fill London's Piccadilly Circus on Oct. 1, China's National Day, to protest the Chinese Communist Party's treatment of Hong Kong, Tibet and the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank Langfitt/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anti-immigrant sentiment and some xenophobia drove the U.K.'s Brexit campaign in 2016, leading Britain to walk away from decades of economic and political integration with the European Union. Five years later, hardly anyone is complaining about the influx of Hong Kongers. In fact, communities such as Sutton are rolling out the red carpet. Steve Tsang, who runs the China Institute at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, says it comes down to the profile of the immigrants and the power of colonial ties. \"Hong Kong immigrants are likely to be from the middle-class, professional background, who would either be bringing in enough money to have early retirement or they will be coming in as very industrious, entrepreneurial workers,\" says Tsang, who grew up in Hong Kong. The British government sees them as more valuable to the economy, he says, and less of a strain on government resources than, say, poorer, less-educated farm workers from Eastern Europe, who were among the targets of the Brexit campaign. When China violated its pledge over Hong Kong, the British government had limited options. If it hit China with economic sanctions, China could have retaliated against British businesses. Benedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, an advocacy group that monitors basic freedoms there, says the visa program was \"less provocative.\" On Oct. 1, China's National Day, hundreds of Hong Kongers descended on London's Piccadilly Circus to protest the Chinese Communist Party's treatment of Hong Kong, Tibet and the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Among the crowd were younger political activists who had fled Hong Kong this year to avoid arrest and prison. Edward, 32, boarded a plane for London last winter after learning Hong Kong police planned to arrest people like him who had helped organize a primary election for pro-democratic parties, which China had ruled illegal. Edward only told a few friends and family members he was leaving. Hundreds of protesters march from London's Piccadilly Circus toward the Chinese Embassy.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank Langfitt/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"In Hong Kong, you have to protect them,\" Edward says, pointing out that authorities retaliate against family members of activists. Like every Hong Konger interviewed for this story, Edward is grateful to the British government, but his transition has been jarring at times. He gave up a well-paying logistics job in Hong Kong and worked for a time as an import clearance clerk, earning minimum wage. Compared to Hong Kong's fast-paced business culture, Edward found his new British employer old-fashioned. \"I tried to write a program within the company just to stream down their data processing, and I was able to trim down a two-man job to a one-man job,\" he says. The company was not happy with this, he adds: \"They said, 'Edward, we don't like you changing things.'\" Even some who've escaped Hong Kong haven't left China entirely behind. Last year, friends in Hong Kong warned Finn Lau, a democratic activist, that he could be targeted for attack \u2014 even in England. Two months later, Lau, 27, was strolling one evening through otherwise-safe West London. He spotted several men in hoodies following him. When he stopped to check, he recalls: \"They rushed and started beating me, kicking and beating my head.\" He says the men didn't take anything, nor say anything racist, but just kept hitting him. \"There was a moment I asked myself, 'Is this the end of my life?'\" he says. Lau passed out. When he came to, he went to the hospital, covered in blood. He was treated for cuts to the face and head injuries, according to a medical report. The doctor referred the case to the police, who couldn't identify the men. The attack has not deterred Lau. He led the protest in Piccadilly Circus at the beginning of this month and marched with hundreds of people to demonstrate in front of the Chinese Embassy. But when Lau walks around London, the city where he has sought refuge, he says he's much more cautious now. London producer Jessica Beck contributed to this report.",

Amazon was already an economic behemoth before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. But when many Americans ramped up their shopping from home, the company saw explosive growth. In short, ProPublica journalist Alec MacGillis writes in Fulfillment, its fortunes diverged from the nation's economic fortunes. The book looks at the American economy through the lens of Amazon \u2014 the forces that made it, the trends it accelerated, and the inequality that he argues has resulted from the growth of Big Tech. The NPR Politics Podcast spoke to him about America's \"winning\" and \"losing\" cities, what Amazon has to do with former President Donald Trump's election, and how much it matters when consumers decide to boycott huge companies like Amazon. Fulfillment was the latest selection in the NPR Politics Podcast Book Club. Join in the book conversations at the podcast's Facebook group. The next discussion, in late June, will be about Elizabeth Hinton's America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s. The following are excerpts from the full interview with MacGillis, with answers edited for clarity and length. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Your book isn't exactly what I was expecting. I sort of went into it thinking, \"this is going to be a book that's, 'Amazon [is] bad \u2014 it has bad labor practices and it hurts small business, etc.' \" And while Amazon doesn't come off as quite a hero, the book is much more about the American economy and American economic history through an Amazon lens. How would you describe what you were trying to do? ALEC MACGILLIS: Yes, I actually came to Amazon secondarily within the book. I wanted to write a book for years now about regional disparities in America \u2014 the sort of growing regional inequality between a small set of what I call sort of winner-take-all cities, cities like Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston, D.C., and a much larger set of cities and towns that have that have really been falling behind. We've always had richer and poorer places, but the gap between them has gotten a lot bigger in recent years, and it's really unhealthy for the country. I especially wanted to write about it after Trump got elected; it was so clear just what a big role these regional disparities had in Trump's election. I chose Amazon as the frame for two different reasons. One is that the company is so ubiquitous now in our life, just so omnipresent, that it's a handy thread to kind of just take you around the country and show what we're becoming as a country in kind of a metaphorical kind of way. But it's also a very handy frame for the story of racial inequality, because the company is itself helping drive these disparities. The regional concentration of wealth in our country is very closely tied to the concentration of our economy in certain companies. DK: I'm not sure what the timeline was of you working on this book, but when you saw the big HQ2 contest happen \u2014 it's like your book's thesis on steroids. What was your reaction to Amazon holding essentially a Bachelor competition for where its next headquarters would be? AM: It was quite serendipitous in a way that they embarked on this process while I was working on the book. I actually chose Washington, D.C. as one of the two \"winner\" cities that I was going to focus on before it got chosen by Amazon to be the second headquarters. [Amazon chose the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va., as a new headquarters site in 2018.] I knew that I wanted to focus on Seattle because it already was the Amazon headquarters. And I wanted to focus on Washington because it was so clear that Washington was another winner-take-all city that had been completely transformed by this kind of hyper-prosperity. And then, lo and behold, they go ahead and pick Washington as their second headquarters. Another reason I wanted to have Washington as a second winner-take-all city is that I found the contrast between Washington and Baltimore so compelling for me. The sort of spiritual heart of the book is the contrast between Washington [and] Baltimore, these two cities that are just 40 miles apart. I've moved between these cities now for the last 20 years, working and living in both places. And it's just been so striking to watch the gap growing between them, and to me, just really upsetting and disheartening to watch that happening. You have one city that's become just incredibly unaffordable for so many people, where it costs, you know, seven, eight, nine hundred thousand dollars to buy a row house, if not more. All these people, longtime residents, mostly longtime black residents, being displaced by the thousands. And then just up the road in Baltimore, you have such deep population decline that you have rowhouses, that are going for seven or eight hundred thousand dollars down the road, being demolished by the hundreds. That just is not good for people in either sort of city, and Amazon is really at the core of that. They chose Washington as their headquarters. It's going to get only richer or more expensive. DK: There's so much to get at here in terms of the economic forces at work \u2014 the way that city government works, NIMBYism in action, de-unionization, companies getting preferential tax treatment, that sort of thing. How did we get here? Is there an original sin that sort of led to where we are, or is it just that we went from a goods-based to a tech-based economy, and this just sort of inevitably happened? AM: There are so many forces that flow into this, and the book really tries to describe a lot of them and to show that this is not just about Amazon. But there's no solutions chapter. It's not an argument book or policy book, but it does leave one, I would I imagine, with the implicit sense that if there is an original sin, if there's one thing that we need to now be focusing on, it is the fact that we have so allowed our approach to monopoly and antitrust in this country to wither as much as we have, that we essentially arrived at something like the moment we were at in 1910, 1915, in the years of the Gilded Age. We recognized that at that time, belatedly, and we took it on and and and then for several decades had a fairly vigorous approach to monopoly and antitrust. And then over the second half of the last century, we allowed that to atrophy. DK: You talked about this regional economic inequality contributing to how people vote, the rise of Donald Trump. I'm curious about your perspective on the whole ongoing economic-anxiety-versus-racial-resentment conversation that there always has been around Trumpism. AM: I spent a lot of 2016 in Ohio \u2014 pretty early on about the rise of Trump and sort of how it was happening, trying to make sense of it. And I've always believed that the economic issues were closely tied together with his racist and xenophobic appeals, that the economic realities [and] decline made people more vulnerable to those appeals. As I put it in the book, the economic decline and resentment does not excuse racism and xenophobia, but rather weaponized it. It made it more powerful. The fact is that it's a big challenge for the Democratic Party that then a lot of these places that used to be real bastions of the party, as these communities have declined, as they've really seen their fortunes fall, [residents] look to the cities, the winner-take-all-cities that have become now the base of the Democratic Party \u2014 to San Francisco and Boston, to New York City and Seattle. And they not only feel resentment of their extraordinary wealth and prosperity, but they also look to the Democrats in those cities and feel alienation. They feel this sense of, \"That is not me. In no way am I those people. Those people cannot possibly be in the same party as me, because they're utterly removed from my experience.\" And that is sort of how you get to the Obama-Trump voter. The Democratic Party is now increasingly becoming what I think of as sort of the Amazon Coalition. It's a coalition of, on the one hand, the highly-educated middle and upper-middle class, big blue metro residents who do a lot of shopping on Amazon. And then on the other hand, the party still has quite a lot of working-class black and brown voters, many of whom work at Amazon now as the warehouse workers, as the drivers. And so you have this coalition of the party that is essentially the people who are buying all this stuff online, highly educated, mostly white professionals buying all this stuff, and then the people packing and delivering it to them, which is a which is a pretty awkward coalition and and perhaps not the most sustainable one. DK: I do know people, and I'm sure you do, too, who don't buy from Amazon or who have stepped back in buying from Amazon for ethical or moral reasons. But your book is so much about systems and the effects of policies, these high-level things. So I'm curious about your take \u2014 how much can consumer choice make a difference? AM: I think it actually can. I think that both levels of this matter, obviously the systemic and structural forces matter a lot. And it's why, as citizens, we should be pushing for [and] thinking more seriously about antitrust and seeing how that seemingly abstract notion connects to all these parts of our life, and pushing our representatives to care about it and act on it. But I also do believe that consumer choice matters. The fact is that it was our consumer choices this past year that drove this extraordinary growth of this company. Our choices do matter. And I don't advocate for a boycott or any kind of cold-turkey because, of course, the company provides convenience for some people who really kind of depend on it. But I do believe that we can moderate and because what we saw this past year was not moderate, it was an extraordinary embrace of the one-click kind of life with an alacrity that was just kind of off the charts. I do believe that it's going to be very important for us now going forward to return to the physical world around us, not just in our shopping, but in all aspects of life, just to try to re-engage with the physical world. Because if we don't, then it will wither. And then you really are left with only Amazon as your only option, because everything else is kind of as has vanished. DK: I want to end on a piece of news that happened after your book, which is the push to unionize at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama. I'm curious, what were your thoughts on the fact that unionization didn't end up panning out for organizers? Also, what could and couldn't a union change for Amazon workers? AM: I was following that whole fight with fascination. It was just incredible to have an actual election at a full warehouse, the first time that had happened in Amazon's history. And I was also not surprised by the outcome because the the odds were so stacked against them. The laws right now make it really tough to organize workers. Companies are so adept at at fighting unions, and [Amazon] really pulled out all the stops down there to try to prevent the union from winning. But I think it's too soon to say that it was a total loss from the kind of activism standpoint. It did bring a lot of scrutiny to Amazon warehouse conditions. And it really did, I think, spark a lot of ferment around the country at other warehouses. The stakes are so great because this really, if you think of it, the grand historical terms in the context of the book, warehouse work, or working at an Amazon warehouse, really has become now the mass employment option in this country, with almost a half million people hired just this past year alone. This is now increasingly the place to go to work if you don't have a college degree, if you don't have specialized training, you're just looking for a job the way you used to go to the steel mill or the factory or the shopping mall. Now you go to the Amazon warehouse. And so if we want to lift up working class existence in this country and make these jobs [and] that kind of existence into something more sustainable, more kind of family-supporting, middle-class-supporting, you have to lift up the warehouse work, because that's where it's at.",

And they not only feel resentment of their extraordinary wealth and prosperity, but they also look to the Democrats in those cities and feel alienation. They feel this sense of, \"That is not me. In no way am I those people. Those people cannot possibly be in the same party as me, because they're utterly removed from my experience.\" And that is sort of how you get to the Obama-Trump voter. The Democratic Party is now increasingly becoming what I think of as sort of the Amazon Coalition. It's a coalition of, on the one hand, the highly-educated middle and upper-middle class, big blue metro residents who do a lot of shopping on Amazon. And then on the other hand, the party still has quite a lot of working-class black and brown voters, many of whom work at Amazon now as the warehouse workers, as the drivers. And so you have this coalition of the party that is essentially the people who are buying all this stuff online, highly educated, mostly white professionals buying all this stuff, and then the people packing and delivering it to them, which is a which is a pretty awkward coalition and and perhaps not the most sustainable one. DK: I do know people, and I'm sure you do, too, who don't buy from Amazon or who have stepped back in buying from Amazon for ethical or moral reasons. But your book is so much about systems and the effects of policies, these high-level things. So I'm curious about your take \u2014 how much can consumer choice make a difference? AM: I think it actually can. I think that both levels of this matter, obviously the systemic and structural forces matter a lot. And it's why, as citizens, we should be pushing for [and] thinking more seriously about antitrust and seeing how that seemingly abstract notion connects to all these parts of our life, and pushing our representatives to care about it and act on it. But I also do believe that consumer choice matters. The fact is that it was our consumer choices this past year that drove this extraordinary growth of this company. Our choices do matter. And I don't advocate for a boycott or any kind of cold-turkey because, of course, the company provides convenience for some people who really kind of depend on it. But I do believe that we can moderate and because what we saw this past year was not moderate, it was an extraordinary embrace of the one-click kind of life with an alacrity that was just kind of off the charts. I do believe that it's going to be very important for us now going forward to return to the physical world around us, not just in our shopping, but in all aspects of life, just to try to re-engage with the physical world. Because if we don't, then it will wither. And then you really are left with only Amazon as your only option, because everything else is kind of as has vanished. DK: I want to end on a piece of news that happened after your book, which is the push to unionize at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama. I'm curious, what were your thoughts on the fact that unionization didn't end up panning out for organizers? Also, what could and couldn't a union change for Amazon workers? AM: I was following that whole fight with fascination. It was just incredible to have an actual election at a full warehouse, the first time that had happened in Amazon's history. And I was also not surprised by the outcome because the the odds were so stacked against them. The laws right now make it really tough to organize workers. Companies are so adept at at fighting unions, and [Amazon] really pulled out all the stops down there to try to prevent the union from winning. But I think it's too soon to say that it was a total loss from the kind of activism standpoint. It did bring a lot of scrutiny to Amazon warehouse conditions. And it really did, I think, spark a lot of ferment around the country at other warehouses. The stakes are so great because this really, if you think of it, the grand historical terms in the context of the book, warehouse work, or working at an Amazon warehouse, really has become now the mass employment option in this country, with almost a half million people hired just this past year alone. This is now increasingly the place to go to work if you don't have a college degree, if you don't have specialized training, you're just looking for a job the way you used to go to the steel mill or the factory or the shopping mall. Now you go to the Amazon warehouse. And so if we want to lift up working class existence in this country and make these jobs [and] that kind of existence into something more sustainable, more kind of family-supporting, middle-class-supporting, you have to lift up the warehouse work, because that's where it's at.",

President Biden and Vice President Harris called for unity  after attacks against Asian Americans have surged since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. \"There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans,\" Biden said during a speech at Emory University in Atlanta on Friday. \"One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation.\" Biden's remarks came three days after a gunman opened fire at three massage businesses in the Atlanta area, killing eight people, including six women of Asian descent. While the suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long of Georgia, told investigators that the shootings were not racially motivated, physical violence and verbal harassment against members of the Asian American community have spiked over the past year. \"Whatever the motivation, we know this, too many Asian Americans walking up and down the streets are worried,\" Biden said. \"They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, harassed, they've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.\" The president said that these incidents are evidence that \"words have consequences.\" Hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States increased 149% in 2020, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. That increase roughly tracks with the COVID-19 pandemic and former President Donald Trump's efforts to blame China for spreading the coronavirus, repeatedly referring to it as the \"China virus,\" \"China plague\" and \"Kung flu.\" Harris, who joined Biden during the trip to Atlanta, called Tuesday's shooting rampage a \"heinous act of violence\" that has no place in Georgia or the United States. She also said that the uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes is a reminder that racism, xenophobia and sexism is real in America and \"always has been.\" Biden and Harris met with local leaders of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community behind closed doors during their visit to Georgia's capital. The president also called on Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. The previously planned visit to Atlanta had initially been intended as a victory lap for the passage of the president's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, which won approval in the closely divided Senate thanks to Democratic victories in two Georgia runoff elections.

To honor the victims, Biden on Thursday ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal buildings and installations. In Atlanta, Biden and Harris also visited the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where they received an update on efforts to fight COVID-19. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling on Air Force One that Biden will offer support for Asian Americans in the state and across the country and talk about his commitment to battling xenophobia and hatred. The president wants to hear about the impact of the violent incident from local elected officials, she said. In an interview that aired on NPR member station WABE, Georgia state Sen. Michelle Au, who is of East Asian descent, said Tuesday's shooting rampage is symbolic of a larger problem. \"I'd like to point out that this latest event on Tuesday, and even the escalating discrimination and violence we have seen over the past year with the development of the coronavirus pandemic, is simply the newest chapter in a very old story,\" Au said. Following this week's shootings, Au issued a statement, saying, \"We need help, we need protection, and we need people to stand up against hate.\"",

            "article_content": "Sacha Baron Cohen, shown here in 2019, has been nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: two for acting in and producing Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and another for his supporting actor role in The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\n                    \n                    Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sacha Baron Cohen, shown here in 2019, has been nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: two for acting in and producing Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and another for his supporting actor role in The Trial of the Chicago 7. British actor Sacha Baron Cohen is known for creating absurd characters and then bringing them into the real world \u2014 and for interacting with people who have no idea the characters aren't real. Nearly 20 years ago, he created the character of Borat Sagdiyev, a dimwitted, anti-Semitic, sexist TV journalist from Kazakhstan. The 2006 film Borat aimed to expose American bigotry, xenophobia and sexism as the title character's unwitting scene partners reveal their true beliefs. The film was an international success, making Borat a widely recognizable, highly quotable fixture of pop culture. Baron Cohen assumed the jig was up: Once the world understood that Borat wasn't real, there would be no way to interact with the public like before. But when Donald Trump was elected president and there was a rise in anti-Semitic, racist, xenophobic rhetoric, Baron Cohen decided to revive his signature character. \"I felt very clearly from the start of the [Trump] administration that we were heading towards authoritarianism. And so I felt I had to do something,\" he says. \"I was terrified that if Trump got in again, that America would be a democracy in name only.\" In Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, which was released on Amazon in October, the character returns to America to offer President Trump a bribe. When it becomes clear that Borat will not meet the president, Borat tries unsuccessfully to give his 15-year-old daughter (played by Maria Bakalova) to Vice President Pence as a gift. He then settles for giving her to Rudy Giuliani, which ends in a now infamous scene in a hotel bedroom. Baron Cohen has been chased, nearly arrested and sued during his filmmaking process. While filming at a gun rights rally for the Borat sequel, Baron Cohen was afraid for his life. He thinks it's time to retire the undercover characters. \"At some point, your luck runs out. And so I never wanted to do this stuff again,\" he says. \"I can't.\" Baron Cohen has been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for his role producing and starring in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. He has also been nominated in the best supporting actor category for playing Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman in the Netflix film The Trial of the Chicago 7. On fearing for his life at a gun rights rally while filming the Borat sequel I was wearing a bulletproof vest, and that's only the second time in my career that I've ever done that. But I was told that there was a chance that somebody might try to shoot at me. I was very aware that once the crowd realized that I was a fake, that it could turn really ugly and it could be really dangerous. ... Sacha Baron Cohen plays a Kazakh TV journalist who travels around the U.S. with his daughter in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.\n\n                    \n                    Cos Aelenei/Amazon Prime Video\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sacha Baron Cohen plays a Kazakh TV journalist who travels around the U.S. with his daughter in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. I remember putting on the bulletproof vest before the scene, looking in the mirror of a nearby hotel, and ... I remember asking the makeup guy, \"Do you think I'm going to get shot today?\" And he's like, \"No, no, no, no.\" I said, \"Well, why am I putting on the bulletproof vest then?\" And he didn't really have an answer. I kept on coming back to this feeling. Again, I didn't want to do Borat again. I didn't want to go undercover again. I felt I had to do anything I could to remind people of what, in 90 minutes, in a humorous way, of what Trump had done the prior four years, and I felt I had to try and infiltrate his inner circle, which we did do with Rudy Giuliani and Mike Pence. We felt we had to do that. I felt I had to get this movie out before the election. But, yes, maybe I'm crazy. On whether he thinks that there's an ethical gray area to bringing characters into the world and deceiving people Those are the discussions that we have in the writers' room continually: Is this ethical? What's the purpose of this scene? Is it just to be funny? Is there some satire? Is that satire worth it? When you're doing stuff like a gun rally and you could get shot, then morally it's very clear. Or if you're undermining one of Trump's inner circle, whose sole aim is to undermine the legitimacy of the election, then, yeah, that's moral. I mean, look at what Rudy did post Borat coming out. He spread this big lie that Trump had won the election. And that lie is so dangerous and so misleading that it led to the attack on the Capitol \u2014 and it hasn't ended. Is the movie as a whole ethical? Yes. We did it because there was a deeply unethical government in power. Sacha Baron Cohen So the morality of seeing how Rudy would react when he was alone in a room with an attractive young woman, I think that morality is pretty clear. I think it's evidence of the misogyny that was trumpeted by the president and was almost a badge of honor with his inner circle. What we did with Rudy was crucial. I mean, we made the movie to have an impact on the election. ... So ethically, I can stand by that all day long. Is the movie as a whole ethical? Yes. We did it because there was a deeply unethical government in power. And there was no question. ... We had to do what we could to inspire people to vote and remind people of the immorality of the government prior to the election. ... I have no doubt about the morality of this film. I'm very proud of it. On not appearing as himself publicly to preserve the identity of his characters for many years I had never wanted to give any interviews as myself. And I had a fantastic period in England where Ali G, which was the first sort of character that I'd done, was a phenomenon in England. Ali G, the character, was huge. It was incredibly famous. ... But me, Sacha, I was unknown, and it was just fantastic. I was able to go on the Tube. I was able to have all the benefits of fame and not be famous. So I wanted to continue that, and also it helped my work. I realized that if I became famous as myself, it would make making my work almost impossible. ... I wish I could have carried on like that and not become famous as myself. There are great benefits to fame in that you can speak to people who [you] shouldn't be able to speak to. People will take your call. ... Some people love getting recognized and love the attention. I don't love it. I loved that period where the shows were really successful but nobody knew who I was. I remember once, the first time we released the Ali G video \u2014 and it was a video back in those days \u2014 and I stood in this record store called HMV on Oxford Street, was the biggest one in London, and I was surrounded by Ali G fans who were buying the VHS, and I was dressed as Borat. And they were like, \"Get out of the way! Get out! You stink!\" And it was such a pleasure for me for them not to know who I was. And then, you know, being on the Tube, the Underground in London, and hearing people talk about Ali G or do Ali G impressions and not realizing that they were next to the man who performed it. For me, that was the most fun period. On what captivated him about Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman, whom he plays in The Trial of the Chicago 7 He was very aware, of the stage and of the cameras, that he was creating a persona and performing actions in order to get young people motivated. So he knew that he could use humor to, firstly, challenge systemic racism and the establishment. But he also knew that if he was funny and brilliant, which he was, he would be able to get some young people to sacrifice their lives to fight against the Vietnam War. He was influenced by the idea of taking theater into the streets, and he was very, very thoughtful. So he was going on stand-up tours during the trial. They felt very off the cuff; however, they were extremely prepared. He had studied Lenny Bruce \u2014 studied the rhythms and also learned some other lessons from Lenny Bruce, including that the trial was a show trial and that they would be convicted. ... \"The more I read about him, I did see some similarity [between us],\" Sacha Baron Cohen says of Abbie Hoffman, the real-life activist he plays in The Trial of the Chicago 7. \n\n                    \n                    Niko Tavernise/Netflix\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The more I read about him, I did see some similarity [between us],\" Sacha Baron Cohen says of Abbie Hoffman, the real-life activist he plays in The Trial of the Chicago 7. He was aware that they didn't have any money \u2014 the Yippies didn't have any money ... [and] that he could actually make an impact was by being funny, by doing these seemingly crazy things, like getting thousands of students to try and levitate the Pentagon or nominating a pig to run for leader of the Democratic Party. The more I read about him, I did see some similarity [between us] ... to a degree. On his audition to play Abbie Hoffman (back when Steven Spielberg was attached to direct) I heard that there was going to be a movie about the Chicago 7. I was kind of obsessed with Abbie Hoffman from the age of 20, and with great chutzpah I called up Steven Spielberg and I said, \"Can you let me audition?\" And he had some reservations, particularly about the accent, because he knew it was a very specific accent. And he sent me a dialect coach, and ... every night we recorded three versions of his speech. And after two weeks, Spielberg said, \"OK, I need a version of that speech that you're happy with. Deliver it to my house at 9 a.m.\" So I had recorded about 30 versions. The dialect coach said [to use] Take 28, and I instructed my assistant \u2014 I said, \"Put Take 28 on a CD. Deliver it to Mr. Spielberg's house.\" I meet up with Steven ... and he sits me down and he says, \"Listen, Sacha, I've got to be honest. I got the CD. Thank you. The first 10 or so takes were not very good at all.\" And I realize my assistant had given the wrong CD. He had listened to all 28. He goes, \"By the end, Sacha, it was perfect.\" By the way, that is why Spielberg is Spielberg and why a lot of those people are who they are. They've got incredible talent, but they sit through to Take 28 when they should have switched off after Take 4. Lauren Krenzel and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Updated at 3:33 p.m. ET Saying it's time to act \"because that's what faith and morality require us to do,\" President Biden on Tuesday signed four executive actions aimed at advancing racial equity for Americans the White House says have been underserved and left behind. Biden said Tuesday that the measures follow one of his core campaign promises: to restore \"the soul of the nation,\" as he often said during the presidential race. \"Our soul will be troubled,\" he said, \"as long as systemic racism is allowed to exist.\" In announcing the actions, Biden cited the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer last May, which touched off demonstrations in cities across the United States. Biden called the killing \"the knee on the neck of justice,\" and said that because of it, \"the ground has shifted. It changed minds and mindsets.\" The four executive actions Biden signed: Before the signing ceremony, Biden also called for restoring and extending the Voting Rights Act, but announced no new initiatives regarding ballot access. Some state legislatures are seeking to restrict access in the aftermath of November's elections. Earlier, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told reporters that \"advancing equity is a critical part of healing and of restoring unity in our nation.\" Rice cited a 2016 Department of Justice inspector general's report that she said found private prisons are \"less safe, less secure and arguably less humane.\" She said Biden is committed to reducing incarceration levels \"while making communities safer,\" which she said starts with not issuing any new federal contracts for private prisons. But Rice said the order does not apply to private prisons used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ACLU called Biden's action on private prisons \"an important first step,\" but that he \"has an obligation to do more, especially given his history and promises.\" According to the federal Bureau of Prisons, a little over 14,000 federal inmates are currently in privately managed facilities. That's 9% of total federal inmates. In a statement, the Day 1 Alliance, a trade association representing private detention facilities, said Biden's action \"is a misguided attempt to blame longtime government contractors for a 'mass incarceration' problem they actually play zero role in driving.\" The White House said the presidential memorandum on housing directs HUD to \"examine the effects of the Trump administration's regulatory actions that undermined fair housing policies and laws,\" and the measure also \"recognizes the central role the federal government has played implementing housing policies across the United States, from redlining to mortgage discrimination to destructive federal highway construction, that have had racially discriminatory impacts.\" The Biden administration says the executive action on tribal sovereignty shows its commitment \"to re-establishing federal respect for Tribal sovereignty, strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship between the federal government and American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes, empowering self-determination, and advancing racial justice for Native communities.\" The order, the White House says, \"reinvigorates the commitment of all federal agencies to engage in regular, robust, and meaningful consultation with Tribal governments.\" Biden's presidential memorandum on Asian American and Pacific Islanders  establishes that the policy of the administration \"is to condemn and denounce anti-Asian bias and discrimination,\"  which Biden called \"unacceptable and un-American.\" Hate crimes against Asian Americans rose along with the spread of the coronavirus, which emerged from China. Former President Donald Trump routinely referred to it as \"the China virus.\" The memorandum directs the Department of Health and Human Services \"to consider issuing guidance describing best practices to advance cultural competency, language access, and sensitivity towards AAPIs in the federal government's COVID-19 response.\" It also directs the Department of Justice to work with Asian American and Pacific Islander communities \"to prevent hate crimes and harassment against AAPIs.\" Tuesday's measures continue Biden's rollout of more than 20 executive actions in his administration's first days. One executive action signed last week requires all federal departments and agencies to look for ways to address racial equity. And a senior government official, who spoke to reporters Tuesday on the condition of not being identified, said, \"This is not the end of our work on racial equity,\" adding that \"we'll have a lot more work to do in the coming weeks and months.\"",

He also said that states will see a boost in supply over the next three weeks, which will be a huge help because, as we've talked about before, people trying to get vaccines are often having their appointments canceled or delayed because there just aren't enough doses to go around. MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Scott Detrow is with us now to walk through what Biden is pledging, some of the challenges in all of this. Hi, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, good morning. MARTIN: President Biden says we need more vaccine. What details can you share about his announcement? DETROW: Yeah. So the federal government is in the process of buying 100 million new doses from Pfizer-BioNTech and 100 million from Moderna as well. And Biden says those should arrive over the course of the summer. And when they are distributed, the U.S. would have 600 million doses, which would be enough supplies to vaccinate 300 million Americans, which is nearly the entire population. Of course, that is if everything is on schedule. And Biden did concede that that is a very big if. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we've ever undertaken as a nation. I've said that before, but I must say it again because we're going to do everything we can to get it done. But a lot of things can go wrong along the way. DETROW: And the latest data from the CDC shows how challenging this is. So far, about 44 million vaccines have been distributed to states, 23 million shots have been administered, but only 3 million people at this point have gotten both of those shots. Remember, both these vaccines require two rounds of shots that are separated. This was urgent all along, but recent news of more contagious variants around the world makes it even more urgent to speed up the vaccination process. MARTIN: So the president wants to secure these couple hundred million more doses. That's going to help over the next few months. But what about the distribution issues now? I mean, vaccination sites don't have enough vaccine to meet demand. DETROW: Yeah. He announced a couple changes, some logistical and some just about getting more vaccines out. Biden said that there's going to be an increase over the next few weeks in the supply going to states. Up to 10 million doses a week will be going out now. That's up from 8.6 million. He also addressed one big complaint from state officials. They have said they're often in the dark about how many vaccines are coming beyond next week. And that makes it really hard to plan distribution. So Biden says going forward, the federal government is going to provide a three-week forecast to states so they can better adjust. MARTIN: We heard in that clip earlier Biden say that a lot of things can go wrong - clearly. Just explain, though, Scott, how important is it to his presidency for this to go right? DETROW: You know, President Biden is going to have a very clear success or failure on this, and that's almost certainly going to be a big way that voters will judge him. And I think Biden's probably pretty fine with that. This is something that's very hard to spin, right? Last year, President Trump learned how his promises and claims on testing were not selling. He said everyone can get a test if they want one. People around the country just knew that wasn't true based on their personal experience. And for Biden, people are going to be vaccinated or not, and they're going to see life start to return to normal or not. He has made tackling this vaccine a central part of his presidency. But you have already seen - as Biden has turned to governing and being the person in charge, you've already seen the White House struggling a little bit with how to frame their goal on vaccinations. For example, Biden has consistently said his goal is to get 100 million shots into people's arms in his first 100 days. A lot of experts criticized that as too low. So you saw on Monday, he started to change a little bit, saying, well, actually, we're hoping to get 150 million shots. He was back to 100 million yesterday. But that's just one example of how it's a little more challenging when you're the person in charge in real time. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Scott Detrow, we'll be checking back with you on this. Thanks. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, we're going to take a closer look now at another campaign promise from the new president. Biden has pledged to address systemic racism in this country. MCCAMMON: Yesterday, he talked about the death of George Floyd as a turning point for America. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people all over the world. MCCAMMON: Biden signed executive actions on Tuesday meant to address racial inequities in housing, private prisons and the treatment of Native Americans and Asian Americans. MARTIN: NPR's justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is with us this morning. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: I mean, this was, as we noted, a fundamental promise by Joe Biden in the campaign. So it makes sense. He had to address it right out of the gate. JOHNSON: Absolutely, Rachel. Remember, Biden always said on the campaign trail that he ran for president after seeing the tragedy in Charlottesville, Va., several years ago. And here's what he had to say yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I ran for president because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation. And the simple truth is our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. JOHNSON: And a little more detail on the executive orders. The first one directs federal agencies to overcome a history of discrimination in housing and restore some critical tools to uncover racism when it exists in things like denying people who are applying for mortgages or rental units. The second executive order instructs the Justice Department to phase out contracts with private prisons. And the final two orders promise support for Native American sovereignty, and they call on federal agencies to fight xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which has really spiked since the pandemic. MARTIN: So those are the specific executive actions. But of course, the leadership all comes from the White House, and that is going to be pushed by a particular person who's been tapped with dealing with this, right? JOHNSON: Indeed. Former ambassador Susan Rice is going to be leading the charge from the White House Domestic Policy Council. She's assembled a team that's going to work to ensure that agencies across the government put equity at the core of their mission. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUSAN RICE: We'll hold the federal government accountable for advancing equity for families across America. I have the support of every White House office and every agency in this work because, as President Biden has made clear, advancing equity is everybody's job. JOHNSON: Now, Rachel, we know the president has picked the most diverse Cabinet in American history, but the Biden team quietly has been putting civil rights experts in jobs all across the government that don't require Senate confirmation, not just inside the Justice Department. MARTIN: So how is this going over with the people for whom this is their life's work? I mean, we're talking about the advocates on civil rights issues. JOHNSON: For sure. I spoke with David Fathi. He directs the National Prison Project at the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union. He says this phase-out of contracts with private prisons who work with the Justice Department is a good first step. But he says the president has an obligation to do a lot more because of all his promises on the campaign trail. DAVID FATHI: There is much, much more work that needs to be done. Most obviously, this order does not apply to immigration detention, where more than 80% of detained immigrants are held in private, for-profit prisons. JOHNSON: Advocates also want to see a lot more on policing, a ban on chokeholds, a requirement that officers intervene if they see a fellow officer engaged in abuse or excessive force. More to come on all of that. MARTIN: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thank you. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. What do you say to the guy responsible for interfering in your country's democratic election system? I mean, I suppose you start with hello, but I don't really know where you go after that. MCCAMMON: Right? We are talking about the phone call that President Biden had with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday. White House officials say Biden took on big issues like the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, cyber-espionage and Russian bounties on American troops. MARTIN: All right. All controversial issues. How were they received? We're going to ask NPR's Lucian Kim, who is with us from Moscow. Good morning, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So what Sarah just noted, all these three topics, very important, but the substance of the call actually had to do with an important arms treaty, right? What can you tell us? KIM: Exactly. The main thing they talked about was actually the New START Treaty. This is the last nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, and it literally expires at the end of next week. The Trump administration tried to add new conditions to the treaty in its negotiations with Russia. That failed. Now there's not any time left, and it looks like both sides are going for a straight five-year extension as provided for in the treaty. As for the other things they talked about, you know, the Kremlin emphasizes in its readout that they talked about cooperation in fighting the coronavirus and bilateral trade. The White House readout, however, brings up some of the thornier issues, as you mentioned, specifically, the cyberattack on U.S. government agencies, Russian election interference. So the Kremlin was much more diplomatic and conciliatory in its tone while the White House was much tougher. MARTIN: And we should just note, this is a stark difference between the conversation topics as we understood them between President Trump and Vladimir Putin than it is between now-President Biden and Putin. I mean, they have a relationship, too. Biden has met Putin when he was vice president in the Obama administration. What do we know about the personal relationship between the two? KIM: Well, it's not an easy one. I don't think there's any love lost between Biden and Putin. But all the Russian experts I've talked to say Putin is pragmatic, he's ready to do business, and he's really desperate to get the attention of the United States. You know, despite Trump's admiration for Putin, he left relations in a really bad place. The last time we know there was a phone call between the presidents of Russia and the U.S. was last summer, six months ago. Biden understands the U.S. needs to deal with Russia, and he's in a hurry to extend this New START Treaty. What I think is telling is how he made the call. He did it after Antony Blinken was confirmed as secretary of state and as Blinken and the other foreign ministers of the G-7 group of nations condemned Navalny's imprisonment. Besides that, quite symbolically, Biden also called the secretary general of NATO yesterday. So this all sends a very clear message to Putin that the U.S. is working with its allies again and will very loudly criticize the Kremlin. MARTIN: I mean, we remember George W. Bush saying I looked into his eyes and saw Putin's soul. We remember Hillary Clinton with the big red reset button. I mean, what's Joe Biden's relationship with Russia going to be? What changes can we see? KIM: Well, in the short term, it looks like both sides can agree that renewing New START is a win-win situation for both countries. But in his phone call, Biden alluded to a lot of the huge stumbling blocks that lie ahead. And these are the issues that won't go away and will dominate the bilateral agenda. MARTIN: NPR's Lucian Kim from Moscow. Thanks, Lucian. KIM: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The French Senate passed an amendment that would make it illegal for girls to wear the religious veil worn by Muslim women. The measure will likely fail when up for debate in the National Assembly.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The French Senate has passed a measure that would ban anyone under the age of 18 from wearing a hijab in public. This is an amendment to a law that the government introduced to address religious extremism. Another amendment would ban the body-covering swimsuit known as the burqini at public pools and beaches. While these are unlikely to become law, they continue a debate among French lawmakers over Muslim clothing. And we're joined by NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris to discuss it. Hi, Eleanor. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: What are these measures that the Senate has passed? BEARDSLEY: Well, as you said, the most controversial one would prohibit anyone - a minor - under 18, from wearing the Muslim veil in public. And actually, today some senators proposed another amendment in that same vein that the headscarf would not be allowed in national sports competitions, especially televised ones. You know, these are amendments to a larger French bill. And I've spoken with experts. They have no chance of becoming law. I mean, they would have to be passed by the lower house of Parliament, which has already said it's against them. And even if they did pass, the country's constitutional council would likely strike them down so that they don't have a chance of becoming law. SHAPIRO: But they tap into a larger debate in France. Explain why conservative lawmakers are introducing these measures if they don't have a chance of becoming policy. BEARDSLEY: Right. Well, this is all about next year's presidential election. And these amendments were all proposed by France's mainstream conservative party, which is really just limping along a shadow of its former self. It's been cannibalized from the left and from the right. It's especially lost voters to Marine Le Pen's far-right party. And I spoke to political scientist Jean-Yves Camus. And here's what he said about it. JEAN-YVES CAMUS: The conservative right sees that some of their previous voters have switched to the far right, so they try to win back those voters. If they want to win back those votes, they have to propose legislation that is at least as xenophobic. SHAPIRO: How do Muslim people in France feel about being caught in the middle of this political tug-of-war? BEARDSLEY: Well, Muslims feel stigmatized. You know, the law - the main law - it was proposed last fall after a French middle school teacher was beheaded by an Islamist radical because he had showed pictures of the Prophet Muhammad in his class. You know, Muslims were very horrified by that. And the government, they feel that the government, instead of bringing everyone together, has sort of singled them out. This law is being called the law to reinforce French values and principles. At first, they had called it the law against Islamist separatism because the government said radical Islam comes from separatist Islam. And it talked about, you know, clandestine schools where little girls are wearing the veil and the sexes are separated instead of gender equality. So Macron spoke about parallel societies being developed that would destroy the republic, and this law was to fight that. Muslims say they do adhere to French values. They are French. And France is a secular country. It's to allow everyone to practice their religion equally. They say it's being warped, even weaponized, to sort of ban religion, especially Islam, which is more visible than other religions because of things like the headscarf. I spoke to Rim Sarah Alouan. She's a researcher on religious freedom and civil liberties. And here's what she told me. RIM SARAH ALOUAN: It's a battle for the next election, really. And what we are witnessing is what I called the weaponization of secularism. And with the election coming, of course, it's who is going to pander the most to the far right. BEARDSLEY: So, you know, this law has a lot of critics. Even Catholic and Jewish leaders have spoken out to warn against it. Many say it's not about extremism, but it's against religion. Nonetheless, it's expected to pass. SHAPIRO: Eleanor Beardsley, thank you very much. BEARDSLEY: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Texas halted President Biden's 100-day moratorium on deportations of unauthorized immigrants. That is just one obstacle as Biden tries to end Trump-era immigration policies.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: A federal judge in Texas has blocked President Biden's 100-day moratorium on deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Biden had campaigned on reversing President Trump's tough immigration policies. But the Trump administration built in obstacles to hamstring his successor. NPR's John Burnett has more. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: The Texas lawsuit is the Biden administration's first legal headache in the arena of immigration. And it won't be the last. MUZAFFAR CHISHTI: I think this was clearly an attempt to handcuff the Biden administration, at least in the beginning of its term. BURNETT: Muzaffar Chishti is a senior fellow with the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. CHISHTI: And I think the Trump administration in its waning days tried to do everything it could to prevent the Biden administration from ushering in its new immigration policy. BURNETT: The outgoing Trump administration quietly signed highly unusual agreements with at least four states, Texas chief among them. The agreements say, in essence, that if Biden officials want to make changes to some of Trump's immigration rules, they have to consult with the states first. Immigration advocates were quick to brand the lawsuit baseless and said it won't withstand appeal. But the argument carried the day with Corpus Christi federal judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee. He wrote that the release of deportable immigrants in Texas, quote, \"establishes a substantial risk of imminent and irreparable harm.\" He slapped a temporary restraining order on the Biden administration and said Texas has 14 days to come back and make its case for a preliminary injunction. No comment from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ACLU groused in a statement Texas is trying to force the Biden administration to follow Trump's xenophobic policies. Meanwhile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton exulted in what he described as the first victorious lawsuit against the Biden White House. Texans have been here before. It was Ken Paxton and his predecessor, Greg Abbott - now governor - who filed at least 40 lawsuits against the last Democratic administration. The Texas AG's office spent millions suing Obama. Paxton has been a fervent Trump ally. In early December, he sued four other states for election fraud without evidence. And the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider it. He also attended Trump's fateful January 6 rally at the White House Ellipse, exhorting the crowd Texans are fighters and President Trump is a fighter. R.G. Ratcliffe is a political writer at Texas Monthly. RG RATCLIFFE: He's been doing it for so long now that at one point in time, his wife used to sing the song where she described herself as a pistol-packing mama whose husband sued Obama. He has started all over again. And it does a very good political job of covering up his own shortcomings. BURNETT: Paxton's legal problems include an FBI criminal investigation into whether he abused his office to benefit a high rolling donor. His top deputies resigned in protest. And he's under indictment for charges of state securities fraud. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing, refused calls to resign. And he promises to keep suing the Biden administration.

            "article_content": "Journalist Art Cullen discusses the battle to keep print news alive in small-town America. Cullen runs Iowa's Storm Lake Times, along with his brother. Originally broadcast Sept. 16, 2021.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. According to one study, 1,800 local newspapers have gone out of business or merged since 2004, and many communities are becoming so-called news deserts without any source of regular local news coverage. Today we're going to listen to the interview I recorded in September with Art Cullen, editor of a local paper struggling to stay alive and serve the rural town of Storm Lake, Iowa. The Storm Lake Times is profiled in a new documentary which airs Monday on PBS. The Storm Lake Times is family owned and run. Art Cullen is the editor. His brother, John, is publisher. And his wife, Dolores, is a photographer and culture writer who will happily pen a story about a two-headed calf. Also on the staff are Art's sister-in-law, Mary, who writes a food column, and his son Tom, the paper's lead reporter. Art Cullen won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for what the Pulitzer committee described as tenacious reporting, impressive expertise and engaging writing that successfully challenged powerful corporate agricultural interests in Iowa. Cullen is also author of the the author of the 2018 book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small Town Newspaper.\" The documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" directed by Jerry Risius and Beth Levison, will appear on PBS stations Monday night, part of the Independent Lens series. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: Art Cullen, welcome to FRESH AIR. ART CULLEN: Well, thanks for having me, Dave. I appreciate it. DAVIES: You know, the typical career path for a journalist is to start in a small market and then gradually move to bigger markets where there's hopefully more money and a bigger audience and more impact. You were well underway in your journalism career when you came back to Storm Lake, a town of - what? - a little less than 11,000. Why? CULLEN: Well, my brother John had the crazy idea of starting a newspaper in our hometown in 1990, about the worst time in retrospect, about the worst time you could imagine starting a print publication in rural northwest Iowa. And I had been working at a daily newspaper. I'd been working my way up Interstate 35 to - in hopes of getting a job at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. And I was at the Mason City, Iowa, Globe Gazette, a daily newspaper where I was the news editor. And I was kind of tired of corporate journalism, working for a large, publicly traded company. And John wanted to start this newspaper in our hometown. And so I came home. DAVIES: You became the editor. It publishers twice a week - Tuesday and Thursday - right? CULLEN: Yes. DAVIES: Tell us a little bit about Storm Lake and the surrounding area. CULLEN: Well, Storm Lake is a meatpacking community. We're not sure how big it is. It's somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people. The census says about 11,000. But again, because about, you know, maybe half our population is immigrant, we're not really sure. And a large percent of them are undocumented who work in a Tyson pork plant and a Tyson turkey slaughter facility. And then there's also - Rembrandt Foods has about 5 million laying hens producing liquid eggs just a few miles north of Storm Lake. So this is a very - this is what you'd call a protein center, actually, for America, fueled by immigrant labor. DAVIES: Storm Lake is the county seat of Buena Vista County, which, if you look on a map, is a perfect square. A lot of farms in the surrounding community, right? CULLEN: Right. Yeah. And it's - Storm Lake is the county seat, home to a 3,000-acre glacial lake which has been sedimenting in over time thanks to agricultural practices. And it's also home to a small liberal arts college called Buena Vista University. So it, you know, it's an interesting, very interesting little rural community. DAVIES: People who follow journalism have been saying for a long time that people need real information, reliable information, not just something that pops up on a social media site, but something that's published by someone who will be there and is credible and, you know, has libel insurance and talks to people of all sides. It's important that people get real information and news about, you know, the world and politics and policy. But it's also, you remind us, important for maintaining a community. You say Iowa - towns in Iowa are generally about as strong as their banks and their newspaper. What does your paper paper do for the community, do you think, its presence there? What does it do besides just give people information? CULLEN: Well, for example, our lake was sedimenting in from agricultural runoff. And we launched a campaign to restore the lake through dredging and watershed protection - conservation practices in the watershed and working with Senator Tom Harkin and Governor Tom Vilsack. We were able to build a 20-year watershed protection and lake dredging operation which removed 700,000 cubic yards of silt from Storm Lake. That's Iowa black gold sitting at the bottom of our lake. And that's just one example of what the newspaper has has been able to accomplish. And by bringing the community together - farmers, bankers, environmentalists, fishermen - we're all pulling for lake dredging. And the newspaper was leading the campaign. So it did bring the community together. And oftentimes, and especially in rural communities, it's very difficult to pass a bond issue to build a new school building. And Storm Like passes with 60% or 70% approval ratings because the newspapers constantly urging the public that we've got to be a growing rural community, otherwise we're declining. So I think those are two great examples. DAVIES: You went there in 1990, which is actually the year that I went to a daily paper in Philadelphia and was there for 20 years. And so I know, as you do, that those were the years that the traditional business model of newspapers fell apart as display advertising and classified ads disappeared into the internet. And I assume that what that means for you now is that you really need to rely on what we call circulation revenue. That's the people plopping down a dollar for the paper. And that means you've got to have local stuff that they want to read. Give us some examples of this - the things that keep people coming back to open the paper. CULLEN: Well, you know, I think it - first of all, it's community news about the two-headed calf and the blind bowler rolling a perfect 300 game. DAVIES: Did that really happen? CULLEN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dale Davis, a blind bowler, rolled a perfect game at Century Lanes in Alta, which is a tiny community nearby. And people turn to it for the school board coverage and the city council coverage and, you know, sewer rates. We just, you know, got our water bill today, and it's significantly higher. And we've been covering this all along in the newspaper about how we're going to have significantly higher water rates going forward. So those are the things that keep people - the obituaries, the weddings and engagements. Those are the things that keep people coming back. And it's not about necessarily what the politicians said this week. DAVIES: I mean, the film has some lovely moments like that. There's the - you always do a story on the first baby of each year, the, you know, first born on January 1. And then there's a moment where I believe your wife, Dolores, goes to cover the visit of the Iowa pork producers' Pork Queen.... CULLEN: Right. DAVIES: ...It's a beauty queen. She goes to visit a second-grade class carrying what? You want to tell us this story? (Laughter). CULLEN: Well, yeah. The Pork Queen's carrying a pig with a diaper on it (laughter) because, you know, pigs poop. And so it's a great moment. And, you know - and then Dolores was just talking about one of the big issues in Iowa is the stench from confinement units with thousands of hogs in them or poultry. And so it was just kind of funny that here is this hog wearing a diaper - actually, a pig wearing a diaper. It wasn't a full-grown hog. And - but it's - in Iowa, that scene is a completely normal thing, and - but when viewed by an audience in Vermont, it's hilarious. DAVIES: But kids get connected to an important local employer and, as you write about often, a source of local pollution. There's complexity to all this. Yeah. CULLEN: Costs and benefits. DAVIES: Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times, serving a rural community in Iowa. The paper is profiled in the documentary \"Storm Lake,\" which airs Monday night on PBS. We'll hear more of our conversation after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're talking about the future of local journalism with Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake Times, which serves a rural community in Iowa. The paper is profiled in the documentary \"Storm Lake,\" which airs Monday night on PBS. Storm Lake is the county seat of Buena Vista County. How has the - I don't know - the demographic makeup of the county and, you know, the political texture of the county changed over the years you've been there? CULLEN: Well, very interesting. This is - I call northwest Iowa a little slice of Texas. And you know, it's - this is very much a live-free-or-die kind of place. Farm Bureau dominates our politics, you know, very much, a libertarian style of - it was once said about Iowa that Iowa will go Democrat when hell goes Methodist. (LAUGHTER) CULLEN: So this is a very Republican area, and Storm Lake is a little dot of blue. It's very much like the country writ at large. The rural areas are very deeply red, and Storm Lake is this little blob of blue populated by a large contingent of Latinos, many of whom are from Mexico, many of whom are from San Antonio. So it's a very different place than most of rural Iowa. And so Storm Lake proper votes Democrat - supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. But the county itself negates that vote and voted strongly for Trump in the last election. DAVIES: And a lot of these immigrants work in the meatpacking plants and poultry processing plant that are - that's in the area. How have you engaged that part of the community? CULLEN: Well, for one thing, we've been a very strong advocate for Latinos in particular who, you know, are here as DREAMers and, you know, young people who were brought here at age 2 or 3 at no choice of theirs. And now they're here stuck without papers. And you know, at one point, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump said they wanted to deport them all. So we've been a very strong advocate for legalizing the undocumented, not only DREAMers, but people with temporary protected status from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and for the people - hardworking people here in Storm Lake who came here avoiding drug gangs and desperate poverty in rural Mexico, Jalisco mainly. And we had this congressman, Steve King, who was, you know, a real xenophobe. And so we opposed him for 20 years. And I think the Latino community appreciates it. But one real issue we have is illiteracy. And so a lot of rural immigrants from Mexico or Guatemala lack reading, you know, literacy in Spanish, much less English. So that's been a real challenge for us as to - the next generation who are graduating from high school and college here now will be newspaper readers, but their parents currently aren't. DAVIES: You're a progressive, and you live in a county that has a lot of Republicans. I mean, you're a journalist. You got to talk to all kinds of people. How do they react to you? What kind of relationships do you have? CULLEN: Most people think that we're fairly, you know, sensible or pragmatic progressives. And then there's a lot of people - 30% of the electorate, I would say, or the public would think that we're crazy Irish Catholic New Dealers, socialists and - which we are. We're Irish Catholic New Dealers. Can't help it. I was born that way. But they accept that, and we keep it to the editorial page. And I think what people really want is an honest discussion of the issues. And that's what we try and deliver. DAVIES: You know, it's been my experience - and I covered politics for a long time in Pennsylvania - and that - it's been my experience that the kind of all-out war and bitterness that occurs between Republicans and Democrats at the national level is much less acute among local members of their parties because they have to live with these folks. I mean, it's just not so deeply partisan. CULLEN: Yeah, but it's getting worse. DAVIES: Well, that's what I was going to say, was - it's - I think I see a change over the last few years. And I'm wondering what you see and particularly, you know, in the wake of this election in which president - former President Trump was, you know, and is still, you know, propounding these, you know, baseless theories that there was fraud and that the election was stolen. What are these relationships like in Buena Vista County? CULLEN: Well, yeah, it's Facebook mainly has really soured our civics. And so this movie's coming out, and it's a beautiful movie. It's not really very controversial. It's just holding up journalism and community life in sort of an idealized way, honestly. And there's nothing, you know, and, you know, 30 years ago, people in Storm Lake would have said, wow, that's really cool, you know. Storm Lake is being held up for something other than a forgotten town. And now with Facebook, you know, you got, of, the liberal rag, you know, who'd want to go see that? You know, actually, it celebrates civic engagement in Storm Lake, Iowa, and how the Iowa caucuses were really, you know, a great exercise in neighbors discussing issues and candidates. And it really holds up Storm Lake as an exemplar. And yet, because of the snarkiness and cynicism that's fed by - on Facebook and other social media, you know, people diss this movie, you know. And again, it's just a minority, but that just wouldn't have happened 20 to 30 years ago. It would have been Iowa pride suffocating any of that. DAVIES: Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake, Iowa, Times (ph), which is profiled in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which airs Monday night on PBS. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake Times, a small, family-run newspaper in Iowa. It's featured in a new documentary about keeping local journalism alive. The film, called \"Storm Lake,\" airs Monday night on PBS. Art Cullen, I want to talk about the editorial series that got you the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. This kind of begins with an environmental problem involving the Storm Lake, which is the lake that is right next to the city of Storm Lake and another river, I guess the Raccoon River. What was going wrong here and in - with these bodies of water? CULLEN: All right. Back in the 1800s, when the white settlers arrived, this area was all marshland and tall grass prairie. And so they could farm. They drained all those marshes and slews and - with underground clay tile. And we've been increasing that - the amount of that underground tile through the years, especially since 1980. And what happens is when we apply fertilizer and you get a heavy rain, that fertilizer washes through the soil profile into these drainage tiles and hits the Raccoon River, which then flows to Des Moines. And Des Moines, with 500,000 drinking water consumers, draws its water supply from the Raccoon River. Hence, because of the nitrate pollution from anhydrous ammonia application to grow corn, Des Moines now has the largest nitrate removal system in North America. And so they sued these three northern Iowa counties upstream for polluting the Raccoon River. DAVIES: Right. And they warned them that they were going to do this. The counties kind of didn't take it seriously. Your - in your editorial said this is a real problem. So the litigation begins. What happens next? CULLEN: Well, because it's a pollution lawsuit, we figure out that - the Storm Lake Times figures out that the county can't - its insurance company won't pay its legal fees for defending this lawsuit. So we asked the county board of supervisors, our county commission, how are you going to cover these legal bills? They could impact our property tax base. And they said, essentially, it's none of your business. We have friends. And we said, who are your friends? And they said, are you heard of hearing? It's none of your business. And so then we went off and joined with the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, which is a nonprofit urging government transparency throughout the state. And we started writing letters saying the Iowa public records law requires you to reveal these donors. And eventually, they agreed to us after having spent about a million dollars from the slush fund in legal. And within - so the counties eventually pulled out of this illegal arrangement that was funded primarily, as we determined from our own reporting, by Monsanto, the Koch brothers and the rest of the fertilizer industry. And so the counties had to pull out of this illegal agreement because we harassed them out of it. And six weeks later, a federal District Court judge ruled that - he dismissed the lawsuit because you basically can't sue counties for agricultural pollution. And so the issue - we won sort of a pyrrhic victory. We got dark money out of the federal courts after they spent a million bucks. But Iowa - in Iowa, agriculture and the environment, which are at loggerheads, never got the hearing it deserved because the legislature is essentially owned by the Farm Bureau and the agrochemical complex. And they will never give the environment a hearing. And we had hoped that the courts would give the environment a hearing, and they didn't. So we're hoping now that Congress will correct this pollution problem in the next farm bill. DAVIES: So the issue was, in part, public information, right? I mean, you have a public entity getting huge sums of money from private interests that aren't disclosed. But beyond that, there was a real substantive issue. You were argued that, hey, county, don't simply defend these practices. Let's get together and reach a settlement and try to address the problem. Right? You actually suggested that they meet and resolve it. And I think one of the parties said that they were going to, and then they canceled it and blamed you. Do I have this right? (Laughter). CULLEN: Yeah, kind of (laughter), yeah. They said - OK, so we had suggested in a series of editorials, can't you knuckleheads just talk to each other? Well, of course they can't. They couldn't talk to each other. Couldn't the governor, Terry Branstad, talk to Bill Stowe, the CEO of the Des Moines Water Works? They're, you know, they're five minutes apart in Des Moines. No, they can't talk to each other. We don't want to hear each other. And so finally, we suggested that the Buena Vista County Attorney and Bill Stowe of the water works - who has since died, by the way - have a meeting. And so they arranged for a quiet secret meeting in Fort Dodge at a Perkins restaurant. And when the county board of supervisors, the Buena Vista County Board of Supervisors caught wind of that meeting. They said, no way are you going to that meeting. We aren't talking to those people. We got lawyers, and we got money. Why would we talk to them? And so that's how, you know, we've become in America. I have a bunch of - I got a million bucks from Monsanto and the Koch brothers. Why should I meet you at a Perkins? DAVIES: And I read that the board of supervisors of the county said if Art Cullen says something, we'll do the opposite, which is... CULLEN: That's exactly right. That's how stupid it got. DAVIES: Well, it's kind of a depressing kind of measure of your own clout, isn't it? CULLEN: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: So you can get the wrong thing done by suggesting... CULLEN: Yeah, so that's how stupid - you know, people dig their heels in. And they can't even talk to each other. And that's where we - you know, it speaks to the larger issue, I think, of how we conduct our politics today. DAVIES: One of the other little details from the story that I love is some of the players involved in this were going to be at a - at some kind of a charity golf outing. And your son Tom went to the country club, tracked them down on the course, and then in the clubhouse, still didn't get any answers, right? CULLEN: Yeah, they spotted him trudging to the 18th hole, and they took off in golf carts, fleeing him. And then they got to the clubhouse, where they issued a no-comment. And it was - the politicians and the money were all golfing together and all drinking each other's booze. And that's how politics is conducted. DAVIES: Well, Art Cohen, thanks so much for speaking with us. CULLEN: Well, thank you, Dave. It's been a delight talking to you. DAVIES: Art Cullen is the editor of the family-run newspaper the Storm Lake Times, serving a rural community in northwestern Iowa. Cullen won a 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. He and the paper are featured in the new documentary \"Storm Lake.\" After our interview first aired in September, Cullen heard from a wealthy tech entrepreneur who offered funding - no strings attached - to keep the paper afloat through the pandemic. Cullen says he's accepted some of that assistance, and he's grateful. The documentary \"Storm Lake\" airs Monday night on PBS. On Monday's show, how do two sisters just three years apart take extremely divergent paths in life? We talk with Dawn Turner, former columnist for the Chicago Tribune about her new memoir. While she became a successful writer, her sister died at 24 from chronic alcoholism. Both grew up in a Chicago neighborhood which Turner says government officials neglected and abandoned. I hope you can join us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller.

            "article_content": "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Art Cullen discusses the battle to keep print news alive in small-town America. Cullen runs Iowa's Storm Lake Times, along with his brother, the paper's publisher.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in today for Terry Gross. According to one study, 1,800 local newspapers have gone out of business or merged since 2004, and many communities are becoming so-called news deserts without any source of regular local news coverage. The new documentary \"Storm Lake\" profiles a local paper struggling to stay alive and serve the rural town of Storm Lake, Iowa. The paper is run by our guest Art Cullen, along with his brother John, the publisher, and his wife, Delores, a photographer and feature writer who will happily pen a story about a two-headed calf. Also on the staff are Art's sister-in-law, Mary, who writes a food column, and his son Tom, the paper's lead reporter. Art Cullen has a mop of white hair, a horseshoe mustache and often a bow tie, inevitably drawing comparisons to Mark Twain. But he's a serious journalist. He won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for what the Pulitzer committee described as tenacious reporting, impressive expertise and engaging writing that successfully challenged powerful corporate agricultural interests in Iowa. Art Cullen has also written op-ed pieces for The Washington Post and The Guardian and is the author of the 2018 book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper\" (ph). The documentary film \"Storm Lake\" is directed by Jerry Risius and Beth Levison. It opens in theaters tomorrow and will be shown on PBS November 15. Art Cullen, welcome to FRESH AIR. ART CULLEN: Well, thanks for having me, Dave. I appreciate it. DAVIES: You know, the typical career path for a journalist is to start in a small market and then gradually move to bigger markets where there's hopefully more money and a bigger audience and more impact. You were well underway in your journalism career when you came back to Storm Lake, a town of - what? - a little less than 11,000. Why? A CULLEN: Well, my brother John had the crazy idea of starting a newspaper in our hometown in 1990, about the worst time in retrospect, about the worst time you could imagine starting a print publication in rural northwest Iowa. And I had been working at a daily newspaper. I'd been working my way up Interstate 35 to - in hopes of getting a job at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. And I was at the Mason City, Iowa, Globe Gazette, a daily newspaper where I was the news editor. And I was kind of tired of corporate journalism, working for a large, publicly traded company. And John wanted to start this newspaper in our hometown. And so I came home. DAVIES: You became the editor. It publishers twice a week - Tuesday and Thursday - right? A CULLEN: Yes. DAVIES: Tell us a little bit about Storm Lake and the surrounding area. A CULLEN: Well, Storm Lake is a meatpacking community. We're not sure how big it is. It's somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people. The census says about 1,000. But again, because about, you know, maybe half our population is immigrant, we're not really sure. And a large percent of them are undocumented who work in a Tyson pork plant and a Tyson turkey slaughter facility. And then there's also - Rembrandt Foods has about 5 million laying hens producing liquid eggs just a few miles north of Storm Lake. So this is a very - this is what you'd call a protein center, actually, for America, fueled by immigrant labor. DAVIES: The Salt Lake is the county seat of Buena Vista County, which, if you look on a map, is a perfect square. A lot of farms in the surrounding community, right? A CULLEN: Right. Yeah. And it's - Storm Lake is the county seat, home to a 3,000-acre glacial lake which has been sedimenting in over time thanks to agricultural practices. And it's also home to a small liberal arts college called Buena Vista University. So it, you know, it's an interesting, very interesting little rural community. DAVIES: People who follow journalism have been saying for a long time that people need real information, reliable information, not just something that pops up on a social media site, but something that's published by someone who will be there and is credible and, you know, has libel insurance and talks to people of all sides. It's important that people get real information and news about, you know, the world and politics and policy. But it's also, you remind us, important for maintaining a community. You say Iowa - towns in Iowa are generally about as strong as their banks and their newspaper. What does your paper paper do for the community, do you think, its presence there? What does it do besides just give people information? A CULLEN: Well, for example, our lake was sedimenting in from agricultural runoff. And we launched a campaign to restore the lake through dredging and watershed protection - conservation practices in the watershed and working with Senator Tom Harkin and Governor Tom Vilsack. We were able to build a 20-year watershed protection and lake dredging operation which removed 700,000 cubic yards of silt from Storm Lake. That's Iowa black gold sitting at the bottom of our lake. And that's just one example of what the newspaper has has been able to accomplish. And by bringing the community together, farmers, bankers, environmentalists, fishermen, we're all pulling for lake dredging. And the newspaper was leading the campaign. So it did bring the community together. And oftentimes, and especially in rural communities, it's very difficult to pass a bond issue to build a new school building. And Storm Like passes with 60% or 70% approval ratings because the newspapers constantly urging the public that we've got to be a growing rural community, otherwise we're declining. So I think those are two great examples. DAVIES: You know, you describe in your book this wonderful moment where I think it's the head of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is there. And he's a guy sitting by himself on the bus. You sit down next to him, and you strike up this conversation. And you realize that he was a guy who is perhaps willing to put some state resources into this dredging process, provided the community, you know, shows up too and makes it clear they want it. And this sort of initiates this campaign. You know, this is sort of not the role that people typically think of journalists as playing. You know, you become not just a chronicler, but, you know, an actor, a player. A CULLEN: Well, we're an advocate for the community. And if nobody else has enough sense to sit down next to that guy on a bus tour around the lake, I'm going to. Not only do I want to talk to him and get some good quotes, you know, and get some news out of him, but at the same time, I, you know, I - as Garrison Keillor said of the Herald Star, I got to live here too. And I have every bit as much an interest in seeing a healthy lake as anybody in Storm Lake. And so, you know, I think through our editorial page, we have a responsibility to advocate for the community in Des Moines and Washington, and that's what we do. DAVIES: Right. And in that case, a huge operation was developed with local and state funds that made an impact. You know, you run a small shop. A lot of people are your relatives. I assume everybody does a little bit of everything. Give me an example of a moment in your week in which you stop and say, yes, this is the reward of being here. This is why I'm doing this. A CULLEN: Well, it used to be when we had our own press, and I was the pressman. And I'd hang a plate on the press with my byline on the front page. And then (laughter) you know how you'd wrap up the press. And it's this classic male testosterone moment when you hear the press roar and you're speeding it up and you're covered in ink and you see your byline on the front page. And, you know, I don't care if I had - I couldn't cash my paycheck that week. At least I had that moment of satisfaction. And now that moment is, you know - is seeing the paper come back from the printer, which we now have - we print an hour away. John and I got too old to run the press and the mailing machines. And so now we print about an hour away. And I still get a kick out of seeing that paper come back with my column in it - or even better, when you're at the newsstand at a grocery store and you see somebody actually laying down a dollar for that newspaper. And it just - it's a thrill (laughter). It's a thrill. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Art Cullen. He's the editor of the Storm Lake Times, which is featured in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake.\" He also has a book, \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Art Cullen, the editor of the Storm Lake Times, which serves the rural community of Storm Lake, Iowa. It's a newspaper that's featured in a new documentary called \"Storm Lake.\" You mentioned the printing press. You're often wearing a bow tie. The two are connected, right? (Laughter) Explain this. A CULLEN: Well, yeah, back in the old days when we printed with lead type, if you wore a - you would have a page laid out in rows of lead type. And when you would lock up the type and tighten it down, if you wore a long tie, you were likely to get your tie caught in the chase. And so editors wore bow ties to keep the spaghetti off their ties and to keep them from getting clipped by hot type. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: Right. You went there in 1990, which is actually the year that I went to a daily paper in Philadelphia and was there for 20 years. And so I know, as you do, that those were the years that the traditional business model of newspapers fell apart as display advertising and classified ads disappeared into the internet. And I assume that what that means for you now is that you really need to rely on what we call circulation revenue. That's the people plopping down a dollar for the paper. And that means you've got to have local stuff that they want to read. Give us some examples of this - the things that keep people coming back to open the paper. A CULLEN: Well, you know, I think it - first of all, it's community news about the two-headed calf and the blind bowler rolling a perfect 300 game. DAVIES: Did that really happen? A CULLEN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dale Davis, a blind bowler, rolled a perfect game at Century Lanes in Alta, which is a tiny community nearby. And people turn to it for the school board coverage and the city council coverage and, you know, sewer rates. We just, you know, got our water bill today, and it's significantly higher. And we've been covering this all along in the newspaper about how we're going to have significantly higher water rates going forward. So those are the things that keep people - the obituaries, the weddings and engagements. Those are the things that keep people coming back. And it's not about necessarily what the politicians said this week. DAVIES: I mean, the film has some lovely moments like that. There's the - you always do a story on the first baby of each year, the, you know, first born on January 1. And then there's a moment where I believe your wife, Dolores, goes to cover the visit of the Iowa pork producers' Pork Queen.... A CULLEN: Right. DAVIES: ...It's a beauty queen. She goes to visit a second-grade class carrying what? You want to tell us this story (laughter)? A CULLEN: Well, yeah. The Pork Queen's carrying a pig with a diaper on it (laughter) because, you know, pigs poop. And so it's a great moment. And, you know - and then Dolores was just talking about one of the big issues in Iowa is the stench from confinement units with thousands of hogs in them or poultry. And so it was just kind of funny that here is this hog wearing a diaper - actually, a pig wearing a diaper. It wasn't a full-grown hog. And - but it's - in Iowa, that scene is a completely normal thing. And - but when viewed by an audience in Vermont, it's hilarious. DAVIES: But kids get connected to an important local employer and, as you write about often, a source of local pollution. There's complexity to all this. Yeah. A CULLEN: Costs and benefits. DAVIES: I want to play a cut from the film. This is where you're in a diner with your brother, John, munching on sandwiches. And also, your son, Tom, the reporter who is - how old is Tom now? Is he still in his 20s? A CULLEN: Yeah, late 20s. DAVIES: OK. OK. You're sitting there. And I guess this is sort of a brainstorming session. And Tom sort of tosses out a couple of ideas. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"STORM LAKE\") TOM CULLEN: Is there anything else we could be doing with, say, the website or something like that? I like the idea of, like, Starbucks selling Wall Street Journal subscriptions. A CULLEN: Oh, yeah. I saw that. Yeah. T CULLEN: Like, why can't we do that? If you could pitch it to a place where as soon as you log on to public Wi-Fi, you get, like, a daily, complimentary access to stormlake.com. You promote it. And it's free if just for one day only. JOHN CULLEN: I don't know that we have enough critical mass to make it work. But who knows? A CULLEN: If it sells us a couple of subscription, what the hell? J CULLEN: Yeah. T CULLEN: An idea that I raised before is an idea of a podcast. And then you would be the star of it if we could do it semi-regularly, maybe once a month or something. A CULLEN: Who's going to sell the sponsorship for a podcast that has 100 listeners? I think this should be about reporting, and I should stick to writing columns and editorials. And I don't understand podcasts, necessarily. And if I wanted to get into radio, I would have gotten into radio. T CULLEN: I understand this whole - if the podcast idea is like - I'm not married to it. A CULLEN: No, I know. T CULLEN: But... A CULLEN: I like the idea that you're bringing things up, but it's just that we got to concentrate on circulation, I think. We're putting out a good paper. That's all I know. T CULLEN: Yeah. A CULLEN: Ultimately, that will pay, right? T CULLEN: Yeah. DAVIES: And that is our guest, podcast skeptic Art Cullen, the editor of The Storm Lake Times. Now, that was, I guess, a couple of years ago that was filmed. And you've actually done a - not - you've appeared on podcasts, right? A CULLEN: I've appeared on podcasts, yeah. And my son Tom is actually still looking into trying to start a podcast. And I (laughter) - you know, and I'm - that's good that he is. It's just that I'm getting - I'm too old. DAVIES: Well, you know, what we're really talking about here is looking for ways to keep this business viable. I mean, you mentioned once, you know, you had a check in your desk that you couldn't cash. That - I assume that's because the bank account was so slim that whatever salary you were getting, well, you can just go without it for now. How are things going? I mean, the pandemic obviously helped - obviously affected everything. Any of these new ideas about the web or anything yielding new, you know, financial initiatives? A CULLEN: Over the past year, we've launched a new website, and it's still a little clunky by my taste. But we're seeing a significant increase since the pandemic in digital subscriptions, which is fantastic. And so we publish our entire newspaper online. And, you know, people are making the conversion from print to digital news consumption and it's - even at the local community newspaper level. And so that's a good thing. And circulation's growing. I think that people really did realize during the last electoral cycle and during the pandemic when - that, you know, that factual information is worth something and that the press does play a role in ferreting out lies and disinformation and that people really began to value it. And I think they became cognizant that a free press was becoming imperiled by all the attacks on fake media whatever and all the fantasies that are being spread as fact on Facebook. I think people are catching on to it. DAVIES: And so how's the paper doing? Is it staying afloat? Is it a daily or monthly crisis to balance the books? A CULLEN: It's a monthly crisis to balance the books, as it always has been. And - but it's just gotten worse in the last five years. For example, the major grocer in Iowa, Fareway, just pulled its pre-printed inserts out of all the community newspapers in Iowa. DAVIES: Oh, no. A CULLEN: And that's a big hit to all those papers. One friend of mine, it's $100,000 a year - 15% of his revenue. So what happens? You got to reduce expenses by 15% if you're breaking even, which he was. So what - we broke even in - we had a terrible first half of the year. And, of course, the whole - 2020 was a disaster. Advertising just completely disappeared. We've seen a rebound in advertising in the second half of this year, and we're - we broke even in July, and we had a little slight profit in August, so I'm hopeful. And another thing we did is we organized something called the Western Iowa Journalism Foundation, which allows - not - tax deductible donations to be given to support independent, family-owned community newspapers in rural Iowa, like ours. And that really helped us, too. We got $15,000 recently from that foundation to help support our payroll. And - but I also have to say the Payroll Protection Program saved us. We would have been sunk without it. DAVIES: The COVID relief bill, right? You qualified for help there, yeah? Right. A CULLEN: Yeah. DAVIES: Yeah, yeah. We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Art Cullen. He is the editor of The Storm Lake Times and author of the book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper.\" The paper is featured in the documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in theaters tomorrow and will be aired on PBS November 15. We'll talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking about preserving independent journalism in American communities with Art Cullen, the editor of a twice-weekly newspaper serving the rural town of Storm Lake, Iowa. Cullen, who runs the paper with his brother, wife, son and other relatives, is profiled in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in theaters tomorrow and will air on PBS November 15. Cullen is also author of the 2018 book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper.\" Storm Lake is the county seat of Buena Vista County. How has the - I don't know - the demographic makeup of the county and, you know, the political texture of the county changed over the years you've been there? A CULLEN: Well, very interesting. This is - I call northwest Iowa a little slice of Texas. And you know, it's - this is very much a live-free-or-die kind of place. Farm Bureau dominates our politics, you know, very much, a libertarian style of - it was once said about Iowa that Iowa will go Democrat when hell goes Methodist. (LAUGHTER) A CULLEN: So this is a very Republican area, and Storm Lake is a little dot of blue. It's very much like the country writ at large. The rural areas are very deeply red, and Storm Lake is this little blob of blue populated by a large contingent of Latinos, many of whom are from Mexico, many of whom are from San Antonio. So it's a very different place than most of rural Iowa. And so Storm Lake proper votes Democrat - supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. But the county itself negates that vote and voted strongly for Trump in the last election. DAVIES: And a lot of these immigrants work in the meatpacking plants and poultry processing plant that are - that's in the area. How have you engaged that part of the community? A CULLEN: Well, for one thing, we've been a very strong advocate for Latinos in particular who, you know, are here as DREAMers and, you know, young people who were brought here at age 2 or 3 at no choice of theirs. And now they're here stuck without papers. And you know, at one point, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump said they wanted to deport them all. So we've been a very strong advocate for legalizing the undocumented, not only DREAMers, but people with temporary protected status from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and for the people - hardworking people here in Storm Lake who came here avoiding drug gangs and desperate poverty in rural Mexico, Jalisco mainly. And we had this congressman, Steve King, who was, you know, a real xenophobe. And so we opposed him for 20 years. And I think the Latino community appreciates it. But one real issue we have is illiteracy. And so a lot of rural immigrants from Mexico or Guatemala lack reading, you know, literacy in Spanish, much less English. So that's been a real challenge for us as to - the next generation who are graduating from high school and college here now will be newspaper readers, but their parents currently aren't. DAVIES: One of the fascinating things that I read in the book is that you kind of have a sister-city relationship with an area in Mexico where many people have come to Storm Lake. And you took a trip with - what was it? - it was the police chief and a city council member. Tell us a little bit about this and what it meant. A CULLEN: Well, yeah, about 10 years - no, actually, it's over 10 years ago. We went down to a little town. There was about four or five of us from Storm Lake, had a little delegation, went down to develop a sister-city relationship with a community called Ayotlan in Jalisco. It's about an hour away from Guadalajara. And it's an identical community to Storm Lake in almost every respect. It's about 11,000 people. And it's, you know, you see Pioneer seed corn signs, you know, which is an Iowa company (laughter) all over in Ayotlan. You know, they grow corn, and they process livestock. But they're poor. They're very poor. And I said, what can we do? I said to the mayor of the county, what can we do as Americans to help you in Ayotlan? Can we invest in new agricultural facilities or whatever? And he said, no, what we need is the rule of law. And now - you know, I think there were 35 journalists murdered in Mexico last year. I couldn't go back to Jalisco now because it's being run by the New Generation Cartel. And I don't know what's become of that mayor. I think he's died. But I worry every day about Ayotlan and what's going on down there and you know, how we embarrass ourselves in front of those people who look up - look to us for the rule of law. And here was those honyocks jumping the walls at the U.S. Capitol, trying to bludgeon Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence. And what can we say to him now? DAVIES: You're a progressive, and you live in a county that has a lot of Republicans. I mean, you're a journalist. You got to talk to all kinds of people. How do they react to you? What kind of relationships do you have? A CULLEN: Most people think that we're fairly, you know, sensible or pragmatic progressives. And then there's a lot of people - 30% of the electorate, I would say, or the public would think that we're crazy Irish Catholic New Dealers, socialists and - which we are. We're Irish Catholic New Dealers. Can't help it. I was born that way. But they accept that, and we keep it to the editorial page. And I think what people really want is an honest discussion of the issues. And that's what we try and deliver. DAVIES: You know, it's been my experience - and I covered politics for a long time in Pennsylvania - and that - it's been my experience that the kind of all-out war and bitterness that occurs between Republicans and Democrats at the national level is much less acute among local members of their parties because they have to live with these folks. I mean, it's just not so deeply partisan. A CULLEN: Yeah, but it's getting worse. DAVIES: Well, that's what I was going to say, was - it's - I think I see a change over the last few years. And I'm wondering what you see and particularly, you know, in the wake of this election in which president - former President Trump was, you know, and is still, you know, propounding these, you know, baseless theories that there was fraud and that the election was stolen. What are these relationships like in Buena Vista County? A CULLEN: Well, yeah, it's Facebook mainly has really soured our civics. And so this movie's coming out, and it's a beautiful movie. It's not really very controversial. It's just holding up journalism and community life in sort of an idealized way, honestly. And there's nothing, you know, and, you know, 30 years ago, people in Storm Lake would have said, wow, that's really cool, you know. Storm Lake is being held up for something other than a forgotten town. And now with Facebook, you know, you got, of, the liberal rag, you know, who'd want to go see that? You know, actually, it celebrates civic engagement in Storm Lake, Iowa, and how the Iowa caucuses were really, you know, a great exercise in neighbors discussing issues and candidates. And it really holds up Storm Lake as an exemplar. And yet, because of the snarkiness and cynicism that's fed by - on Facebook and other social media, you know, people diss this movie, you know. And again, it's just a minority, but that just wouldn't have happened 20 to 30 years ago. It would have been Iowa pride suffocating any of that. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We're going to another break here. We're speaking with Art Cullen. He's the editor of the Storm Lake Times, which is featured in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in select theaters tomorrow and will be aired on PBS November 15. We'll talk some more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Art Cullen. He is the editor of the Storm Lake Times and the author of the book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small Town Newspaper.\" The paper, which publishes twice weekly in Storm Lake, Iowa, is featured in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in select theaters tomorrow and airs on PBS November 15. Art Cullen, I want to talk about the editorial series that got you the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. This kind of begins with an environmental problem involving the Storm Lake, which is the lake that is right next to the city of Storm Lake and another river, I guess the Raccoon River. What was going wrong here and in - with these bodies of water? A CULLEN: All right. Back in the 1800s, when the white settlers arrived, this area was all marshland and tall grass prairie. And so they could farm. They drained all those marshes and slews and - with underground clay tile. And we've been increasing that - the amount of that underground tile through the years, especially since 1980. And what happens is when we apply fertilizer and you get a heavy rain, that fertilizer washes through the soil profile into these drainage tiles and hits the Raccoon River, which then flows to Des Moines. And Des Moines, with 500,000 drinking water consumers, draws its water supply from the Raccoon River. Hence, because of the nitrate pollution from anhydrous ammonia application to grow corn, Des Moines now has the largest nitrate removal system in North America. And so they sued these three northern Iowa counties upstream for polluting the Raccoon River. DAVIES: Right. And they warned them that they were going to do this. The counties kind of didn't take it seriously. Your - in your editorial said this is a real problem. So the litigation begins. What happens next? A CULLEN: Well, because it's a pollution lawsuit, we figure out that - the Storm Lake Times figures out that the county can't - its insurance company won't pay its legal fees for defending this lawsuit. So we asked the county board of supervisors, our county commission, how are you going to cover these legal bills? They could impact our property tax base. And they said, essentially, it's none of your business. We have friends. And we said, who are your friends? And they said, are you heard of hearing? It's none of your business? And so then we went off and joined with the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, which is a nonprofit urging government transparency throughout the state. And we started writing letters saying the Iowa public records law requires you to reveal these donors. And eventually, they agreed to us after having spent about a million dollars from the slush fund in legal. And within - so the counties eventually pulled out of this illegal arrangement that was funded primarily, as we determined from our own reporting, by Monsanto, the Koch brothers and the rest of the fertilizer industry. And so the counties had to pull out of this illegal agreement because we harassed them out of it. And six weeks later, a federal District Court judge ruled that - he dismissed the lawsuit because you basically can't sue counties for agricultural pollution. And so the issue - we won sort of a pyrrhic victory. We got dark money out of the federal courts after they spent a million bucks. But Iowa - in Iowa, agriculture and the environment, which are at loggerheads, never got the hearing it deserved because the legislature is essentially owned by the Farm Bureau and the agrochemical complex. And they will never give the environment a hearing. And we had hoped that the courts would give the environment a hearing, and they didn't. So we're hoping now that Congress will correct this pollution problem in the next farm bill. DAVIES: So the issue was, in part, public information, right? I mean, you have a public entity getting huge sums of money from private interests that aren't disclosed. But beyond that, there was a real substantive issue. You were argued that, hey, county, don't simply defend these practices. Let's get together and reach a settlement and try to address the problem. Right? You actually suggested that they meet and resolve it. And I think one of the parties said that they were going to, and then they canceled it and blamed you. Do I have this right? (Laughter). A CULLEN: Yeah, kind of (laughter), yeah. They said - OK, so we had suggested in a series of editorials, can't you knuckleheads just talk to each other? Well, of course they can't. They couldn't talk to each other. Couldn't the governor, Terry Branstad, talk to Bill Stowe, the CEO of the Des Moines Water Works? They're, you know, they're five minutes apart in Des Moines. No, they can't talk to each other. We don't want to hear each other. And so finally, we suggested that the Buena Vista County Attorney and Bill Stowe of the water works - who has since died, by the way - have a meeting. And so they arranged for a quiet secret meeting in Fort Dodge at a Perkins restaurant. And when the county board of supervisors, the Buena Vista County Board of Supervisors caught wind of that meeting. They said, no way are you going to that meeting. We aren't talking to those people. We got lawyers, and we got money. Why would we talk to them? And so that's how, you know, we've become in America. I have a bunch of - I got a million bucks from Monsanto and the Koch brothers. Why should I meet you at a Perkins? DAVIES: And I read that the board of supervisors of the county said if Art Cullen says something, we'll do the opposite which is... A CULLEN: That's exactly right. That's how stupid it got. DAVIES: Well, it's kind of a depressing kind of measure of your own clout, isn't it? A CULLEN: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: So you can get the wrong thing done by suggesting... A CULLEN: Yeah, so that's how stupid - you know, people dig their heels in. And they can't even talk to each other. And that's where we - you know, it speaks to the larger issue, I think, of how we conduct our politics today. DAVIES: One of the other little details from the story that I love is some of the players involved in this were going to be at a - at some kind of a charity golf outing. And your son Tom went to the country club, tracked them down on the course, and then in the clubhouse, still didn't get any answers, right? A CULLEN: Yeah, they spotted him trudging to the 18th hole, and they took off in golf carts, fleeing him. And then they got to the clubhouse where they issued a no-comment. And it was - the politicians and the money were all golfing together and all drinking each other's booze. And that's how politics is conducted. DAVIES: We're speaking with Art Cullen. He's the editor of the Storm Lake Times which is featured in the new documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in select theaters tomorrow. We'll talk some more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF QUINCY JONES' \"MONTY, IS THAT YOU?\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Art Cullen. He is the editor of the Storm Lake Times and the author of the book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience, And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper.\" You know, in the book, you say that you had 10 employees at the paper, five of them named Cullen. And you try to pay competitively and offer health insurance at no cost to employees. But you had a couple of employees that had serious illnesses. Briefly, I mean, what happened here? And how did it affect your ability to take care of your people? A CULLEN: One of our ad salesmen - his name was Mike Dirks (ph) - had an organ transplant. And our health insurance premiums - this was pre-Obamacare. Our health insurance premiums went up 78% and 68% in successive years. And then we - our associate editor Tina Donath had cancer. And the insurance company said she couldn't get treatment in Storm Lake. She had to drive to Sioux City. Even though the treatment was available in Storm Lake, she had to drive to Sioux City an hour away to get her cancer treatments. And then the insurance company jacked up our rates another 58% the following year. And then heading into the pandemic year, the insurance company raised our rates 44%. (Laughter) So, you know, it's just very difficult to stay in business at that rate. DAVIES: How did you manage that? A CULLEN: Well, my brother John forsook his salary and went on Social Security and doesn't get paid for being publisher. And I'll tell you what, being a publisher and filling out postal forms and talking to bankers isn't that fun. And he's doing that for free. And then this spring, I went off the payroll. I went on Social Security early. And so I get a part-time paycheck now. But that's how we deal with it. And, you know, we had to cut down on our TV listings, which agitated a lot of our senior citizen readers who can't figure out how to use the channel changer. And so that's how we dealt with it. And, you know, we haven't been able to give raises since the pandemic. DAVIES: Have you had to lay anybody off? A CULLEN: No. We just laid off me and my brother, but we're still working. DAVIES: You know, there is another newspaper in Storm Lake - right? - the Storm Lake Pilot Tribune. It's still... A CULLEN: That's what I hear. DAVIES: (Laughter) You know, a lot of communities don't have even one newspaper. Why does Storm Lake need two? A CULLEN: Well, because we're the only newspaper that's locally owned. And this newspaper is a satellite of a newspaper in Spencer, Iowa, which is 40 miles away, which is headquartered in Cape Girardeau, Mo., hometown of Rush Limbaugh, by the way. And so it's not really a local newspaper - no offense, but it's not. We're local. We live - the editor and publisher and the owners live six blocks away from the Times office. And all we care about is Storm Lake, Iowa. We don't care about Cape Girardeau, Mo., or Spencer or someplace in South Dakota. We care about Storm Lake. And that's the difference. And I believe that's true. The reason I think that the Star Tribune in Minneapolis is the model for the industry right now is because they're independently owned by Glen Taylor. And The Washington Post is independently owned by Jeff Bezos. And the New York Times is independently owned by the Sulzbergers. And that's why they're successful. And I believe that's why regional newspapers owned by hedge funds are failing. DAVIES: You know, I thought we would finish with a letter that you wrote to your son, Tom. It's really a letter to a young journalist. You want to just tell us, you know, how you came to write this and publish it and maybe just read, share a bit of it with us? A CULLEN: Oh, sure. My son Tom was in college, and he had an economics degree from the University of Northern Iowa. And his professors, who all admired him very much - he was a four-point student - and they said, you know, you could go to law school or you could get a Ph.D. in econ or you could go work at the Chicago Board of Trade. What the hell are you going to work at a newspaper for? So, you know, and Tom told me that. And again, always searching for a column idea, I said, well, there's a column there welcoming Tom home and explaining, you know, what is it - why should you work long hours for lousy pay and sometimes no pay at all at a little newspaper in the middle of nowhere? You know, we think we're somewhere, but everybody else thinks we're flyover country. So, yeah, I wrote this column called \"Letter To A Young Reporter.\" But yeah, I'll just read a paragraph if you don't mind. (Reading) A pretty good rule is that an Iowa town will be about as strong as its newspaper and its banks. The best journalism is that which builds communities. You build your community by publicizing good deeds done by reporting on the cheats and scoundrels and other politicians, by urging yourself and those around you to do better by allowing dissenting voices to be heard, and by making certain that your town's issues are heard in Des Moines and Washington. Use your power to build and the newspaper will grow naturally. Always be honest. Again, credibility is your only stock and trade. DAVIES: Well, Art Cohen, thanks so much for speaking with us. A CULLEN: Well, thank you, Dave. It's been a delight talking to you. DAVIES: Art Cullen is the editor of the Storm Lake Times and author of the book \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle Of Change, Resilience And Hope From A Small-Town Newspaper.\" The paper's featured in the documentary film \"Storm Lake,\" which opens in select theaters tomorrow and will be broadcast on PBS on November 15 as part of the Independent Lens series.

[POST BROADCAST CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this story, while discussing health insurance rate increases for the Storm Lake Times, host Dave Davies mistakenly said that insurance costs that an employer pays are influenced by the health care utilization of the employees in the company, so that serious illnesses among a few employees can cause large rate increases for everyone in the firm. In fact, the Affordable Care Act changed the rules so that rates for workers in small companies are now based primarily on the experience of all those insured in the relevant geographical rating area, not just the experience of those in the company in question.] Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.
